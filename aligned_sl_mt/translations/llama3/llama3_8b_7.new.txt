Oh sons, I have now completed this book for you, which is the last of the science of medicine, because its conclusion was reached through him, and through his explanations, and through his declarations, it seems to me that you will be able to complete that which belongs to you in this treatise, which is a part of my operation, namely surgery.
Since my operation is now obsolete in our region and in our time, completely private within itself, except that a little bit of science remains, and the vestiges remain, but there are no more than some small descriptions in the books of the Ancients, which have changed the most and deviated into those errors and aberrations, until the intentions of it are closed and the force of it is elongated and the art.
And it seems to me that you revitalize that ancient order of this treatise through the way of exposition and declaration and abbreviation; and because I added the forms of instruments such as cauterizers and other tools of the work for the purpose of supplementation of declaration, and preparation for use, which is necessary.
However, the reason why a good craftsman cannot be found with his own hand in our present time is because the art of medicine is long, and it requires its practitioner to be exercised in the science of anatomy which was known by Galen so that he could know the joints of the members and their forms, and their conjunction and separation; and have knowledge of bones, nerves, and ligaments, and their number, and their arrangement; and of the pulsating veins and quiet ones, and the places of their effusion.
And therefore Hippocrates says that a name is a mere sound, but in the work small, and most of all in the art of surgery.
But we have already said that about him in the introduction to this book; because whoever is not knowledgeable about what we have said about anatomy will not be spared from falling into error, by which men will die, just as I have seen many of them, since some are formed in this science and take themselves for experts without knowledge or experience.
Because you saw a foolish and inexperienced doctor who had inserted an abscess on the throat of a woman, and had cut some arteries in the throat so that a great deal of blood flowed, and the woman died between the others.
And I saw another doctor who, without realizing it, pulled out a gallstone from a man who had already developed an illness in his condition, and the gallstone was large, and he brought it to him and left that gallstone with a piece of the bladder, so that that man died three days later.
And you had already asked to remove it, and I saw that because of the size of the gallstone and the condition of the patient, one could infer that he would die.
And I saw another doctor who received payment from a duke of our land for surgery, and he set to work on a blacksmith's Negro who had a fracture in his thigh; and the doctor, with his ignorance, removed the fracture, on top of the wound, with pulleys and stays with strong tension, and did not allow the wound to breathe.
And then he bound it according to his desires, and then he re-laced it, and then he let it stay for some days and commanded that we loosen the bandage; and it became such that the thigh and leg were gangrened, and it led to destruction.
And you were called to him, and we loosened the bandage, and subsequently he experienced calmness and alleviation from his pains.
But meanwhile corruption was already confirmed in the member, so that it could not be restrained, and did not cease to spread corruption in the member until the patient peril.
And I saw another doctor who opened up a cancerous abscess and had it ulcerated about four days later, until the great evil of his patient's lordship was revealed.
Which is because the cancerous abscess is pure of melancholic humor, so that it does not need to come to him with force from all sides, but rather be in a member which suffered as if it was being hosted.
And therefore, sons, it is necessary for you that my operation be divided into two parts: one being the operation associated with health, and another being the work in which there is danger in the greater dispositions.
And you have already existed in every place of this book where the operation is in which there is error and fear; therefore it is necessary for you to guard this and leave that aside, so that foolish people do not find a way to speak and to deceive you.
And therefore take up your arms with solicitude and protection of God, and your patients with felicity and firmness.
And use the best way with the grace of God and persevere in losing one's life and gaining a glorious succession, and leave behind terrible diseases that are difficult to heal, and keep your arms from this which makes you fear, so that your station remains in your faith and in your name, lest it escapes: for it is more remaining at your glory, and more so in the world and in the end to your sanctity.
Galen has said in some of his own writings: "Do not medicate bad diseases, lest bad doctors be unnamed".
And you have already divided this book into three chapters.
Here begins the division of the book, and first of the first part. The first chapter arranged from head to foot, in the forms of instruments and in the ironworks of cauterizers, and from what is necessary in the operation.
The division of the second part. The second chapter, on cicatrization and perforation, and on cupping, and on wounds, and on the extraction of splinters and similar things to those, all chaptered and ordered in the forms of instruments.
The third chapter, on restoration and relocation, and on the cure of torticollis and similar things to those; chapter ordered from head to foot, and in the forms of instruments.
You should know what kind of joints that cauterizer is suited for and which ones it is not suitable for, and in what condition it should be prohibited to use.
So I say that the sermon on the quality of the joint of cauterizer and its necessity is a long and prolix one, subtle by science, and secret hidden; and already many wise men have spoken about it, and they have disagreed among themselves, and to me it suffices to share a small part of their sermons, fearing prolivity.
And so I say that cauterizer is suitable for every universal condition that is in material or its matter, except for two conditions, which are conditions where the material is lacking.
In the dry and parched condition with material that dries out; for some will say that cauterizer is helpful in this case, while others will say the opposite of this, that cauterizer is not suitable for a disease that is due to quality and dryness, because the nature of fire is quality and dryness, and it would be inconvenient to apply heat and dryness to a dry and parched condition.
And those who say the opposite of this will say that by cauterizer it is made to join together in all dry and parched diseases that are found in the bodies of men, for when you compare the body of man and its moistures to the condition of fire, you find the body of man cold.
And I say by this sermon that I have experimented with it many times to discover.
But I do not think it necessary to repeat what has already been explored and exercised in the chapter on cauterizing by last exercise, and to be familiar with the diversity of human conditions and the disposition of diseases in their respective cases, and the causes of those, and the accidents that occur in them, and the space of time that those take.
But in other conditions, there is no fear for you, and especially in cold and humid diseases, since all doctors have agreed on those, and are not discordant in the joining of cauterizing in those.
And know, sons, that from the secret of cure by cauterizing with fire and its goodness, so much is said about cauterizing with medicine, it is because fire is simple, whose action only reaches the member being cauterized and does not harm another member adjusted to it except for a small disturbance.
But the action of medicine combined reaches that member which is distant from it, and very easily brings illness to the affected member with difficult healing and often stays.
But the fire, by its subtlety and good substance, does nothing more than to superfluously add. Already we have known through experiment and long service of study in the art over the truth of causes; and therefore I am excused from the length of this sermon. And if it were not that the secret hidden with the fire is not read well in this pause to you, and the quality of the operation of it in the bodies and its expulsion by which it expels diseases, with a philosophical demonstration sermon, which would be sharp in your breasts.
And know, sons, that they disagree on the time when it is suitable to perform cauterizing and pause the best time of spring.
And I say that cauterizing is suitable at any time, because the harm caused by the timing of an accident is submerged in the joining of what attracts to cauterizing, and most especially if the cauterizing is for pains or necessary pains, strong and fierce, which do not suffer delay for fear of those that would bring malice, which is greater than a small harm entering through time.
And thus it does not occur in your minds, or sons, that this is not esteemed except by the common folk and foolish doctors, so that for that disease which is cured by cauterizing, there is no reduction of time, and pause that consequence.
And the cause is not thus as they say for that reason, because cauterizing is only a place of medicine which alters the condition and dries out the humors which are the cause why pains come.
But in any case, cauterizing is superfluous over medicine due to the desire for its value and virtue of its operation and greatness of its lord.
And it is possible that its disease may return at some hour of time, according to the condition of the patient and the location of his disease, and the virtue of it, and what is prepared in his body from the aggregation of superfluous things, and what is arrived at him in his acquisition through foods and similar causes; unless the disease for which cauterizing is administered is a subtle disease in a member with few superfluous things and humors, such as a tooth cauterization for pain and similar cases, it is possible that it will not return to him, but rather it will be reduced to smallness.
And it is also said that cauterizing is the last resort of medicine, and it is a sermon of desperation, not because I understand what they mean in that, for I believe that there is no cure that profits through medicine or any other cause approaching cauterizing.
And the cause is contrary to that; and I understand that cauterizing is the last resort of medicine not just when we administer the methods of cure in some diseases, and those medicines do not concur, and it approaches the end of the cause, then one administers cauterizing, and profits from it. And hours ago, I said that cauterizing is the last resort of medicine, not according to my understanding which I understand from the common people and the foolish doctors.
And the ancients said that cauterizing with gold is better than cauterizing with iron, and they did not say this except for the equality of gold and its subtlety.
And they said that the place of cauterizing does not take away from it, as this is not absolutely true, for I have already experienced and discovered that it does not do so except in certain bodies where others are not, and cauterizing with gold is good and better than with iron as they say; but when you do cauterizing with fire using gold, it is not declared to you, because it is hidden according to the quantity that you want by the roughness of the gold, and prepares to receive heat; and if you place upon it ignition so that the gold melts by the fire, and case in the fire some plates so that the craftsman can see through the occupation of that.
And therefore it is made to cauterize with iron, that we may proceed more lightly and more promptly to the rectitude of operation.
And I have already arranged this chapter on cauterizing according to chapters, and arranged those from head to foot, in order that the one demanding this may easily find what they want.
The First Chapter.
This cauterizing refers to the humidity and frigidity on the serving of the accident which is caused by two causes, one being the cause of soda and the other being the multitude of raumatic fluxes, called corissa, from the head to the parties of the eyes and ears flowing, and the multitude of sleepiness, and pain in the teeth and the throat, and universally all disease that comes through frigidity, such as paralysis, apoplexy, and similar ones in those diseases.
The form of this cauterizing is this: first, I command the patient to be purged with medicine lactative in the head, for three or four nights, according to what is required by the virtue of the patient and their age and habit.
And then I command him to shave his head with a razor, and have him sit between two mats on a well-cushioned bench, and let his mats rest on his own feet.
And then pause the razor's edge on your palm near the nose between their eyebrows. But since the time has come as you said, mark that place with a tent, and then light the cauterizing oil of which this is the form:
And then place it on that marked spot with the tent, in a way that descends, so that your hand is gradually constrained little by little, and you revolve it.
And then lift your hand lightly and gaze at the spot, and if you see that some quantity of bone has been revealed, like the amount of grain of errors, hours elevate your hand, and if it does not return to its original position with that iron, but rather becomes frigidated, until what I have told you is visible to the bone.
And then take a small amount of salt and dissolve it on the spot, and let it stay for three days.
And then place it on the wound that is covered with border and let it stay on it until the scar of the fire is destroyed. And then cure the spot with four-herb ointment until it is healed.
And they said that as long as the wound remains open, so much the better it gets, for it is better and more healing.
And some of them said that the cauterized part should be cauterized to the bone, and held in place until some part of the specificity of the bone is absorbed.
And then it should be razed what has been adjusted to the bone, and then it should be cured.
And others said that with the cauterizing it should come to an end, and then it should press strongly into the bone until the bone cracks, and this is the form of little alphecati. And they believe that from that spot the vapors of the head will evaporate.
And the open wound should be kept for a long time, and then it should be cured until it is consolidated.
But to me, it is not visible in these two species of cauterizing at all, except in some men according to the way of fear; and I leave that, you should know, better for health when it is so; because the head has been developed by the solution of continuity there, just as we have testified in other members, and especially when the patient's head is of a frigid nature.
And the first species of cauterizing is more saved and better, according to my judgment; and from that house and with that work, there is health.
Second Chapter.
On Cauterizing of the Head.
When chronic and long-lasting pain occurs throughout the head in a patient who is prolonged, and uses various remedies such as plasters, poultices, ointments, powders, and balms, and especially if it has already been cauterized with one cauterizing which does not benefit him at all, then consider whether the patient's head is of strong creation in its nature; and since it is not frigid and finds no great relief, then cauterize another cauterizing over that little bit. And then cauterize it on the horn of his head with a cauterizing until the bone is split apart. Cut the bone and uncover the quantity of bone that we have described, and then cauterize it with a cauterizing in the rear part of the head at the location called "vas", which is the place where the wind blows. And raise your hand in this way, and do not uncover the bone, for the patient by doing so will experience a great deal of pain different from the pain of all other cauterizations on the head.
And you should say this cauterizing in its place, for it is necessary that the cauterizing which cauterizes the horns of the head and the occiput is more subtle than that with which the middle part of the head is cauterized; and this is its form.
Fourth Chapter.
On Cauterizing of Old Hiccups.
When there is dull pain in the head or it spreads to the eye, and medicine lactative has been purged, and another cure has been administered, which I have described in the divisions of diseases; and all does not benefit, then cauterizing in two ways: either with medicinal acuteness combined, or with iron.
But cauterizing with medicinal acuteness is when you take a piece of aloes, scrape it and cut off the extremities from both ends. And then make an incision in the place of pain on the temple with a well-sharpened lancet until it makes a spot below the bone, so that it is hidden.
And then press strongly on it with a stopper to prevent further constriction, and leave it for the space of three hours; and then remove the aloes, treat the wound, and let it stay for two or three days, and then place on it a poultice submerged in border until the spot becomes healed.
And then cure that with ointment until it is healed.
And if you wish, do the same with some medicinal combinations which I have written in the two treatises on medicinal combinations.
But the cauterizing with iron according to this manner: ignite by fire of which this is the form:
and it is called "claus clavilhs", because the head of it is like a shape of a clove in which there is some curvature, and in the middle part of it is a small prominence.
And then place it on the spot of pain, and hold your hand steady - so that the arrowhead is not absorbed by the surrounding tissue - and rotate the iron slowly little by little with speed.
And if the quantity of blood that is absorbed by the specificity of the bone is as much as the majority of it, and lift your hand for fear that the artery which is left behind will not be absorbed, so that no flow of blood comes forth.
And then soak the cloth in saltwater and place it on the spot, and leave it for three days; and then change the cloth with border, and then cure with ointment until it is healed.
And if you wish, cauterize with the edge of the cutlery according to the cauterizing, and beware of cutting into the artery in this old hiccup properly.
Fourth Chapter.
On Cauterizing of Old Hiccups Properly.
When you cure emigranea with what we have said about the previous cure and what we have described in the divisions of diseases, and if the cure does not benefit and sometimes the disease is so severe that it does not respond to what we have said about the first cauterizing with medicine or with fire, then you must ignite the cutlery cauterization until it is whitened, because it means on the spot of pain with a line of length which is most of the digit, or whatever; and hold your hand steady for one moment and press strongly there until the artery is incised and reaches the bone.
However, it is necessary for you to be mindful of the continuation of the jawbone, which is damaged by mastication, and that the ligament not be absorbed and the nerves which are affected by this, and that there be no spasms.
And if it is about the custody and caution of the flow of blood from the artery that is severed, for in the severing of it there is fear, and especially for him who is ignorant of what he does and has not studied or practiced; and leave the operation at the beginning.
And you will find it in the memory of the regimen of accidental bleeding from the artery according to its own manner, in its own place in this book.
And if you see that this disease does not respond to this cauterizing and see the patient's body is tolerable, then cauterize it in the middle part of the head just as we have described, and cure the wound until it is healed.
And if you wish, administer the cauterizing which we have described in the chapter on stretching of artery with two cloths, and it is better this cauterizing and more relevant.
Fifth Chapter.
On Cauterizing of Earaches.
When in the ear there is pain due to cold and it is cured with lactative causes and with another cure which I have described in the division, and the pain does not subside, then ignite the cauterizing, and this is the one called "puncta", of which this is the form:
And then make the puncta approach the ignition, and be brought to the surroundings of all the ear as a wheel is revolved, or in the circle of each example if the pain is in each. Draw out the cauterizing from the root of the ear little by little until you have marked the spot with intent.
And if the cauterizing is applied to all the points in the entire ear, and those places, and then cure them until they are healed.
Sixth Chapter.
On Cauterizing of Torture.
Torture which is cured and by cauterizing there is only of the species that come through flux, according to what we have said in the divisions of diseases.
Avoid cauterizing the species which occurs due to dryness or spasm of the nerve.
When you cure that species of torture with jarrings and capipurgi and guarguarismes, and your cure does not conform, then it is necessary to cauterize the patient with three cauterizations: the first at the root of the ear, and the second a little behind the temple, and the third at the conjunction of two lips.
And pause your cauterization on the contrary side of the affected part, for softening does not come except in the part that appears to be healing.
And the form of cauterization is that you cauterize it with the cauterizing on the right side of the extremity of the ear, a little above the horn of the head, and in the temple another, the length of which is according to the length of the thumb's tip, and hold your hand with the cauterizing until the quantity of the majority of the bone's specificity is consumed.
And this is the form of the cauterizing, and it is a type of cutlery, the shape of which is before the table. But even more subtle is that which you see a little, and it is necessary to temper in it a little of superfluous grossness.
And then cure the spot with this water which is before processed until it is healed.
Seventh Chapter.
On Cauterizing of Old Apoplexy.
When apoplexy is old and you cure it with what we have said and your medicine does not conform and the patient has no fever, then cauterize it with four cauterizations: on all the horns of his head; and with cauterization in the middle part of the head, just as we have said; and with cauterization in the back of the head. And the manner of the cauterizing is done according to what has been said above.
And it is cauterized on the mouth of the stomach; and it is more posterior; and then be cured with water that is processed.
Eighth Chapter.
On Cauterizing of Oblivion caused by Flux.
It is necessary that the patient be given in the beginning large jarrings and pills of purgative medicine.
And then shave the head of the patient and place on it an ointment described in the treatise on ointments, on the back of the head.
And pause for a few moments, because that is the manner of cauterizing. And do so according to the order which I have already said.
And then if he is healed by that; and otherwise, then do three cauterizations in the back part of his head, which are descendants from the upper part of the head down to the lower part of the neck. And pause between each cauterization the length of the finger, and then cure with water that has been processed.
But if you wish to add more and the patient is tolerant, then do the cauterization in the middle part; and if you wish to add even more, then cauterize that on both horns.
And then cure that until it is healed; and be the olive cauterization according to the form given above.
Ninth Chapter.
On Cauterizing of Paralysis and Softening of the Whole Body.
It is necessary that you process in the softening of the head with jarrings and with water as we have said; and then shave the head of the patient, and then cauterize it with cauterization in the middle part of the head, and with cauterization on all the horns of the head, and with cauterization on the back part of the neck, and with three cauterizations on the vertebrae of the neck.
And if it is necessary in the disease of softening of the body for many and the patients are tolerant, and the disease is strong, then cauterize that with four cauterizations on the vertebrae of the back, and gradually with cauterization until it is consumed by the bone's motion, and lift your hand. And then cure that until it is healed, and this be olive cauterizing.
Tenth Chapter.
On Cauterizing of Epilepsy.
It is not cauterized the epiletic, but that epilepsy is caused by flux.
And therefore it is necessary to soften the brain at first with jarrings and with other cure which we have described in the division when the patient is great and the exception of medicines is tolerated.
And if it is a child who cannot tolerate medicines, then administer guarguarismes and mastiguation with purgative medicine, for four days in advance, with good provision of food.
And then shave the head of the patient, and then cauterize it with one cauterization in the middle part of the head according to the previous manner, and with another cauterization on the back of the neck, and on each horn of the head. And if the patient is strong and is tolerant, then cauterize it with the cauterizations which I say, having paralysis and softening of the body on the vertebrae of the neck and the back.
And be the olive cauterizing according to what has been said before.
But if the patient is a child, then pause with subtle cauterization according to this manner.
Eleventh Chapter.
On Cauterizing of Melancholy.
When the causes of melancholy are humid and corrupted flux, then cauterize that with the cauterizations which we have said in having paralysis.
And if the cause of melancholy is superfluity declining into melancholy, and the body of the patient is humid, then give him to drink water that softens the brain according to what has preceded in the division.
And then shave the head of the patient, and then make a turban decently made from it over the circle, and then place that in the middle part of the head.
And the patient shall be kept seated comfortably, and held from all sides.
And then pause with a liniment; and it is more worthy of an ancient border of sheep. And warm that over the fire with gentle heat, measured by measure, which the patient suffered when it was most in him. And then place that in the middle part of the head of him in the circle, and let it be there until it is warmed.
And do this with the patient for one week at a time, with another regimen of good medicine until he is healed; or if you wish, cauterize that making small points according to what is most of it, but keep your hand with a cauterization thus ordered: this is a species of cauterizing which moistens the brain with equality.
And then pause that covered in beggar's cloth or in grayish gallinaceous (i.e., old hen) skin.
Twelfth Chapter.
On Cauterizing of Water Descending into the Womb.
When you are declared the beginning of water in the womb by the signs which I have said in the division, then begin and give to drink to the patient water that softens the head of him, and keep that from all humidities.
And make that sweat in a bath in the degree for some days.
And then command him to shave his head, and cauterize that with cauterization in the middle part of the head; and then cauterize that with two cauterizations on both temples if it is the beginning of water in two wombs, or on one side if it is the beginning of water in one womb.
Cut with the cauterizer all the veins and arteries which are left by the bone; and let the cauterizations be in that length in the latitude of the temples.
And beware of fluxes of blood when it is being cauterized; and if you see from him fluxes of blood, stop it with some medicine which is to your power.
And you will come to wisdom, which is in the extraction of arteries and in the absorption of those and caution regarding fluxes of blood.
And sometimes it is cauterized on the cervical vertebrae left between two bones with two cauterizations produced gradually.
Thirteenth Chapter.
On Cauterizing of Old Tears.
When the tears of the womb are old and superfluous, and through the veins and arteries which are in the manifest location on the outside of the head, it is verified that this is a flux of cold and humid fluid, then cauterize that with the cauterization which we have recounted in the chapter of the beginning of water flowing into the womb, and with cauterization in the middle part of the head, and with two cauterizations on the cervical vertebrae left between two temples, and with two cauterizations on the cervical vertebrae left between two bones. And if you need addition, then cauterize that on the entire back of the womb over the extremity of the forehead with a small cauterization.
Fourteenth Chapter.
On Cauterizing of Stench from the Nose.
When you medicate that with water as we have said in the division and your medicine does not benefit, then prepare and give to drink to the patient cockroaches for three nights; and then shave the head of him, and cauterize it with a gentle olive cauterization. And then cauterize that with a clove cauterization and two cauterizations on both sides of the forehead, just above the hair.
And beware not to cut into the artery that you find.
And of the clove cauterization, this is the form.
Fifteenth Chapter.
On Cauterizing of Softening of Eyelids of the Womb.
When the eyelid of the womb is softened by disease or humidity, then cauterize that eyelid with one cauterization with this lunar cauterization; and this is the form of it:
And if you, then cauterize that on both sides a little above the eyebrows with two cauterizations in all parts, and be extended from the temples. And let the length of each cauterization be according to the quantity of the eyebrow.
And do not press too hard with your hand on the cauterizer, but according to the quantity that the third part of the eyelid is absorbed.
Sixteenth Chapter.
On Cauterizing of the Eyelid of the Womb When the Hairs are Converted to the Inner Parts and Punch the Womb.
When the hairs of the womb are converted to the inner parts in such a way that they punch the womb, then cauterize those in two ways, either by fire or by medicine which is complementary.
If by cauterization of fire, command the patient before that they may comb their own hairs as if they were making them smooth, until they are prolonged and equalized; and if you punch that, then you should bind the womb with a bandage so that it is not harmed until the hairs are born.
Then when they are born and equalized, pause the head of the patient in your seat, and then sign on the eyelid of the womb with a tent, with a signal which is according to the figure of a mullein leaf, and be the beginning of the signal near the hairs.
And then pause with a cloth wrapped in almond oil or mucus from papyrus over the womb.
And then ignite the cauterization which this is the form of it.
And then cauterize on the figure which you have signed, little by little, in many times, until the surface of the bone is burned like a mullein leaf, all appearing properly.
And the sign of health for this work is that you see the eyelid of the womb already contracted and the hairs of it elevated above the puncture of the womb.
And then elevate your hand and leave that for three days, and then pause with a cloth wrapped in borders until the scar is eradicated. And then cure that with an ointment until it is healed.
But if some cause returns to the hairs and the eyelid is softened, then do another time the cauterization on that just as you did initially.
But if the hairs are left in the eyelid, then cauterize that until it is elevated to its natural place and equalized, so that the hairs do not harm the womb.
But the cauterization with complementary medicine is that you command the patient to comb their hairs until they are prolonged and equalized, and then make a bandage like a mullein leaf.
And take a known saponin and a living cause of an inch. The end. And thus, and then mix those causes well, and make this with a feast for so that it is not warmed; and then spread that water on the bandage which is made like the form of a mullein leaf, and pause that over one womb or both; and pause below the womb cloth wrapped in almond oil, and the head of the patient be in your seat.
And then pause the said thing on the medicine and press that a little and not harm it until the patient feels the sting of the medicine, for sting is in him like fire.
And then, when the patient perceives that he feels the sting of the medicine, pause and say to him "Be quiet" and do not harm it until the sting ceases; and then, when the sting ceases, rinse the womb with water; and then consider if the eyelid has already been lifted like it is washed away by fire or incision, for then you are well; and if not, return to that medicine on the location where you did not apply the medicine and do not neglect until your operation is equalized and the womb is contracted.
And then pause with a cloth wrapped in borders until the scar of adjustment is eradicated, and then cure that with an ointment or another until it is healed.
And it is necessary for you to diligently watch over your operation so that no residue of the medicine falls into the womb, and if the eyelid becomes softened after some days and any cause of the hairs hurts the womb, then repeat your medicine on that location where the eyelid has become softened, and do it in the same way as at the beginning, and guide it until it is healed.
And this is the form of mullein leaf.
And know that the wombs of men are diversified according to their magnitude and smallness, and therefore, according to this, is made your contraction.
And let not the way of rightness be hidden from him who studies in this art.
Seventeenth Chapter.
On Cauterizing of Fistula that is in the Lacrimal of the Womb.
When you cure a fistula with water as we have said in the divisions of diseases and do not confer your cure, then command that you cauterize it according to this manner: command the patient to pause their head in your seat, and hold the head of them with some attendant between your thighs in such a way that it is not harmed nor agitated with their own head.
And then pause with a cloth wrapped in almond oil or mucus from papyrus over the womb of it.
And then ignite the cauterization which this is the form:
...which shall be curved, like the shape of a cane or a pheasant's tail, from one end to which is made the cauterization.
And if you wish, it shall penetrate into the other extremity. And if you wish, let it be so as a signal.
But in any case, that which is curved is better for your work.
And then press the fistula if it is open, and draw out pus and dry it. And if it is not open, then open it and extract the tumor from it.
And then pause with the cauterization which is well ignited, and take with that your hand a little bit to apply the cauterization to the womb at the parting of the nose, so that you do not err or disturb the patient, and then pause the cauterization in the gray matter of the womb and corrupt it.
And then if at the beginning of your cauterization it enters into the bone, that is good; and otherwise, then repeat the cauterization one or two times as needed; and leave that so for three days, and then pause with a cloth wrapped in borders and surround it with an ointment to dry until it is healed.
But if it is passed eleven days and not healed, then pause with sharp and corrosive medicine until the bone is uncovered and shaved according to what is suitable in your own chapter.
And there is another method of cauterizing a fistula which some first doctors said: insert the instrument into the location of the fistula and then pause in that subtle fissure, which is the form of it: And pour into that the quantity of one inch of melted lead; and take your hand with a camel with good retention, and do not let the patient be harmed because the melted lead may penetrate to the womb of him; and pause over the womb of the patient with a cloth wrapped in almond oil or water, for lead adheres to the location of the fistula and heals it through marvelous healing.
And if the fistula is healed with the water that we have said about cauterizing and curing, that is good; and otherwise, then it is necessary to administer a blow through the nose and reduce the fistula to the body of the nose according to what will come in its own place.

And then lift your hand, and then repeat the cauterization several times according to what you wish.
And then the patient will open their mouth with water of salt and hold it for an hour, and afterwards stop it, because the decayed tooth is sealed and the softened gingivae are strengthened and the corrupted humidity is dried up.
Twenty-First Chapter.
On Cauterizing of Toothache.
When toothache is due to coldness, or the tooth is cold or warm, and your cure with medicine does not confer, then cauterize in that location according to two ways: either cauterize with a border of oxen, or cauterize with fire.
Cauteri with border is that you take the border of oxen and boil it in a cauldron of iron, and then take a cloth and wrap it around the extremity of the tent, and then immerse that in boiling border, and pause that over the toothache festinatingly until it is cooled.
And then repeat that several times until the virtue of fire reaches to the root of the teeth.
And if you wish, immerse wool or cloth in the border as said above, and pause that over the aching tooth, and pause on top of that iron ignited until the iron reaches to the root of the curvature of the tooth.
But in any case, the cauterization with fire is that you attend to the quantity of iron or steel, and be in the core of it some roughness, and the sharpness of the fire does not reach the mouth of the patient.
And then ignite the cauterization according to its form, and pause that over the tooth and take your hand until the cauterization is cooled; and do this several times because the pain will be relieved or in one day or another.
And it is necessary for the patient to fill their mouth with good border and hold it for an hour, and then spit it out; and this is the form of the cauterization.
And cauterize as you wish, with whatever instrument or method you can use.
And this is the form of the cauterizing instrument:
Twenty-Second Chapter.
On Cauterizing of Exostoses.
When exostoses are of flesh and humors that are cold and not obedient to digestion by medicines, and you wish the digestion of those slightly, then you ignite the cauterization with a curved shape according to this form, having two extremities humps for the smoke of the cauterization to escape through one side, and pause that ignited instrument on that apostema once, and another if it is needed of that, until it reaches the root of the apostema.
And if the apostema is small, then pause the cauterization according to the quantity of the apostema, and then leave it for three days and pause over it with a cloth wrapped in borders until what the fire has burned off is relieved.
And then cure that with ointment, poultices, and cloths until it is healed.

On Cauterizing of Lung Disease and Cough.
When cough and lung disease are of cold humidities, and the patient has no fever nor hiccup, and it is an old disease, then cauterize that with two cauterizations on the furcula in the affected locations; and with another cauterization in the middle location of the chest between two nipples; and let the cauterization be like a key according to the previous form.
And if you wish, make your cauterization punctate with the cauteries that are called puncture, the form of which precedes in the puncturing of earache.
And make points into those; and then cure that with water, applying as preceded until it is healed.
And now the cauteries have three ramps, where cauterization is in that: in one go, you can make three cauteries according to this form:
Twenty-Fifth Chapter.
On Cauterizing of Tittil, which is the Head of the Assistant.
When the head of the assistant is dislocated due to lubricating humidities and is not fixed in its return movement, and it becomes dislocated again as we have testified, then it is necessary first to reduce the dislocation, and then the patient shall be reversed onto their back or side; and then elevate the cord which is in the departure from behind the citillic to the upper parts with the fingers of your left hand, if the joint is dislocated from behind.
And then ignite the cautery with two heads; and this is the form of it:
And then cauterize the cord until it penetrates that into another side; and the figure of cauterization will be like this, when there are five cauteries.
And some times it is adjusted according to this count, because there are eight cauteries.
And then pause over the cautery with pores full of salt, and then make the patient adhere to tranquility, and let the member not be decayed for any time until it is comforted.
And if the dislocation is in the upper parts and there is no remedy, then cauterize over the muscle with a cauterization like a key or with multiple punctate cauteries, because the joint is confirmed and the humidity is dried up and the patient is healed.
Twenty-Sixth Chapter.
On Cauterizing of the Stomach.
When cold and many humidities come into the stomach, and it is thrown out of its composition and becomes multiple rumblings in it, and if you continue with the methods of curing and do not concur, then it is necessary that the patient be turned onto their back and stretched out their arms and legs, and then cauterize that with three cauteries: one on the chest for the quantity of a finger with a key-shaped cautery, and two on both sides of the cautery, so that the figure of triangular cautery appears; and elongate between them so that they are not adjusted to cause pressure.
And if the depth of the cautery is equal to the quantity of two-thirds of the thickness of the cord.
And let the figure of the cautery be according to this form, and if you wish, cauterize with a large cautery in the middle location of the stomach according to this form; and this shall be one cautery according to the form of a circle, according to this form:
And let the stomach be punctured with that which is frightened of this cautery: and it is that you sense on the stomach point according to the quantity you want in tent, and then cauterize those points with a cautery; and then cure that with the curing that preceded until it is healed.
Twenty-Seventh Chapter.
On Cauterizing of the Fettered Foot.
When the pain is in the foot due to coldness or humidity or excessive ventosity, and it has departed from its normal composition by superfluous egression, and the patient is cured with water as we have said but does not concur, then it is necessary that the patient be turned onto their back and stretched out their arms and legs, and sense three cauteries according to this form and quantity on the foot behind the hip bones, so that it reaches the position of a man lying down.
And let the space between each cautery be according to the thickness of the finger, and let the cauteries be according to the length of a straight arm.
And do not compress your hand with the cauterous motion.
And if the quantity of water that is absorbed is equal to the quantity of the majority of the cord's thickness, and it is not yet adjusted; and if the patient stands on their feet; and if they are not standing, then let them lie down, which has stretched out its legs, and raised its arms.
And it is possible for you to cauterize these cauteries with a knife-shaped cautery, when it is according to your subtlety and prudence in the art.
And take care that you do not proceed too quickly in the cauterization, and be careful with the subtlety of all the cord so that it is absorbed throughout the body and reaches into the vessels, for this cord here is subtle; and know this.
Twenty-Eighth Chapter.
On Perforation of the Aposteme of the Foot with a Cautery.
When there is an aposteme or excrescence on the foot and you wish to know if that aposteme is in the flesh of the foot or in the skin, then if it is in the flesh of the foot, the patient will be afflicted with gravity and pain with no acuteness.
And if it is in the skin of the foot, then with great pain and many times that will fatigue even the doctors to cure it.
Therefore, it is necessary that the patient be turned over onto their back on the pillow; and then sense the location of the aposteme with tentation; and then ignite the cautery which is similar to rag, the form of which has preceded in another page. And then cauterize with that same cautery until all the cord is consumed, until it reaches the ciphac, until in such a way that health may ensue.
And then cure that with the curing of other apostemes until it is healed.
And it is not necessary that one use this form of cautery except for the one who has studied in the art of medicine and has prolonged it, and whose many maladies have known; but this one may be bold at times on this operation, yet always heed the warning and it will be better.
Twenty-Ninth Chapter.
On Cauterizing of Pleurisy.
The ancient cauteries of the roots of aristology have declared that for pleurisy, it is necessary to cauterize according to this manner, and this is what you take from the roots of aristology, a long dry root that is found, and it is of the thickness of a finger.
And then submerge that in oil and ignite it at the fire, and then cauterize with a cautery in that location which is between the continuation of the furcula and the collarbone; and with two small cauteries guided by that, one slightly declining towards the party that is below the beard, and with two cauteries on that part that declines between the fifth rib and the navel, declining slightly to the parts behind; and with another cautery in the middle location of the foot; and with another on the stomach, and with three cauteries from behind; and with one cautery in that location which is between the two shoulders, and with two cauteries from both sides of the foot, leaving the cautery which is between two shoulders.
And it is not necessary that you compress your hand with the cautery, but rather let it be in the manifestation of the cord in action.
And already the ancient ones have said that some of the men who used iron cautery like a ray and ignited it, and put it in that location which is between the ribs, until it reaches that aposteme and healthiness is promoted, just as we have said in the aposteme of the foot.
But in this perforation with cautery there is no fear, for as it happens soon after the location of fistula to which there is no healing.
Thirty-First Chapter.
On Cauterizing of the Melancholy.
When you cure the disease of melancholy with water as we have said in the division and do not concur with your curing, then cauterize there according to three manners, all of which are right, one of which is that you make three or four lines according to the length of the melancholy, following the figure of the cauteries of the foot, the figure of which has preceded.
And between each cautery the thickness of a finger or a little more, and the manner of the cautery is the same manner which we have said in the cauteries of the foot, equally.
And do not compress your hand with the cautery; and let the patient lie on their back.
And there is another manner of cauterizing, so that you ignite the cautery having two handles, which cause we have said in the chapter on dislocation of the muscle, and elevate the cord which is in the end of the melancholy, where it reaches the bed of the patient's left side.
And be your elevation according to which you elevate the cord as long as the body is, so that you may make cauteries according to the latitude of the body.
And then insert the two handles, ignite one, and enter into that which with those you will pierce the cord from the other side.
And then extract the cautery; and thus four cauteries are made.
And if you wish, cauterize with a cautery having three handles.
And then you cure the cautery more than I have said to get it out for too many days, because it is more certain that other causes preceding in the curing.
Thirty-Second Chapter.
On Cauterizing of Hydropepticus.
Cauteries are not used in hydropepticus, but rather in acute properment.
When you cure the hydropepticus with the manners of curing which we have said in the division and do not concur with your curing, then it is necessary that one cauterizes with four cauteries in the circle of the navel and with one cautery on the stomach, and with another cautery on the foot, and with another cautery on the melancholy, and with two cauteries between the vertebrae of the back, and with one cautery in the right side of the foot, and with another cautery on the stomach. And the quantity of the depth of the cautery should be proportioned to the subtlety of the cord.
And then leave the cautery under for so that it gets out slowly over a long time.
And do not evacuate the patient from curing immediately after the cautery with water as is necessary for two intentions, and thus it will be hastened to him with the aid of healing.
The form of the cautery with which the belly is cauterized is like a key according to the previous form above, and it is that with which the back is cauterized is olive-shaped according to its previous form.
Thirty-Second Chapter.
On Cauterizing of Feet and Limbs.
When the feet are apostemated in dropsy and filled with sitten water, it is necessary that you cauterize the feet on the top of the heel with a cautery that is between the auricular and anular, and elevate your hand with the cautery and do not twist it; and then elevate your hand, and do not return to it completely, for the sitten water resists.
The cautery is according to this form: And then make two cauteries on each limb, and in each limb be made a cautery at the extremity of the knife-shaped cautery. And be the cauteries according to the length of the limb: one below the knuckle and another below the middle part of the limb; and on each limb, two cauteries.
And leave the wound open without cure for a long time in order that some water may flow from it.
And then cure it with those causes which we have said.
Thirty-Third Chapter.
On Cauterizing of Belly.
When the belly is weakened by cold and humidity to such an extent that it loses its virtues, namely the digestive and retentive virtues which are in the stomach and intestines, and it is cured with water as we have said in the curing methods, but does not concur, and at times the patient suffers from a cauterization of virtue exhibiting, then cauterize that with a great cautery on the natural stomach according to what has preceded in the cauterization of the stomach, with the circle cautery and four subtle cauteries in the circle of the navel, with a key-shaped cautery; and with another cautery over the loin over aloes granules, or with two cauteries.
And if at times excessive humidity and the patient's water tolerates, then cauterize that on the intestines and over the intestines, and slightly adjusting two cauteries over the stomach and near the groin, for it is perfect curing of which you will not err.
Thirty-Fourth Chapter.
On Cauterizing of Old Hemorrhoids.
When such old hemorrhoids or one of gross humors or corrupted humidity are in nature and are cured with water as we have said in the division, but do not concur with your curing, then cauterize with three cauteries on the pus left behind from the vertebrae of the little back and triangular, and with a cautery above the navel that falls between two ditties.
And if you think that the stomach of him is enfeebled and his food not digested, and his face at times apostemated, then cauterize that on the stomach with a great cautery according to what has preceded; and with one cautery on the foot, and with another cautery on the melancholy of him with a key-shaped cautery; and leave the cautery open for some time, and then cure him until he is healed.
Thirty-Fifth Chapter.
On Cauterizing of Athies Properly for their Abscission.
When you abscess the athies, then ignite the cautery which is similar to a ray. Then insert that ignited cautery into the abscessed athie, and lastly extend your hand until the cautery reaches the opening of the vein from which blood flows.
And make it once or twice, for if the athies are too many, then cauterize each of them according to what we have recounted, and then cure those with water that concurs with their wounds until they are healed.
And if you cauterize with a great cautery on something, it is more certain in judgment.
Thirty-Sixth Chapter.
On Cauterizing of Fistulas that are formed in the natural parts of him.
When nature does not obey the work which we have recommended in its place, and the patient is frightened by that, be healed with a cautery.
Therefore, when you find some fistula in the natural parts of him, and it is old, rotten blood and corrupted humidity are flowing from it, and thus what is most worthy to be done is that you probe that with a subtle tent and know the quantity of the depth of it with the aforementioned tent.
Then ignite the cautery which is similar to a ray. And then insert that ignited cautery into this fistula, and according to the quantity in which the tent enters.
And iterate over that with the cautery until those corrupted bodies are consumed in one, two, or three passes, according to the quantity of your necessity.
And take care not to burn the nerves and veins; or if the fistula goes to the bladder or intestines, then take care of all those places; and do not do so unless the fistula is in a fleshly location and you are certain that it is not penetrating.
And then cure the place until it is healed.
And if the place is sealed, and all the matters have abscessed from it, and thus remains for a long time, then know that it has been completely cured.
And if the matters are not removed from him, then know that it is penetrating or into the preone of him or corrupting his flesh, or that there will be remembrance of those causes in its place.
Thirty-Seventh Chapter.
On Cauterizing the Tonsils.
When in the tonsils there is great pain due to cold or gross ventosity, and because of this the patient's throat is sore, then it is necessary that you cauterize that on each tonsil with a key-shaped cautery, of which the remembrance precedes.
And then cauterize with a little more, so that three lined cauteries will be made, and thus they will be more certain in judgment.
Thirty-Eighth Chapter.
On Cauterizing the Bladder.
When debilitation and softening occur in the bladder due to cold and humidity such that the patient's urine does not retain, then cauterize that on the posterior part of the bladder, where the hair of the small intestine begins, and cauterize with one cautery on the right side and another on the left side.
And be the length of each cautery according to the quantity of the nodules on the pustule; and cauterize that with a cautery in the lowest part of the back, or with two cauteries if necessary.
And be the key-shaped cautery according to what has proceeded.
Thirty-Ninth Chapter.
On Cauterizing the Malar.
When cold and humidity come to the malar, and because of this impregnation is prohibited, and the menstrual fluxes are corrupted, and the provocation of them is delayed, and pain occurs in the lower abdomen due to their retention, then it is necessary that the place be cauterized with three cauteries in the circle of the navel, just as we have said in the cauterization of the bladder; and with a cautery on the lowest part of the back, or with two cauteries, and let the key-shaped cautery be.
Fortieth Chapter.
On Cauterizing the Dislocation of the Hip.
When moist humors are abundant in the part of the hip, and the causes of its swelling are made manifest, and the sign is that the limb is prolonged over the other when compared between them. And the place of the dislocation is located in the part which is above.
Therefore it is necessary that you cauterize the patient on the part of the hip with a circular cautery similar to a circle, as soon as you have sensed with a tent in the circle of the part thus revolved, and so that the part falls in the middle location of the circle.
And be the cautery of which the form proceeded in the cauterization of the stomach.
And if this cautery is not before you, then cauterize that with three cauteries and a large olive-shaped cautery.
And make the cautery according to the quantity of the subtlety of all the cord; and then cure that until it is healed.
Fortieth Chapter.
On Cauterizing the Sciatic Vein.
When pain comes in the part of the hip, and its cause is cold and humidity, the patient is cured with water as we have said and does not concur, and this is old, then it is necessary that you apply to the patient with gross humors by fetid pills or artificial pills or semblances; and then cauterize that.
And the manner of the cautery in that is according to two manners: or a cautery with burning medicines, or a cautery with fire.
There are according to two scientific manners, of which one is that you cauterize that on the part of the hip of him with three triangular cauteries in this shape; and make them good depth. And be the space which is between each cautery the quantity of the thickness of the said, and if it is an olive-shaped or large cautery.
But sometimes there are four cauteries, with the one on the middle location on the head of the hip, for that reason.
And if you wish, cauterize with the circle of which the form precedes in the cauterization of the dislocation of the hip, that is a circle that contains and burns the subtlety of all the cord.
And this is the manner of cauterization in sciatica when pain is attached to the hip and does not extend into the joint.
But if it extends into the joint, then cauterize that with two cauteries on the joint on the location where the patient feels the pain; and with one cautery on the pelvis for four times, a little distance from the hairy part.
And if the cautery is cutelliform, and be the depth of the cautery according to the quantity of the subtlety of the cord.
And if the patient says that the pain is extended to the place near the digits of the feet, then cauterize that here where it is felt with a cautery for three points or four or more as needed.
And if the patient says that the pain is left below the donut-shaped vein near the joint, then cauterize that with a cutelliform cautery.
And be careful in all cautery that you do not leave the cautery until it has burned nerves or large arteries, and that because of this, it is bad for your patient to suffer or contract.
And behold, I have seen one and another of those who will be cauterized on the pelvis and finally in the cautery, and the inflamed fire burning inside until the tumor reaches its peak, and the pierced and corrupted foot is made. And thus a great solution of the belly occurs, and thus death ensues.
And if the pain is in two parts together, then cauterize each one according to this manner.
And thus the wise ones say in the cauterization of the hip, that this is the manner: make it similar to a circle of iron with a circumference equal to half a palm; and be the shape of your orifice according to the thickness of a walnut shell or less.
And within that circle be another third; and be the space which is between them the quantity of the nodules of the pustule; and be those circles about two parts; and be the length of them one nodule or two nodules, and make in those margins of iron decently apparelled in the circles; and this is the form of it:
And be ignited in the fire until it reddens and gives sparks, and be paused above the part of the hip, the patient lying on his side. And then cauterize that with three circular cauteries in one pass.
And then leave that for three days; apply a poultice to it with border and leave the wound open for many days; and then cure that with ointments until it is healed.
Thus speaks Albucasis: Ah, children, we have used this type of cautery rarely because of the fear of looking at it, and therefore few have found those who look upon it.
But from good cauteries, they have suffered at him, and found the place of him.
But the cautery with burning medicines is one that you make two circles having a perforated armula in which should be placed the goaf of the iron door; be the length of the partitions in the neatness of their being two nodules or as many as those.
And if the space which is between each one is the quantity of the thickness of the said; and be above and below, and be that contain themselves between them according to this form:
And then pause above the part of the hip the patient lying on his side, and compress your hand over the part of the hip; and then take cold water and pour it between two circles, and let its quality be in a small fire little by little, and hold that for the quantity of an hour, and cause the patient to suffer the biting and adaptation of him — as if from fire — until the biting ceases.
And then lift your hand with the instrument and wash away the cold water from all of the hip with warm water.
And then leave that for three days and pause over it with border until the darkness of adaptation is regained, and leave that too for some days, and run from him purulence; this is the last in judgment.
And then cure that with ointments until it is healed.
And if the pain is extended to the joint or the thigh, make it like a statue in him that contains water according to how it is made in the hip equally.
And this is the manner of cold water, and you have already written it in the treatise on the rectification of medicines. Recipe of alkali and of both non-extinguished causes, one for each hip, and crush them and pause in a new wave of which the left part is pierced by a small hole, according to the quantity that enters into the ray.
And pause the bottom of the wave in another enveloped wave, and pour on that alkali and living causes with warm water which absorbs those for one finger, and then compress them with your thumb for good compression, and leave the hole to descend from it into the parted-off wave in the enveloped wave.
And then adjust all that water, and pour it on other living causes and another alkali renewed, because that water is now of very strong acidity, which is administered in many operations of medicine and in cauterization of the other members, because operation makes fire.
And some of the medicines with which the hip is cauterized, such as tea-zit and mulberry juice, and causes with savory in such a way that they are mixed.
And Gualia recounts the story of a man from ancient times who was operated on and cured for hip pain and sciatic vein pain, and magnified much about him, saying that no other cure was needed, and that it was healed in one pass, just as he had recommended, because very little effort was required to achieve this.
And it is that you should be taken with certain vertebrae, and if not found, take a fresh fig; and much be crushed with a little grey matter, and paused above the hip where there is pain, or in the joint, or in the thigh, and tied.
And be left for the quantity of three hours or for the quantity that the patient feels relaxation of adaptation.
And then immerse that in water and therefore when the body of him is relaxed, interpose it in the sun, so that the pain ceases and he is healed.
And know that no one should use these medicines for cauterization except in the event of evacuation from the body.
But already Escorides has said that when the sciatic vein is cauterized in a wound of goat, it is cured with ease; and this cautery is done according to this manner: take wool and soak it in old oil, and place it between the toes of the foot and between the bones.
And then take dried goat's hide and inflame it with fire until it is made of charcoal; and then pause it over the wool and leave it inside until it is stretched. And then repeat this process, and do not stop until the sensation of biting reaches into the hip and brings relief to the pain.
And this manner of cauterization is called "cauteri de vaquas".
Chapter 42.
On the Cauterization of Pain in Two Places.
At times pain is in both places due to various causes, such as bruising or striking or excessive evacuation, and by causes similar to those, through the infusion of wet and humid matter.
And the cautery is not done except in this one species which is made by effusion of wet matter.
Therefore, it is good to evacuate the patient with pillules fitidas and similar ones that are made on both places where there is pain, three lines according to the latitude of him, plus one tenths in each line or more, depending on the quantity that comes from the tolerance of the patient and the virtue of him.
And make a cautery with pointed cauteries.
And if you wish, cauterize with three or four pointed cauteries in the middle of the joint according to this form:
Chapter 43.
On the Cauterization at the Beginning of Giltiness.
Many times this illness attacks little children; and the sign of its beginning in children is that it happens to their structure in the ear, with a sudden elevation and movement.
And you find it in the last cervical vertebra of the spine, and in the nodes of him that already begins to rise above the other vertebrae.
And then when you find this and want to prohibit it, then cauterize that with a circular cautery according to this form: which takes the cautery on all parts of the vertebra equally.
And if you wish, cauterize in the circle of the vertebra with pointed cauteries two or three lines. And be the points proper between them.
And then cure that place until it is healed with this which we have said.
But beware that cautery should not be administered in giltiness caused by spasms of nerves.
Chapter 44.
On the Cauterization of Gout and Joint Pain.
When joint pain is caused by wet humors that are poured into each member of the body, then when pains come in the feet, it is customary for doctors to call this gout properly.
And therefore when gout caused by wetness is cured by a method of cure and the pains are not relapsed, then relapse them with cautery.
And you cauterize that with evacuation in the circle of the joint of the foot, with many cauteries.
And be the olive-shaped cautery, the form of which is this:
And if it is necessary that points are made on the fascia of the foot, then make with a pointed cautery. And if the pains rise into the digits or to other joints, and this many times endures, then cauterize that on each digit with three or four cauteries of all parts with this olive-shaped cautery.
And if many cauteries are needed to produce this effect, then cauterize that and do not press too hard with your hand on the cautery, so as to be only about the thickness of a cord.
And if the pains rise into the finger and the toe, then administer the cautery which we have said in our chapter.
And if the pains are only in the toes and are called "suagra", then puncture in the circle of the phalanges as they revolve, puncturing those two lines.
And if the pains remain in the said toes, then puncture in the circle of the phalanges on each digit and on the tip of the finger.
And if the pains rise approximately after some days to the joints or muscles, then cauterize all of them on all parts of the aids.
And do not evacuate the patient from good regime and reception of medicines, for if it is made good regime and evacuation is done with this cautery, then the patient will be healed, God help.
Chapter 45.
On the Cauterization of Wounds.
When the wound occurs in the thighs and says that it is spreading the bladders before the navel to the belly, and this is beginning to approach, then it is good for you to order the patient to leave his diet for a day and to use lenient causes so that the wound may come out of his belly.
And then follow the patient between your fingers on his back, and command him to keep his arm bent until the orifice is made or the navel or bladders appear.
And then return that to the said digits and signal by attempting the rupture on the bone of the pelvis, signaling the extremity of which is similar to the half-circle of the upper parts of the body.
And then ignite the cautery of which this is the form:
until it is hot enough to produce sparks. And then reduce the navel or bladder to its natural curvature, and then pause your hand over the location so that the navel does not burst.
And you have already opened between the joints of the patient and left one joint paused, another serving on his thighs, and another on his feet, which has its own fingers.
And then pause the cautery over that sign with your hand having the cautery standing upright, and get that into the bone of the pelvis up to the middle of the duodenum; and repeat it in another way if you did not succeed in the first time getting into the bone.
And observe wisely the state of the navel at the time of your cautery, that you do not burn that navel so that it does not bring harm or great evil to the patient.
And know that when you are using the cautery, do not touch the bone, nor confirm your operation.
And it is good for children's cauteries to be subtle according to their great and small size.
And then cure the location of the cautery for three days with borders, so that the scar of fire is renewed.
And then cure that with other ointments until it is healed.
And the patient shall lie on his back for 40 days until the location and wound are sealed.
And it is good that you pause the nourishment of him according to the length of time for his cure, which stretches his belly, and that the navel does not burst forth under the effort of healing.
And then when it is time to lift after 40 days, then administer gradually decreasing power, and keep him that way for another 40 days.
And he should be weakened by labor and replenishment of food and drink, and of loud voices, for when he uses this regimen of healing, then it will be whole.
And I will say the cure for ruptures in other parts of the belly, and at the beginning, and you want them not to stop, then cauterize the rupture with that round cautery according to the quantity of it, and this is what is exhausted from the cord as well as the third part of it; and then cure that with what we have said, and do not adjust.
And already some first ones said that rupture should be cauterized with triangular cautery according to this form, since it is signified by attempt:
and it is a paused line that goes through the latitude in the latz plus above the rupture, and another line above; and place your hand with a pointed cautery, but the first cautery is lighter and better.
Chapter 46.
On the Cauterization of Twist.
When there is a pain in some members due to bruising or striking and the pain persists for a long time and does not conform to cure with medicines, then it is good that you cauterize with pointed cautery.
And be the cautery of every member according to its magnitude and smallness, virtue and faultiness, location of twist and pain of it.
Therefore, if it is healed by the first cautery, well; and otherwise, then repeat the cautery on him; for of those pains it is customary that they are punctured from one member to another which approaches it, so that you should achieve those with cautery until the patient is healed.
Chapter 47.
On the Cauterization of Leprosy.
Some lepers are cured with cautery by a great amount of benefit, and especially if the type of leprosy is caused by the putrefaction of phlegm and melancholy.
And therefore, when you want to cauterize that person, consider if the leprosy is common and has been cured with what we have said in the division and not denied, nor stayed, and fear for the patient that the corruption may comprehend all his body and all his composition, then cauterize that on the head with many cauteries: one in the middle of the head, and a second one further away from it, up to the end of the hair; and both above the two horns; and one behind, on the nape or neck.
And finally, your hand with the cautery a little bit to impress on the bone a small impression, and from there are dislocated the scabs, so that the exhalation of thick vapors is alleviated for him; and cauterize on the malleus according to what was previously said.
And if the leprosy is already spread out on the patient and appears manifestly, then it is good for you to cauterize him with those cauteries which we have said in the head; and with a cautery on the extremity of the nose, and two on both kneecaps, and two on both shoulder blades, and two on the vertebrae of the back, and six on the vertebrae of the neck, and two on each ankle, and two on each heel, and two on the tendons of his feet; and cauterize him on all the joints of his fingers and toes, and on every toe and heel, and on the phalanges of his fingers.
And beware of the nerves which are over the tendon that you do not burn those.
And sometimes it is cauterized with a cautery on the bone of the pelvis and another on the mouth of the stomach, and another on the liver.
And know that the more you adjust the cauteries, the more beneficial and conforming it is; and know that the patient has no pain in the cautery, just as they have in their skin, because his body is already stupified.
And it is good that the cauteries are great or small according to the members and joints, as it is preceded by the species of instruments.
And then cure the cautery with fine flour of ears coitus, mixed with honey and other remedy until it is healed.
Chapter 48.
On the Cauterization of Stupor.
When some member is stupified or asleep and is cured with medicines, oils, and plasters, but does not heal, then you should cauterize that stupified member with cauteries according to the greatness of the member or its smallness.
And be your cautery entering into the subtlety of the cord a little bit. And then cure that with ointment until it is healed.
And sometimes it is cauterized some stupor which occurs in the hands and feet, and on the vertebrae of the back, and then the sensation of the nerves that move that member is restored, and the stupor is renewed.
But do not presume on this unless you are wise in the anatomy of the members and the exit of nerves throughout the entire moving body.
Chapter 49.
On the Cauterization of Moles that are Morpheas.
When moles are old and do not conform to any of the ointments of medicine, then you should cauterize on them with a preconceived cautery a little bit according to the quantity of the subtlety of the cord until the whiteness and color of it are renewed, and the color of it is changed.
And then cure that with fine flour of ears and lentils mixed with rose oil and leaves of arnagrosa, and the blood of dove or the blood of yronda, each being one part and all being mixed together; and then bind a cloth and place it on the location until it is healed.
Chapter 50.
On the Cauterization of Crabs.
When a crab is beginning and you want to remove it, then cauterize that with a circular cautery in the circle of it as it is turned.
And the wise men said that it should be cauterized with the last cautery in the middle location; but I have not seen this, because I fear that it will be ulcerated, and I have already seen this some times.
And it is better to be cauterized in the circle of it with a circle as we have said, or with many cauteries.
Chapter 51.
On the Cauterization of Adulteries.
When some adulteries are delayed in maturity, and thus it is because of the superfluity making that one, or because of the state of the patient, which is old in decrepitude, with little blood, or because of time, and you want to hasten in the maturity of adulteries; then cauterize in the circle of it with many small punctured cauteries; and then leave that which will fasten in maturity.
But if you want the perforation of it with a cautery, then ignite the cautery which has this form; and place that in the middle location of the adulteries until it penetrates the cord.
And if the cautery in that location is more distant, because the body of the arm is alleviated; and then cure that until it is healed.
Chapter 52.
On the Cauterization of Corrosion.
Corrosion is corruption that walks in the member, which corrupts it as fire consumes dry wood.
Therefore, if you find that corrosion in a location where it tolerates a cautery with fire, then ignite small and great cauteries according to what is convenient in that location where the corrosion is.
And then cauterize all of it, from top to bottom, until you eradicate all the corrosion and there remains no cause of it.
And then leave that for three days, and pause over the locations cauterized with a gentle touch, mixed with oil, until all the scabs are eradicated and all corruption.
And then cure that with ointments of flesh-generating things.
But if after three days the flesh grows healthy in which there is no corruption, well; but if not, then repeat the cautery on that which remains in the corrupted locations.
And corrosion is cured with some times of acute medicine, because it is a medium in place of cautery. But nonetheless, a cautery with fire is of greater benefit.
And I have already said the cure for it with acute medicine in the division, and therefore take that when you will need it.
Chapter 53.
On the Cauterization of Claws and other similar things.
Sometimes there is a malady that appears as a claw, which is a great, inflamed cause that weighs down the foot; and cautery in those places is done according to two manners, either with fire or with hot water.
But the cautery with fire is to ignite the cautery, resembling a penitent's vulture, which is made of iron according to the quantity that contains the claw from all parts, and is of subtle edges.
And then pause that which is ignited over the claw, and then revolve your hand with the cautery in the circle of the claw until the cautery reaches the depth of the claw. And then leave that for three days until the arm begins to heal. And then apply an ointment to that with wild marshmallows crushed with salt, and leave the ointment on that for one night, because that will be eradicated from its roots.
And then cure the location with an ointment of flesh-generating things until it is healed.
And if it does not convert, and many times accidents occur on the surface of the body, mostly in the hands and feet, then it is good that you administer with cauteries of water; and this is to take a cannula made of iron or of a penitent's vulture, and place it on the claw; and then pour into the cannula some cold water, and stretch your hand, and you revolve that with compression from top to bottom, and press the margin of the cannula against the root of the claw, and let the cold water flow back to the point of the root; and wait for the patient a little while the mordication of the cold water for an hour, and then remove it, because the claw with its roots will be eradicated.
And thus do it to those places and apply the other remedy until you come to all those parts of their own in the body.
And then cure those places which are eradicated with the roots of the claws, with that of the ointments which make flesh grow.
Chapter 54.
On the Cauterization of Trembling.
When there is a trembling in some part due to irritation of the nerves or due to fever caused by irritability, or for other similar cause, then it is good that you cauterize that with four cauteries or five on the vertebrae of the back, between each vertebra an individual cautery; and also on the feet of it, and on the stomach of it, with olive cautery.
And then the trembling subsides and hastens the healthiness of the irritated disease.
Chapter 55.
On the Cauterization of Accidental Bleedings in the Body.
When in the body there are accidental bleedings and pustules that open up into wounds which are made of gross, corrupted matters; then it is good at first sight as appears, to be cauterized all over the head of the fistula with a subtle cautery made from myrtle wood, the extremity of which is extended by fire; or with the roots of long-lived estrogia; or with lentecular cautery.
And sometimes it is good to cauterize at the beginning of its expulsion according to this manner; and not to be believed, and thus the superfluity is dispelled from those things, and they are healed.
But nonetheless it is good that this should be done with proper evacuation by phlebotomy.
Chapter 56.
On the Cauterization of Accidental Bleeding from Incision of Archeria.
Many times there occurs bleeding from archeria which is caused by the wound that needs to be cut away, or by the incision of apostemes or cauteries of the member, and thus it resembles, and it is difficult to cure that.
Therefore, as it happens to some of these things, then you should take a piece of cloth with your hand and place it on the orifice of the archeria, and pause above that which I have said to strengthen that many times until the flow of blood is stopped by what I have said, and there be no more.
And then pause in the fire with olive cauteries, small and great, by number of moles, and blow upon them until they are quite ignited.
And then take from those one small or one great according to the location and wound in which the artery is broken, on that vein which hastens more than you will have restored what I have said, and place the cautery until it is abscinded and restrained that blood.
And if the blood is expelled from the orifice of the artery when you remove what I have said and extinguish the cautery, then take another cautery carefully from the cauteries which are prepared in the fire, and thus do not cease to do this again until the blood is restrained.
And beware that you do not burn the nerves which are here, and that another evil comes upon the patient.
And know that when blood flows from the artery, it is not possible to restrain the blood in those places, and especially when the artery is large, unless by one of four methods: or with a cautery as we have said, or with extraction when it is not extracted, because when it is extracted the extremities are burnt off and the blood is restrained, or that it be tied with a thread or with a ligament by strong constriction, or that certain medicines be applied to it which have the virtue of restraining the blood; and they should be strengthened with poultice and decent compression.
But he who administers decent restraint of it with ligature and constriction by means of cloths or through the position of causes that burn and resemble, does not conform except later.
But if this happens to someone and there is no doctor present or medicine, then take a pause from the indicated digit on the orifice of that vein as we have said, and understand by great constriction of it until the blood is stopped from the supreme part of the wound, and above the archery the same thing is not restored; and above the archery be sprinkled with cold water of very great coolness until the blood is congealed and thickened; and also consider in what there is need for a cautery or medicine.
On the Cutting and Piercing and Vents and Bloodletting and Wounds and their Likenesses.
We have already said in the first chapter about every disease in which cautery with fire is convenient and with medicine that burns, and the occasions and causes of it, and the instruments necessary in those places with the forms of the cauteries; and we have arranged the chapters of the subordination of the head down to the feet.
And you will proceed in this chapter by that same manner, so that it may be clarified for whoever desires this, as you have requested.
And before you begin this, it is good, son, that you learn that in this chapter, it is about the same thing as is in the first chapter of cautery.
And therefore it is necessary to be in great caution, for in the operation which is in this chapter many times blood evacuation occurs, which is with blood that contains life; and thus one must be cautious about the sprinkling of the vein or incision on the apostema or appearance of exiture or purgation of the wound or extraction of sagette or incision of peyra and their likenesses. And all those things are accompanied by fear and trembling, and in the most of them death.
And I warn you that over yourselves this should not fall, for sometimes the case requires methods of men with many methods of diseases. And among them are those who rush with their own disease and it is light for them to die, and thus because of the vehemence of what they find in their disease, and because of the length of their disease, and with their disease there is fear which means death.
And among them is one who gives to you his own breath and takes away from you, you hoping for health with him, and his disease is mortal.
And therefore it is not good that you consent to that which comes to you from whom this manner is; and your caution should be greater than covetousness and rapacity; and do not presume any cause about this except proper certain science which verifies what you know, and through which succession praiseable.
And use in the cure of all your diseases prophetic and indicative science, which is converted to health, for in that is help to you over the acquisition of fame and memory, praise and glory.
Oh, sons, God inspires in you His own understanding and does not withhold from you direction and protection, for this is in His hand.
And I have ordered this chapter distinct by chapters according to what preceded in the chapter of cauteries, from the cure of the head down to the feet, so that it may be alleviated for you that which you ask about and of which you have need.
Chapter One.
On the Cure of Water Contained in the Head of Children.
Know that this disease often occurs in children during the time of birth, and when the umbilical cord is tightly tied around the child's head.
And sometimes it occurs due to a hidden cause that is not known.
But I have never seen this disease except in children; and all those whom I have seen are on the verge of death, and therefore it is to me a pitiful sight.
And I have seen that a child whose head was filled with water, and his head was always magnificently expanded to the point where he could not even move on his own due to the greatness of his head, and more so that the humidity increased until it became mortal.
And this humidity either accumulates between the vertebrae and the bone, or accumulates behind the bone above the skull.
Therefore the operation in that case is to make an incision in the middle of the head with a fissure in the latitude, and the length of the fissure should be about two inches until the humidity flows, and this is the form of the spatula.
And therefore if the humidity is further increased and the apostema is greater, then there are two incisions according to this manner:
And if the humidity is behind the bone, then the sign of it is that you should press the commissures of the head on all sides and the water will be squeezed out when you compress that with your hand inwards and not to your surprise. It is good for you to make an incision in the middle of the head with three incisions according to this manner:
And then make an incision in the middle of the head with three incisions according to this manner: and appropriate extract all the humidity from the wound; and then strengthen the incisions with cloths and poultices; and then envelop it with a covering made of vinegar and oil within five days, and then untie the ligature and cure the wound with tentes and unguents, and strengthen the head with equality; and feed the patient with dry food of little humidity until the member is comforted and healed.
And there is another manner of incision, which considers how the magnitude of the apostema and the collection of water appear, for sometimes it appears more in the occiput, or in the front part, or on the right side, or on the left side; and therefore attend to the incision where the apostema appears and the accumulation of water is seen, and make it according to what seems best to you.
And observe that you do not cut the artery and thus blood flows and the patient dies from that flow of blood with evacuation of humidity.
Chapter Three.
When you find some catarrh or rash on the eyes or feet, and it is old, and there is no conformity in that with the cure of medicines, then the last resort in this case is to cut those two arteries.
And therefore when you want to cut those that the patient's head is filled with water, and then apply a rough cloth to the location where the arteries appear, and then strengthen the patient's neck with some cloth; and then consider which vein pulsates; and the locations of each one are on the locations which are near the ears, repressed, and only in some men.
And then take note on the artery with a probe, and then cut each one with the spatula of each part, sharp and incisive, entering into the bone, and this is so in the latitude of the head.
And if you wish, insert the spatula below the artery and cut it where it meets the incisions in the parts above.
And let the length of the incision be about two inches, so that when some vein is cut, the blood flows out with a pulsating efflux, which springs forth frequently.
But if the artery does not appear at the incision, then it is good that you measure from the ear the quantity of space of three inches, and then take note with a probe, and enter into the bone.
And as for how much blood to let out, it is about one pint. and not too little or too much, and all this is according to the quantity which appears of the virtue of the patient's disease and of the filling of the artery.
And then consider the wound, and therefore if there remains on the bone some cause of the skull, then cut away this part in order that the apostema may not become cauterized.
And then strengthen the wound with poultices and ligatures of linen cloth, and then cure it with unguents until it is healed.
Chapter Three.
On the Extraction of the Arteries which are in the Temples.
When an ancient or recent emigration occurs in the temples, due to old and humid climates and qualities of the lacertae des temples, or a violent and ancient heat similar to those, and it is medicated with the methods of cure of medicine and this does not conform, then we have resorted to these diseases by extracting the arteries in the temples, or cauterizing them as we have shown.
And the manner of the operation and extraction of those is that the patient feels the pulse which are in the temples; and understand the artery which appears on the temple, for it is shown to you by its pulsation, and is hidden except in a few men by the vehemence of heat.
And if it is hidden from you, then the patient's neck should be strengthened with some cloth; and then apply a rough cloth to the location or evaporate the location with hot water until the artery appears manifestly. And then take the spatula, of which this is the form: And then you should scrape the vertebra with that spatula with ease until you reach the artery; and then cut it at the point where it is bent and extract it from the upper parts until you remove it from the vertebra and discover those tunics which are below it, on all sides.
But if the artery is subtle, then envelop it with the tip of the spatula, and then incise one part of it according to the quantity by which the ends of it are lengthened and contracted, and there will be no bleeding, for if they are not cut off, the blood will not flow at all.
And then evacuate about one pint of blood. until three pints.
And if the artery is great, then it is good that you divide it into two parts with a double ligature of thread or with cords at length, and do not allow it to putrefy before the wound has consolidated and bleeding has ceased.
And then cut away the superfluity which is between two ligatures; and do this at that hour or shortly after.
And if you wish, cauterize that part with a cauterizer into the bone and with a cutlery cauterizer until the ends of it are cut off, and remain in place for that medley of work.
And it is better work if the patient has fever or is of a warm complexion; for cauterization is one of those causes that help to end humidity, and therefore it is better in youth.
And it is good to apply the extraction of arteries which fills the old wound, and be placed on the powder decently made, and then be cured with dry medicines that make the flesh appear and with some ointment until it is healed.
And if while you are working another time blood flows from the artery, then immediately stop that bleeding with a ligature, or with a cauterizer, or by filling the wound with a cloth, and strengthen your hand until the bleeding is stopped. And if no cause of those is present with you, then pause your hand on the location until the blood has coagulated, and envelop the location with hot water of vehement warmth, so that the sharpness may be stilled, and strengthen as needed.
And that which is easier in the extraction of arteries is that you cauterize the vein with this cauterizer having two sheaths, since you have marked the two locations with a probe, and then deposit each one, quietly, until they reach the bone and cut the vein in two places, so that what is between the ends of it may be lengthened, for they are not fully consolidated by this cauterization.
And this is the form of the cauterizer:
And the sharpness of the two sheaths are examples. But rather if the sharpness is less than two sheaths, it is better, for if they are sharp like two sheaths, close to each other, and do not cut into the flesh with velocity.
Therefore, as in those there is some thickness, the heat of the fire is kept in them and the flesh is cut away slightly.
And this work is better than all other works and more gentle.
And the space which is between two sheaths is the quantity of thickness of that digit.
Chapter Four.
On the Cure of Eyes with Acute and Acid Tears.
When the tears are acidic, and the body of those veins which are above the forehead is affected outside, and there is no conformity in this with any cause of medicine, and the face of the patient becomes reddened and he feels a wandering movement in his own forehead, as if it were a migration of ants, and the eyes of that person are exhausted, humidified to such an extent that their lids have become constricted, and the eyelids are scorched by the acidity of the tears, the ancient physicians used to mix certain medicines for this cure, and they called that cure "spassa".
And it is that you command the patient to scratch the skin which is on his forehead, and then cut three incisions equally distant from each other according to the length of the forehead. And if the length of the incision is about two inches: one incision shall be equally distant from the length of the nose in the middle of the forehead, and the second according to the length of a little movement of the lacertae which are in the lacrimal, and the third on the other side.
And beware of the cutting of the arteries which are in two sides, and lengthen your hand with the continuation of both jawbones. And if the space of each incision is about three inches adjusted.
And if you have a piece of sponge appareled or dry cloths, moderately moistened with which you can absorb the blood.
And then insert the spatula of two sharp ends, the form of which is as follows: which is from the temple to the second incision. Excise the entire cord which is between two incisions on the skullbone above the bone, and then make this way from the first incision to the second. And then strengthen the spatula and insert it into the first incision another time with a different instrument which is called a cutellar, sharp on one side and not sharp on the other.
And pause the edge of that instrument so that it cuts through the flesh and cord, and then insert it into the bone so that it reaches the middle incision, and cut away with it all the vessels that descend from the head to the eyes.
But then continue the incision up to where the cord appears, and then make it so in the middle incision into the other incision.
And when a quantity of blood equal to that amount is released, press the places where the coagulated blood has collected.
And then pause in each incision, allowing the cut to close like a old wound, and pause over those powders impregnated with vinegar and oil and vinegar, so that no cauterized apostema may appear.
And on the third day, untie the ligature and administer a great abundance of hot water or tea, and then cure it with an ointment of basilicum and rose oil and others until the wounds are healed.
Chapter Five.
On the Cure of Tears through Catarrh and descending to the eyes from the partitions behind the head.
When there is acute catarrh and continued flowing, and the patient's eyes are exhausted and small, and their gaze is weakened, and the eyelids are ulcerated and their skin is raw, and in the forehead of the head there is a sharp pain and subsequent exhaustion, then you should know through these accidents that the matters and catarrh come from many veins proceeding from behind.
And the best cure for those is this: that you command the patient to scratch his forehead, and then cut a incision in the middle of the forehead, a little distance apart (and it begins with the incision of the left temple to the right temple; and be an incision into the bone; and lengthen your hand from the lacertae of the temples which are most suitable for mastigacio), until the bone is revealed.
Dry out all the blood with sponge or dry cloth and then fill it between the two lips of the incision with an old wound or with cloths tied. And then strengthen above with powders impregnated with vinegar and oil, so that no cauterized apostema may appear.
And when you see that the apostema has diminished, then it is good to apply heat to the bone until it begins to produce flesh, and then cure it with an exsicative regimen which makes the flesh appear, just as if you take two parts of wheat flour and four parts of colophonium, and mix them together, and from that make a poultice and administer it to these wounds for the nativity of the flesh.
Chapter Six.
On the Cure of that which Catarrhs in the Ears.
All causes that catarrh in the ears are one of four species, for it is either mineral pyre or a similar cause like iron and vinegar, or it is from plants like cheese or fava, or it is a fluxible cause like hot water and vinegar and their likenesses, or some animal.
And therefore when pyre catarrh in the ear or another similar cause from those causes that do not adjust nor believe in the ear, and pause the ear at the sun, and if times the pyre, then it is good to distill some cause of violet oil or size, and then administer the extraction of it, and make the nose run with conditions, and stop up the nostrils by the happening of sneezing. And then pause in the circuit of the ear some pieces of cloth or wool, and stretch the ear to the upper parts, for many times it is forgotten with these causes.
And if it is not gotten, then it is good to administer the extraction of it with the instrument called "epicicario" which has a subtle shape.
And if it is forgotten with the instrument, then it is good; and otherwise, it is good to administer the extraction of it with a subtle bone of slight duplication.
And therefore if it is not forgotten for this, then it is good to make a needle of iron and insert the tip of the needle into the ear canal and close around the needle with wax and softened oil so that only the needle remains. And then extract with your breath a strong attraction, for many times as we have recounted.
But if it is not forgotten in this manner, then it is good to take a piece of burnt bark or a prepared wickerwork with which the birds are caught and having taken a small quantity, place it at the end of the ray, and then wrap around it decently placed. And then insert that into the ear canal with ease, and then dry out the ear of its humidity.
And therefore if it is not forgotten with all the causes that we have recounted, then you should stop cutting before it becomes cauterized or spasmed.
And the manner of cutting is that you first bleed the patient from the saphenous vein and extract the blood according to the virtue of it, and then make it cease between your hands and convert the ear into the upper parts, and finally make a small incision in the root of the ear just above the grey hairs of it. And then make the incision of lunar shape until it reaches the pyre, and when the pyre is blackened, stop that if you can with proper instruments; and then close the incision in that hour with speed, and cure it so that it may be healed.
And if the cause that catarrhs in the ear is one of those fats that believe and are inflated, then it is good to administer the cure and extraction of it; but if it does not obey your attention, then you should take a spatula of fine steel according to this form: and administer with that the removal of that fat which is catarrhs in the ear.
And do not do this when you think that it is already moistened by the vapor of the ear, and pause it in many pieces, and then extract from those with the onces or subtle gestures, or with incision as we have said, for it is alleviated the extraction of it.
But in the water which is entered into the ear, it is good for the patient to use sneezing with conditions at first, and fill his own ear with a little old cloth, and then pour over that ear where there is water, and if by this it is forgotten, it is good; otherwise, you should take many hot irons and lemons according to the length of the digit, and burn those in the fire for a while, and have the patient insert one of those into his own ear canal and beat with another iron on the iron which is behind the ear. So do not cease doing this with pyre until all the water is forgotten.
So do not cease doing this with pyre until all the water is forgotten. And then the water will be forgotten in such a way that you take from paper or cotton gauze. and put one end of it into the ear and stretch the other end with fire until the tip of it is burned.
And then put in another gauze and make it so many times until all the water is forgotten, and stretch that with a needle as described above of the extracting pyre.
But in the extraction of beast that enters into that ear, if it is small, thus push and pull similar to the sound, cure that as we have said in the division; but if it is from a great body which appears on the side of the vessel, then it is good to administer the extraction of it with gestures and onces, and the cause of it is less severe than all the other causes that catarrhs in the ear.
But in the extraction of worm generated in the ear, when you cure that with the water that we have said in the division and in the treatise on distillations and do not confirm your cure, then it is good to look at the ear towards the sun.
And therefore if any cause of worms appears here, then you should extract that with gestures or subtle onces; but if no cause appears, then you should take a needle that is straight and wide from which this is the form: And insert the subtle tip into the ear according to the quantity which can be borne by the patient; and then suck it out with a strong suction, and make this many times, until all the worms are forgotten.
But if it does not obey your attention, then you should stop and close the circuit of the needle with wax as we have said; and then administer distillations which have already been tried by the ancients in the cure of worms, and find this in the treatise on distillations.
And then your effusion with which you pour the medicinal oils into the ear with this instrument of which this is the form: And make that of silver or of iron, straight, with a small hole, and on top.
And therefore so it is when you need to extract what is in the cavity of the needle's continuation here where it will be necessary. And if you wish, take the thread and wrap it around the tip of the needle decently and tightly, and then pour oil into the cavity of the ascending, or juice from some herb, or whatever you want from these medicines in the needle — and that is in the ear —, and then insert the thread with a knot above and express with your hand that on gentle compression of it so that the oil is expelled into the cavity of the ascending and the patient feels the oil outside.
And what is inserted into the ear is already scorched with fire for a little while. And be careful that the cause which you will distill into the ear is not too hot, for the medicines of the ear do not tolerate this.
Chapter VII.
On the Cure of Ear Plugging.
Some times some children or even adults have a blockage in the ear canal due to a wound or flesh that is not perforated; and this blockage sometimes occurs in the inner ear or in the outer parts.
And that which occurs in the inner part of it, which does not comprehend the vessel, is in the greatest difficulties for difficult healing.
And in that which you succeed in comprehending the vessel, it is good to pause the ear of the patient in the sun and look at it. And therefore if you see obvious opilation, open that with a fine spatula of which this is the form:
If the tip of it is in the ear canal where there is a small distance, with one side being sharp and the other not; and the spatula has two lion-shaped sides so that it does not cause irritation to the ear.
And therefore if the blockage is due to flesh born in the ear or in the ear canal, then you should cut it with subtle onces and incise that with great ease until all the flesh is removed.
And if the blockage is in the inner part of the ear, then you should take a subtle thread of lion and heat it with fire for a little while, and then insert that into the ear canal.
And therefore if you have sensed blockage with that which the patient experiences with ease, due to the weight of having heard, try to relieve the oppression of it with ease; and be careful not to harm the nerves of the ear.
And then pause in the ear with cloth of linen according to the quantity of the width of the canal which you have wrapped with Egyptian ointment; and make this for several days until you are sure of the consolidation of the wound; or take some vinegar and soak it in water and powderize over it, and use it; and if the ear is already cauterized, then it is good to remove the vinegar and replace it with another vinegar which you have wrapped in wax that is made with rose oil, until the cauterized apostema yields; and then cure that until it is healed.
But if there is bleeding, then submerge a sponge or cloth in hot water and pause it over the ear, and use another cure which restricts the flow of blood, as described in the treatise on distillation.
Chapter VIII.
On the Cure of Athazil which affects the Eyelids.
Athazils which affect the eyelids of humans sometimes become moist, and at other times they are dry.
Therefore it is good that you take those with needles or onces, and incise them with an instrument from their roots, and then pause over the places as described.
But if pain and bleeding come, then you should cauterize those with a thin lunar cauterizer.
And the best cauterization is when you insert it into the incisions and many times return, as long as there remains some cause of their roots; and when they are cauterized with fire, those roots are burned and do not return.
Chapter IX.
Cure of Grandeyssa which comes to the Eyelids of Humans.
Many times it grows on the eyelids of humans some cause which is assembled with grandeyssa in its strength and hardness, and therefore grandeyssa is called.
And it is an accumulation of thick moisture on the eyelid below and above.
Therefore the operation on them is that you consider whether the grandeyssa is proceeding from there in what appears from the eyelid and is spread to all parts; and the cause of it is light.
Therefore proceed with an incision by the distance, and then search out that part from all parts with ease until it evacuates, and then suspend that with a needle and excise it.
And if the figure is great, then you should adjust it with a suture; and cure that until it is healed.
And if it is slight, you will not suffer harm from it, because the ointment of it restores that and fleshens.
And if the grandeyssa is declining to the outer parts of the eyelid, then you should smooth out the surface outwardly; and then elevate the eyelid and suspend the grandeyssa with a needle, unless you need an incision, and press that from all parts; and if the eyelid by incision is lengthened, this is not noted in any cause.
And then, with the incision, wash the eyes with salt water; and cure the place with that which fleshens until it is healed.
Chapter X.
On the Cure of Axirnah in the Eyelid above the Eye.
Axcirnah is a grayish thing which is generated in the tunics of the eyelid above, and mainly affects children, aggravates their eyes, and causes great harm to them; and they cannot gaze at the brightness of the sun because of it, so that tears are shed upon them.
And so you will have them weep constantly on their faces, and sleep on their faces; and thus the eyelids of theirs below are overcast with moistened lids, which already has swelling, and apparent danger is in the eye; and when you press the place with those words, you will cause harm within them.
And one manner of operation is that the patient places their own head on the bed, and then pauses a cloth of linen and of water to make a poultice, and makes from it a circle according to the quantity which contains arthernach from all parts; and then pauses that over that and presses with the words of totality so that harm is aggregated in the middle of the circle; and then proceeds in the middle of that moisture with an instrument inserted into a slit by the distance, and the slit should not be greater than the slit made in flabotomia.
But in the forefront it is good that you cut the cord entire until you reach arthernach, for in the greatest dispositions, arthernach proceeds by slit according to the form of white greasiness.
Therefore extract that with cloths which you have wrapped between the words of totality to the outer parts, and revolve between your right and left hand until it is scattered.
And be careful not to insert in the slit because you may reach the eye with the instrument and damage that.
But if there is no arthernach at the beginning of the slit, then adjust the slit a little with ease so that arthernach may proceed; and then extract that as we have said; and then submerge cloths in water, vinegar, and salt, and pause them over the place and strengthen those with powders.
And then some that trickle salt and pause it in the cavity of the slit, because this which remains of that humidity.
And then cure that until it is healed.
But if there is a cauterized apostema in the place, then cure that with soft poultices until it is healed.
Chapter XI.
On Manners of Touching the Eye.
When in the eyelids of humans there are knots, you should adjust those below with natural skin and thus make them old, then those above do not touch the eye and cause habits of illnesses such as constant tears and softening of eyelids and flesh until this becomes a cause of destruction of the eye which is called touching the eye, and cure it in four ways: or by cauterization with fire; or with sharp medicine according to what was said before in the chapter on cauterization; or by making an incision and suture; or through canals as I will say.
And therefore it is good that you pause the head of the patient on the bed; then turn the eyelid of the eye with your left hand, and if it has turned, well it is; and otherwise, insert a needle into that in which there is a fold of the part more below than the eyelid, and make the needle penetrate through the fold above, and thus be - near the edge of the eyelid where there are hairs - next to the hairs, and pull the thread up to the parts above with the eyelid, and turn it with the thread.
And then proceed in the outer part of the eyelid below the hairs adjusted with an instrument inserted into the lacrimal major canal until the lacrimal gland; and then extract the thread and pause below the eyelid with small powders of cotton or cloth, and then sign over the eyelid with a tent, and be like a figure of mirt leaves.
But meanwhile it is good that the figure should be according to the quantity of swelling of the eyelid, for this already varies among men, because some of them need to have a great amount incised from the eyelid in proportion to the amount by which the eyelid is softened.
And then proceed with the instrument over the two lines which you have marked, and begin from the lacrimal major canal into the lacrimal minor canal. And if your slit is as wide as the natural hairs, like it is the greatest thickness of a king.
And then put the needle in one of the two angles of the cord, and then excise it entirely, and then adjust with a suture the two lips with a subtle gullet or thread, and cleanse the wound, and make adhere what superfluous threads there are on top of two eyelids with some causes visible; if you want to do so, and otherwise, do not cure.
And then loosen the suture of the threads within three or four days, and then cure that.
And if you wish, leave the wound without suture and cure it with that which dries and tightens, for the eyelid is raised by the sealing of the wound and the accumulation of fluid; but suture is better. Therefore thus I say to those who are old in taxinir.
But meanwhile on him there is solicitude for the patient, and it is of good operation, and not in his fear.
And there is another manner in taxinir, and it is that you mark on the eyelid a figure like mirt leaves, and then raise the eyelid with three threads separated and gathered according to this form:
But if it is not possible to do so, having the threads, and this is not equivalent, then take a needle with thread and insert that in the middle of the figure, and then proceed with the other thread near the lacrimal major, and the second thread near the lacrimal minor, and adjust between the words of totality the threads with equality, and then lift your hand with equal lifting, lift the entire cord above which is marked as we have recounted.
And then adjust the two lips of the wound with a suture, and cure that until it is healed.
But if there is an apostema caused by your incision or slit, settle that apostema with cerote and lukewarm water, and with ointments.
And some times it grows on the eyelid where their own hairs are converted, then it is good that you use in that of what we have said about incision; but suture in each case is more artificial.
Taxinir by canals is according to this form: And it is that you convert the eyelid and cut the figure which is below according to what I have recounted; and then by art make two canals or two thin staves from which the length is according to the length of the eyelid and the width of their width is less than the width of the instrument. And you have already incised at the extremities of each partition, where you have the threads.
And then gather each one with subtlety over what superfluous of the eyelid of the eye, and tighten the canals of each partition with a strong constriction, and leave it for some days, because the cord will die and be rejected and will settle in until it falls into place.
But if it is delayed, then tear the cord apart with forceps, and then cure the wound until it is healed.
Therefore when it is solidified, the eyelid is raised and the hairs do not sting.
And this is the form of two canals which you will make according to this form: and have the quantity of length and width neither more nor less.
Chapter XII.
On the Elevation of Stinging Hairs in the Eye with a Needle when the Hair is Hard.
When the hairs are unnatural, hard, and sharp, and sting the eyes, the operation in that is that you take a subtle needle and insert it into that thread of cedar and lion, and then adjust the extremities of it and note each one in a manner very subtle. And be the length of the threads of the quantity of one palm.
And then you compose another subtle thread below it in brief, and tie the extremities of that if you wish.
And then place the patient's head on the bed, and be near the sun so that your work may be declared, for it is a subtle and delicate operation.
And then insert the needle into the root of the hair adjusted to which it has been necessary to apply art, and make that penetrate into the eyelid quickly until you extract that above the natural hair.
And then pull out the hair above and insert it into its place, and be the hairs one, two, or three, but not more.
And then pull out your hand with that until the hair is extricated and settled into its place in the eyelid with the natural hair.
But if it is attracted to the eyelid and not extracted the hair, you will attract the eyelid to the parts below with the thread which you have composed with that, until in it is extracted from the upper part of the brow.
And behold that with the vision of the eye, for then you will extract the eyelid and the thread, and gently pluck out each and every one of them from the eye, and leave the closures for two or three days, until the hair adheres to its place and grows over it good flesh.
And if the hair is shorter, then you will adjust one long hair from the natural hairs, and it is elevated with that, or so that it leaves space until it becomes long again, and then you will elevate that.
Chapter XIII.
On the Cure for Cataract Which Appears in the Eyelid Above.
When cataract appears in the eye, and it is contraction of the eyelid when it is constricted above or on one side or the other, due to bad consolidation of wound or section or cauterization, and it is called leporina, and this cataract either is natural or accidental, and it is caused by consolidation of wound or sections or cauterizations, or by likenesses to their maladies.
The manner of the operation in that is that you will cut through that consolidation and separate the lips of it, and insert a piece of linen cloth between them, and tie those together until they are healed.
And it is not good that you use any cure of it from the causes which dry up and constrict; for if you do so, it will return to be worse than ever before, without any hope.
Use in that of causes which soften like fenugreek, and steep it in hot water where coriander is grown and sown with linseed, or a poultice of aquilon, which is liquefied with some oil, and submerge the cloth in that, and cure with that.
And the treasure of your cure is that you perforate it with all art, and not be consolidated according to the form in which it began.
And this operation which we have said, is nothing but some correction of cataract that does not return to its original form as it was before.
Chapter XIV.
On the Cure for Cataract Which is Done in the Eyelid Below.
This cataract which is made in the eyelid below, which is truly called vertadierament cataract; and it is of some natural origin, or other accidental.
But accidental is made by wound or section or cauterization or by other likenesses.
And the way of the operation for that is that you take a needle with double thread, and insert it into the flesh, and make it pass from the left lacrimal to the right lacrimal, until the thread reaches the two extremities of the flesh.
And then stretch the flesh to the upper parts with the needle and cut it with the needle, and insert it into an instrument of broad width. And therefore if the figure of the eyelid returns as it should, good is; and otherwise, take the thread and place that in the cleft figure, and with that convert the eyelid, and close the two slits on the side of the eyelid below.
And be the extremities of the two slits at two angles of the incision, which you have made until they converge, and be of their own made angle, so that when they come together, a figure is formed from them.
And this figure is the Greek letter: lambda (λ).
And then place the flesh so that it covers the quantity that is the edge of the eyelid below, which is the shape of the eyelid.
And then adjust the separated parts and sew them together with the thread of wool; and then cure those with what we have said about soothing medicines and poultices, until it is healed.
And if the cataract develops through a fissure or suture or cauterization, then it is good that you make an incision with a flat opening on the hairs of the eyelid as it has preceded. And then separate with a poultice between two lips, according to what we have said.
In the summary of the sermon on the cure for cataract when it is above or below, that runs in its operation, according to what is prepared in the form of cataract, and that is in a form of diverse variations.
And the skilled craftsmen always prepare art in any way possible for each operation to bring back the figure to its natural form or close to it, and that patient according to what is convenient for him with regard to the operation and instruments in the best dispositions.
Chapter XV.
On the Adhesion of the Eyelid to the Conjunctiva or to the Cornea.
When this adhesion occurs in many men, it is necessary to solidify the eyelid above the white of the eye, and to prohibit its natural movements and works, therefore it is good that you insert the extremity of the thread below the eyelid, and lift it up or stretch it with the uncles.
And then you will insert the adhesion with a subtle instrument, which is not sharp as cuts, having obtuse a little so that the patient may not be disturbed during the operation, and leave the instrument so that it does not touch the eye with its sharpness.
And be your incision such that it excises that adhesion with ease, so that the eyelid may return to its natural form and all the adhesion may be healed.
And then you put into the eye salty water with which you wash it, or distill in it a solution dissolved in water.
And then separate between the eyelid and the eye with a poultice of linen, and place it over the eye infused in white of egg, and then use for three days causes that consolidate until it is healed.
Chapter XVI.
On the Incision of the Eyelash and the Eminence of Flesh of the Lacrimal Glands.
Know that the eyelash is according to two manners, because either it is nervous, and is similar to a hard, subtle cypress; or it is non-nervous, similar to white condensed humidity, which when it comes into contact with iron, takes on a dryness, and the eyelash is cut off and the needle is not fixed in place.
And both species do not begin until the lacrimal gland, which gradually grows smaller as it covers the vision and prohibits the light and movement of the eye.
But the manner of working in this incision is that the patient places his head on the bed, and then opens his eyes, lifts the eyelid with your hand, and carefully collects the eyelash with a needle of gentle doubling and stretches it to the upper parts. And then take a needle and insert into it a piece of horse or ox or cow hair, or something similar, or a strong thread, or double the extremity of the needle little by little and place it in the middle of the eyelash, and penetrate that with the needle, and tie the eyelash to the thread; and stretch that to the upper parts, and excise on the side of the eyelash which touches the pupil. And then you will follow it with the hair until the end of it.
And then you will insert the remaining part into the root of the lacrimal gland with a subtle instrument or small scissors, and loosen the natural flesh of the lacrimal gland so that through this incision there may not be continuous flows of tears.
And sometimes the eyelash with its extended or tied needle is thus, as we have said, and then it should be excised with a lion-shaped instrument, which has this form:
And beware that in the instrument you do not touch the tunic of the cornea and cause a rupture, and that the pupil is pierced.
And then the incision should be left in the eye for a few days or until a white crust forms, and let that remain until the next day; and then cure it with water as is necessary, until it is healed.
And if the eyelash is not nervous and you cannot insert the needle, nor is it fixed in that place with the thread, then many times this species of eyelash is cured by medicines, and is healed just like yeast and recounted in the division.
And if you want to excise it, then you will operate on the eye of the patient and take a subtle instrument, lion-shaped, with acute precision, according to this form: with subtlety. And if sometimes it is rarefied and is confused and enters into the root, then you will distill from your eye a white crust or a grayish-gray crust or a crushed salt, and stop up the eye until the next day.
And then repeat the operation on that until everything is removed from it, unless a contrary aposteme catches in the eye, because then you will leave it alone, and cure the aposteme at first until it is healed.
And then repeat your operation on that with reason, until it is healed.
The eminence of the lacrimal flesh, if noticed in the eye for great harm, should be suspended by thread; and excise that part from it, and do not finish the incision so that you may not cut off flows of tears.
And then distill into the lacrimal grayish-gray crust or white crust, until it is healed.
Chapter XVII.
On the Incision of Algae and Water that is Born from Flesh Adjusted in the Eye.
Sometimes in some eyes is born red flesh, and it is superimposed until it covers the pupil, or approaches or stretches over the eyelids and strongly compresses the eyelids to the parts above and is assembled like the rose of a balcony.
But the operation in this case is that the patient places his head on the bed; and then opens the eyes of that place and collects all that flesh with suitable needles and threads; and then excises the flesh at the beginning until everything is finished with the scissors, and beware of the eye that you do not touch it with your operation.
And be your incision with which you excise those or with the instrument which we have recounted in the incision of the eyelash, or with small scissors with which it is gathered in such a way that the form of it comes to this chapter.
Therefore, when your incision is complete and all that flesh is removed, then fill the eye with crushed salt, or distill into it red powder resembling it to the corrosive medicines, and place on the eye outside a cloth soaked in white of egg until you are assured that there will be no aposteme.
And if there remains any cause of algae and it is covered with a scar, and you fear an aposteme, then leave the eye alone and cure that aposteme with water which will heal that aposteme, and then repeat the operation on that until it is healed, and similarly do in the flesh adjusted which occurs in the eye of this species.
But still you must be careful to alienate all cure of the eye by natural or accidental means, working with iron, and not place your hand in any of these operations until you see that member is sufficient for that operation.
Chapter XVIII.
On the Collection of Sabellum in the Eye.
Sabellum is a red vein which runs through the eye and prohibits its normal operation, and by its length it reveals the eye's days.
Therefore, it is necessary at the beginning that you consider whether the eye in which there is sabellum is strong and does not have another disease besides sabellum, then you will collect that sabellum.
And it is that you command the patient to place his head on the bed, and then suspend those veins with one thread or two according to your prudence; and let that thread be of subtle doubling according to this form:
or two threads gradually in one case, according to this form:
And then are collected those veins with subtle forces, with subtlety, and wash away the blood hour by hour, until you see those veins to be removed from the eye and turned around.
And beware that you do not touch the eye with the extremities of the instrument; and if your operation is in the middle of the day before the sun, and be very firm in your operation that you only excise those veins.
And when you have completed, then you will distill into the eye green or red powder so that with its acute corrosion it may dissolve the water that is removed from the sabellum.
But if it is not possible for you to collect all in that hour, then gather as much as you can and plaster the whole with water that relieves the pain of it, and leave it for a few days until the pain is assuaged and there is assurance of no aposteme.
And then repeat the operation on that according to the same manner until it is healed.
And this is the form of the scissors:
Chapter XIX.
On the Reduction of Swellings at the Nose.
When you cure swellings with cauterization or sharp medicine, and they do not heal as told, then there is no need for further intervention in that place, but rather you should cut into the aposteme until its maturity, and extract all the moisture which is in it and drain it so that the bone may be revealed.
And therefore, when the bone is revealed and corruption or blackness appears in it, then you will rasp it with an instrument of which this is the form:
And it is called "aspre cap", and it is made of iron, and its head is rounded like that which is made pointed by a file or an emery wheel in a subtle point (such as shown in the following form).
And place that on the corroded part of the bone, and then turn it between those two fingers, and press your hand gently, little by little, until you know that that corruption is removed.
And so it will be done some times, and then restore the place with causes of drying and tightening.
Therefore, if the place is consolidated and good flesh has grown in it, and the body of the sickness has been removed and remains for 40 days, and is not renewed or apostemated, nor does any accident occur there, then you will know that it is healed.
And if not, then it is not in that place to intervene, but rather to reduce the fissure to the form of the nose, and according to this manner: and it is that you uncover the second bone with iron or sharp medicine, and when the bone is uncovered, then you take a thread according to this form:
Be the extremity of the iron triangular, and the shaft of it be first thinned out to the extremity in such a way that it is as if it were worn away.
And then place that on the bone, and it should be right next to the lacrimal; and stretch your hand a little bit from the eye, and then turn your hand with the thread in such a way that it penetrates all the bone, and he feels the patient by pushing with his hand as if he were looking out through that when he takes his hand away.
Therefore, then restore the place with drying and tightening medicines in such a way that they will be suitable for your patient.
Therefore, when the flesh and the place are hardened, then the material which was flowing to the parts above returns to the nose, therefore that is easier on the patient.
Chapter XX.
On the Reduction of the Eminence of the Eye.
When the eye protrudes entirely and does not cause harm or diminution in the vicinity, then you must loosen the patient, and then follow, and then pause for breaths in the neck without scarification and with good suction; and then place a poultice on the eye made of equal parts of safflower, aloe, and sarcocolla, and then strengthen the plaster over the eye with many powders.
And the manner of the powders is that you take cloths of lion's mane many times, and each cloth be folded in four pieces; and make powder from those.
And then place those one on top of another according to the quantity that the eye needs. And then strengthen over those with a strong, tight cloth; and repeat the suction without scarification; and then stop the suction and leave the eye straight for a day and night.
But if in the meantime the ligament is relaxed, then it is necessary to be very strict.
And then stop the ligament for a day and night just as we have said.
And if the eye has already been reduced, then it is good; and if not, then you must repeat the plaster with powders, tightness, and suction until it is healed.
Chapter XXI.
On the Incision of the Eminence of the Uveal Tunic.
When the uveal tunic becomes disrupted and there is an eminence that proceeds outside the eyelids like a grain of raisin, and it is rounded in shape like a human being by this, and you want to excise it, then the operation on it is as we have recounted, where you introduce the needle into the root of the uvea from the lower part and another needle into the double thread from the lacrimal side, and make that thread penetrate and leave the first needle according to its disposition; and then excise the location of the double thread and lift up with it the part of the uvea in the circuit of the needle, and strengthen that motion.
And then extract the needle and place on the eye wool infused in white of egg, and leave it until the thread comes out with the uvea.
And then cure the eye with water that comforts it until the wound is healed.
And sometimes gather all parts together with a circle of cloth into the eye, and then it is pierced with a subtle instrument that comes to the forepart of the eye, and flows the humor of the cornea, and descends the eye and enters soon.
And then strengthen until it is healed.
Chapter XXII.
On the Cure of Alconati.
This disease which is called Alconati is nothing but a humor that is settled in the eye, similar to water descending and not that.
But the manner of operating on it is that you make the patient sit on a prepared and straight bed, and then take his head in your hands on both sides, and lift him up until you see the humor coming out from the parts above, and then dry it and not let it flow down, and stop the light, and the patient sees the causes just as he sees.
And if it does not flow down below, you will know that it is water.
But if the descent of the humor is not prepared with the water as we have said, then make the patient sit between your hands and take a subtle instrument and find it on the panniculus cerning a little of the continuation of the conjunctiva with the tunic of the cornea in the crown (into that place where you see), until the humor is forgotten.
Therefore, when it is forgotten, then you will distill into the eye cold water in which you have mixed honey or water in which you have boiled fenugreek and honey.
And then be cured by the other causes until it is healed.
Chapter XXIII.
On the Cure of the Water Descending from the Eye.
We have already said the species of water in the division and which is suitable to pierce with the instrument declaring the word, then that one according to health.
Then it is necessary for you to make the patient sit between your hands on a chair and bind his head with a cloth, tight and strong.
And then place your left hand near the eyelid of the patient's eye on which is the water, if it is the left eye; or with your right hand, if it is the right eye.
And then with your right hand take almonds, if the eye is left; or with your left hand, if it is right.
And then place the extremity of the almond near the crown for the thickness of the rim in the album of the eye from the smaller lacrimal part, and then press the almond with virtue and turn your hand with it.
And then penetrate into the album of the eye and feel that the almond has already reached the seen cause.
And it is necessary that the measure of the path of the almond to the fore part be the measure of the space which is from the pupil to the end of the blackness, and it is the crown of the eye; for you will see with that pupil through the vision of the eye by the clarity of the tunic of the cornea.
And then place the almond in the location where is the water, and then attract it down once or twice, and therefore if the water descends soon, then see the patient on which his vision will be restored soon, and the almond in his eye.
And then rest for a moment; therefore if the water has descended, then you will remove that other almond before it is thrown away.
And therefore when it is dry and does not descend, then you will extract the almond with ease, and turn your hand with it little by little, and then dissolve a small amount of clear gemstone salt in that water and wash the eye inward; and then pause outside the eye with a cloth or stopper or wool infused in rose oil and egg white, and bind the eye with water.
But we will use those of our time that are passed on to us with an album of egg white.
And if it does not obey your almond at the instrument of the eye because of its hardness - for there are some men whose eyes are very hard - then you must take the instrument which is called "alberid" and this is its form:
And then pierce with that instrument the conjunctiva, and do not keep your hand in the wound, but rather make a way for the almond to reach a subtle location.
And then insert the almond as we have said.
And the completion of your work, prepare the patient for a sleeping descent made in the dark house where he will sleep on his back with no movements whatsoever.
And pause in the nature of it so that his nature is aligned, and not move his head to the right or left at all.
And let the ligature be according to its disposition within three days.
And then loosen that in the dark house and uncover the fresh sight, and make it see some causes, and then return to the ligature within seven days.
And do not need to do that at the hour of medications or soon after infusion. They had told you to abandon this because the water flows more lightly through great and fervent contemplation.
But if an aposteme appears cautiously, then you must remove the eye before the seventh day and correct it with water that dissolves the aposteme.
Then you absolve the sight of him and pause on his face near the orifice by which it is governed for some days, existing in the darkest darkness.
And then be guided gradually from that darkness and converse with his own causes.
And know that in alchemy there is no excuse for the disciple to see some things at times, and then you will be bold on the operation.
And already it has been passed on to us by some of those who are at the Artach, and some said that it makes fire in the Ayrrac, greatly perforated, through which the water is sucked.
But meanwhile, I have not seen this done in our land which has perfected that, nor read it in some of the books of the ancients; and it is possible that this is new.
And these are the forms of the species of magnesia, by which one is above those who do not know them:
And they are made of iron or bronze properly, and they are the extremities of their own magnesia with this subtlety triangularly, the sharp end thus as it is the form.
Chapter XXIV.
On the Cure of Cured Meat in the Nose.
When in the nose there are born various meats diversified of which some cause is assembled to that of Scorpio's weight or to Polyp's flesh; and this disease is called Polypus because it resembles that flesh represented. And from there is a cancerous meat, pale and of a dark color; and then it is that the lion's flesh is not of a dark color.
Therefore, in that which is not fraudulent nor cancerous, it is necessary to make the patient sit between your hands and place him in the sun, and anoint his nose with that meat. And then extract that to the parts above, and then incise it with the sharp instrument of one side into the part where you know that all the meat has been removed; if there remains any cause from which ablation is possible, then you must ratify that with one of the subtle instruments with ease until no cause remains. But if the patient's wound is septic or an apostema appears cautiously, then you must pause and apply that which is necessary; or if it is one of the malignant apostemas, then you must cauterize and cut out that part until the wound is abscessed and all cavities are removed.
And then be guided in the nose, approaching the incision with water or oil. But if the nose is swollen and there is moisture proceeding from it into the palate, then you will know that it has already been cured.
But if the moisture does not penetrate as it should, then you will know that there is no meat in the nose above the bones of the nostrils to which the ablation has not been performed.
Therefore, it is necessary that you insert the faithful one into the place where there is some thickening, and nuzzle in each notch the quantity of said or minus, and pause between each notch the quantity of said or minus, and guide the patient and insert one end of the faithful one into the nose with the ray or with another cause which is possible to it.
And after this has been done, that the patient's odorant is attracted into the canals of the nose, and be extracted on his gullet, because many times the same thing seems to happen at school, and it is a light cause for one who wants to do so.
And then pause the two extremities of the faithful one, with one end coming out of the nose and the other remaining in the nose, and then administer a seal of meat to the notches that are on the faithful one, and do this until you know that the flesh is already at the notches of the faithful one.
And then extract the faithful one, and pause in the nose near the abstraction of blood, one cup, and do this for three days or more until the encrustation is all consumed that remains from the flesh.
And then pause in the nose with a lead cannula for several days until it is cured.
But if you find a cure that exists, use that one.
And this is the form of the instrument for making capipurge, with which oils and medicines are distilled in the nose:
And make it of silver or bronze, which is like a small lantern open, just as a small shell, and the meat similarly.
And if you wish, make a closed cannula like a reed, and the cannula of the instrument for making capipurge, and it shall be flat, open; at which will be a handle on the last part of it, with which you can hold that when you are extracting in oil or water that you want from the juices and causes susceptible.
Chapter XXV.
On the Worms that are in the Extremities of the Nose.
Many times it is born a worm in the extremities of the nose, and it is magnified and increased in some days until the regard of it is seen.
And therefore it is necessary that you incise it at the beginning of its appearance, and eradicate all of it. And then pause over the place, or cauterize or apply medicine that is suitable for the location.
But if it is delayed in its incision until it is magnified, then consider whether it is softened, hard, of dark color and little sensation; then do not touch that with iron because it is a cancerous apostema; for many times those who incise this apostema incur great malice towards that which had been.
And if the apostema is of lion's touch and not of dark color, and many times incision is possible in all that, then evacuate the patient and incise that without fear, and cure the place with what exists and constrains until it is healed.
Chapter XXVI.
On the Suture of the Nose and Lips and Ear when Continuity is Dissolved by Wound or Similarity.
Know that when solution of continuity occurs in one of these cartilages, few confer in this operation except in certain men.
Therefore, when you find that some cause of those is present, consider whether it is a fresh wound with its own blood, and then you should adjust the two lips of the wound with suture, and carefully cure that until it is healed.
And if the lips of solution of continuity are already separated, and each is made whole, then it is necessary that you excise each part of its own cord-like appearance until blood comes out. And then adjust the two lips with suture and strengthen those, and over those sprinkle blood of dragon and powdered three times, and pause on the powder a compress of emplastrum diaphanic, or some other consolidating emplastre, and leave that bound for two days or three, and then remove that and replace it with another emplastre and leave that until the flesh is fully absorbed, and carefully cure with anointing until it is healed.
But the manner of suture is that you add the solution of continuity or with needles as we have recounted in the suture of the abdomen, or add the solution of continuity with faithful thread as to your own and make it known.
Chapter XXVII.
On the Extraction of those Causes that come in the Two Lips in the Parts Behind.
Many times it happens to many men in the parts behind their lips certain hard and grainless apostemas, some smaller and some larger.
Therefore, it is necessary that you convert the lips and fissures into each of those hardnesses from all parts, and then fill the location with sagittated lint until the blood is restricted, and then be washed with hot water and be cured the location with what exists as a styptic, until it is healed.
Chapter XXVIII.
On the Incision of Adjusted Meat in the Gums.
Great many times there is a growth of flesh above the gum adjusted meat which the ancients called albulus, therefore it is necessary that you suspend that with one or two threads, or that you hold that with forceps and incise that as it should be, and let the blood run or flow.
And then pause on the location with sagittated lint or other powders that are styptic or exciting.
And if that flesh returns, then incise it secondarily, and cauterize it, because the cautery will not return.
Chapter XXIX.
On the Reason of Teeth with Iron.
When in the surface of the teeth of the parts behind and those of the front and between the gums are adjusted rough, sharp, and some blackened, and some turned yellow or green until the gum is corrupted and the teeth become loose.
And then it is necessary that you make the patient sit between your hands and pause the top of him in your seat, and ratify the teeth in which those roughs and causes appear like sand until there remains no cause, and thus make the blackness and yellowness and other things disappear.
Therefore, if this is the beginning of the reason, good it is; and otherwise, then you must iterate the reason over those on another day and on the second and third until it comes to the final statement in what you wish.
And know that teeth have required many remedies of diverse forms and figures according to how it is prepared for your operation. And therefore the razors with which the tooth is razed from the part behind are another of the razors with which it is rasped between the teeth according to other forms, and these forms of razors should be prepared by you as you will see soon.
Chapter XXX.
On the Eradication of Teeth.
Necessary that you cure the tooth of its pain with all diligence and toil in its entire eradication from it, for there is no cause that can surpass its growth when it is eradicated, for it is a sublime substance into which it excites itself in its eradication from it.
But it is necessary when the patient is forced to eradicate that tooth, that you firmly certify what is the aching tooth, for many times the pain deceives the patient and assumes it is in a healthy tooth, and you eradicate that one and then pause until the sick and aching tooth is eradicated, for we have already seen this through the operation of barbers.
Therefore, as you must be certified which is the aching tooth, and knowing well, it is necessary that you scarify in the circuit of the tooth with a spatula in which there is some virtue, until it is dissolved from the tooth to the gum of all parts, and then pause and let it settle with your own hands or with subtle forceps little by little until it conceives.
And then pause in the strong hold with great force for good speaking or sudden power, and pause the head of the patient between your fingers that you will hold well so as not to harm, and then pull out the tooth according to rectitude in manner that you do not break it, nor give more major pain to the patient.
And then if not forgotten, take one of those instruments, and put that at the disposal of all parts with facility and effort the removal of it thus as was done at the beginning.
But if the tooth is cracked or corroded, then it is necessary that you cover with cloth that crack and strengthen it with a thin thread at the extremity of a subtle ray so that it is not broken in the hour of your constriction upon it as you take hold.
And it is necessary that you work with exquisite care through scarification in the circuit of all parts of the gum and guard well your strength so as not to break it and remain divided from it, and return upon the patient for the malice that will be greater than the first pain.
And beware that you do not do as some ignorant barbers do in their fistulation and audacity towards the eradication of their own, without administering what we have recounted; for many times they bring upon men great illnesses which are more difficult to be broken, and all or part of those teeth become disordered, or that tooth is extracted with some bones of the mandible as many times have testified.
And then the eradication of it should be washed away with hot water or warm water and salt.
And if it is necessary to flow with blood in this way, just like many times it has been necessary, then take some quantity of egg white and sprinkle it over the wound, and if that egg white does not concur, then cauterize.
The form of the forceps and subtle tongs with which the tooth is manipulated at the beginning should be of long extramital, short handle, and thick, so that they are not doubled when you must work with them.
And should be thus as times of thick handle, so that when you strain with them they are not doubled, but short extremities.
And should be made of Indian iron, with curved extremities, and in the extremities of those, should be teeth which some enter into others and strain through constriction descending strongly, and sometimes those extremities are in the shape of a bird's beak, which is called ciconia, so it is guarded, and they have strong constriction.
Chapter XXXI.
On the Eradication of Teeth and Extraction of Bones from Mandibles Broken.
When you must eradicate a tooth that is broken for some reason, it is necessary that you pause over the location with a border for one day or two until the location is softened; and then insert gently or tongs the extremities of which are assembled to the beak of a bird called ciconia or guard, the shape of the forceps:
The extremities of theirs are made behind like lime or alfalfa.
And if you do not obey your will with these forceps or tongs, then it is necessary that you hollow out the root and disarticulate all the flesh and insert the instrument which has no name, that is a small lever of which the shape is this:
And it should be of short extremity, thick and small, and not be worn out for that reason that it will not break.
Therefore, if the root is forgotten, good it is; and otherwise, help yourself with these other instruments of which these are the forms: the form of the first instrument is triangular extremity in which there should be some thickness:
The form of the second instrument is that it should be triangular and with a more subtle extremity.
And already you help yourself with this instrument having two ramps of which this is the form, approximately following: and with other instruments which precede in the rasping of teeth; for soon it is made with this instrument which is assembled to great once, and this is the form:
of the triangular extremity bent or short, which should have some thickness, and not be worn out for that reason that it will not break.
And therefore you know that the instruments of teeth are many and similar to each other, as well as the other instruments.
But the artisans skilled and subtle in their art, find for themselves by their own means, according to what it signifies the operation and various diseases; for they are of the diseases to which the ancients did not decree nor pause proper instruments, due to the forms of diverse species.
But if the bone of the mandible or of the other bones of the mouth is broken, or if it pines away, then be sure to place great care upon that in its location where it is suitable for the instruments and forceps which we have said in the extraction of tooth roots, and help yourself with gestures of which this is the form:
And it should be in a place with some thickness, little by little, and be strung or held in the mouth so that it does not escape or flee until the bone of all is forgotten; and then restore the location with medicines suitable to this.
But if there is a small putridity in the bone, then pull out that from that putridity and its blackness, and cure that until it is healed.
Chapter XXXII.
On the Cure of Teeth Elevated above Others.
When teeth are elevated above their natural form and majorly so in women and especially venerable maidens; therefore it is necessary that you consider: if a tooth is not very close to another tooth, and there is no possibility of suture or binding of it, then pull out that one; but if it is annexed to another tooth, then you must incise that one with this instrument whose form is like this; it resembles a pig's tooth, and is made of Indian iron with an extremely sharp extremity.
And then your incision should be with which you will incise that one in many days for the hardness of the tooth, and so that it is not confounded with other teeth.
And if an elevated tooth is exposed to erosion, then remove that one with a file of Indian iron whose form is like this:
And it should be all of Indian iron and the edge slightly curved; and it should have many small points like a file with which are made needles, with which the tooth is filed gradually over several days with ease, so that there is no other tooth confounded and decayed. And then line it up in the end, and pull out that one with some rasors.
And if a tooth is broken and the tongue lies against it, then it is necessary that you file it down until the sharpness of that fragment is removed and rounded off, and be filled in such a way that the tongue does not lie against it nor corrupt the word.
Chapter XXXIII.
On the Restoration of Damaged Teeth with Gold or Silver Wire.
When accidents occur to teeth before concussion and removal by percussion or falling, and the patient cannot strengthen over that which is damaged, and you have treated that with stiptic medicines, but your treatment has not been effective, then for this reason, so that they do not decay, it is necessary to reinforce those with gold wire and not silver, because silver turns green and soon perishes within a few days, whereas gold never changes.
And the wire should be in such subtlety and thickness according to the quantity that can fit between the teeth; and the form of the recipe is that you take the wire and double it within two healthy teeth, and then you increase by two bends of the wire between two damaged ones, or one or many, until the thread reaches the healthy tooth on the other side. And then repeat the thread within the part from which you began, and strengthen your work with ease and wisdom until it is not damaged.
And then tighten the thread with which you will bind the wire to the roots of the teeth that do not decay.
And then incise the excessive extremities of the wire with forceps or tongs, and add those in each place with gestures, and convert them and hide them between the healthy tooth and the damaged one, so that they do not cause injury to the tongue. And then let go of it just as straight as possible.
But if it is broken or separated, strengthen that one or those with another wire in such a way for all its time.
And this is the form of teeth and the figure of the restoration of two healthy teeth and two damaged ones, just like these linked together:
And when one tooth or two returns to its place, and each remains in its own location, and are re-grown just as we have recounted, and remain.
And only skilled artisans and wise men can do this.
And sometimes it is suitable for some reason of cow bones, and is made from them in the shape of a tooth, and is placed in a location where the tooth has fallen out, and is strengthened just as we have said, and remains and serves that one for a long time.
Chapter XXXIV.
On the Incision of the Ligament which is in the Tongue and Prohibits Speech.
This ligament which is found behind the tongue sometimes or is natural to it, or accidental and occurs through a wound that has already consolidated.
And the operation in this case is that you open the mouth of the patient, and the existing head of his tongue comes into view; and then elevate his tongue, and carefully incise that ligament according to its latitude, until the tongue is freed from its retraction.
But if in that case there is some hardness or stiffness, and this is due to the consolidation of the wound, then you should take care not to incise too deeply, but rather cut along the latitude until you have severed the ligament and dissolved the knot.
And beware that there is not a gaping wound in the flesh before the ligament, and that you do not cut too deeply and cause blood to flow.
And then be sure to wash away the remains of the incision with warm water or vinegar, or with a cloth soaked in water; and then pause beside the tongue and let it lie down; thus is the method which will keep the patient's tongue from becoming stiff again every night so that another knot does not form.
But if there is a flow of blood, pause over the location with a poultice; but if the bleeding ceases, then let the wound be cauterized with a caustic lanolin which is suitable for this purpose. And then apply that cure to other causes until it is healed.
Chapter XXXV.
On the Extraction of a Ranula behind the Tongue.
Sometimes, behind the tongue, an abscess forms similar to a small boil that prohibits the tongue from its natural operation; and very soon it is magnified until it fills the mouth.
And the operation in this case is that you open the patient's mouth, seated before the sun, and consider the abscess.
And if you see it of a dull red or black color, hard and dry, which the patient does not feel any sensation, then do not touch it because it is cancerous.
And if it is turning white and has moisture, then you should insert a probe into it, and incise that part with a subtle spatula, and cut off the entire portion; and if blood flows in the hour of your operation, then you should pause above a poultice, so it is vetriol, until the bleeding ceases.
And then return to your work until you have completed it in accordance with the location, so that it is washed with warm water and salt; and cure that part with the other cure, just as it was done before, until it is healed.
Chapter XXXVI.
On the Extraction of an Abscess from Both Ears and that which is nothing in the Gullet and other Abscesses.
When it occurs in the Gullet, so are the glands which are assembled together, which bulge out and are named two Ears, which when you cure them with what we have said in the division and they do not heal, then you should consider if the abscess is hard, of dull red color, and with little sensation, then do not touch it with iron.
And if it is of a red color and the root is large, then do not touch it with iron due to the flow of blood; rather leave it until it has matured, and either you will remove it or it will break apart on its own.
And if it is of a white color, rough, and the root of it is subtle, then that one needs to be incised.
And the operation in this case is that you consider, before your operation, if the abscess has already subsided and repaid its debt or if it has diminished by some diminution; and then make the patient sit before the sun, and his head should be in its proper place, and open the mouth of him, and the servant takes hold between his own most prominent teeth the tongue of him behind with an instrument very noble, whose form is this:
And it should be made of silver or iron, and it should be subtle like a knife.
Then, as you take hold of that tongue and it is shown to you the abscess, and you look at it with the skin around it, then take a probe and put that in the mouth, and pull that out as far as you can. Or other causes of the tunics, and then cut it with an instrument whose form is this:
Or other causes of the tunics, and then cut it with an instrument whose form is this: and is assembled to forceps, however the extremities of it are curved, so that the opening of each of those is in the end of the other, very sharp, made of Indian iron well ingrained.
But if this instrument is not at your disposal, then incise it with a spatula whose form is this: And it should be sharp on one side and not sharp on the other side.
And once you have incised one notch, incise the other following this same manner of incision, and then apply the incision to the patient's mouth with a cloth soaked in water.
But if bleeding occurs, apply water from the decoction of scorsa of milgrana or of mirtra leaves and similar to that of caustic substances until the bleeding is stopped, and then cure it until it is healed.
And sometimes there are other abscesses in the gullet besides those two ears, and you should incise them according to what I have said about incising two notches together.
And you had already treated a woman who had an abscess in her throat which was turning yellowish, with little sensation, and which had already closed up her throat, so that she was breathing very tight, and had been prohibited from eating and drinking water for a day or two, and it seemed to be on the verge of death if you hadn't acted within a day or two.
And the abscess had grown so large that it had taken two ribs between which it had pierced through two holes.
So you carefully inserted your finger and stayed in one of them, and pulled it out, and pulled out a large portion of it, and then you incised the other notch of the other hole, and then you opened the patient's mouth, and compressed their tongue, and then you placed the probe in that abscess.
And then you cut out a large part of it, and there was only a little blood flowing from it. And thus the throat of that woman was completely cleared, and she began to drink water and eat food, and then you did not cease to incise that abscess many times over a long period, and subsequent abscesses occurred in its place, which you incised until it was prolonged.
And thus you went away and cauterized the throat of her, and afterwards there was no addition; and then you walked around and did not know what God had done to that patient through you.
Chapter XXXVII.
On the Incision of a Hernia when it is Abscessed.
When the hernia descends to the scrotum and is abscessed and is long, then it is called perpendicular; and if it is in the left side large and rounded, then it is called a bubo.
But when it is cured with what we have said in the division, and your cure does not concur, and it only happens that the abscess is left behind and is subtle, then you must incise that which is added roundly; and if it is to that length, and is bleeding, of a dull red or black color, and there is no sensation to him, then you must beware the incision of him, for in that case there is fear over the patient.
And when you incise it according to the manner that I have said of its whiteness and length, then you should make the patient sit and take hold of his tongue with an instrument whose form is this: And place the probe in the new abscess, and pull it down and incise it with one of two instruments which are mentioned in the incision of two notches.
And beware that you do not incise it except at the point where it is adjusted to its natural term without addition, for if you incise too much, you will deprive him of his speech.
And then use what we have recommended in the incision of two notches, and cure it until it is healed.
But if the patient is terrified by the incision, beware that you use it in the cauterization of him without fear, and the manner of cauterizing in him is not but with sharp water, and you pause the patient's head in its proper place, and then take hold of his tongue with the instrument which we have said, and take some of the water which we have mentioned in the chapter on cauterization, and apply it to that living cause, and pause it neither thick nor thin, and fill the concavity of the instrument whose form is this:
So the extremity of it is in a concavity in which the medicine is paused just like the concavity of a spoon, and pause the instrument with the medicine on the abscess, and the patient will lie on his side so that his saliva or mucus from his mouth flows into the internal cavity of the abscess through the intrinsic medicine, so that it does not descend to any cause over his throat and trouble him.
And then take your hand and the medicine, and express it on the uvula for a space of about half an hour until you see that it is blackened and calmed by the biting action of the medicine.
And if you wish, take a cloth and wrap it around the extremity of the ray, and submerge the cloth in the medicine, and insert the ray with the cloth into a cannula above until the cloth adheres to that cannula, and do this many times until you achieve what you want from the cauterization of the uvula, and then leave it alone for three or four days.
And if you need to repeat the medicine, repeat it, and then cauterize it in the circuit of the uvula with a cloth wrapped around it in a border, and clarify it with that which is in the circuit of the medicine, and be washed with warm water, and be treated externally with an embrocation, and internally with poultices until it is healed.
And this kind of cure is more saved than incision and more free from fear.
Sometimes the uvula is cured with this method which is more subtle than cauterization and incision, because it is cured through sublimation in this manner: take camphor, hyssop, origanum, rue, Arabic gum, chamomile, and similar herbs to those of the plants, and mix all these causes, or some of them, into a pot, and be submerged in warm water, and boil; and then stir the pot decently, and there should be a hole in the middle of the pot, above which is placed an iron instrument shaped like this: made of silver or iron.
And the extremity should be inserted into the mouth of the patient until the vapor reaches the uvula above the tonsils, so that the uvula is very much obscured.
And then repeat this many times until it is dry, and take care not to do this cure at the beginning of the appearance of abscesses, because too much would be absorbed into the abscess, and you should not do this, but rather declare the abscess to be so.
But if this instrument is not at your disposal, then take a reed and make a plug of wood in the extremity of it, so that the mouth of the patient may be stopped up, because the wooden plug prevents the vapor from burning the mouth.
And this cure is good for health.
Chapter XXXVIII.
On the Extraction of Thorns and what adheres to the throat and other causes.
Many times something sticks in the throat or thorn of a fish or some other cause.
Then it is necessary that you extract what appears to be from those things, above which the sight sees, since you take hold of the tongue with an instrument in the sun, so that it may be declared to you what is in the throat.
And what does not appear and is hidden from you in the throat, it is necessary that you make the patient vomit before food is digested in the stomach, because very often the cause attached to the throat will be forgotten through vomiting; or that the patient drinks a glass of vinegar or essence of lettuce or a bottle of dry bread; or takes a piece of sea sponge, and binds it strongly with a thread, and then the patient swallows it, so that when it reaches the place where thorns are and is extracted, then they will be forgotten. And instead take an eel and bind it with a thread, and let it be placed inside and then extracted; or take a tube and insert it and then pull it out.
But if those causes which we have said are not forgotten, then take a leaden instrument shaped like this:
And it should be more thick than a ray a little bit, and in the extremity of it there should be a concavity which you insert into the patient's throat with ease.
And it should raise its head upwards and take care that the touch of its bone in the throat, so that it may enter into the body and with that which will compress the bone or the thorn, or that it will put itself under its own hand.
But meanwhile the patient should insert it with ease, by his knowledge of the place where the attached cause is and compresses below, and pulls out his hand with the instrument upwards, all according to the quantity prepared to be forgotten.
Chapter XXXIX.
On the Extraction of Blood-Clots Attached to the Throat.
When it is medicated with blood-clots with what we have said in the division of the cure with medicines and does not concur, consider then that in the throat of the patient there is sunlight, because you have compressed his tongue with an instrument which we have recommended.
Then if you find the blood-clot, extract it with a small probe or subtle gestures decently.
And if it is not possible to extract it with that, then take a concave cannula and insert it into the throat of the patient, and then pause in the concavity of the cannula a hot iron, and do this many times (until the blood-clot is dead and falls out of the throat) and abstain from giving water to the patient all day.
And then take a full vial of warm water, and open the mouth of the patient with it, and wash the mouth with it; and do not let any cause pass through it and spoil the water for an hour afterwards by his own hand, because the blood-clot soon as it feels the water takes fright.
But if it is not forgotten as we have recommended, then sublimate the patient with cinnamon or asafoetida using the instrument which we have recommended in the sublimation of the uvula.
And do this, so that it will fall.
And there is another way of operation in the sublimation of it, that you take a pot in which are burning coals and the pot is covered with a cover in the middle of which is a hole, and the extremity of the instrument is placed in that hole; and then bring down the sublimation; and pause the patient's mouth at the end of the cannula, and close his mouth so that the sublimation is not forgotten until you know that the sublimation has reached the blood-clot, for the blood-clot will soon fall.
And if it doesn't work, then you repeat the sublimation many times, and abstain from giving water to the patient, and give him salty and bitter causes, and not fresh water, and thus it is necessary that with this regimen be forgotten.
And this is the shape of the instrument with which blood-clots are extracted from the throat when seen; and it resembles forceps thus, except that there is some curvature. The one that is placed in the throat, and the extremity of it resembles the beak of a heron, which is grasping, with a lime that is sharpened, so that when you compress some cause, it will not let go.
Chapter XL.
In which is the summary of the sermon in warning against abscesses and their treatment.
Abscesses are many species, of many methods, according to the remembrance of their kind, each one described in this book.
And thus diverse in perforation and section of them through two methods, one of which is by the species of abscesses themselves; and therefore, according to the humors.
And the second method is according to the places in which they occur in the body, for the abscess that occurs in the head is different from the abscess that occurs in the buttocks; and the abscess that occurs in a bony place is different from the abscess that occurs at a joint; and each one has its own judgment by operation.
And some abscesses are such that they should not be punctured, but rather allowed to mature with the pus in those places or completed as they are.
And other abscesses are such that they should be pierced when they are crossed, and not allowed to mature according to their completion, just like those abscesses that are proper to joints. When an abscess occurs near a joint, it prolongs itself within the circuit of the joint, and very often corrupts the ligaments or nerves of that joint, causing contraction of that member; or is an abscess near a main limb, and if you delay piercing it until it has matured too late for the main limb; or is an abscess in the buttocks, then pierce it unripe; and do not make it cross, but rather the one that is proper to the buttocks, so that the prepuce of it is not putrefied and elongated outside the buttocks, and a fistula is formed, or it becomes inflamed in its term and does not heal. But it is necessary that you know the hour of piercing the abscess, and thus it is when it is matured.
And know that it is matured when there is the cessation of pain and fever, and a decrease in the swelling and pulse, and a sharpness at the top of the abscess, and other signs.
And where it is necessary to know that the piercing should be done in the place most distant from the abscess and coming from the cure of the elevation.
And piercing should be done through the length of the flesh or body if the abscesses are in the parts of the arms or legs, and in places of the lacertae, tendons, nerves, and arteries; and, finally, in all places where there is no reflection; for in those that are reflected, use piercing according to that member.
But when the abscess is in a bony place, then it is better that you delay piercing it until you are confirmed of its digestion according to completion, as we have said; for if you pierce it too early, it will prolong the body's putrefaction and many foul humors, and very often the lips of it will be hardened and the depth of it.
But some abscesses should be pierced according to the latitude of the flesh or body if it is necessary, or according to what the member requires.
And it is necessary that you administer a small piercing, and in large abscesses a great piercing and a wide or many sections according to the diversity of the size of the abscesses.
And others are the abscesses in which it is necessary that the cord is concaved and is incised, when it becomes thus as if pan and made are in term, as with those that occur in many parts of the duodenum and of boils.
And of those that are incised with a section having three angles; and of those it is in which it is incised as if it were a figure of a myrtle leaf, as with the abscesses of the groin.
And of those that are incised with a round section and a lunar section, and resemble those.
But that one to which there is no such abscess as those of the lions, superficially, it is necessary that you pierce it with a superficial or flat piercing only.
And it is necessary that when the abscess is large and has already collected much pus, you pierce it and do not hesitate to extract all the pus at that moment; having extracted one part of it, and then plug the abscess until the next day, and then extract a larger part, and then repeat this many times according to gradation until it is forgotten.
And especially if the patient is of frail virtue, or a woman in childbed, or a small child, or an old person in decrepitude, for the animal spirit many times is resolved with the exit of the pus, and very often the patient dies, and you open them.
So guard this chapter with great caution, and accordingly administer your piercing in which you pierce these abscesses, so that you wash away the plagues and consider whether the plague of the abscess is small, or is a flat section; then you should administer those things of old or new patch; and if the abscess is large, and the fissures of the perforation are many, then it is necessary that you pause in each hole until they come together.
And if in the abscess is separated a part of the cord or has concavated that in the circuit, then it is necessary that you complete it with an old patch or with a thread made from linen cloth, as when you treat bread or raisins, without moisture; and strengthen that within three days; and accordingly process it and cure it with water as needed for the dressings until it is healed.
But if bleeding occurs during the hour of your operation, then you should administer warm water and vinegar to the mules where a linen cloth is wrapped, and pause that over the location of the blood flow many times.
But if the bleeding persists, then it is necessary that you administer a remedy and cure, and powder those which I have recommended in many places of this our book and division.
But if it is in the time of winter, and the location of the abscess is a place of many nerves, then it is necessary that you apply poultices in wine and oil, and pause those over the locations.
And if it is in the summer, and the locations are fleshy, then it is necessary that you apply poultices wrapped in water and oil or wine and oil, and let it be warm for three days, as we have said, and then remove the abscess and wash it with water as needed until it is healed.
And thus is what is necessary for the knowledge of the cure of abscesses universally, but according to the method of distinction that I have said of all abscesses in which way is the path of its cure by chapters individually.
Chapter XLII.
Of the section on abscesses that occur in the cord of the head.
In the cord of the head, small abscesses, and some species of nodes that contain tunics which are their own facts; and the species of them are many.
And among them are pustules, and those that contain humidity similar to lime. And among them are those that contain humidity similar to powder, and resembling their own kind; and those that are lapideous, hard.
And in the section of all and in the extraction of those there is no fear, as you should not cause tension in the arteries.
And the operation in this section is that you apply them with an instrument of the form which resembles it, which is called "entromes", until you know what they contain.
Therefore, if what it contains is humidity, then you should divide it with a section according to its length, in a superficial section, following this form:
And begins in the section of the line of .B. up to the line of .G. Then, as the humidity is evacuated, you should excoriate that skin which contains that humidity, and do not leave any cause from it, for many times it returns if some cause remains.
And accordingly submerge a patch in Egyptian ointment, if present, and if not, in water and salt; and fill it with that the wound and leave it until the next day, for by this means you corrode all that remains of that skin.
And accordingly iterate over that patch with Egyptian ointment secondarily and tertiary times, if it is needed, until you are confident that there is no remaining cause of that skin; then cure the wound with ointment until it is healed.
And if the abscess contains fatty nodes, then you should incise it according to this form: with a section having the shape of a cross, and cut once between two lips of the section, and scrape off all that part, and exert your skill in extracting the tunic which contains that.
But if it causes tension in your arteries, then do as I have recounted to you first.
And similarly do with the abscess that is hardened by section and cure according to what I have said; and section on a hardened abscess is easier, for it has little blood and little humidity.
And some times there are such cases of these abscesses that are in the head of certain men, with whom there is no humidity; and this cause is because you incised over an abscess on the head of an old woman who was so deaf, harsh, white, and numb, that it could not be touched, and if someone had touched it with that percussion, it would have hurt him.
But in other abscesses that occur on the head, this is not the same chapter, such as those that come to the heads of children and are filled with wax, but the section of these all is superficial.
And pause the piercing of those at the lower part of them, so that the body of the pus may be relieved in the lower parts.
And accordingly cure those with what is needed for their cure.
Chapter XLII.
Of the section on scrofulas that occur in the neck.
Many times these abscesses occur in the neck and armpits and groin; and sometimes they occur in other parts of the body.
And those that occur in the neck, and many that are generated between them, and all scrofula of these is within its own tunic proper, and as with the nodes and abscesses of the head, as we have recounted.
And the species of these scrofulas are many, for some are lapideous, and some contain humidity, and some are malignant which do not submit to cure.
Therefore, in that one which you find to have good disposition in the Touchment, of which the color is manifestly related to the color of the cord, and is bad at all parts, and is not annexed to the nerve of the neck, nor to the veins, nor to the arteries, and is not swollen, it is necessary that you incise it with a superficial section from above to below along the line of .G. up to the line of .B., and scrape off all that part, and extend two lips of the cord with one cut, or with many cuts if you need them, just as we have said in the abscesses of the head, and extract it little by little.
And it is even more caution that the vein or nerve should not be incised.
And it is more caution that the spatula not be very sharp, so that it does not adjust to your hand and incise, or that you disturb the patient, and that you incise what is not necessary to incise; for if you incise a vein or artery and prohibit yourself from your operation, then pause in the wound until it becomes dry and rough, or other powders which stop the flow of blood, and strengthen the wound, and leave it until the acuteness of the abscess subsides and the wound becomes softened and begins to heal. When the blood is separated.
Therefore, return to your operation until you have completed it.
And accordingly, inquire about the sign your teacher has indicated if there remains any cause of other small scrofulas, then incise those and clean them.
And if it is in the root of a large scrofula, then it is necessary that you do not incise that scrofula from its roots. And accordingly, tie up that with a double thread and let it rest until it falls by itself without causing harm.
And accordingly, fill the wound with an old patch which you have already submerged in Egyptian ointment, and accordingly cure it.
And if you incise that scrofula entirely, then it is necessary that you adjust the two lips of the wound and sew them together as soon as possible so that there is no remaining superfluity.
But if you find that there is remaining superfluity due to the greatness of the scrofula, then it is necessary that you understand how to incise its root, and extract it and administer suturing and what is said.
And that of the scrofulas which contain humidity, pierce it with a superficial incision at the place where it appears to you as the location of maturity, and pause the incision so that it reaches the pus base of the body, just as we have said.
And accordingly, administer the incision with ointment and similar substances to those, so that it corrodes what remains of the corruption. And accordingly, when you see the wound already cleansed, then cure it with ointment of generating flesh until it is healed.
Chapter XLIII.
Of the section on the pilling of the abscess which occurs in the groin.
They called this section in the old days "epilhot", and we have not seen anyone in our land who has done it.
And this is the inscription of the sermon of those.
But in men who have syphilis, it is necessary to avoid the extraction of the epilhot, because through this there would be no help, for all the veins and major vessels of the patient are here.
But in those who have abscesses that are cauterized in the mouth or groin or both ears, when the disease is not in the canal, it is necessary to use the section of epilhot to avoid the destruction which is caused by perforation.
Therefore, when we want to do this, it is necessary that we incise the epilhot below three circles of the epilhot, or four with a small section in latitude between two circles for quantity, so that the section is in cartilage, not in bone, and this location is suitable for section, because it is privy of flesh and the vessels of blood from there are distant.
And if the doctor is cautious, it is necessary that he extends the cord of the groin with one cut, and accordingly cuts through the cord until it reaches the canal, but avoid the vessels of blood if you see any cause.
And accordingly, incise the ciplach according to what we have recounted; and it is signified on the section of the canal by the flame which is from that side and is disordered and broken off due to the abscission of the voice.
And leave the wound open for some time.
Therefore, when the hour is ripe in which perforation is to be feared, add two lips of the cord of the wound, and sew it up alone, except for the cartilage.
And accordingly, administer medicines that make the flesh new until it is healed.
And Albucasis says that the summary of this sermon which we have recounted is an exposition not to show that some of these abscesses have already filled up the groin of the patient, and the patient has come close to death, and his soul is exhausted, and some go to incise the epiglottis so that the patient may breathe over the location of the wound through some respiration, and be saved from death.
And therefore, I command to leave the wound open until the malice of the disease is consumed; and it is the malice of that place for three days; and then I command to close the wound, and cure it until it is healed.
And what I have seen through my eyes is that a servant took a cauterizing iron and applied it to his groin, and incised a part of the canal of the lung, and you were called to the cure of him, and he began to groan as if groaning from the dying, and discovered the wound and extracted the blood which was situated in the little wound.
Therefore, you were confessed that he had not incised a vein nor an artery, and the breath was coming from the wound, and cured it until it was healed.
And he did not suffer any harm except for some roughness in his voice, and accordingly, after several days, he returned to an improvement of his physical condition.
And now I say to you that there is no fear in the section of the epilhot.
Chapter XLIV.
Of the section on abscess that occurs in the groin outside, and is called a hernia of the groin.
This abscess is called a hernia of the groin, which is a great abscess according to the color of the body, and it occurs more in women.
And it is according to two manners, either it is natural or accidental.
And in the natural one there is no need for cure.
And the accidental one is according to two manners, of which one is similar to grassy nodes, and the other manner is similar to abscess which is caused by a constriction of an artery, and in that there is fear. And it is not necessary to make presumption about it unless it is small. And you should proceed with that and investigate it according to what is said, and if you find it similar to grassy nodes, and not suspended from any of the veins, then you incise it as with the nodes, and extract it with water that contains the peel and bursiclam; and otherwise, then thoroughly examine the entire being, and accordingly cure the location where healing is needed until it is healed.
Chapter XLV.
Of the section on the species of nodes.
Of the nodes many species and I have already said all the species of theirs in the division.
And it is necessary that you recount thus the difference between a node and an exitra, so as to dispel doubt.
Therefore, I say that with exitra there is heat and fever and violent pains until the ebullition of the superfluity is sedated; and it is completed putrefaction which then ceases the fever, pain, and heat.
But with a node there is no heat nor fever nor pain, and it contains that cartilage-like substance which is in its own sac.
And it is according to the color of the body, and its beginning is like a cheese and it is made thus like a pouch, whether greater or lesser, and they are according to two species, either they are grassy and contain humidity, and the colors of the humidity are many, as I said in the division.
Therefore, when you come to the cure of a node, that you expose it and inquire into it at the beginning with a instrument which is called an intro-mes, according to what its form will appear in the chapter which is next to this one.
And it is the manner of inquiry into abscesses and all nodes, which is that you take this instrument and introduce it into the most humid part of the abscess, and you turn the handle thus little by little until you know that the instrument has penetrated to the cord.
And accordingly, finally, your hand according to the measure of the greatness of the abscess, and accordingly extract the intro-mes and consider what is situated in its place.
And if the moisture which flows is forgotten, of whatever color it may be, then you incise it with a superficial section according to what I have said in other abscesses.
And if from the place of the intro-mes there is no moisture, then you know that it is grass.
And dry on it with a section having the shape of a cross according to this form: just as I have taught you, and suspend it with a needle, and excise the cord from all parts with ease, and preserve the skin or sack, if possible, over that and extract that pus from the node.
But if it is broken in the operation, it is not possible to extract that pus, and often times end up with this, and accordingly you extract it by pieces until there is no longer any cause from there.
For if from there remains no cause, a little or too much, the node will return as before.
And if you find that from there remains a small part, then complete the wound with some sharp and corrosive powders and strengthen the wound, and pause over it which has abscessed cautiously, and cure that other way until it is healed.
And if it is a great node, then you sew the two lips of it and cure that with water which nourishes.
But if the pulsating vein is on the opposite side, or non-pulsating, then you compress and apply a wet compress to the location of the gauze, which is vitriol, and leave it so for two days or three until the wound becomes firm and the ebullition of blood subsides; and accordingly return to incise that which remains of the node.
Chapter XLVI.
Of the forms of the instruments necessary for section and perforation.
Of those, the forms of intro-meses, and of three species, that of which is great, and of which is medium-sized, and of which is small.
The form of the great intro-mes is this:
The form of the small intro-mes is this:
They are made of iron, with a pointed end, and curved extremities that descend in a gentle slope, for the purpose of fixing the instrument in abscesses.
And these are the forms of the experiments, and they are called "albered", and one of them is called "berid".
And there are three species, that of which is great, medium-sized, and small.
The form of the great experiment, shape of it:
The form of the medium-sized experiment, shape of it:
The form of the small experiment, shape of it:
Conveniently so that they are for those abscesses, exitrae, fistulae, and bubae, and also for the bones and other causes.
And thus they are made round, thick, and long, like great needles with which the stitches are sewn together, and they are made of earthenware citron, or of iron, or of silver, And the best ones are when they are made of earthenware citron.
And they are made of black plums, which are adapted to those that are plentiful the fistulae in the concavity of which there are reflections, which are reflected in their lightness with those reflections.
And there are three species, that one of them is long, and the others medium-sized, and the others short, according to the quantity of the width of the fistula and its constriction.
Form of the great experiment of lead:
Form of the medium-sized experiment of lead:
Form of the small experiment of lead:
The forms of the needles are of many species, that one of them is simple, with only a single curvature, and there are three species: great, small, and medium-sized.
And among them there are iron needles, and there are three species.
And among those, there are needles with two curvatures, and there are three species.
And among those, there are needles with three curvatures, and there are three species.
And all these are necessary in their place.
Form of a small simple needle, shape of it:
Form of a large needle having two curvatures: Form of a medium-sized needle having two curvatures: Form of a small needle having two curvatures:
Form of a large needle having three curvatures:
Form of a medium-sized needle having three curvatures:
And these are the forms of scalpels with which one cuts and scores nodes and abscesses, and there are three species, that one of them is great, medium-sized, and small.
Form of a large scalpel:
Form of a medium-sized scalpel:
Form of a small scalpel:
The extremities of those with which section is made are sharp and the other extremities are not sharp, and they are not paused in such a manner, but rather so that it may be done gently in the excision of nodes to avoid the danger of incising a vein or nerve, and for this reason the patient is cured and afterwards tranquility is found a little due to the adaptation which is obtained from the excision of the abscess.
And these are the forms of ligatures, and there are three species: great, medium-sized, and small, just like threads.
They are made of earthenware and resemble rays, with which one makes alcohol.
And it is in the lateral extremity that one makes a small puncture with a hidden spatula and in that corner runs the partitions inwardly and outwardly, whenever you want, just as you see.
The forms of spatulas, which are hidden between the fingers when one performs the puncture of abscesses and do not touch the patients, and there are three species: great, medium-sized, and small. And these are the forms of those:
The forms of absorbents with which one absorbs the flow of blood, and there are three species: great, medium-sized, and small; their forms are:
They are made of earthenware citron, rounded with some length, and are subtle.
And it is necessary that these species of absorbents are great, medium-sized, and small, for the purpose of absorbing the flow of blood with velocity when needed, and accordingly when first aid is not medicine.
However, one does not use those to absorb blood in all parts of the body, and one uses them only in fleshy areas, such as in the crevices of the hips and buttocks, and in the creases of the arms, and breasts, and belly, and groin areas, and similar to their fleshly counterparts.
And sometimes they are made of those small instruments resembling scissors according to this form; by which blood is absorbed when it is done through phlebotomy, or incision of a vein or artery.
And sometimes they are made round according to this form:
Chapter XLVII.
Of the cure of men's breasts which are similar to those of women.
Sometimes the breasts of certain men become inflamed due to the excess of sleeping when they start getting older, and accordingly, the breasts are swollen, and similar to those of women, and abscesses form at a distance.
And to the one who is afflicted with this, it is necessary to incise those with a lunar section according to this form, from the line of B to the line of G, and accordingly excise all the gangrene, and accordingly fill the wound with an incarnate medicine, and accordingly adjust the two lips of the wound with sewing, and cure that until it is healed.
But if the breast sinks into the partitions and is softened by its magnitude just like in women, then it should be cut in two parts from top to bottom, with two sections resembling a lunar figure, of which each one is contained within the other, until the major line contains the minor one according to this form of the line of B and the line of G. And accordingly excise the cord that is between the two lips of the wound, and remove the swelling, and administer the liquid we have said about suturing and the powders which are necessary for healing until it is healed.
And if you do not complete the incision of that which is necessary to be cut due to the unease of the patient and the flow of blood, then it is necessary to fill the wound with a submergent poultice in corrosive gauze and leave it until the corroded part that remains of the grayish color is gone, and accordingly cure that until it is healed.
Chapter XLVIII.
Of the puncturing of abscesses that come left behind the titillate.
Those abscesses that come left behind the titillate are of the species of scrofulae, hard ones, which contain a sack.
And among those, some contain moisture; and those that contain moisture should be incised with a lunar section according to this figure: from the line of G to the line of B. And when all the fluid that is in the abscess has been evacuated, then you should fill it with a warm compress and leave it until the next day.
And accordingly, the compress should be applied and the wound should be cured with a suitable poultice until it is healed.
And if the abscess is of the species of nodes and scrofulae, then you should cut it open just as we have said in the section on scrofulae equally.
And if the wound is extended in such a way that it appears to be inflamed, then you should apply a cautery to it just as we have said before.
Chapter XLIX.
Of the section of abscesses that occur through artery or vein.
When an artery is ruptured and the cord that is consolidated on top of it has become inflamed and an abscess has formed, then many times these signs are observed: for when an abscess is caused by an artery, it becomes long and aggregated in the forepart of the body; and when you press the abscess with those said fingers, you will feel a stridor.
And that which is caused by a vein is rounded to the visible part of the body.
And the section on this abscess is in error, and more so in those that are left behind in the armpits, and in the neck, and in many places of the body; and it is very great, therefore it is necessary to avoid its cure with iron, and that which is in the extremities or at the head should be avoided.
But over that which is caused by them through inflammation of the orifice of the artery, you should cut open the cord section in the long way; and accordingly, you will find the section with scissors and accordingly, you will tie off the artery, and deliver from the tunics until it is uncovered.
And accordingly, you will make a stitch on that with an needle and make it penetrate into the other side, and strengthen the artery with a double thread in two places, — which causes you to see your own eyes in the extraction of two arteries which are in the temples.
And accordingly, you will push the place between two ligatures with a spatula until all the blood that is in it is drained and the abscess is dissolved.
And accordingly, you will administer care in which fire is generated until the ligatures fall away; and accordingly, you will cure that with suitable poultices to it until it is healed.
And if the abscess is caused by an incision of a vein, then it is necessary for you to take with your hand as much water as is possible from the abscess and the cord, and accordingly, you will insert the needle left behind the place which you have taken with your hand, and make it penetrate; and be in that double thread until you extract that from the other side, and accordingly, you will tie off the abscess with a single ligament as I have said to you earlier about the ligature of two parts at two extremities of the thread.
But if you fear that the thread will be extracted, then accordingly, you will insert a double thread with the needle left behind all the abscess, through the incision of the first needle, and strengthen those threads in four places.
And accordingly, you will cut off the abscess in the middle of it, until when what is left is in it, then you will incise the superfluity of the cord, and leave that which is tied to it.
And accordingly, you will pause over the poultice which you have submerged in vinegar and oil, and accordingly, you will administer care which is made with some and powders until it is healed.
Chapter 1 on the abscess that occurs due to twisting of nerves.
Just as an abscess occurs in the artery and vein, and similarly an abscess occurs in the nerves when it occurs through percussion or due to excessive strain, and by similar causes.
And it is made in the most part of it in the places of the assistants or the heel, or in any place where the joints are damaged.
And it is a severe abscess, and is akin to the color of another body, and is in the major part of it disposed to its own kind, when it is stretched with vehemence, then in it the patient appears as if in a stupor.
And it is not an abscess aggregated in the forepart of the body, and therefore it is left behind the cord, and it is damaged to all parts and does not go to the parts before or behind.
Therefore, that which is in the joints should not be incised with iron, for very lightly it would result in contraction.
But that which is in the head or forehead should have the cord cut open with a spatula. But if it's a small abscess, then take that with forceps and cut it open with razors.
And if it's large, then you should suspend that with threads, and excise that, and accordingly remove that; and adjust the wound with a suture, and cure that until it is healed.
Chapter LI.
Of the section of abscess which occurs due to inflammation that occurs in the belly.
I have observed in some men that many times in their bellies and in other parts of their body those things which are called fungi by similarity to those with fungi, whose roots are subtle and the head of that is thick; and already the lips of those are conversed, and it is of those who is small, and it is of those who is very magnified.
And I have already seen one, and in the belly of it were two things which resembled fungi, and there was no difference between those white ones, with a subtle root.
And already the lips of those were turned inwards and split open, and moisture flowed from that at all times.
Therefore you should incise those and insert them into the one in a weight of 18 ounces. and the other, weighs 6 ounces.
And the operation in the incision of theirs is that you consider whether the patient is humid, and the color of the thing is white, humid, with a subtle root; then you should incise it with a spatula, and be present when you have cauterized it over fire, because many times the section of it must expel much blood; and if you see the blood, cauterize that.
And if the patient is weak and fearful, be careful not to incise with iron; but rather take a lead thread of recent making, and strengthen that thing, in the manner which we have said; and leave it for two days.
And accordingly, adjust it in the constriction of the lead thread; therefore, do not cease to strengthen the lead greatly on that thing, until it is cut off and falls away by its own weight.
But if that thing is of great root, then in the incision of it there is some cause for fear and terror, and most especially in that which is in the belly.
But possible is that you incise the greatest part of it, and accordingly cauterize that so that it does not return.
And accordingly, cure that until the wound is healed.
And be careful not to incise that thing which is of a dark color, with little sensation, and with little regard, for that is absolutely cancerous.
And you will find it to be a memory of cancer accordingly.
Chapter LII.
Of the care of the navel prominence.
The navel prominence is caused by many reasons; or by fissures of the cicatrix which is on the belly, and you see that it is torn away or bundled up according to what is seen in other ruptures; or by blood which flows from a vein or artery, as has been said before, or by coarctation of the ventricle in it.
But if it is due to a fissure of the cicatrix and the bursting forth of the navel string, then the color of the abscess is similar to the color of the body; and there is no pain, and accordingly, it appears in different situations. And if it is due to the bursting forth of the navel string, then the situation of that with water as we have recounted, is with a more violent diversity; and when you press that with the threads I mentioned, it is hidden, and accordingly returns; and very quickly it becomes so, and is magnified much by the introduction of bath and violent labor.
But if due to humidity, then it is not so, and does not hide when you press with your hand, nor is it constricted or believed.
And if due to blood, then accordingly, the abscess appears with these signs declining towards blackness.
But if it is due to nothing but flesh, then accordingly the abscess is a severe one, large and hard, and is situated according to a quantity.
But if it is due to coarctation, then accordingly the touch of it is like nothing.
And the operation in this case is that you consider whether the prominence of the navel is due to blood from an artery, or a vein, or coarctation; accordingly, it is necessary for you to be prohibited from treating it, because in that there is fear and terror just as I have taught you in the chapter where I described abscesses caused by arteries and veins.
And if the prominence of the navel is due to the navel string or the cord, then accordingly you should command the patient to take hold of his own navel and be standing upright; and accordingly, sign with a tent in the circuit of all the navel, and accordingly, command him to stay between your hands on both sides of his navel, and accordingly, surround it with a spatula in the circuit of the navel over the place which you have marked with the tent; and accordingly, extend most of the abscess above into the upper parts with threads; and accordingly, tie it off in the circuit with strong thread or with cord, and the manner of tying should be decent.
And accordingly, take the middle of the abscess, which is extended over the ligature, and insert the said thread into it and seek out the navel string; and if you have found or guarded it by the ligature, then accordingly, extract the abscess and push the navel string down to the lower parts of the belly.
And if you have found the cord, then accordingly take that with threads; and incise the superfluities of it.
But if it is contrary to your artery or vein, then accordingly circle that place, and accordingly return to your operation; and take two needles and put them in those two strong threads, and insert the two needles into the circuit which you have made around the abscess in a cross-like manner, so that they will penetrate; and accordingly strengthen the abscess in four parts above the needles.
And if you wish, remove the needles and leave the place until the flesh extends and falls away by itself; or incise that when it is subtlety and becomes soft, and accordingly cure that with water as needed until it is healed.
And if the prominence of the navel is due to nothing but flesh or humidity in it, then accordingly you should conquer the abscess as we have said and remove the blood or humidity which you find there, and accordingly cure that with water as needed and consolidate the place.
Chapter LIII.
Of the care of cancer.
We have already said in the division, about the species of cancer and how it is treated with medicines, and what is to be avoided in treating it with iron so that it is not ulcerated; and we have said that cancer is generated through excessive care and caution in treating it.
And the ancients said that sometimes cancer is in a place where its eradication is possible, just like breast cancer or abdominal cancer and their similarities to the members allocated to remove all of it, and most especially when it starts small.
But when it is old and great, you should not attempt to treat it, because you will not be able to heal it at all nor have I seen anyone else do so, nor that it has been brought to a good outcome.
And the operation in this case is when it is allocated as we have said, that you precede and leave the patient and purge him of black cholera some times, and accordingly apply a poultice to that place if a manifest repletion has been found.
And accordingly, prepare the patient with preparation for the operation in which the place is located, and accordingly prohibit in the thread threads that are necessary for that; and accordingly concave all parts of the cord so that it is good excision until there remains no cause of the roots of it. And accordingly, let the blood flow, and do not incise it slightly, and express the places, and wipe away the thick blood with your hand or with an instrument that is at your disposal from among the instruments.
But if you find that the thick blood incision of the vein or artery causes contrariety to it, then accordingly cauterize that place until the flow of blood is stopped, and accordingly cure that with another cure until it is healed.
Chapter LIV.
Of the care of hydropsis.
We have already recounted, in the division, about the species of hydropsis caused by water, and the signs of each species, as well as its treatment with medicines.
And that one which is cured with iron is only the species of Althita alone, and it is not approached with iron to the species of Timpanister nor to the species of Yposarca, because this is mortal.
And when you have already medicated this species of hydropsis timpanister with medicines and it has not been confirmed by your medicine, then accordingly consider whether the patient is already weakened or has another disease, just like if it is in the lungs or belly and similar to those, then accordingly beware that you do not treat it with iron, because fear is above this.
But if you find the patient to be of robust virtue, and there is no other disease but hydropsis alone, and it is not an infant or an old person, then accordingly the manner of the operation for that is that you lift the patient between your hands, and give them proper care, expelling the water from the belly with their own hand, filling the water at the part left of the pentenilh, and accordingly take a pointed spatula in this form:
with two sharp parts long, with a sharp extremity just like a spatula; but however, be in it some smallness little by little, so that in the operation with that you do not enter into the navel string, and lead those to.
And accordingly consider if the generation of hydropsis is from one of the navel strings, because then you should have the section move away from the navel by the quantity of three said parts to the left over, on the right side of it above the pentenilh.
But if the generation of hydropsis is due to disease of the liver, then accordingly your section should be left of the navel by three said parts.
And if the generation of it is due to melancholy, then accordingly your section should be in the right side.
And it is not necessary for your section to be on the side on which the patient wishes to lie down, so that the superfluities do not flow to that place freely.
And accordingly pierce the entire cord with an instrument and accordingly insert it into that section, and lift your hand with a spatula between the cord and the siphac, and you will excise that; and if it is the quantity of one fingernail or thereabout.
And accordingly pierce the cicatrix until the spatula reaches the location where you want it to be, and that is the location of the water. And accordingly extract that and insert an instrument which has this shape: and it is similar to a silver canula; it is made of silver or of iron or of lead, and at the bottom part of it there is a small hole, and on both sides of it there are three holes: two from one side and one from the other side; and the end of it is incised according to the manner of a feather, just like when you:
And on the top of it is a ring, because when the instrument reaches the water, then that ring will soon descend upon the instrument, and accordingly evacuate from the water in a moderate quantity; for if you evacuate more than necessary at that hour, very quickly the patient will die due to resolution of their animal spirit, or you will cause injury to them which is close to death.
But evacuate from that according to the quantity of the virtue of it and according to what your observations indicate about the patient's disposition, the virtue of their pulse, and the good or bad nature of them.
And accordingly extract the instrument, and retain the water which is retained because it is held back by the cord which holds the hole that is on the cicatrix of which I have told you to pierce it according to this manner.
And accordingly repeat the instrument on another day if you find that the patient is able to tolerate this, and extract a small quantity of water, and do this for some days with caution, and beware of error until there remains only a little water.
But if you fear for the patient, and let a large quantity of water flow, then accordingly cure that with burial in hot sand, and mix it with warm mud, and wait under the sun for a long time; and cure that with desiccative medicines until they are healed.
And cauterize on the stomach, and the melancholy and liver accordingly with the extraction of water, according to what I have recounted previously in this which has preceded.
Chapter LV.
Of the cure of children who are born with undescended testicles not perforated.
Sometimes one of the children is thus born from the belly of its mother and the head of its mixture is not perforated (or has a very narrow hole or is not in its place).
Therefore it is necessary to pierce that with a perforation as soon as it is born with a fine spatula according to this shape:
And accordingly pause in the hole a small clasp made of lead and tie that one on, and leave it there for three days or four.
And when it is time to urinate, be renewed and flow; and accordingly return that.
And if you do not pause the lead, it is possible that the urine which flows over the place will not allow this to close.
But that which has a narrow hole should be treated with a leaden clamp, just as we have said, for many days until it is widened.
But those in which the hole is not in its place are led astray, and this is because of those who are born with the trait that is at the end of the penis, so that it cannot urinate downwards, but instead lifts the penis with its own hand upwards; and it is not a natural generation, therefore the sperm cannot reach the mother according to rectitude, and it is a miserable illness.
And the manner of the operation in this case is that the patient should be placed on their back, and accordingly stretch the head of the penis with your left hand with a vehement extraction, and incise the head of the head of the penis at the location of the perineum with a sharp spatula, just like when you make an incision with a feather, or that you remove some part, so that the middle of it resembles the head of the penis and the hole falls into the middle place according to what is necessary.
And beware that in your operation of blood flow, because often this happens; and pause at the place where you will incise the blood, and cure the wound until it is healed.
Chapter LVI.
Of the affliction which occurs in the foreskin of the penis and its corruption, blackness, and adhesion to the head of the penis.
Many times this affliction occurs on the penis and is an excess of soft flesh.
And one of them is malignant and the other is non-malignant.
Non-malignant, requires that you suspend with a fine thread and incise it so that all the excess flesh is removed; and accordingly pause over the cut submerging it in Egyptian ointment; and accordingly cure it with diaphanous ointment until it is healed.
And if the affliction is malignant, of a bad color, then accordingly you must administer cauterization at the incision and the reason for it.
But if the affliction is in the foreskin of the uncircumcised penis and one part of it is inwardly towards the foreskin and the other part is outwardly, then accordingly you should remove the afflicted part that is inwardly towards the beginning until it is consolidated; and then you will cure that which is outside, for when you cure that simultaneously with the foreskin, there is no guarantee that it will not become tangled.
And often it happens in the genitals and foreskin of blackness and corruption, therefore it is necessary that you scrape away all that which has already been denigrated and which already wants to corrupt or has already corrupted; and accordingly line that over with a mixture made with honey, which is mixed with flour of scoria of millet grain and with crushed and sifted errors.
And accordingly cure that with another treatment until it is healed.
But if there is an excessive flow of blood, then accordingly administer lunar cauterization in this form:
for cauterization is beneficial at two dispositions together, namely the flow of blood and the wound when it is corrupted.
And if the head of the penis is corroded and destroyed completely in an instant, then accordingly it is necessary that you insert into the opening of the foreskin a leaden catheter so that the patient may urinate through it.
In the adhesion of the foreskin to the head of the penis (and this adhesion only occurs in those whose foreskin is intact and has not been circumcised; and when adhesion occurs due to wound or abscess) it is necessary that you excise with an obtuse spatula until the bond is dissolved and the head of the penis is completely freed from all parts.
And if it is difficult to excise those parts exactly, then accordingly you should excise with an instrument some cause at the head of the penis and foreskin, and thus it is because the foreskin, when it is subtle, can be easily perforated by its own subtlety slightly.
And accordingly separate between the foreskin and the head of the penis with a thread of fine silk, which has already been moistened in water so that they will not adhere again.
And accordingly it should be treated with a strong medicine until it is consolidated.
Chapter LVII.
Of the purification of children and the cure of that which occurs to them due to circumcision.
Circumcision is not a solution to continuity in the same way as other wounds: but rather it is of our operation and our will, and that which occurs in it is properly in children, it is necessary that we assign in it a better operation and path more easily leading to health.
Therefore I say that the ancients did not write about circumcision in any of their books, because they did not use it in their laws, and it is only because we have acquired through experience, which is why many artists and barbers have found out to circumcise and purify with a razor and with torments; and they use ligatures with thread and incisions with the nail.
And you have already condemned all these methods and did not find better purification with razors, with ligatures with thread that in purification like the nail, because many times you have escaped the cord above, because the foreskin has two tunics, and the lower tone remains below, and it is soon forced to another incision and sure pain. And the purification which is made by alalfa, and is delicate, of which barbers use, is not guaranteed to be a secure incision at the extremity of the male member, because it soon enters into the wound itself.
But in the operation with nail, iron soon obstructs and corrupts your operation. And the cord of the child is short by nature, and many times they are so made that they do not need purification, and I have seen those.
But from the purification that is made with razors and ligatures with thread, I have discovered by experience that there is a flaw, because the razors are of proportional incision, therefore the acuity above is as much as the acuity below; and thus when you press your hand so proportionally on two acuities, and inscribe them according to one measurement in time; and it is made compression of the thread with a figure containing the cord of the penis from all parts, with which there is no error at all.
And the manner of the first operation is that you should make the child lie down as much as possible if it is one of those who understand a little, and not make anything except to tie the thread in its penis so only, and let it be for another day.
And accordingly make that child happy in all that manner which is possible to you according to the intelligence it receives. And accordingly make that child be between your arms most carefully prepared, and not at all anxious; and conceal the razors in your hand or leave them behind so that the child does not see those nor anyone else of the instruments.
And accordingly insert your hand into the penis of him and blow into the cord, and pull that in until it is out at the head of the penis, and accordingly purify that which is accumulated therefrom, from sordid things.
The form of the razors for purification, this is the form:
Be the extra tips not cutting and the others cutting, so that the ram of the key is not left, and the length of both edges be as much as the length of two equal hands.
But the error in purification is that soon you flee the internal cord entirely, or a part of it becomes detached from the incision.
Therefore, it is necessary that you stretch that of your hour with your nail in front of the apostema of the location and incise according to equality.
And if you cannot hold it with your nail, then accordingly extract that with a thread and incise it.
But if three days have passed and that which is inflamed below the penis has not subsided, then accordingly you should let it be until the apostema becomes calm, and excise that with facility, and incise that according to what is prepared for you.
And beware of the head of the penis, because it will not be at ease with this.
And accordingly cure that with the powder which consolidates wounds, as we have recounted in the treatise on powders.
And if it is incised with the cord according to measure, and obeys the parts above, then this will not be noticed by him.
And accordingly cure that with what we have said until it is healed.
Chapter LVIII.
Of the cure of retained urine in the bladder.
Retention of urine in the bladder is caused by oppression made by pain or by blood congested, or by a poultice or by flesh, and resembles those things that we have said about the ways of cure in the division.
And if it is not dissolved with what we have said, then the cause of the disease is violent and requires a strong treatment, accordingly it is necessary to administer an extraction from him with an instrument which is called syringe, the form of which is as follows: It should be made of silver and very fine thread, like a needle with a subtle tip in the shape of a palm and a half, with a thin cane at its head.
And the manner of extracting urine with this is that you take double thread and tie it in the extremity of the thread or cloth for good binding; and insert the extremities of the thread into the part below the ring, and inscribe with razors if there is any superfluous cause of the thread, but insert it into the needle with vehemence And accordingly, fill the ring with border and album of honey.
And make the patient sit on a stool, and envelop the bladder of him with warm oil, olive oil, and honey.
And accordingly insert the ring with facility until it reaches the root of the penis; and accordingly double the penis above to the part of the belly; and accordingly push the ring into that part; and accordingly push that part into the bladder, so that the patient is brought to the desired cure, and not made in the same way as this order, but rather in a manner that goes against tortuosity.
And accordingly stretch the thread with the cloth little by little, because the urine is eating away at the cloth.
And accordingly extract that and make it for urine cure, and use the ring, do not stop doing this and use the ring until the bladder is evacuated and the patient receives relief.
Chapter LIX.
Of the quality of catharticization of the bladder with clysteredra and similar instruments which are in accord with that.
When ulceration or apostema occurs in the bladder, or blood is congested in it, or the skin is constricted with poultice, and you want to make it distill waters and medicines in that place, then accordingly it should be done with an instrument which is called clampcedra, and this is its form:
except that at the extremity of it is deaf, so it is closed. And in that there are three holes: two from one side, like so many times.
In the beginning it is a concave space, in which is poured water that fills it up to the quantity needed, plus addition, until when any cause is drawn out of the humidities with it, and then it is drawn back, and when it is expelled long, according to how clampcedra acts, as is written naphta in the battles of the sea.
Therefore, when you want to extract humidities from the bladder, insert the extremity of clampcedra into the humidity, and draw out with it the water that is poured into the parts above, because the humidity is drawn into the concavity of clampcedra.
And accordingly insert the extremity of clampcedra into the penis according to what we have recounted in the ciringua; and accordingly pour out the humidity with water that pours it out, because that humidity comes to the bladder shortly, and the patient is cured thereby.
The form of the subtle clyster which is used to catheterize the bladder, and this is its form:
And it should be made of silver or lead, with the head being like a small feather, and below it a thin cane attached.
And accordingly take the bladder of a moving animal, and pause in it the humidity that you want to catheterize in the bladder, and accordingly tie it between two with a strong binding made of double thread, and heat that humidity over the fire.
And accordingly insert the extremity of the clyster into the penis.
And accordingly press your hand upon the bladder with the humidity, stretching downwards until the patient feels that that humidity has reached the bladder.
But if you do not have the bladder present, then accordingly take a bag of parchment and make from it a circle; and perforate that entirely around its circumference; and accordingly insert a strong thread into those holes, turning them over; and accordingly add the circle just as it is added also in such a way that you pause on that which you want from the humidities, and oils and waters.
And accordingly you tie that in the instrument and make it as you made for the bladder, and express with your hand until the humidity reaches the bladder.
Chapter LX.
Of the Extraction of Pain.
We have already said in the division the species of pain and cure of it with medicines, and the difference between pain generated in the lungs and pain generated in the bladder, and the signs of that.
And we have said the pain in which catches operation with hand and section.
And the pain generated in the bladder properly is that which is placed in the bladder.
And you will narrate that with manifest exposition and abbreviation.
So I say that the pain generated in the bladder mostly appears to children; and among its signs is that the urine which flows from the bladder is like water in its subtlety, and appears in that sand; and the patient frequently rubs his penis, and many times takes a step back, and accordingly it is dressed; and with this you will find the anus in the shape of those.
And it is more difficult to cure children of that until they have reached the age of 14 years; and it is a hard cure in old people. But in young people it is easier because it is between those.
And from that of which the pain is greater and the cure is lighter; And if it is little, it is contrary to that.
So, when we come to the cure of that, it is necessary at the beginning to purify the patient with a clyster which extracts all the fissure that is in his intestines; for that fissure sometimes prevents the evacuation of the pain from its inquiry.
And accordingly be pressed the patient with his own weights and be constricted and narrowed in his joints so that the pain descends to the root of the bladder, or jumps from one place to another occasionally.
And accordingly make that patient sit between your most prepared hands and those of him be left the things of his, so that the bladder is made to decline entirely to the parts below.
And accordingly cover all that with a covering.
So, if you feel the pain in space, then immediately cut yourself off from it with section upon it.
And if you do not feel completely the pressure of your touch, then it is necessary that you anoint with oil the indicated spot on your left hand, if the patient is a child, or the middle spot if he is a young adult, and insert that into his anus. And cover with oil of the pain until it remains below your said spot. And convert that little by little into the neck of the bladder.
And accordingly press upon that with your said spot, and expel it into the parts outside of the bladder at the location from which you made the section.
And command the servant to press the bladder with his right hand; and command another servant to stretch out her left arm towards the parts above, and with her other arm to relax the cord which is below the genitals, in the part of the location where the section is being made.
And accordingly insert an spatula which is incident, and this is its form: and cut through the flesh between the anus and genitals, not in the middle location, but above the left flank; and let the section be upon that pain and your said spot be on the anus, and let it be a transverse section, so that the section outside is wide and thin below according to the quantity of pain that has been evacuated, and no greater, for then little by little the flesh will compress your said spot which is in the anus, and forgets its defect.
And know that of the pain is some which has an angle and corners, for which the evacuation of it is made difficult by this.
And from that pain, there appears a node similar to a gland, and it is rounded, and it makes the evacuation of it lighter.
So, if it is that which has angles and corners, adjust it in the fissure.
And if it is not so forgotten, then accordingly you must gently press upon that, or strengthen upon that with decent gestures, the extremity of which should be as a file on which you would strengthen upon the pain, and not escape from it; or that you would insert below it a subtle instrument of curved extremity.
But if you cannot press upon that, then accordingly you must amplify the hole a little, and if you see a flow of blood, cut it off with strength using a vitriolated thread.
But if the pain is more than one, then at the beginning you will push your hand to the mouth of the bladder, and accordingly inscribe upon it; and accordingly push a little further on; and similarly do so if there are many more than two.
And if it is great pain, then ignorance is that you inscribe upon it with great section, for it happens to the patient one of two causes: either he dies or endures the continuous evaporation of urine, because of which the location is not entirely consolidated.
But administer expulsion from there until it is forgotten, or engineer in the fracture of it with razors until that comes out in pieces.
So, when you have completed your operation, then accordingly fill the wound with the juice of aloe and the blood of dragon, and strengthen that. And pause upon that cloth dipped in oil and vinegar, or in rough oil and cold water, so that the apostema may be cooled.
And accordingly repose the patient on his own pillow, and do not loosen the bond for three days.
And when that has been loosened, envelop the location with water and hot oil, and accordingly cure it with divine ointment and devilish ointment until it is healed.
But if in the wound there occurs an apostema that is cautious, adjusted and corrosive, and from it appears as if the blood is frozen in the bladder, and because of this the urine is prohibited (and this is known by the excretion of blood with urine), then accordingly insert your said spot into the wound and extract that blood, for if it remains, it will provoke the bladder to corruption of the bladder and putrefaction.
And accordingly wash the wound with vinegar, water and salt, and with opposition to all species, as is necessary for the cure, until it is healed.
And accordingly note in all the hours of the entire cure that you have laid and adjusted the medicines which are paused upon the location.
And if the pain is small and is in the head of the penis, and is stuck there, and the emission of urine is prohibited, then accordingly cure that with what I have recommended before you come to the section, for too many times by this cure you are accused of section; and now I have already tried this, and it is that you take a perforator of iron like an alfalfa, the form of which is as follows:
of triangular extremity, pointed, fixed in a wooden handle.
And accordingly take a thread, and tie it around the penis below the pain so that it does not return to the bladder.
And accordingly insert the iron into the penis, perforating with facility until the perforator comes to that pain. And accordingly revolve the perforator with your hand in that pain little by little, and you perforate the perforation of it until you make that from the other side penetrate; for the urine is soon abolished.
And accordingly press your hand upon that which is remaining of the pain from the departure outside of the penis, because it is torn, and it is forgotten with the urine, and the patient is healed.
But if this cure is not adapted to your equipment for any reason which prohibits it, then accordingly tie a thread below the pain, and another thread above the pain. And accordingly inscribe upon the pain in that penis between two ligatures. And accordingly extract that. And accordingly loosen the bond and purify the congealed blood which is formed in the wound.
And it is not necessary to tie the thread below the pain, but only so that it does not return to the bladder, and the other thread above, only because when the thread is loosened and approaches the evacuation of the pain, the cord returns to its place and closes the wound.
And therefore it is necessary for you when you tie the thread above, that you raise the cord to the parts above, or that you complete your said action, and close the wound as we have said.
Chapter LXI.
Of the Extraction of Pain from Women.
Pain in women is rarely generated.
But if there is pain in some of those (women), then it is difficult to cure it, and it is prohibited by many ways.
One of them is that the woman is too proud.
And the second one is that you do not find a woman well instructed that can recognize if she has been touched by a doctor when she is chaste, or is of women without husbands.
The third one is that you do not find a woman who knows this art, especially the operation with hand.
And the fourth one is that the location of the section on pain in women is too far from the location of the pain, so you need a deep section, and there is fear.
But if necessity prompts you to this, then accordingly take a woman who is well instructed, and not easily startled.
But if you are deprived of that, then accordingly seek out one who is quiet and subtle, or present a matronal woman well experienced in the nature of women, or a woman who has parted from this art.
So make her present and command him to do everything that you will tell him, from the inquiry about the pain to the beginning; which cause is that he looks if the woman is chaste, then accordingly put his said thing into her anus and ask for the pain.
So if you find that, cut it below his said thing, and then command him to inscribe upon it.
But if she is not chaste, then command the matron to insert his said thing into the anus of the patient and inquire about the pain, since he places his left hand on the bladder, and compresses it with a good compression.
So if you find that, then accordingly gradually relax it from the orifice of the bladder to the parts below with the sum of its virtue until it reaches the root of the canal.
And accordingly inscribe upon it the opposition of the middle of the anus to the root of the canal from which some part is brought to an end and centred in that part, and his said thing is not relaxed from the pain cut below.
And the section should be small at first; and accordingly insert the ray upon that section, and if you feel the pain, then adjust in section according to the quantity which you know will cause the pain to be removed from there.
And know that the types of pain are many: for some are small and great, and sharp and rough, and long and rounded, and with nodules.
So you know how many species there are of that for which you signify upon that which you will.
And if you see a flow of blood, adjust to the location with vitriol thread and tie it there for an hour until the blood is cut off, and then return to your operation so that the pain is forgotten.
And make sure you prepare with your own the instruments which are said in the extraction of pain in men, for so that you may be helped by them in your operation.
And if you see a flow of blood, and know that the expulsion of blood is from the wound that is inscribed, then you pause powder on the location and strengthen it with powder and strict descent, and do not iterate this; and leave the pain and do not extract it, for very soon the patient will die. And accordingly cure the wound.
And then when the sharpness of the blood has ceased after some days, and the location is healed, accordingly you return to your operation so that the pain is forgotten.
Chapter LXII.
Of the Section on Hernia Acuta.
Hernia aquosa is nothing but an aggregation of moisture in the white pouch which is below the cord of the genitals containing the fluid, and it is called a pouch.
And sometimes it is in the proper sac which nature has prepared for it in the part of the fluid, until another fluid is born; and it is the cord of the genitals between the white pouch which we have said, and it is not this but rather a tumor.
And the generation of this hernia is due to debility which occurs in the genitals, for it flows into them this material, and sometimes it happens through a blow made on the genitals.
And this humidity has many colors, for the color of it either declines to citrine or blood-red, or red, or is blackish-feculent, or white as water, and it is this which is most.
And the signs by which it is known where this accumulation of water is are these: for if it is in the white pouch which we have said, then the apostema is rounded and declining a little towards length, thus like the figure of a fluid, and appears the genitals, because the humidity contains that from all part.
And if the humidity is in the proper sac, then the apostema is rounded with the part of the fluid and therefore one estimates that it is another fluid.
And if the humidity is between the cord of the genitals and the white pouch, then cats are born below the sensation.
And when you want to know the nature of the color of the humidity, then accordingly you test the color of the humidity in the apostema with entromes which precede its form; and according to what is found in the vestige of the entromes, judge from that what is below it.
And then when we come to the cure of it with iron, accordingly command the patient to be flaccid if this is possible for you, and sometimes let his body please.
And accordingly it should be raised on the patient's back for some reason a little above, and pause below him many cloths.
And accordingly set yourself on the left side of him, and command the servant to follow on the right side of him, which stretches his arm to one of two sides to the cord of the genitals and to the part of the miracle of the belly.
And accordingly take a spatula and cut the cord of the genitals from the middle location by its length to the proximity of the pubic hairs.
And the section should be made according to right proportion, equally distant from the line that you must draw on the skin of the genitals, until it reaches the white pouch including.
And excavate that, and observe, and be careful for yourself so that you do not inscribe that; and your excavation with which you excavate by part below as it is suspended in the fluid most and subtly scrutinize the excavation according to the quantity as possible for you.
And accordingly pierce the white pouch full of water with a broad perforation, and extract all the water.
And accordingly separate between the two lips of the section with an incision, and extend the white pouch to the parts above; and do not touch the cord of the genitals including, and inscribe the white pouch in that manner which is possible for you. And accordingly inscribe that with its totality or in pieces, and mostly the subtle side, for if you do not scrutinize the inscription of it exquisitely, there is no certain guarantee that the water will not return.
But if the fluid proceeds from that outside of its cord in the time of your operation, then when you have completed the section of the white pouch, return to that and accordingly adjust the two lips of the cord of the genitals with suture, and accordingly cure that just as with other wounds, until it is healed.
And if you find the fluid corrupted by another disease, then accordingly you should ligate the vessels which are sore the suspensori, and extract the fluid, and accordingly cure that with what we have said.
But if the fluid is aggregated in two separate parts, then you should know that there are two hernias; therefore inscribe that part according to what you have done on the other in equal manner; and if it appears to be one operation, then you do it.
And accordingly you should wash the wound, and insert into the sections wool submerged in oil or rose-colored oil; and pause before another wool which you have submerged in wine and oil, and spread that over two genitals and the miracle of the belly; and pause above folded cloths and powder, and tie those above with a thread which is according to this form:
and accordingly be pressed two cloths and be filled with cuminated wool according to this likeness; and be made the extremities at which it is necessary to be cut off or moistened with wool, and be added to structure in the waistband of the breeches, and one of the extremities take from the backside to the back, and the other takes to the part of the pubic hairs, and two extremities above two canals below and two other extremities above two gonads, and all structure shall be adjusted in the waistband of the breeches.
And sometimes this hernia is medicated artificially with a cauter in place of section with iron; and it is that you take a cauter cutlery subtle and inscribe on it the cord of the genitals, and ignite it according to what we have recommended until the white pouch containing water is revealed, and then you take the cauter in this form: and it is assembled into Greek letter.
And accordingly pierce through that white pouch, and ignite until all the moisture has been drained out.
And accordingly extend the white pouch with an incision, and excavate with an incision, and excavate with a subtle cauter ignited; and inscribe that according to what is possible for you until you eradicate all of it; and be careful of the fluid so that the fire does not touch it.
And know that this operation is more saved and more distant from bleeding flux, and better than an operation with section.
But if you encounter an apostema contradiction in the hour of section or in the hour of cauterization, or bleeding flux, then accordingly you should cure which contradiction comes to you through this, with a cure which is suitable for him according to what is said.
But if the patient is poor and does not hope for a second operation due to its horribleness, then accordingly administer a perforation according to what we have recommended here; and it is when you are certified by that which we have said about the significations, that this hernia is watery.
And accordingly it is necessary that you should make the patient lie on some elevated stone, and then pierce the apostema in the lowest part of him with a spatula, and pause the perforation according to the length of his body.
And make the perforation broad so that it drains out all the water.
And accordingly pause on the location cut and tie it and leave it, so that it drains out the remaining water. And accordingly cure that until the wound is healed.
But if there is opposition to the evacuation of water at that hour you pierce it: and this is not done except for the reason that the white sac in the orifice of the wound makes opposition and prohibits the emission of water, then accordingly you should put into the wound a probe or instrument with which the water is extracted from the hydrocele, the form of which is preceded; or adjust on the surface of the wound a small one.
And know that the water returns, and is added accordingly about 6 months or thereabouts; and when it is aggregated, then accordingly it should be pierced in the same manner, so that the patient thus will pass his days.
Chapter LXIII.
Of the Section on Fatty Hernia and its Cure.
Know that in the section on this hernia there is fear of being lost to destruction in the greater dispositions; for which I have seen the departure from it and being saved through that better.
And you should remember the operation on this and the species of the apostemes.
Therefore I say that the apostemes are born in the bodies of those whose genitals are composed and it is done so for many reasons: or because of acute and bitter superfluity which is poured into the genitals, or because of a blow.
And it is the color of the apostema according to the color of the body, and not found in it pain, and it is a grave apostema.
And very often it is a fatty apostema, the color of which is dark, and there is no sensation to it.
And sometimes it is done through constriction of the vessels, and through inflammation of those things so that already the memory of it is perceived, or through inflammation of veins.
But this which is due to inflammation of vessels is known through the dissemination of the apostema when you compress it with those things said above; and it does not need that it touches.
But this which is due to inflammation of vein is not disseminated from it by any cause through compression with those things.
And it is possible that on this species a section may be made and on the other fleshes; and it is that you inscribe the cord of the genitals, and accordingly stretch the fluid to the upper parts, and extract it from the white pouch, and deliver the suspensori of the vessels, and tie them, and inscribe the suspensori more than what you deliver from all part of the fluids of the womb.
Therefore if the fluid is already consolidated in those fleshy parts, then accordingly you should extract the fluid and inscribe it.
And if there is adhesion due to some cause of the white pouch or between what is between the vessels, then accordingly you should deliver all that adhesion and inscribe it with a rounded inscription.
But if there is a natural growth of flesh in the location of the adhesion which is behind, then accordingly you should inscribe all that is from it and extract the fluid as we have said.
Therefore when your operation is completed, then accordingly fill the wound with wool impregnated in rose-colored oil and wine; and then cure it with another cure until it is healed.
Chapter LXIV.
Of the Cure of Hernia which is of Vine.
Vine is an aposteme enveloped by some kind of wrapping similar to a bud in the softening of the testicles, and it is done with difficult movements exercised and walking about the patient.
And in the cure of this illness, it is due to fear because of that which is preceded by remembrance.
However, it is necessary to say operation on that according to what the first ones did.
And I say that it is necessary to make the patient lie on an elevated stone; and accordingly impale the suspensori of the testicles at the parts below; and accordingly tie the cord of the genitals with those things said above, which are proved by the rod; and have another minister with you, and extend those things with vehement extension.
And accordingly inscribe with a spatula broad and straight for a transverse section in the right of the vessels, until the vessels are uncovered.
And accordingly excavate from all part as we have said above in extraction of artery which are in the temples.
And accordingly put an needle in those which is faithful double, and tie it at the first place of the places where it happens to be vine, and tie it another time at the last place of theirs. And accordingly inscribe those in the middle location with a straight section according to the length of the body, and extract that which is added from the putrid and corrupted humors.
And accordingly cure the wound with a cure of other wounds in which you want to be generated for that reason that the vessels which nourish one of two genitals may not fall, because it is not evil for that.
But if the vine affects all the vessels, then accordingly it is necessary to remove the testicles or for the testicles to be severed from the vessels, in order that it may be deprived of all nourishment through the constriction of the vessels, and that they may become atrophied, or that it becomes so that there is no longer sustenance with them.
Chapter LXV.
Of the Cure of Intestinal Hernia.
The advent of this hernia is by a section that enfolds in the white pouch extended over the belly from the parts of the gonads of the miraculous womb, so that those bags of rupture fall into some of the bags.
And this rupture is either of the white pouch or of excess of fluid, and it occurs in these two species for many reasons: or because of a blow, or because of sound, or because of noise, or because of elevation of some grave cause, or because of likenesses.
And the sign of this is when it occurs gradually over a long time, and does not occur suddenly, and it is an aposteme which grows evenly into the preceding part because the white pouch compresses the bag.
And the sign of it is when it occurs by section of the white pouch, because at first it makes sudden and vehement pain; and it is an aposteme which appears different from what was previously apparent, and this is due to the emission of the bag, and the body of it towards the parts above the white pouch.
And sometimes it is forgotten with the bag, and it is called this intestinal hernia, also known as zirbal.
And sometimes it is made with ventosity, and sometimes it runs in the bag's cleft, and stays there, and that is where great peril lies for the patient, and sometimes it causes a wicked and more intense pain when it is pressed.
And in the cure of the species of this illness with iron, there is fear, because it is necessary to avoid the caustic agent in that.
And the manner of the operation of that is that you command the patient to relax the bag with their own hand towards the parts inside their conquest if they obey your returnment, and accordingly be placed on top of his shoulder between your thighs, and raise the knees of him.
And accordingly tie the cord which joins the cord of the testicles to the parts above, and inscribe the cord of the testicles all along; and accordingly place it in two lips of the section incision as you need to irrigate the section with those.
And if the section is according to the quantity that is possible for you, so that all the fluid is forgotten from that.
And accordingly excavate those pouches which are below the cord of the testicles, until the white pouch is uncovered from every part.
And accordingly, you should intervene with your own hand in that which is said to be the testicle, between the white pouch and the one which is below the cord of fluid, and between the white pouch and the second one, and absolve from that adhesion which is in the part behind the fluid.
And accordingly, you should take hold of the cord of the testicles with your hand and extend the white pouch in its own direction with your left hand, and raise the fluid with the white pouch to the part of the section; and command the minister to extend the fluid upwards and you dissolve the adhesion that is behind with complete solution.
And accordingly, I say that there should be no cause for the bag to be enveloped in the white pouch hard. But if you find any cause from it, then accordingly you should impale that into the belly below.
And accordingly, you should inscribe in the part below the cord of the testicles with a section from which blood and pus may flow as we have recommended above.
And accordingly, you should administer wool immersed in oil and stop at the wound; and administer the binding which we have recommended (and sometimes the white pouch is cauterized, which we have said to be inscribed with caution against bleeding flux, because many times it occurs) and leave the binding until it falls by itself.
But if the bleeding is delayed, then accordingly cold water should be poured on it, and pause over that until it falls as we have said.
And accordingly, cure the wound with another cure of wounds until it is healed.
Chapter LXVI.
Of Hernia Ventosa.
In this hernia, there is no one who has been bold in the cure of it with iron.
And the first ones said that it is made as we have recommended in the hernia which is with wine; which is that you lay the vessels accordingly above the section on that with facilitation of the fluid; and accordingly, cut off the middle part around the aposteme with water that opens up to those vessels.
And cure the wound according to what we have said until it is healed.
Chapter LXVII.
Of the Disproportion which is made in the Gonads.
Sometimes a rupture occurs in the gonads as we have said, and emerges the location.
And there is no cause for the genitals of the bags to be affected by the testicles; and if there is, it is little; and returns again in all hours.
But if the time is prolonged with this, there is a fissure adjusted in the white pouch so that it descends into the white pouch; and this occurs because of the extension of the white pouch which is in the gonads as we have said, which cause is that the white pouch is stretched and becomes softened and the location becomes apostematized and emerges.
And the cure for this is with a cauterization as we have previously described.
And sometimes it is cured with iron according to this manner: and that the patient lies on his back between your thighs, and accordingly cuts off the location of the rupture of the apostemes which emerges by section along the latitude according to the quantity of three threads.
And accordingly, strengthen the white pouch that is below the cord until it is uncovered.
And accordingly, take a needle and pause it over the elevated location of the white pouch, and press that onto the abdomen.
And accordingly, close the two elevated locations on the extremity of the needle of the white pouch, and adjust with the suture one to the other.
And accordingly, extract the extremity of the needle, and do not inscribe the entire white pouch, nor extend the fluid, nor any other cause as you have learned in the cure of intestinal hernia.
And accordingly, cure that with the cure of wounds, and as you inscribe the threads, cleanse it and restore the wound until it is consolidated; for the white pouch is contracted and the prominence of rupture is not adjusted.
And cauterization is better in this location, since it is more conducive to health.
Chapter LXVIII.
Of the Softening of the Cord of the Testicles.
Many times the cord of the testicles in some men is softened because the flesh that is between it is softened, and it becomes fat for consideration.
Therefore it is necessary for the one who is treating this to make the patient lie on his back and inscribe all the cord which is softened onto the natural cord; and accordingly, adjust two lips with the suture.
And if you wish, cut off in the beginning the superfluity of the softened cord with three or four cauterizations and a firm suture.
And accordingly, inscribe between the sutures; and accordingly, cure by the cure of other wounds until it is healed and the threads fall.
Chapter LXIX.
Of Castration.
Know that castration in our law is excommunicated, but by reason it is written to me that I remember of it in this book; and it is not necessary to recall it except for two methods, one of which is because of the science of the doctor when he is inquired about it, who knows the cure of it which occurs; and the other method is that we many times have needed castration of other beasts for our uses from those, such as horses, and oxen, and pigs, and similar to animals.
And therefore I say that castration is done in two ways: either by ablation or by incision at section.
But in that which is done by ablation, the way of the operation is that we make the beast lie down in cold water until its testicles are softened and relaxed and hang. And accordingly, take those with your hand into the water so that they are resolved and do not appear below the touch.
But in castration done by incision and section, you must have the beast and press the cord of the testicles with your left hand.
And accordingly, tie the suspenders and inscribe on each fluid with one section so that two fluids proceed.
And accordingly, inscribe those more than you will excise. And do not leave any cause on those of the white pouch, except for the subtle white pouch which is above the vessels.
And this manner of castration is better which is done by ablation, for ablation leaves very little cause of the testicles so that the beast does not desire to copulate.
And accordingly, cure the wound until it is healed.
Chapter LXX.
Of the Cure of Hermaphrodites.
Hermaphrodites in men are according to two manners: one is when it appears in what space there is between the cord of the testicles, where a female figure is formed as if it were a womb, and this has a male and female part.
And sometimes from that there flows urine which is in the cord of the testicles.
But in women, there is one species: and it is that the womb of the woman over the pubis is as if two testicles of a man are joined together in a little less than half the part above, like the perineum of a man and two testicles.
And the cure is of three species: one from the men and two from the women. And it is that you must inscribe those adjusted flesh parts so that the fear of that is removed, and accordingly cure those with the cure of other wounds.
And in the second species of men from which urine flows which is in the cord of the testicles, there is no cure or operation for that.
Chapter XXI.
Of Linting and Eminence of Flesh due to Causes of Women.
Linting is very little adjusted on natural causes until it is stretched and made firm the consideration; and sometimes it is magnified in some women to such an extent that it spreads like in men and pours into copulation.
Therefore, you must have the superfluity of linting with your hand or with an instrument and inscribe it.
And do not leave any inscription, especially in the region of the rectum, so that the flow of blood is not interrupted.
And accordingly, cure that with the cure of wounds until it is healed.
But born flesh is flesh that comes from the loins of the mother until it fills up, and very little is issued to the parts above according to the semblance of a hen (and for this reason we also call this “diseased generation”); therefore, you must inscribe it as I inscribe linting, and cure it until it is healed.
Chapter LXXII.
Of the Cure of Hysteria.
Hysteria is when the womb of the woman is not perforated or is only slightly pierced. And it is either natural or accidental.
Accidental is due to disease that has preceded, and it is caused by flesh not well adjusted or by a subtle white pouch or thickening.
And it is caused in the lower back of the mother, or in the sides of her, or in the upper part of her womb, or in the lower part of her womb, and it prohibits coition and pregnancy and childbirth, and very little permits menstruation.
And the knowledge of this is done by consideration of the meter, if the oppression is apparent, propounded; but if it is not apparent, you must search for it with the said threads or with a needle.
But if oppression is due to a subtle white pouch and it is propounded on the two lips, you must cut and break that.
And it is that you pause above the two lips of dust, and accordingly pause the said threads indicating both the upper and lower masses.
And the woman should be on her back, her legs extended, and accordingly extend the two lips with force until that subtle white pouch is broken and the oppression is opened.
And accordingly, take wool and dip it in oil and pause it on the location, and make the patient lie down at home that day so that the location is not consolidated.
But if the white pouch is thick and dense, you must inscribe it with a spatula or with myrtle leaves.
But if the oppression is due to inflammation, you must suspend that with an instrument, and inscribe it.
And take the medicines that make cease the flow of blood without scratching, such as aconitum, and blood of dragon, and gallbladder, adjusted with album of hen.
And accordingly, administer a leaden cannula widely so that the wound is not slightly consolidated.
And keep it for some days and administer cold water of lily.
And accordingly, be cured with the other cure of consolidation until it is healed.
And sometimes it happens in the natural birth of other flesh, and you must inscribe according to this manner. But if it is due to gangrenous aposteme, there should be no contradiction with iron in any manner.
Chapter LXXIII.
Of the Cure of Hemorrhoids and Tail and Red Bottom that occur in the Womb of Women.
Hemorrhoids are a prolapse of many veins until those flow blood continuously; and when old hemorrhoids are formed, they become hardened.
And I have said in the division the species of those and their signs, and will also say which receive cure and which do not receive cure.
Therefore I say that hemorrhoids and hardened veins when they are in the lower back of the mother and do not appear to the sense, therefore in those there is no cure with iron.
But those that are in the opening of the mother above which one senses, are those that can be cured.
And you must put the woman in a warm place and accordingly extend the hardened veins with forceps or with rough cloth and inscribe them with the roots.
And accordingly, powderize on those the flow of blood with one of the inscribable powders without scratching, such as aconitum and similar to those.
And accordingly, press the patient's feet for an hour, and accordingly pause that in cold water.
And if the flow of blood persists, then make that person drink a decoction of samarang and scorched millet and mallows and similar things.
And accordingly, take oat flour and comfort that with honey and vinegar and make an ointment with water on the back of him.
And if the blood is absorbed, it is good; and otherwise, make adhere to two blisters, and to the nipples with scarification.
And accordingly, take wool and submerge it in the juice of colocynth or in the juice of argemone or in the juice of guaiacum with vinegar and make adhere to the place; and accordingly, cure the place with poultices until it is healed.
And cure that until it is healed.
Chapter LXXIV.
Of the Perforation of Accidental Bleeding in the Womb.
Many species of accidental apostemes occur in the womb, such as gangrenous and lapidated aposteme, ulcers, adhesion, erpetromen, fistula hemorrhoids, red bottoms, hardened veins, and other apostemes. And I have said these illnesses and their species and signs, and the cures for them in the division.
And it is fitting that you say in this treatise of aposteme caustic which appears in the womb when it is one of the apostemes that college together to heal, and if you wish to know in what manner the operation is done with iron.
Therefore it is fitting that you consider if the pain of the aposteme in its beginning is acute with percussion and flux and fever, and sometimes blenches and if one senses above that a sensation, then do not cut with perforation of iron, and cure that with water which helps on maturity until the acuity of accidents ceases.
And accordingly it is fitting that you make the woman lie on a bed which has two mattresses; and recline her on her back and adjust her feet to the part most distant from the womb, and have her legs expanded, and pause her arms below her nails, and tie each one with a ligament to water suitable.
And accordingly the midwife follows the right path and administers the instrument with which the opening of the womb is opened, the form of which will come in those causes that are made to follow.
And accordingly when you wish to administer this instrument, you must make it with the ray of the back of the woman's womb, and that which is entered into the womb from the instrument should not be more than the back of the womb and lead the patient. But if the instrument is greater than the back of the womb, then it is fitting that you powderize on the texture of the back of the womb so that the introduction of any instrument into the back of the womb is prohibited.
And accordingly you must powderize the vertex that runs on the instrument from above and down, and the minister should hold the instrument and turn the vertex until the opening of the womb is opened.
And when the excitement appears, and it is touched with the hand and is warm and moist, then you must cut that with a spatula at the head of him.
And when the discharge is evacuated, then you must powderize on the wound a compress soaked in rose oil or green oil which has some stimulating quality; and pause the pressure in the section on the back of the womb.
And accordingly, pause above the mother and on the pubic hair a clean wool soaked in water in which mulberries have been boiled.
And accordingly, be cured after two days with poultice which is suitable for that until it is healed.
And sometimes the mother is washed and the wound similarly as it is anointed with water and honey, and accordingly anointed with water in which the root of lily or aristolochia longa has been boiled, and accordingly returns to the poultice.
And if the wound is deep in the mother's womb, then it is fitting that you are prohibited from the cure of him with iron, having cured that with water as we have said in the division.
Chapter LXXV.
To teach midwives how to medicate children when they are born with a non-natural figure.
A necessary cause is that the midwife knows at the beginning the figure of natural childbirth by signs from her, and it is that when you see the woman expel at the parts below and desire to smell the air, and above it is inclined due to what is on her part, and hasten the extraction of the child, then you will know that this part is according to natural figure, and it is the extraction of him over his head, and the second birth with that or suspended or pendulous from the umbilicus.
Therefore, when you see those signs, then it is fitting that the belly of him be compressed so that the child descends slightly because when they descend upon his head, they give to him the second birth, and it is cleansed from those superfluities with good cleansing.
But that which is another this part is non-natural and not to be approved, because when the child is born with his feet and the body of him is born before his head and his feet, and one hand or at the foot. i.e. or is born with his head and one hand or at the belly of him, and very little is converted on his back, and similar to the figures that are not to be approved.
Therefore, it is necessary for the midwife to be wise and subtle in all those causes, and to guard against error and deception.
And I am showing the whole figure of those, and what sign is in those so that it may be signified by this and has been on top.
When the child is born on top of its head through natural eccentricity, and it is vehement upon the woman and has made a difficult part for him, and sometimes the virtue of him is already debilitated, then make that person drink, or have women give to him, and evaporate the womb with henbane and humus oil.
And accordingly introduce the midwife between the said spatula small and a fissure with that second birth, or cut that with her own fingernail until it runs with water which is in it of humidity. And press the belly of the woman until it gives birth to the child.
But if it does not give birth, then it is fitting that the woman be anointed with a poultice of pimpernel and a poultice of fenugreek with camomile.
And accordingly command him to you, and command the anointing, that it be compressed and make her sneeze with conditions; and tie the mouth of him and his nose for one hour, because the child will soon be forgotten.
And if the two arms of the child are forgotten at the beginning, then it is fitting that you reduce them with little ease little by little. But if it does not obey the instrument, then you must pause the woman on a bed and lift her feet up, and accordingly conceive the bed on the earth; and the woman is to be held so that she does not fall under the concussion.
And if the arms are not returned and the child dies, then you must inscribe those and extract the remains of the child or tie the body to the hand with cloth and extract that with equality, because it will soon be forgotten.
When the child is born on its feet, then it is fitting that you push them inwards, and accordingly convert the child little by little, and accordingly make equal that part, and accordingly take one foot of him and stretch those little by little.
But when they are born into the thighs, then you must command him to come out, and make her sneeze with conditions, because it will soon be forgotten if God so wills.
And if it is not forgotten as we have recounted, then you must return the child little by little until it comes to the second birth according to natural figure, because it will soon be forgotten with easier extraction.
And if it is prohibited according to all that we have recounted, then you must take musellage of althea and dissolved gum, and beat everything in the mortar for good beating, and accordingly line with water the womb of the woman, as far down as the belly of her. And accordingly make that person drink in tepid water until they achieve the hips.
And when the parts below of him are softened, then make him inhale the vapor of myrtle and pause that for him. And when the sub-fumigation has lasted for an hour, then make her lie on a bed, and accordingly make her sneeze and stretch her mouth, and lift that away from her, and press the lower part of the belly of her with gentle compression, because the child will soon be forgotten.
The Birth of the Child Lateral to One of Its Arms. Be guided in the reduction of her arm, but if you cannot reduce that, then lift the woman and make her walk.
And if she cannot walk, then make her lie on the light, and conceive the thighs of her with strong concussion, and accordingly administer those which you have recounted of poultices.
And if the childbirth is over, then make her lie on a bed, and accordingly study the reduction of the arm, and equalize the child according to natural figure, and make her sneeze and command him to compress himself until it is forgotten.
The Birth of the Child with its arms expanded and the flesh of him at the two sides of his right side. It is fitting that the midwife hold the arm of the child and accordingly rotate it little by little, and equalize that with ease.
And when it is and as much as is equalized, then pause over the womb of her that which we have recounted of oil and poultices.
And accordingly command him to sneeze little by little, and when you have done that, then make her lie on a bed and command him to be inclined over the right side, and accordingly command him to compress himself; and make her sneeze with conditions. The Exit of the Prepared Foetus from the Right Side.
When it comes to the horror of the right side according to this manner, consider, and accordingly you must inscribe the second birth with your own fingernail until it is evacuated from humidity.
And if the child is suspended over the face and neck of her, then you must inscribe that from the navel, in order that it may not be retained and die.
And accordingly push the child into the lower parts until it comes out according to what is fitting, and command the woman to compress herself sometimes, and if God so wills, it will soon be forgotten with easier extraction.
The Exit of Twins or Multiple Foetuses. Know that sometimes twins are born, and occasionally three or four, but this is rare and not to be wondered at; however there are causes that are natural, and not living.
And contain those, whether they are multiple or not, one second birth, and separate them by caesarean section, distinguish those from the bond in the umbilical cord of each of them; and sometimes some are forgotten thus as is one child for easier natural extraction, and some are extracted sometimes through non-natural extraction just as we have recounted.
And if some of them are difficult to deliver and come to what we have said about non-natural figures, then you must cure those just as we have recounted.
And if the midwife is subtle and does that which facilitates and subtlety, and with delay, and is guided according to all figure as it is prepared by the ingenuity leading to salvation.
Recollection of that which is formed in the womb from embryos and is aborted.
Some women are found to be fertile in one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, and even up to ten months, and you should verify that a woman aborts at the sixth month, while another conceives again with all the numbers, which is caused by measurement of the wise sages.
And all this is to be in the science of the midwife because it is very similar to that, and therefore pause at that with what is fitting.
Chapter LXXVI.
On the Extraction of the Child when it is Dead.
When you cure the dead child with what we have said in the division of medicine and it is not otherwise extracted, and you are forced to use operation with force, then it is fitting that you consider whether the woman is of good virtue and not affected by any of the accidents by which perilous loss may occur upon her.
Then it is fitting that the woman be inclined over a bed on her back, and her head lowered down and her thighs raised.
And the minister must hold that in two parts or tie it in a bed for so that her body does not stretch out during the extraction of the child.
And accordingly moisten the mouth of her with oil and with humus oil and with poultice of althea and fenugreek and with seed of lily.
And accordingly anoint the midwife's hand with those oils and poultices, and accordingly introduce her hand with ease into the mother, and accordingly search for the exact location where the fingers should be placed on the child.
And when the location is convenient: then you consider whether the child is prepared to come out over its head, and accordingly place your fingers in the holes of it, or on the neck, or mouth, or palate, or below the chin, or at the furcula, or in the places proper to the chest, or below the hips.
But if the delivery is over the feet, then in the navel, or in the middle of the chest.
And it is fitting that you have the finger on the right hand, and pause the curvature of it at that location which is between the fingers of the left hand, and introduce the hand with ease and place the finger in one of those locations which we have said, until you arrive at the cause of birth.
And accordingly pause and place another finger, or the third if necessary, in order that there may be equal attraction, and not extension only according to its straightness.
And thus it is good at all parts, in order that the extraction of him may be facilitated just as it is done in a tooth for the eradication of it.
And it is fitting in that which is between them that the extension be softened; and if some part of him is retained, then it is fitting that the midwife anoint some of her fingers with oil and introduce those expertly and revolve around what is retained.
Therefore, if the part of the child is forgotten, then it is fitting that the fingers be permeated into the place where it is more high; and make thus until the whole child is forgotten.
But if the hand is extracted before the other, and it is not possible to reduce that by the contraction of him, then it is fitting that a cloth be wrapped around that; and accordingly extract that until all is forgotten, and inscribe that either in the junction of the hand or in the thigh.
And thus it is fitting to do so in the other hand and in both feet.
But if the head of the child is large, or there occurs contraction in the extraction, or the water is adjusted in the head of it, then it is fitting that you insert between the fingers the spatula with spines and split the head and drain the water, or displace that with one instrument which is called "alundat", whose form will come from the forms of other instruments in the chapter which is apropos to this.
And similarly do so if the child is naturally large-headed: and it is fitting that you inscribe that with an instrument called "algemat", or take that with an "alundat" just as we have said; and accordingly extract the bones with forceps.
And if the head is extracted and is contracted at the furcula, then it is fitting that it be split into so that the humidity which is in the pelvis may be poured out.
But if it is not complicated, nor obedient to extraction, then it is fitting that you inscribe the head at once according as it will be possible for you.
And if the remains of the womb are apostemated or are in a state of dropsy, then it is fitting that you perforate it until the humidity which is in it runs out.
But if the child is on its feet, then it is fitting that the attraction of it be light and the direction of it to the mouth of the mother be light.
But if it is contracted in the womb and pelvis, then it is fitting that you extract it with cloth which you will wrap around your hand, and that you split the womb and pelvis into so that the water which is in them may flow out.
But if the other members are still and turn back the head, then it is fitting that you insert your left hand; but if the mouth of the mother is swollen, then insert your right hand into the prepuce of layre, and search for that head, and draw it towards those fingers into the mouth of the mother, and accordingly introduce one finger, or two fingers, and attract him with those.
And if the mouth of the mother is contracted by apostema and it causes trouble to you, then it is fitting that you do not trouble yourself about it; before it is fitting to administer an effusion of humid and greasy causes. And administer poultices; and follow the patient with waters that soften and moisten.
And if the child is on its own chest, then it is fitting that it be pierced: and anointed with water as we have said in the living child.
And if this is not possible, then it is fitting that it be inserted into a pot and extracted.
And it is fitting that you leave no cause behind the second birth.
And when you have completed all your operation, then administer the water as we have said for the cure of apostemes which occur in the mother.
And if there occurs a flow of blood, then you should induce it into astringent waters and administer the other cure.
And you have already seen a woman in whose womb was a dead child, and accordingly on that same spot another pregnancy had begun, and accordingly the dead child is the other. It happened to him that a long time ago an apostema occurred in his navel; and it swelled up into a hot inflammation, and began to discharge pus.
And you were called upon to cure him, and treated him for a long time, and the wound was not consolidated.
Then I placed over him some poultices of strong attraction, and extracted from him a bone, and accordingly after some days, another bone was extracted; and I was very astonished, since in the womb there is no bone.
And then I thought that they were the bones of the dead child.
Therefore I bandaged the wound, and extracted from him many bones, the woman existing in her usual dispositions, and already living in such a manner for a long time, bore a small child.
And I did not marvel at this being strange, but because in this is science and aid to that which the physician by art and skill administers with his hands for healing.
Of the forms of the instruments that are necessary to extract the child.
The shape of the uterus, which is opened up in the mother:
This is the shape of a strengthener in which are joined the liberties, at which joining there are two uteruses in two extremities of two feet. But this uterus must be made more subtle than the strictor, and made of ebony or boxwood.
And the latitude of each stick is two fingers and a margin on both sides, one finger, and in the middle part of two sticks are two adjustments made by those sticks which are already fixed, of which the length is half a palm and a little more, and the latitude of each is two fingers or a little more.
And these two adjustments are inserted in the mouth of the mother so that it is opened up with them when you revolve the two prescribed uteruses.
Another shape similar to that, more subtle and lighter:
Is made of ebony or boxwood sticks according to the likeness of forceps. But in the extremity of it there are two additions like that, and the length of those additions is one palm, and the latitude of each is two fingers.
And when you want to open the mother with those, then you must place the woman on a bed, her feet hanging down, and open up what is between her thighs. And accordingly place your hand on the instrument, as you would with forceps, in equal measure according to the quantity you want of the appreciation of the mouth of the mother until she does what you want.
The shape of the uterus which they called the "ancients":
The shape of a prompter, with which the child is prompted:
The shape of a reducer, with which the large head is reduced:
And it is assembled to forceps, with which there are teeth at the extremity, like times, and some times it is made long like forceps according to this shape, like times, with which there are teeth like the teeth of a saw, into which it is inserted and reduced. The shape of a reducer little:
The shape of a finger with one spine:
The shape of a finger with two spines:
The shape of a spatula having two extremities, with which the head is split:
The shape of two broad spatulas:
All those instruments are exercised, and when more species of that and prepared by the artists, as much is easier for their operation and higher than what men can do by their quantity.
And you must not omit to use those instruments in any case, for the necessity of them is not excusable.
Of the extraction of the second birth.
When the second birth is retained, then it is fitting that you command the woman to retain her breath, and accordingly make her cough, and strengthen your hand on the mouth of her and on her nose, and if by this means it is brought out, well it is.
And if not, then take a cloth and perforate it in the lid of a casket and pause on that herb which burns the mouth of the mother, like calamus and rue and anise and camomile and Arabic scordium and cassia wood and saint-honorius. All these herbs or some of them are submerged in water in the cloth, and pause it on the fire.
And accordingly place a cane made of hemp in the mouth of the mother, and hold it until the vapor comes to the concavity of the mother.
And accordingly make her cough as we have said, and the second birth is brought out quickly.
But if this cure does not work and the second birth is not brought out, then you command the midwife to immerse her left hand in sassafras oil or in a mixture of altaica, and accordingly insert it into the womb and seek out the second birth, and when you have found it, then take it and extend it little by little. But if it is annexed in the prepuce of the mother, then insert your hand according to what we have recounted, and when you have found the second birth, extract it gradually, according to rectitude, so that the mother does not faint from the vehement attraction. Beforehand, it is fitting that it be permeated into the right and left sides with ease.
And if the mouth of the mother is contracted, we have already recounted the cure with coughing and medication with the cloth and herbs.
But if it is not brought out by all the causes which we have recounted, then beware that you do not fatigue yourself in iteration of abstraction, but rather it is fitting that what has issued from there to the mouth of the mother lies at the side of the woman, and accordingly anoint it with enguent and tetra-pharmaceutical; for this will make it rot after a few days and be dissolved and brought out.
But when it rots, it rises to the bad authority of the head and stomach, and this leads the patient; and then it is fitting that sub- fumigations and conveniences should be administered according to what.
But some of the Ancients have already been proven to use sub-fumigation with Nazitor and dried figs.
The shape of an instrument by which the woman is sub-fumigated for the retention of menses and second birth:
Is made of beaver or earthenware.
And is placed the subtle extremity in the womb and the wide extremity over the fire, and the sub-fumigation is placed over the arms of the fire.
And hold it until that sub-fumigation is consumed and another iteration occurs.
Of the cure for the child's unperforated navel.
Many children are born with navels that are not perforated, which are covered with a subtle and opaque film. Then it is fitting for the midwife to pierce with her finger that film; and if not, pierce it with a sharp spatula, and take care not to touch the navel.
And accordingly apply some lanolin infused in wine and oil; and accordingly cure that with unguent until it is clean.
But if you fear that it may be obstructed, then place a tube in the wound for many days, and remove it when the child will desire to evacuate.
And if there is obstruction of the navel due to consolidation of wound or aposteme; then it is fitting that this consolidation be pierced, and accordingly cured with water as we have said for the cure and with lead.
Of the cure for the fistulas which are left behind.
The fistulas that are left behind in the departure, which are lower down and thicker, and those that are located near the navel outside or in the space of one part.
And it is a single fistula or multiple ones.
And when that swelling is antiquated and flows with white or subtle pus, and some of these fistulas are penetrating.
And those that are penetrating are known by what is issued from them through the egress and ventilation; and sometimes the patient uses the egress, and then a little blood is issued from them.
And some of those fistulas penetrate into the space and enter the bladder, and into the urethra of the penis; and some of those that are penetrating enter the juncture of the thigh and into the notch of the hip.
And the way to know whether a penetrating fistula enters the navel and does not penetrate is that you place your finger inside the navel, and then carefully introduce a thin probe made of earthenware or iron into the fistula when there is no resistance.
But if there is resistance in that, then insert into it a subtle probe made of lead or the fur of a horse until you feel the probe or the fur on your finger.
And if you do not feel it at all or there is no passage of the tube from any cause of emission, blood, or ventilation, just as we have said, then you will know that it is non-penetrating, and accordingly, consult with the cure.
And when the fistula is penetrating into the bladder or into the urethra of the penis, then the significance of it is issuing forth with urine from that place and prohibition of it to such an extent that the location where medicine is consolidated.
But if it is penetrating into the juncture of the thigh or into the bone and causing intense pain in the circuit, then the sign of it is that the probe will enter here if there is no resistance in the bone, and intense pain in the circuit of the departure; and that from there pus will flow constantly; and that it does not take with that medication, nor is consolidated with unguent.
And in all those penetrating fistulas there is not complete cure, and the cure of them is the toil and vexation of the learned physicians on which we have fixed.
But in that which is not penetrating and does not decay, the healing with iron is expected according to what I have recounted and proved.
And it is that the patient lies down between your knees above his or her back and raises their legs up to yours, with the thighs sloping towards the belly of the patient, and accordingly inserts a probe made of lead or earthenware into the fistula if there is resistance, until you know the location where the probe fits.
And if the patient feels pain around the navel, then it is fitting that you insert your finger into the navel.
And if you feel the probe already having gone in and penetrating, or if you feel between your finger and that siphac or flesh, then you will certainly know that it is penetrating; and accordingly, do not trouble yourself with it, as we have said.
But however, some people may say that it cures in some cases, although it may not always be so.
And the medicine by which one hopes for improvement in that is that you make a subtle cauterization according to the size of the fistula, just as has been preceded, and then insert that ignited substance into the fistula until it pervades around the navel; and accordingly repeat this process two or three times until you know that all those adjusted fleshy parts that are resembling the quill of an eagle have been adjusted.
And accordingly cure that with calques wrapped in parchment until all those adjusted fleshy parts are cooked; and accordingly cure that with medicines that generate and consolidate flesh, and if it is cured, well it is; and if not, then it will not be cured in any time through another cure.
And if the probe goes in and does not penetrate into the navel which is in the navel, and between that and the probe which is a subtle specer of flesh or film, and the fistula is opened on that surface where the codon is, then dry the codon from the beginning of the fistula, and you see drying with the probe, and it is in the fistula until the drying reaches the location where the extremity of the probe emerges, and by the probe is freed and cut.
And accordingly, cleanse those fleshy parts that are gathered like the quill of an eagle and do not remain from any cause.
But if the flow of blood comes and goes between you and your operation when you are cleansing those fleshy parts, then take a mile that is and use the least painful instrument to cauterize with fire or sharp medicine, for cauterization with fire adjusts two good habits: it adjusts the adjustment of those adjusted fleshy parts, and abscizes the blood excess of humidities.
And accordingly, cure that with calques wrapped in parchment or in three-fold cloth until the wound gets its breadth, and accordingly, cure the wound with unguents of hard flesh that generate and consolidate.
And such medicines which have astringency and excess; when it is restored, then it is healed and you do not fear relapse.
But if the fistula has penetrated into the perineum of the navel and is elongated from its surface on the body, then insert your finger into the navel and investigate with that.
And therefore, if you find the probe and it is subtly of film or flesh, and is propitious to penetration, then there is no operation in that place except according to the way of faith and hope.
The cause is to administer in that place one of three ways: either to cauterize it as we have said; or to dry it out until you achieve the conquest of that place so that it is possible for you to insert some and apply the propitious cure; and do not proceed with drying because you do not want to insert the navel containing the belly, and what happens is that the patient's will is expressed; and accordingly, cure that with water as we have said, because very soon it will be healed; or elongate that film and cleanse that pus that dries out there into the propitious place, just as we have said, either with a probe or another instrument of sharp extremity, and accordingly cleanse those fleshy parts fistulated which are in the drying process until you can perform percrustation; and accordingly, strive to achieve the restoration of all the wound with drying, and if the upper opening is not consolidated, and the fistula remains open on the side of the navel, it will be easier for the patient. And sometimes the fistula is closed in this way: when you insert the probe into the fistula, and it is in the navel area around the surface of the body with the coden and on the margin of the navel, then take a tentative perforation that is like an awl preparing the hearts according to this form:
and insert it into that faithful wrapping of five faithful ones or around those; and accordingly, insert the probe with faith in the fistula until you achieve the conquest of that place.
But if it is penetrating in the margin of the navel proper to the backside, then you extract the thread from that channel and insert your finger into the navel; and extract the extremity of the thread and adjust the two extremities together, and strengthen each one, and leave it like that for a day or two, and when you have inserted the thread into the flesh, strengthen it well so that those fleshy parts are stitched which are between the two extremities of the thread and fall.
And accordingly, cure the wound until it is consolidated and healed.
But if the opening of the fistula is not penetrating, then make it penetrate in whatever way you are prepared, but not in the navel, for it is not your place to do so; and accordingly, do that until it is healed.
The shape of the spatulum with which the fistula is divided: its curvature is very sharp on one side and not sharp on the other, so that you do not insert what is unnecessary, just as sometimes.
Of the suturing of hemorrhoids in which blood flows during the insertion of those.
Hemorrhoids are according to two ways, for either they are between the navel like coal, or those that are like grass on a rye field. And of those that are small and large, and that the blood flows from them constantly and is one, or many, and that they are outside the navel, and in the extremities thereof.
But however, those that are outside the navel are according to the degrees of little humidity, from which clear water or a small amount of blood flows with continuous flow, and according to the color of the skin.
And the cure for that which is behind the navel is that you command the patient to settle and to be quiet until the navel is cleansed and the hemorrhoids appear to you. Then take hold of them with your nails or what you have, and accordingly cut off those roots.
But if the nails are not caught in those due to their moisture and softening, then take those with a rough cloth or with a thread or with a woolen floss, and extract those with your fingers, and accordingly cut off those roots and powder some powders suitable for cauterization near the incision, so that they are applied to those places in place of cauterization; or cauterize them according to what has been preceded in the chapter on cauterizing. And accordingly, cure those with the other cure until they are healed.
And if the navel does not obey emission, then anoint the patient with a little mordicating ointment on the navel area, and wash it with that water which is in the navel and which will obey emission slightly when the patient is pressed.
But if the hemorrhoids are outside the navel, then the cause of theirs is light, and it is that you take them with your fingernail or with a small knife, and cut off those roots, and accordingly cure those with water as we have said until they are healed.
And he who has an incision, must minister the suturing of them according to this way: take a thread wrapped around and insert that into the needle and accordingly extract the hemorrhoids from the upper parts, and make it penetrate into the root of the other part, and wrap the two extremities of the thread in the more distant part of the needle, and so latitudinally; and strengthen the hemorrhoid with strong traction, and accordingly remove the thread and needle.
And do this to all of them, and leave one alone and don't cauterize it, so that the superfluity of blood flows from that one.
And accordingly, press a cloth soaked in rose oil or cerate onto the navel area, and press that onto the navel and command the patient to rest. And accordingly, leave that alone until it forms a scab; and when it is scabbed over, cure those with unguents or other remedies until it is healed.
And since they are ancient and do not work with that medicine, then it is necessary to cut them off at the point of spatula or with your fingernail until they become moist and host the scab above, which prevents consolidation; and accordingly, cure those until they are consolidated.
Then you must cut those off at the root, more fiercely than the first time, until they bleed much and are excoriated; and accordingly, cure those until they are healed.
Know that Almesamir is key, and it is not so unless the notes are red on the color of the skin resembling a cap of clover, and it is made throughout the body and especially in the parts left behind by the feet and hands, and it involves through those pains the desire for love.
And then it is necessary to cut out what is in the circle of the key, and to hold it with forceps or small knives, and to eradicate its root; and accordingly cure that.
And if you wish, cauterize according to what is preceded in the chapter on cauterizing.
But of verucca, it is a small, hard, fistulous prominence on the surface of the body, and many times appears in the majority of children.
And the cure for it is to stretch and cut it off, or to strengthen it with a thread or a piece of cloth until it forms a scab. And if you wish, cauterize that according to what we have said, with fire or sharp medicine.
But formica is a small, fatty or fistulous prominence on the surface of the body approaching the navel, and when it is touched by the finger, it seems to be bitten by an ant, and is made around the body.
And the cure for it is that you take a reed pen or a votar pen, and it should be strong, and press that on the formica until it contains the circle of the pen in its parts; and accordingly revolve your hand with the pen until you cut out what is in the circuit of the formica, and then pause that in the navel of the flesh, and that eradicates the formica from its root.
And if you wish, do it with a reed pen or an iron pen according to this form:
Be the upper part of the pen tip slightly sharp, not perforated, wrapped in order that on the said part of the skin, the ablution of it may be performed and the revolution of that.
And if you wish, cauterize the formica according to what is said before in the chapter on cauterizing.
The Form of the Instruments that are Administered to Give Cautery.
Sometimes it is made cauterization of silver or lead or melted iron or hammered; and sometimes it is made with those small and large instruments according to what is administered, for that which is administered in the cure of little children is small; and of those whose buttocks are rough or sore, their cauterizations shall be small.
The Form of Great Cautery.
The head of the reed pen above, in which the bag is tied, should be broad according to this way; and there should be a distinction at the point where the bag is tied, just as sometimes.
And the extremity of it, which is inserted into the navel, should be blunt (not open) like a lion's tooth, with subtlety; and on one side of it there are two holes, and on the other side one hole, and the width of the hole should be according to the thickness of the rays and slightly thicker than small.
And it should be a bag in which medicines from the bladder of an animal or sheep's wool are placed, and the root of it should be one palm.
And it should be pierced with many small holes just as it is rolled up; and if the space between the holes is the thickness of the said.
And accordingly insert the needle into those holes, a strong thread of raw thread which is made from ten threads, or surround them; and adjust that bag to it; and when the bag is placed in it, be tight in the head of the cauterizer between two distinct ones with strong constriction, and accordingly cauterize each hole: But the quality of cauterizing is that you fill the bag with medicine, which should be warmed according to the quantity of the tolerance of the patient; and take care that it is not too hot nor too cold.
And accordingly the patient should be laid on his back, and raise his knees towards himself, and pause there until one cup is left above which men or lansol; and accordingly apply a small amount of oil or album of honey or mucilage of fenugreek or similar substances to the extremity of the cauterizer; and accordingly insert that into the navel with ease, and accordingly the minister should take the bag and express all that is in the cauterizer into the bucket with two hands and sometimes with great vigor until everything is evacuated from the cauterizer; and accordingly extricate the cauterizer and the patient will lift his knees to the wall.
And if the medicine forces him to sleep similarly, hold it as long as he can; and if he sleeps with that for a whole night, it is more likely to lead to good results.
But if you cauterize that in the diseases of belly flux and navel inflammation, then you must iterate the cauterizer until it is healed.
And if in the navel there are hemorrhoids or apostemas, then it should be a cauterizer very subtle and lion-like, of those cauterizers with which children are cured.
The Cure of Sores.
And thus I have said in the division of the cure of sores above what is fitting for a free person, and I say thus: the cure of those with me and with medicines according to the complement.
Therefore I say that sores are diversified according to how they are made and according to the place on which the sores occur.
And the causes by which many times sores are made are just as if from a blow of peyra, or incision with space or cotelet, or striking with lance, or with fist, or with arrow, or similar to those of many causes.
But the sores that are on the parts of the body are like a sore which appears on the head, or on the neck, or on the feet, or on the belly, or on the thigh, and similar to those of the limbs.
And I recommend the cure for some sores by which you pause that rationalization and rule on other sores.
And I begin with the sores of the head, simple ones, for the remembrance of the composed ones will come at the beginning of the third capital.
Therefore I say: when a simple sore occurs on the head and it is not a fracture, then consider this: if it is due to a blow from a peyra or similar, and already the wound has opened so slightly that it is a large sore and you fear about that patient having an apostema or cauterization, then you must immediately take hold of the cephalic vein and bleed, but not too much; and extract as much blood as necessary according to the quantity of the virtue of the patient's blood, unless there be some other cause prohibiting bleeding, especially if the blood that has issued from the wound is little.
And be the bleeding on the opposite side of the wounded part; and watch out for the patient's replenishment, and their diet, and their hearty food.
But if some cause prohibits from the beginning, then it is advisable to minimize food and not approach meat or wine.
And pause on the sore, if an apostema cauterization occurs, cut in with rose oil or wine that is stipticated.
But if it is sure of apostema cauterization, then pause on the sore, if it is recent with its own blood and the air has not changed that powder which I recommend as proper little.
And if the air has already changed that one, then pause on some other unguent until it is healed.
But if the sore is large or is due to incision with space and similar things, and the lips of it are not adjusted for pus, then adjust those with suture according to what I recommend for their suture.
But if the sore is already uncovered of bone and flesh, and there is no retention of it but a small suspender, then cut into that and accordingly cure the sore with medicines and restore the flesh according to its location, and command the patient to eat food in which there is grossness: caps and forms of meat and similar things until it is composed.
And if you find in the wound putrefaction and it does not adhere to the bone, then cut out all that is putrid and rotten, and accordingly cure it.
But if in these sores there is an artery or vein from which blood flux can occur, and it is not abscessed by medicines, then you must inquire about the artery, and if you find that one not incised, then cut into it with spatula, or tie it; and if necessary, it will cause what we have said not to conform, then you must cauterize until the blood is absorbed.
And if these sores are simple and small, then the cause of them is light; therefore you must powderize on those this powder, because it will consolidate before the air changes those.
And the method of the powder is this: take one part of oil of enses, two parts of blood of dragon, and three parts of non-extinct cause; mix it well and crush it thoroughly, and fill the sore with that powder, and constrict it with good constriction until it adheres to the sore, and coagulates with the blood.
And accordingly stretch that powder above with powders and loosen it, and do not remove it while it is like this, so that the medicine is not eradicated from it until it is healed.
And sometimes one makes this alone with caustics, when it is not present to you in the same place as the oil of enses and blood of dragon.
And already this method of operation is done in large sores when it is necessary to pause on those and be stretched, and these sores are recent with their own blood, which the air has not altered.
And if the air has altered them, and especially when it is in the time of summer, then do not take thought about the position of this powder, but instead cure those with what we have said, namely by applying some ointments that are dissolved, or by applying powders made from barley flour mixed with water and honey until they produce a poultice; and accordingly cure those with another remedy until they are healed.
But if there is a fracture in the bone near the sore, and it is small, then you must extract that with gestures.
And I will say: the cure for fractures of the head in this way that is venomous.
The Sores of the Neck.
But if the sore occurs in the neck, then there is no difference in treatment between it and a simple sore of the head.
But if the nerves of the neck are cut or arteries, then if it is a nerve, do not apply a caustic to it, but rather avoid applying a remedy that causes strong stipticity, such as vinegar and eggs, which are like vitriol and similar things that harm nerves and contract them. And do not apply any cause to the sore that is completely cold, because the substance of the nerves is cold and their continuation is in the brain, which is the most noble of all the members.
And if that which is cured by medicines is light, just as it is washed with lukewarm water, some day infused in rose oil or un-rose oil, and thucia when it is washed with lukewarm water and the other minor wounds are treated according to this method, and ointments moist.
But if the sore is large, then you must apply suture, or compress the lips of it, and accordingly cure that with powders until it is healed.
But if the sore is deep or occurs in the lowest part of the poultice, then you must pierce that in the most depressed location.
But if the sore already has an incised artery and there is a flux of blood, then you must separate or dry that, or tie that, or cauterize that if necessity requires it to happen.
But if the vertebrae of the neck or all have been incised, and the veins of the neck are saved, then you must adjust the lips of the spine with suture over the canal of the neck and do not touch that; before equalizing it and reducing it to its natural shape, and accordingly strengthen it with decent tension, and loosen it for some days; and accordingly cure that with ointments in which there is stipticity and excitement until it is healed.
But if the sore has made a impression in the bone, then you must pierce it, and if there are fragments of bone in it, extract all those that you can from them; and as for what is not attached to you, loosen it until the sore subsides, and be separated, and the excrescence of it be alleviated.
And if the sore is recent, then powderize on it the powder which I have recommended to you. But if the sore has made a fistula, then cure that with what will come to mind in its own capital.
If it is a blow from a lance or cotelet, and the depth of it is great, then consider more whether the sore is ventilated when the patient complains; know that the sore is mortal.
And if there is no great depth and the sore is recent with its own blood, then pause in it on the first hour powder, and do not strengthen that so that the blood is not retained in the depth of it and does not return to the heart and does not harm the patient; but pause in it attractive ointment, and remove it twice a day.
And if the ointment is not present, then pause in the orifice of the sore a little bit so that it sucks up what you have from the humidities; and make sure the patient sleeps over the sore so that water flows in it adjusted.
But if three days or more have passed since the sore occurred and the patient does not experience spasms, nor trembling of the heart, nor constriction of the bile, and other good dispositions are present in them, then know that the sore is saved; and then cure it with calques and with another remedy until it is healed.
But if the healing of it is excluded, and all time has been opened, then know that already a fistula has been made; cure therefore that according to its own capital.
And if the sore is due to incision with space or cotelet, and it is simple on the surface of the foot or hand, then cure that with what precedes suture, if it is great, or with powder, if it is small.
But if the sore has made an impression in the bone, and there are pieces of bone that are separated from it, then you must twist the sore and pull to extract those pieces, if they are separate. But if they are not separated, then loosen them until the sore subsides, which will alleviate the extraction of them.
And for other sores that occur in other members, the judgment in cure is the judgment of what we have said.
The Sores of the Belly.
The indisposition which occurs in the belly is either great, small, or medium-sized.
And small disruption is made difficult by another way, and it is known that the reduction of theirs is more difficult, if you do not take care to introduce them into their place as soon as possible, for it opens up and becomes swollen, making the instrument of them difficult.
And therefore the best disruption is medium-sized, for in that one there is not difficult the reduction of the belly, just as it is difficult in the two species mentioned earlier.
And know that the suture of the belly is according to four methods, but two sutures are common ones that are necessary in sutures of other sores of the body.
And two other sutures are proper ones that communicate with other sores, but however they are more proper in the suture of the belly.
And I recommend to you whatever explanation and declaration.
Therefore I say that when the sore is small and there is some cause from the belly for it, and it is made difficult to reduce that, then this is in one of two ways: either by the smallness of the disruption as we have said, or when the belly has become inflamed due to the coldness of the air.
And therefore when that is so, you must then scrape it in such a way that you submerge a sponge or wet cloth in tepid water, or that you gather sanguinary, cypress, and spike, and embrocate with that on the belly until the inflammation is resolved.
And sometimes I have found that this [treatment] has a certain sharpness, and it is better than just water alone in resolving the inflammation.
And therefore when the inflammation is resolved, then you must moisten the belly with water in which is cooked aloe and mulva, for by this it is alleviated the instrument of it with little cause.
But if the instrument of it is excused from this cure, then you must divide the disruption into small pieces with an instrument in which are incised emoryddos.
And the first cure is better when it is proper and not necessary to cut, and there is no occupation to cut at the time of necessity and faintness.
Of the instrument, it is necessary to know its shape.
One part of it is bent acutely, and the other part is not acute, and the extremity is subtle, and it should not be too fine, but rather a little obtuse.
And therefore when the sore is enlarged and protrudes from the belly, then it is necessary that its reduction be according to its natural shape, in its proper place, if possible above that, for it is better.
But when the disruption is large and is in the lower part of the belly, then it is necessary that you make the patient lie on their back, and place their knees higher than their head; and if it is in the upper part of the belly, then you should support the head and feet so that they are higher than the remaining parts.
And similarly, if the disruption is in one of the two parts of the belly, then pause your attention and consideration always for that part where the sore is, so that it may be higher than the other.
And thus it is necessary that you administer this in great sores and in medium-sized sores.
And in small sores, pause this which is according to your preparation, and make sure that the one who administers it is among those most skilled, who has the disruption entirely with his hand and adjusts the lips of it, and makes sure to uncover from this to another, for which there is some reason.
And this is the common method of suturing: take the needle, or count the needle according to the amount of amplitude of the sore; and then leave from the extremity of the disruption of the ring finger, and strengthen the needle once, or twice, so that you do not put faith in the two extremities of the cord, with the two extremities of the ciphac that is left behind the cord of the parts inside, until you make it penetrate from that part; and you have already added two extremities of the cord and two extremities of the ciphac, and so there are four orders.
And then strengthen the double thread with the needle, and sometimes on two parts together, and then add the two lips and the sore by decent addition; and then leave the thickness of the finger and put another needle in it, and then bind that with thread just like the first needle; and do not stop doing this if it is necessary with needles until you have completed all the contraction of the sore.
And the needles should be medium-sized between thickness and subtlety, for the thin needles only slightly cut into the flesh; and the thick ones are difficult to manipulate in the cord, and therefore it is necessary that they be medium-sized in subtlety and thickness.
And it is not necessary to have the needle inserted in two extremities of the cord proper immediately, for fear that the flesh will be cut too little and the sore will be exacerbated before its consolidation.
And the sutures should not be prolonged for fear that the sore will not be allowed to consolidate.
And then insert the extremities of the needles so that they do not disturb the patient's rest while sleeping; and place poultices spread out on all sides, which have the extremities of the needles; and leave those until you know that the sore is consolidated.
And these types of suture with needles in this manner are more suitable for small sores, for they can be completed with one needle or two or around that.
But the second suture is common: and it is that you administer with a suture the four extremities, of the cord and two extremities of the ciphac, at once, with a needle in which there is thread wrapped around in subtlety and thickness.
And then, when the needle has penetrated these four extremities, reduce it to that middle part where you started, so that the thread will retreat from the highest point of the sore and return to the wound, so that the suture is like a cloth suture with which the cloths are strengthened.
And pause between each suture the amount of thickness of the finger.
And this suture is known to men.
And with such a suture, I have closed the wound which had been inflicted on a man in his belly, which had been wounded with a knife, and was the disruption of a wound that was greater than one palm, and was situated around two palms from the navel, and was the disruption in the middle of the member; and then I reduced it after the belly had been opened for 24 hours.
And the wound was consolidated in the space of 15 days or around, and cured him; and then I watched over him for some months, and he converted to his former dispositions.
And other doctors had judged that he would not be cured; and by miracle, it was so, for you did not treat him with ointment, for there was no medicine or balm found in the place where the wound was, but instead you poured water from a honeycomb twice a day and performed frequent ablutions with water of honey until he was healed.
But you said two species of suture proper according to the narration of Paraula.
And then you began with the suture of the cord, and inserted the needle from the outer part to the inner part.
And then, as the needle pierces the cord and meets the lacertus in straightness and length along the entire body, and leaves the extremity of the ciphac where you have inserted the needle; and make it penetrate into the other extremity from the inner part to the outer part, in the other extremity of the mihat.
And then, when you have made it penetrate, pause and make it penetrate again in that same extremity of the mihat from the outer part to the inner part; and leave the extremity of the ciphac that is in this place, and make the needle penetrate into the other extremity from the inner part to the outer part.
And make it penetrate with that same penetration which you make it penetrate into the ciphac in the extremity of the mihat, and which is in the part of you until all that penetrates.
And then, starting from this side, sew it with that same thread and attach the extremity of the ciphac to the other side, and remove the needle from the cord which was penetrated, and then reduce it into that same cord and sew the extremity of the ciphac that is on the other side to this extremity of the mihat; and remove it from the cord which is part of you.
And do it once and then again, and do it once more in a similar way until you have sewn all that is outside according to this example.
And the sum of this suture method is that you sew with a suture of pellicies in which you sew the skins, and thus you sew the ciphac once from the part of the extremity of the cord, and then leave it for another time until it is complete.
But the second species of suture proper which you say is called Gualia, and this is from Sermo de Lu and per Lu recommended, is that you sew according to semilitut with which some medicants sew it, and thus they add all parts to their corresponding part according to nature; and they apply the extremity of one side to the other side, and the extremity of the mirror to another extremity, and this is done as I recommend to you.
It is necessary that you place the needle in the extremity of the mirror at your own proper part from the outer part, and make it penetrate to the inner part in that same sole, and leave two extremities of the ciphac; and then turn back the needle and make it penetrate from outside to inside in two extremities of the ciphac.
And then turn back those two parts, and make each one penetrate from the inner part to the outer part in two other extremities of the mirror on the opposite side.
And this method of suture is better than the common light suture, and it is the suture which I previously recommended.
This is the sermon of Gualia.
And others will say that the suture of the belly is corrected with two needles, so it is that you insert into these two threads one thread, and begin with the introduction of a needle from what belongs to you, and make it penetrate into the other side according to the suture of those who sew skins together.
And you should know that when disruption is in the middle of the belly, the suture of it is more difficult than in other parts of the belly.
But the judgment of medication for a wound is a judgment about other wounds.
Which cause is because when you succeed in healing the recent wound with your own blood before it alters that, and reduce the swelling and sew it up and apply it decently, then pause over that bloody powder.
And if the air has already altered the wound, then pause over that certain ointments which are present before you, so that they will make a hard impression and break the threads, and be consolidated ciphac and mirror; and then cure it thus as is the healing of other wounds until it is healed.
But if you don't have the medicines present, then pause over that as much as possible, since it begins to grow a crust, coto viel, and by changing those two times a day, it is done thus as I teach you, until it is healed, because you won't need another medicine in many dispositions when wounds are simple.
But if you fear that the wound communicates in lesion to the main members, then it is necessary that you immerse a lion's hair in good quality oil of temperate nature, or in rosated oil, and pause that in the circuit of the places which are between the angles and leave those things as they are.
And if you feel pain or putrefaction in your own bellies, since many times this happens, then it is necessary that you crystalize that with vinegar stiptic black tea, and especially if the putridity has been conveyed into the belly and is made exitura penetrating into the cavity of the body.
And you should know that the wound in the large belly is of a lighter healing than that which is in the small bellies.
And it is of difficult healing because the belly which is called "gegunu" does not receive healing from wounds that occur in it; and this is because of the great multitude of veins that are in it and because of its magnitude, and because of the subtlety of the body of that, and because of its proximity to the nature of nerves.
But if that which proceeds from the wound is a thread, and you succeed in getting it recent, reduce it according to your rectitude with which you reduce the bellies equally.
But if it has passed into the space and is already made green or black, then you should strengthen that with thread over the place that is diminished by it, in order to stop blood flowing, because in the thread are veins and arteries.
And then, inscribe that which is other than this bond, and pause the two extremities of the thread pending from the left side of the wound to the outside, so that above you may be alleviated the attraction of it by the shedding of the scab and emission of the crust from the wound.
Remembrance of wounds when they occur in the belly.
When a disruption occurs in the belly and is small, then it is possible for it to be restored in certain men, for thus I saw one who was struck in his own stomach with a lance and had an old wound from the right side of the stomach that had become a fistula, and this due to poor management and windiness.
And so I guided the healing of it, even though it was not contained in its own recovery, but instead continued to subtlety that into which it had focused and the location was consolidated.
And I saw that the location was consolidated, and I guided the patient who had deviated from his usual habits due to the accident in his own stomach; and he did not deviate further because of this bad accident and remained in good physical condition, eating and drinking normally, and then entered into a bath and was exercised in his usual activities.
And others will say that when a wound occurs in the belly and is small, then it is necessary to bind it according to this method: and it is that you take fine threads of great caps; and then adjust the two lips of the wound and place one thread from those which have the open mouth over the two lips of the wound; therefore, when you take hold of those and strengthen your mouth, cut off the head of it, because it adheres and does not dissolve.
And then pause another thread next to the first one, and do not cease to make threads one after another according to the quantity of the entire wound.
And then reduce the threads and close the wound; and those attached capsules will remain in the belly until the belly is healed; and no harm will come to the patient.
And it is possible that the belly can be tied with a subtle thread which is made from the belly of an animal joined to it, since it is more in needle; and it is that you take the extremity of these threads of the belly, and it is very bare, and then tie the extremity of it with a thread of like material, enveloped, and then insert that thread into needles and sew with it on that belly, and reduce it in the disruption.
And this method of suture with threads is nothing but according to the way of faith and hope.
But if the wound is large and wide, especially if it is in one of the delicate bellies, then it is not a matter of ingenuity, but rather subtlety, and not a complete healing of it.
On the Healing of Ulcers and Fistulas.
Know that every wound and apostema when it becomes old and antiquated, and is made an ulcer, and does not consolidate and gets a crust all the time and is not cut off, then, in whatever member it may be, universally it is called fistula and we call it azukem.
And fistula, according to truth, is a waxy, hard, white node, without pain, in which there is a cavity like that of the penalty of ausel; and for this reason we call it "alcus rizatz", i.e. penalty.
And in some men it is humid, which gets a crust; and the humidity is dried up in a few hours. And sometimes this humidity is much, little, thick, and subtle.
And I have already shown all these causes and their signs, and the cures for them with medicines in the division.
And I will tell you how to cure fistulas, which are made by way of operation with my hands.
And know that fistulas occur in all the members of the body; for some are fistulas that penetrate to the great veins and arteries, or to the nerves, or to the diaphragm, or to the belly, or to the bladder, or to any of the ribs, or to some of the vertebrae of the back, or to any of the joints composed in such a way as if by composition of the hand and foot; and those that give proximity to the main member and similar things.
And therefore those of these fistulas that are in this way are difficult to heal and do not receive cure, and the occupation with them is labor and ignorance.
And if some of the fistulas are so deep that they do not penetrate to those places I have mentioned, and you wait and expect and hope for its cure, and you wish to understand it, then take a chance with iron or steel, and if the fistula follows the right path, and you will know what it is.
But if the fistula is twisted, then investigate it with a subtle attempt at lead, for lead has the lightness of its own heart and can correct the twist.
And if the fistula is very horrible, it is not possible for you to signify on it with an attempt.
Then cleanse the orifice by its own orifices, for the humidity which cleanses it flows to the other orifices.
And then inquire with great care, according to which method it is possible for you to know whether here there are bones or nerves, and whether the fistula is distant or nearby, or if it is a fistula that has many openings and is located above all on the sum of your strength, with your introspection, and how you understand the illness, and the invention of pain comes from your compression with your hand on the place, and similar things to the significations and causes of accidents at the apostema.
And when you have stood on all those causes with steady gaze, then go to the cure according to confidence: and it is that you consider now if it is an apparent fistula nearby or in the salient place, distant from joint, nerve, artery, vein, or one of the places which I have told you.
Now you will cut out the fistula according to what has been said before in the narrative of it, and stop there that is in that filtration and decomposition of flesh, and that which is born from the orifice of the flesh, or of the tail and similar things, and cure that until it is healed.
But if the fistula is of deep profundity and follows the right path, then you must insert it into the preon as far as possible, and carefully remove all its corrupt flesh; and carefully wrap some cloth-like substances in acute medicines, and introduce those into the cavity of the fistula, which you have comprehended with iron.
And thus with that, in a few days, until the acute medicine has consumed all that remains in the cavity of the fistula from corruption.
And thus, with that, carefully restore it with ointments that generate healthy flesh until it is healed.
But if it is not healed by this, then you must cauterize it according to what we have recounted.
But if the cause of fistula is bone and you are certain of that, then you must inquire into it and cut out the bony part according to what we have recounted, unless you prevent any cause of vein or nerve or main member as we have said.
But if the bone is exposed and there is corruption and blackness on it, then you must scrape away that part until all the corruption is gone; and carefully cure that with what is necessary until it is healed.
And if it is not healed and breaks out again just as before, then you must know that you have not succeeded in eradicating the corruption entirely; and therefore, you uncover it again and carefully make the reasoning of it and the purification of it with the last remaining strength, and carefully restore that.
And therefore, if it is healed, then it is good; and if not, then you must know that the corruption is in the deep profundity of the heart, which has not been succeeded in, and accordingly, there is nothing else for you to do but to leave it.
And if the corrupted bone is small or it is to your advantage to attract that, then you must attract it with subtle forceps which are suitable for this.
And if there are many bones, then carefully remove all of them, and leave not a single cause with your strength.
But if any cause of the humors is contrary to you, and in them there is no fear or error, then carefully cut away those membranes or flesh if it is here, and deliver the bones.
But if you are not prepared to extract the bones of your time, then pause over the wound as it is now, and let that wound rest until what is around those bones of flesh and membranes, and guard the wound so that it is not consolidated, and be constrained by the section which you have cut in your operation.
They have, if you fear, pause over the wound submerged in olive oil, or the wound submerged in Egyptian ointment, or in some of the green ointments, for when those membranes are gone and the bones are separated from their covering, and the attraction is alleviated.
But if it is a large bone like the bone of the knee or ankle or similar to those, and what is corrupted on it is only the surface so much as to be only the face of it, then carefully scrape away that part with a rasp so much as to remove that blackness and corruption, and carefully restore the wound.
But if what is corrupted on it is a large part, and the corruption has already reached the marrow of the bone, then it is necessary to close that area and completely excise it within the location where the corruption has taken hold, and then cure that until it is consolidated.
And I recommend to you that you seek the advice of one man in his expertise in this matter, so that you may pause and reflect upon it and assist yourself in your operation.
A young man of about 30 years old, who suffers from pain in his knee, and the parts that are damaged inwardly are above the material inwardly to the bone, until the material is reached to the knee, and it is matter of apostema with great apostema, and there is no external cause.
And therefore the time was prolonged with that patient due to the error of the physicians, until the apostema was hubert, and the materials became putrid, and his cure was carefully paused, until the knee became fistulada, and made its way through the many orifices which all poured forth pus and the humors of the body.
And therefore many physicians were summoned around two years, but there was no one who knew in those men, nor did they have the knowledge in that art, until you were called.
And I saw the knee of that man and the materials that were flowing from those orifices through great vessels; and already the body of that man was totally stabled and his skin color was citrine.
And then I inserted a probe into one of those orifices and guided it to the bone.
And carefully you and examined all the orifices and found that those which were reaching their respective parts of the knee.
And then I carefully probed and cut open one of those orifices until I uncovered a part of the bone, and found that it was corrupted, and already it was rotten and corrupted and denigrated; and already a part of the knee had penetrated into the cartilage.
And then I saw what was discovered and prepared from the uncovered bone.
And I saw that it was not in the bone, but rather that corruption which had abscessed and spread, and I already had drained it.
And then I paused the restoration of the wound with consolidative medicine for a long time, and it was not consolidated.
And then I iterated and discovered again on the bone secondarily on the primary discovery, and found continuous corruption in the bone.
And I saw that it appeared to be from that corruption, and then I was forced to perforate to make the cure of it and restoration, but it was not restored.
And then I discovered another way and did not cease to excise the small bone little by little, particularly and perforate the restoration of it, but it was not restored until I excavated around a palm's length from there, and that extracted along with its marrow, and then restored it with medicines, and it consolidated slightly and healed.
And there was no need for iteration in the operation and section of it, except by the disposition of the surgeon's hand and the scarcity of tolerance and fear of death, since it happened to him at all hours due to excessive evacuation syncope.
And therefore the patient is fully restored through entire healing, and nothing is in place of the bone's hard cartilage; and it is done well the arrangement of him in his own body, and he returns to his natural virtue; and he is converted into his original dispositions and does not make anything contrary to himself in movement or damage in any cause.
But if it is an osseous prominence in the body that has already been traumatized, then you must cut it according to this method: first, take a ligament and strengthen it at the extremity of that prominent bone; then command someone else to stretch it to its full extent; pause the ligament made of thicker wool from the initial ligament; and then tie it over the flesh that remains on the bone, extending the extremity of it so that you can pull the flesh to the remaining parts, and then uncover the flesh over the location where you want to cut in order to avoid cutting into the flesh.
And pause the saw or table so that it leaves a decent margin below the bone, because when you do this, the saw is not prohibited from cutting through the corrupted flesh.
And it must be the cutting on the location of corruption little by little, because if there is corruption in the concavity of the bone and it does not appear in its appearance to the sense, then one must proceed with the cutting from another way.
And if the bone is corrupted and not prominent, then the one part continues with the other; and the corruption is in the middle location or in a part of it, then you uncover all parts of the flesh entirely; and then pause the saw, and then cut that from the first part where the corruption is located, until the cutting is continued on the other part.
And let the cutting be according to the location of the corruption, a little bit at a time, as we have said.
And if the corruption is in the joint, excise that corrupted joint, and cut the bone where it continues to the other part.
And if the corruption is in the continuation of two joints, then there is no ratio but ingenuity.
And if the corruption is in the chest of the arm or leg, it is very difficult; however, it is necessary that you investigate the corruption in whatever way it appears to you, and then excise it, and cleanse it according to each disposition which is possible for you, and also when there is no contradiction with veins or nerves.
And you will know what instruments and saws are needed to be used on these bones, depending on the situation of the bones, their preparation, their thickness, their subtlety and grandeur, their smallness and rarity; so that it is necessary for you to prepare a whole variety of operation instruments suitable for each operation.
And you will know that this operation means something to you about the species of instrument which you need; when you are great in study and long and knowledge of the ways of this art, and testimony of manners of diseases, for then already you have them for yourself that is convenient for all instruments.
And you will see that at the end of this chapter I have formed a list of instruments which are to be used with simplicity, and with which you will proceed to your prohibition, which you will experience on the others. It looks like we've reached the end of the text!

The craftsmen are wise and compare little, but instead focus on the present and what is absent. They discover new operations and instruments that aid in the descent of external causes when accidents occur.
The doctor explains that sagetas are not expelled from the members in which they are embedded, but rather according to two methods: either by attraction of the location where they enter or by the opposite side.
The doctor describes the process of sageta extraction from a flesh location.
The doctor advises leaving the sageta alone for a few days if it doesn't respond to initial treatment, allowing the surrounding flesh to heal and reducing its attraction and extraction.
The doctor advises leaving the sageta alone in bone if it doesn't respond to initial treatment, allowing it to be re-attracted and mobilized each day, until it is eventually expelled.
The doctor advises performing a procedure to amplify the location of the sageta in the bone and then extract it if it doesn't respond to initial treatment.
The doctor advises that if the sageta is hidden in the location of the body and is hidden from sensation, you should try to detect it with your own sense of touch, and if you feel it, then attract it using some instruments that are suitable for its attraction.
The doctor advises that if you are unable to manipulate the sageta due to the constriction of the wound and its length, and there is no bone, nerve, or vein in the area, then you should focus on widening the wound until it is possible to extract the sageta.
The doctor advises that if you have access to the area where the sageta is embedded, then you should carefully dissect the surrounding flesh in all directions using all the skill and technique at your disposal. If necessary, you may need to use forceps or other instruments to gently tease out the flesh in order to expose the sageta.
The doctor advises that when you perform the extraction of the sageta in each location where it is found, you should use twisting and turning motions with your hand and forceps to guide the sageta out, taking care not to break or damage it. You should also be mindful of the difficulty of attracting the sageta back to its original location.
The doctor advises that if you are unable to extract the sageta at your current attempt, then you should leave it alone for a few days until the parts of the circuit surrounding the sageta have had time to heal and recover. Then, you can try again, as the sageta will be less resistant to extraction. The doctor advises that if bleeding occurs during the extraction process, then you should administer the remedy described in the chapter on healing.
The doctor advises that you should be cautious and gentle when performing the extraction, taking care not to damage any nearby veins, nerves, or arteries. You should also use all the skill and technique at your disposal to extract the sageta, moving with ease, tranquility, slowness, and firmness, just as you have been taught.
The doctor advises that you should contract the sageta in such a way that the patient will follow the shape of the sageta's figure, according to which it should be removed from its location. This is more advantageous. The doctor advises that if this is not possible for you, then you should use what is possible according to the figures.
The doctor advises that if the sagetas are expelled through the contrarian action of the other part, or if they have already progressed to some extent towards the exterior parts, or if the sageta's extremity has become gelatinous due to the sensation from the uppermost part of the codenna and sometimes becomes elevated; then you should grasp it; and let the section be according to the quantity taken by the forceps; and gently attract it, because it is made light for summoning.
The doctor advises that if the sageta is stuck in the bone, then you should twist the forceps according to the contrary direction until the sageta presses into the bone, and amplify it as much as possible, and then gently extract it.
The doctor advises that if the sageta is still stuck, leave it alone for a few days, and then try again, until it comes out naturally.
The doctor advises that if the root of the sageta is in the location, then you should push it out with a gentle and careful motion.
The doctor advises that if the root of the sageta is caught and you want to administer an impulse, then you should insert something into it, if it is deaf (i.e., unresponsive), use a hidden instrument to put pressure on the concavity of the sageta, and then gently push it out with a gentle motion.
The doctor advises that if the sageta is concave, then you should push it out with a strong instrument, because the sageta is loosened by this.
The doctor advises that if the sageta is entwined (entoxiguada), then you should carefully remove all the flesh in which it resides, if this is possible for you, and then gently cure it with what is necessary.
The doctor advises that if the sageta is located in the foot, or in the belly, or in the bladder, or in the side, and it is close enough for you to touch it with your hand, and it is possible to cut above it, then you should cut above it and be careful not to incise a vein or nerve, and extract the sageta, and then close the wound if necessary, and cure it until it is healed.
