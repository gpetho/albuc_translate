Chapter Forty-Four.
On the incision over the swelling that appears in the larynx from the outside and is called elephant of the larynx.
This swelling, which is called elephant of the larynx, is a large swelling, the color of the body, and it is common in women, and it is of two types.
Either it is natural or it is acquired. As for the natural, there is no remedy for it. As for the acquired, it is of two types, one of which is similar to fatty tumors, and the other type is similar to the swelling that results from a thickening of the artery, and there is danger in incising it.
So you should not approach it with the iron at all, except for what is small, if you examine and inspect it with the probe and find it similar to the fatty tumor, and it is not connected to any of the veins, then incise it as you incise on tumors.
And extract it with what contains it of the sac if it is in a sac, and if not, then excise all of it, then treat the area with the appropriate treatment.
