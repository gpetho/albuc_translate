 CHAPTER SEVENTY-THREE.
On the treatment of haemorrhoids and warts and red pustules arising in the female pudenda.
 Haemorrhoids are an inflation of the heads of the blood-vessels leading to abundant and constant bleeding.
When haemorrhoids are chronic they turn into warts.
I have already mentioned in their place the kinds of wart and their symptoms.
Now here I shall say which kinds permit of treatment and which do not.
I begin by stating that haemorrhoids and warts in the depths of the uterus that are not palpable are not able to be treated operatively.
Those at the orifice that are palpable you can treat.
So you should get the woman into a cool place and then draw on the warts with forceps or catch hold with pieces of rough cloth, and cut them away from the roots.
Then if that cause a flow of blood sprinkle with one or other of the powders that stop bleeding but are not corrosive, such as acacia or dragon's blood or olibanum or the like.
Then raise her legs up against the wall for a while and then bring them down into cold water.
And if the haemorrhage persist for a long time make her sit in an infusion of sumac and pomegranate rind and oak-galls and the like.
Then take barley flour and beat it up with honey and vinegar, and apply to the back a plaster made of this.
And if the bleeding cease, good; but if not, apply to the loins and breasts cupping-vessels without scarifying.
Then take wool and dip it in the juice of red cynomorium or plantain or wild eglantine, together with syrup of oak galls, and apply to the place.
And when the swelling has subsided treat the place with ointment until it heals.
 Now red pustules resemble the heads of thyme, and are of rough appearance.
All that appears on the surface should be cut away in the manner mentioned for treating warts; and dress the wounds until healed.
