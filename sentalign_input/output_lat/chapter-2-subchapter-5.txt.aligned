When sharp, intense, continuous catarrhs happen to someone: and you see his eyes weakened, small, and already their vision has been impaired: and the eyelids are ulcerated, and hairs fall from them, and in the depth of the head there is a sharp, damaging pain, and subsequent sneezing: then you may conclude from these symptoms, that these matters, and catarrhs, come only from many veins.	When anyone has a quantity of painful defluxions, acrid and continuous, and you see the eyes wasted and sunken and their sight is weakened and the eyelids are ulcerated and lose their eyelashes; while deep in the head there may be a vehement and grievous pain with incessant sneezing, then you may know from these occurrences that those humours and catarrhs arise from many deep blood-vessels.	0.849944
And the best treatment for them is this. And it is, that you instruct the patient to shave his forehead. Then make a single incision in the middle of the forehead, or slightly on one side, across the width, and begin the incision from the left temple to the right temple: and let the incision go down to the bone: and keep your hand away from the muscles of the temples, which move during chewing: until when the bone is revealed: and you will dry all the blood with a sponge.	The best treatment in this case is that which follows: you bid the patient shave his forehead; then you make one incision in the middle of his forehead or a little above, crosswise (begin the incision from the left temple going toward the right temple; the incision should be down to bone; and avoid the temporal muscles that move during mastication) until the bone is laid bare.	0.8313583
Then separate the two edges of the incision with old cotton, or with linen strips. Then compress from above with cushions: and soak the cushions with wine and oil, so that hot swelling does not occur.	Wipe away all the blood with a sponge and separate the edges of the incision with teased-out cotton wool or with rolls of linen; then bind up with pads over; the pads should be soaked in wine and oil to guard against an effusion.	0.72351325
And when you loosen it, and you see that the hot swelling is already reduced: then it is necessary to rub the bone, until flesh begins to grow on it.	When you undo it, if you see that an effusion has erupted, you should scrape the bone until a growth of flesh begins in it; then treat with a drying treatment which generates flesh.	0.7248753
Then treat it with a drying regimen that makes flesh grow, as if you take two parts of wheat flour and four parts of colophony, and prepare a plaster from them, and apply it to stimulate flesh growth in these wounds.	For example, two parts of wheat flour are taken and of colophonia four parts, and of them a salve is made which may be used to encourage the growth of flesh in wounds of this sort.	0.81400806
