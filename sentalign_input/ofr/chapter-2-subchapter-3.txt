of migraine
When an old migraine comes, and acute catarrh, because of the moisture of tears and the heat in the temples and chronic raging headache and similar things, and he is treated with various medical cures and none of it helps him, we should open the arteries of the temples and cauterize them, as we have described.
And the way to open them is for the patient to pull back the hair from his temples, and pay attention to the artery that appears in the temple, because it is clearly visible by its pulsation, and is rarely hidden except in some men who are too cold;
and if it is hidden, the patient should tighten his neck with some cloth, then rub the area with some rough cloth, and sprinkle the area with hot water until the artery appears clearly;
then take the spatula which has this form:
then lightly scrape the skin until you reach the artery, then pull it up with the forceps, and separate it well from the tissues that are underneath it on each side;
and if the artery is thin, turn it with the point of the hook, then cut it on that side according to the size of the two heads.
For if it is not cut, the blood will not spurt out completely.
And draw blood from six hundred up to three hundred;
and if the artery is large, you must tie it in two places with a strong double silk thread, so that no decay comes before the healing of the wound, and bleeding occurs;
then cut the excess between the two ties at that very moment, and then, if you wish, cauterize it with the cutting cautery down to the bone until the heads are severed;
and that is the better way, if the patient has no fever and is of a warm complexion.
For cautery helps to dry up moisture:
therefore it is of greater help with moistures.
Or it is necessary for the extraction of arteries that one fills the place with old cotton and puts on well-made tents;
and when they are untied, they should be treated with drying medications that promote flesh growth, and with tents, until healed;
and if blood flows from the artery while you are working, hasten to stop it with cautery, or fill the place with vitriol and compress it with your hand until the bleeding is stopped;
and if you don't have that available, put your finger on the spot until the blood clots, and sprinkle the area with cold water until the bleeding stops, and compress it as needed;
and what is better and easier in the extraction of the artery is that you cauterize the vein with this cutting cautery from two sides, but the cutting edges should be quite thick to retain their heat longer. 
For when the instrument is too thin, it holds its heat less.
And there should be a finger's width of space between the two blades, and then when you have marked the two places with ink, and you place the burning iron on it until it reaches the bone, and cut the vein in two places;
and they should be spaced apart between the two ends for it is not completely fused with this cautery from one end to the other;
and this is the form of the cautery:
