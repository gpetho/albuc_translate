On the tumour arising from the twisting of a tendon.	On abscesses that occur from twisting of the nerves.	0.7487601
As a tumour arises on an artery or a vein, so may it also come in a tendon when it has been bruised; or it may arise from excessive fatigue, or such causes. This occurs mostly at the wrists, at the heel, and at all sites of articular movement.	Just as abscesses occur in arteries and veins, so too they occur in nerves: caused by a blow, or from excessive labor, or similar reasons; and most commonly they appear in the armpits, or the heel, and in every place where joints move: and it is a serious abscess.	0.8373039
It is a hard tumour of the same colour as the rest of the body, and is generally painless, and when strong pressure is put upon it the patient has a numb feeling in it.	Its color resembles that of the surrounding body, and it usually lacks pain; and when pressed hard, the patient feels a numbness similar to stupor.	0.8167821
It is a tumour that does not form in the deeper tissues but is subcutaneous. It is freely movable laterally, but will not go forward or backward.	And it is not a deep-seated abscess within the body; rather, it is beneath the skin, moves in all directions, and does not extend forward or backward.	0.76373565
Those that are situated on joints should certainly not be tackled with the knife, for that often causes palsy.	Therefore, those found in the joints should not be attacked with a blade. For contraction may indeed occur.	0.7275375
Incise the skin of those occurring on the head or forehead, and if the tumour be small take hold of it with the forceps and cut it away by the root.	In those cases found on the head or forehead, make an incision in the skin with a small scalpel. If it is a small abscess, then hold it with forceps and cut it off at the root.	0.774078
But if it be large, catch it up with a hook and dissect it away and remove it; and sew up the incision and dress until healed.	And if it is large, then suspend it with a hook, scrape it off, then remove it, bring the wound together with sutures, and care for it until it heals.	0.78941405
