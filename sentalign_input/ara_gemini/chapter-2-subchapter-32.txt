Chapter thirty-two on the spreading of molars that grow on top of others.
If the molars grow in a way other than their natural course, they make the face ugly.
And especially if this happens in women and slaves, then you should look, and if the molar has grown behind another molar and it is not possible to spread it or file it, then extract it.
And if it is attached to another molar, then cut it with this instrument which is pictured here:
And it resembles a small beak.
And let it be of Indian steel, very sharp at the tip.
And your cutting of it should be over many days, due to the hardness of the tooth.
And so that you do not loosen other teeth.
But if it is prominent and firm because of its coldness,
then file it with a file of Indian steel which has this form:
It should all be from India, and its point should be very finely engraved, like the file with which needles are made.
File the tooth with it little by little over many days, gently, so that you do not shake the tooth and it falls out.
Then smooth it afterwards and scrape it with some scrapers.
And if a tooth has been broken and it bothers the tongue when speaking, then it should also be filed until the roughness of the break disappears, and it becomes even and smooth, and does not harm the tongue, nor does it spoil speech.
