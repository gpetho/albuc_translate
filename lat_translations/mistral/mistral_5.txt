Praefatio.	 Preface.
Postquam compleui uobis o Filii, librum hunc, qui est postremus scientiae in medicina cum complemento ipsius, et consecutus sum finem in eo, ex expositionibus eius, et ipsius declarationibus, uisum est mihi, ut compleam ipsum uobis cum hoc Tractatu qui est pars operationis, id est, chirurgiae cum manu.	 After I have completed the book for you, my sons, which is the last concerning knowledge in medicine and its supplement, and after I have come to an end in it, by means of its explanations and its own declarations, it seemed good to me that I should complete it for you with this Treatise, which is a part of surgery, namely, chirurgery with hand.
Quoniam operatio cum manu prostrata est in regione nostra, et tempore nostro priuata omnino: donec fortasse periit scientia eius, et abscissum est uestigium eius: et non remanserunt ex ea, nisi descriptiones paruae in libris antiquorum, quas mutauerunt manus: et accidit eis error et haesitatio, donec clausae sunt intentiones eius, et elongata est uis ipsius: Visum est mihi, ut uiuificem eam cum ordinatione huius Tractatus in ea secundum uiam ex positionis, et declarationis, et abbreuiationis: et ut ueniam cum formis ferramentorum Cauterii, et reliquorum instrumentorum operis: cum fit ex declarationis additione, et ex properatione eius quod est necesse.	 Since the operation with hand has been laid down in our region and during our time entirely prohibited: until perhaps the knowledge of it perished, and its trace vanished: and there remain only small descriptions in ancient books, which have been altered by hands; and error and hesitation occurred in them, until their intentions were closed and the impulse of it was prolonged: It seemed good to me that I should revive it with this Treatise's arrangement according to the way from the position, the declaration, and abbreviation; and that I come with forms of iron tools of Cautery and the rest of instruments' operation: with making additions to declarations and obtaining what is necessary.
Caussa autem propter quam non inuenitur bonus artifex eius cum manu sua in hoc nostro tempore, est: quia ars medicinae est longa, et oportet auctorem eius exercitari ante illud in scientia anatomiae, quam narrauit Galenus, donec sciat iuuamenta membrorum, et ipsorum formas, et eorum coniunctionem, et separationem, et habeat cognitionem ossium, et neruorum, et lacertorum, et numerum ipsorum, et eorum egressionem, et uenarum pulsatilium, et quietarum, et locorum exitus earum.	 The reason why a good craftsman of this is not found with his hand in our time, is because the art of medicine is long, and it is necessary for its author to exercise before that in the science of anatomy, which Galen narrated, until he knows the remedies of members, and their forms, and their conjunction and separation, and has knowledge of bones, nerves, muscles, and their number, and their exit, and the pulsations and quiets of veins, and their locations.
Et propter illud dixit Hippocrates, quod nomen cum nomine est multum, et cum opere est paucum, et praecipue in arte manus.	 And for this reason, Hippocrates said that much is the name with the name, and little is the work, especially in the art of hand.
Nos uero iam diximus de illo in introitu huius libri.	 We have already said about it at the beginning of this book.
Quoniam qui non est sciens, quod diximus de anatomia, non euacuatur, quin iam cadat in errorem, quo interficiuntur homines: sicut ego uidi multos ex illis, qui formantur de hac scientia, et iactant se de ea absque scientia, et sine experimento.	 Since one who is not skilled in what we have said about anatomy will not be purged, but rather fall into error, in which men are slain: as I have seen many of those who are formed from this science, and boast about it without knowledge, and without experiment.
Quod est, quia uidi medicum stolidum secuisse apostema scrophulosum in collo mulieris, et incidit quasdam arterias in collo: quare fluxit sanguis mulieris, donec cecidit mortua inter manus eius.	 I have seen a foolish physician cut off a scrofulous apostema on a woman's neck and accidentally cut some arteries in the neck: therefore, the woman bled to death before his very eyes.
Et uidi medicum alium, qui praesumpsit ut extraheret lapidem uiro, qui processerat in aetate, et lapis erat magnus.	 And I have seen another physician who presumed to extract a stone from an old man who had grown it, and the stone was large.
Peruenit ergo ad eum, et extraxit ipsum cum frusto uesicae.	 Therefore, he came upon him and extracted the stone along with a fragment of the bladder.
Quare mortuus est uir in tertio die.	 Wherefore the man died on the third day.
Et ego quidem iam uocatus fueram ad extrahendum ipsum: et uidi ex magnitudine lapidis, et dispositione infirmi, quod moriretur.	 And I myself had been called to extract it; and I saw from the size of the stone and the state of the patient that he would die.
Et uidi medicum alium, qui accipiebat stipem apud quendam Ducum terrae nostrae propter medicinam: et accidit eunucho nigro, qui erat apud ipsum, fractura in crure eius prope calcaneum: et properauit medicus cum ignorantia sua, et strinxit fracturam super uulnus cum puluinaribus, et astellis strictura forti, et non dimisit uulneri expirationem.	 I have seen another physician who was receiving a stipend from some Duke of our land on account of his medicine: and a black eunuch who was with him suffered a fracture in the leg near the heel; and the physician, ignorant in this matter, bound up the fracture over the wound with ligatures and forceps, and did not allow the wound to breathe.
Deinde absoluit eum secundum desyderia sua.	 Then he treated him according to his own ideas.
Postea dimisit eum diebus aliquot, et praecepit ei, ne solueret ligamentum: et stetit sic donec apostematum est crus eius, et ipsius pes, et peruenit ad perditionem.	 Later he dismissed him for some days and ordered him not to loosen the bandage; and so he stood thus until a tumor formed on his leg, and his foot, and came to ruin.
Vocatus sum ergo ad eum: et properaui ad soluendum ligamentum: et consecuta est tranquillitas, et euasit a doloribus suis.	 Therefore I was called upon him: and I hastened to undo the bandage; and quiet came over him, and he was relieved of his pains.
Verumtamen corruptio iam confirmata erat in membro: et non potui refraenare ipsam.	 But the corruption had already become established in the limb: and I could not stop it.
Pon ergo cessauit corruptio perambulare in membro, donec periit.	 The decay shall cease to spread through the member until it has perished.
Et uidi medicum alium, qui perforauit apostema cancerosum: et ulceratum est post dies, donec magnificata est malicia eius cum domino ipsius.	 And I saw another physician who perforated a malignant ulcer: and after days it was healed when the wickedness of it was revealed to its master.
Quod est, quia quando est cancer purus ex humore melancholico, tunc non oportet ut perueniatur ad eum cum ferro omnino, nisi sit in membro quod toleret, ut abscindatur totum eius.	 Because when a cancer is pure from the humor of melancholy, then it should not be reached with iron entirely unless it is in a member that can bear it, so that the whole thing may be cut off.
Et propter illud o Filii, necesse est uobis, ut sciatis, quod operatio cum manu diuiditur in duas diuisiones: scilicet, operationem cui associatur salus: et operationem, cum qua est periculum in pluribus dispositionibus.	 And for this reason, O Sons, it is necessary for you to know that the operation is divided into two divisions: namely, an operation associated with health; and an operation, with which there is danger in various dispositions.
Et ego iam excitaui in omni loco huius libri, in quo uenit operatio, in qua est terror et timor.	 And I have already risen up in every place of this book where the operation comes, in which there is fear and dread.
Quare necesse est uobis, ut caueatis illud, et dimitatis ipsum: ut non inueniant stolidi uiam ad loquendum, et dehonestandum.	 Therefore it is necessary for you to be careful of this and to separate it yourself so that fools do not find a way to speak and disgrace themselves.
Accipite ergo mensuram cum sollicitudine et protectione, et infirmos uestros cum facilitate et firmitudine, et utimini uia meliore perducente gratia Dei ad salutem et successionem laudabilem: et dimittite aegritudines terribiles difficilis sanationis: et tollite animas uestras ab eo quod facit uos timere, ut ingrediatur super uos haesitatio in fide uestra et commodo uestro.	 Take then the measure with care and protection, and use your sick ones with ease and firmness, and make use of a better way leading by the grace of God to health and praiseworthy success; and leave behind the terrible illnesses that are difficult to heal; and deliver yourselves from that which causes you fear, so that hesitation may not enter into your faith and comfort.
Est enim magis remanens ad gloriam uestram, et sublimius in mundo isto, et postremo ad quantitates uestras.	 For it remains more for your glory, and higher in this world, and finally to your quantities.
Galenus enim iam dixit in quibusdam suis admonitionibus.	 For Galen has already said in some of his warnings.
Non medicetis aegritudinem malam: ne nominemini medici mali.	 Do not heal evil diseases, lest you be called evil physicians.
Iam autem diuisi hunc Tractatum secundum tria Capitula. ¶	 Now I have divided this Treatise according to three Chapters.
Capitulum primum.	 First Chapter.
De Cauterio cum igne, et Cauterio cum medicina acuta, capitulatum, et ordinatum a capite usque ad pedes, et formis instrumentorum, et ferramentis Cauterii: et omni quod necessarium est in operatione. ¶	 On cautery with fire and cautery with sharp medicine, this is the first chapter arranged from head to foot, and the forms of instruments for cautery, and its tools; and all that is necessary for the operation.
Capitulum secundum.	 Chapter second.
De sectione et perforatione, phlebotomia et uentosis, et uulneribus: et extractione sagittarum, et similibus illius: et totum capitulatum, ordinatum formis instrumentorum. ¶	 On section and perforation, phlebotomy and ventosities, and wounds: and extraction of arrows, and similar things: and the whole chapter, arranged in forms of instruments. ¶
Capitulum tertium.	 Chapter third.
De restauratione, et dislocatione, et curatione torsionis, et similibus illius: capitulatum, ordinatum a capite usque ad pedes, et formis instrumentorum.	 On restoration, and dislocation, and treatment of twisting, and similar things: the chapter is arranged from head to foot, and forms of instruments.
Soli Deo Gloria.	 To God alone be the glory.
Liber Chirurgici Albucasis.	 The Surgical Book of Albucasis.
Pars I.	 Part I.
¶ De Iuuamento, et Nocumento Cauterii: et quibus complexionibus conueniat, et quo tempore: et si cum ferro, uel auro.	 On the help and harm of cautery: in what constitutions it agrees, and at what time: whether with iron or gold. ¶
Caput I.	 Chapter I.
Sed Ante Quidem Quam rememorer operationis cum eo, oportet ut dicam qualitatem Iuuamentorum eius, et Nocumentorum ipsius: et in qua complexione exhibeatur.	 Before I remind you of the operation with it, it is necessary that I say the quality of its remedies and its harms, and in what composition it should be presented.
Dico ergo, quod sermo de qualitate iuuamenti Cauterii, et nocumenti eius, est sermo prolixus, et subtilis, scientia, et secretum occultum.	 I therefore say that the discussion of the quality of the remedy and harm of the cautery is a long, subtle, scientific, and hidden knowledge.
Etiam locuta fuit in eo multitudo sapientum, et dissenserunt in eo: et mihi quidem sufficit parum ex sermonibus eorum, timens prolongationem.	 Also there was a multitude of wise men who debated on it and disagreed among themselves; and to me, at least, a little of their discussions is sufficient for me, fearing prolongation.
Dico ergo, quod Cauterium confert uniuersaliter omni complexioni, quae est cum materia, et absque materia: excaeptis duabus complexionibus, quae sunt complexio calida absque materia, et complexio sicca absque materia.	 I therefore say that the cautery applies universally to every composition, whether with material or without; except for two compositions, which are the hot composition without material and the dry composition without material.
In complexione autem calida et sicca cum materia dissenserunt.	 In the hot and dry composition with material, they disagreed.
Quidam enim dixerunt, quod Cauterium iuuatiuum est in ea.	 Some said that the cautery is beneficial in it.
Et dixerunt alii contrarium illius, scilicet quod Cauterium non est conueniens in aegritudine, quae est ex caliditate et siccitate: quoniam natura ignis est caliditas: et inconueniens est, ut sanetur ex agritudine calida et sicca, cum calido et sicco.	 Others said the opposite of this, namely that the cautery is not suitable for the illness which is from heat and dryness; because the nature of fire is heat; and it is inconvenient to be healed from a hot and dry illness with heat and dryness.
Et dixit ille qui dicit contrarium illius: quod per Cauterium fit iuuamentum in omni aegritudine calida et sicca, quae accidit in corporibus hominum: quoniam quando tu comparas corpus hominis, et humiditates eius, ad complexionem ignis, inuenis corpus hominis frigidum.	 And he who says the opposite of this said that the cautery is beneficial for all hot and dry illnesses which happen in the bodies of men; because when you compare the body of a man and his humors to the composition of fire, you find the body of the man cold.
Et ego quidem dico per sermonem eius: quia ex perimentum iam detexit mihi illud aliquotiens.	 And I myself say by that speech: because it has often been proven to me in practice.
Verumtamen non oportet, ut ueniat super illud, nisi qui iam probatus est, et exercitatus in capitulo Cauterii exercitio ultimo, et cognouit diuersitatem complexionum hominum, et dispositionem aegritudinum in se ipsis, et caussas earum, et accidentia ipsarum, et spacium temporis earum.	 Nevertheless, it is not necessary for it to come up again unless he who has been tested and experienced in the last chapter of cautery exercise, and knows the diversity of men's compositions, and the disposition of illnesses within themselves, and the causes and accidents of them, and the duration of their span.
Ex reliquis autem complexionibus non est super uos timor: et praecipue in aegritudinibus frigidis et humidis.	 From the remaining temperaments (complexions), there is no fear for you; and especially in cold and moist diseases.
Iam enim conuenerunt omnes medici super eas: et non dissenserunt in iuuamento cum Cauterio in eis.	 For indeed, all physicians have agreed on them (cauteries); and they have not disagreed on the use of cautery with them.
Et scitote filii, quod ex secreto curationis per Cauterium cum igne, et bonitate eius super Cauterium cum medicina comburente est: quoniam ignis est simplex, cuius actio non peruenit, nisi ad membrum quod cauterisatur: et non nocet membro alio coniuncto cum eo, nisi nocumento paruo.	 And know, my sons, that from the secret of treatment by cautery with fire and its goodness on cautery with medicine burning, since fire is simple, whose action does not reach except to the member which is being cauterized; and it does not harm another joint connected with it, unless in a slight degree.
Medicinae uero comburentis actio peruenit ad illud quod elongatur ex membris: et fortasse facit accidere in membro aegritudinem difficilis sanationis, et fortasse interficit.	 But the action of medicine burning reaches that which is stretched out from the members; and perhaps it causes pain in a member and perhaps kills it.
Ignis autem propter subtilitatem suam et bonitatem substantiae suae, non facit illud, nisi superfluat.	 Fire, however, because of its subtlety and goodness of substance, does not do that unless it is in excess.
Iam uero innotuit nobis illud per experimentum, propter longitudinem seruitutis et studii cum arte, et stationem super ueritatem rerum: et propter illud excusor a longitudine sermonis.	 Now indeed it has become known to us through experiment, because of the length of service and diligence with skill, and the position concerning truth; and because of that I excuse myself from the length of speech.
Et si non esset, quia non licet huic libro meo, afferrem uobis secretum occultum in igne, et qualitatem operationis eius in corporibus expulsionis suae, qua expellit aegritudines sermone philosophico demonstratiuo, qui acueretur a mentibus uestris.	 And if it were not that it is not allowed for this book of mine, I would bring to you the secret concealed in fire, and the quality of its operation in bodies, by which it expels diseases, which could be demonstrated philosophically, and which would become clear to your minds.
Et scitote filii, quod ipsi dissentiunt in tempore, in quo conuenit fieri cauterium, et ponunt melius tempus ueris.	 And know, my sons, that they (physicians) themselves differ as to the time when a cautery should be made, and they put the better time in truth.
Et ego dico, quod cauterium conuenit in omni tempore: propterea, quod nocumentum accidens propter tempus submergitur in iuuamento, quod attrahitur cum cauterio.	 And I say that a cautery is appropriate at any time; for this reason, any harm resulting from the time (of the operation) is immersed in the benefit which is drawn near by the cautery.
Et praecipue si cauterium est propter dolores ex doloribus necessariis, fortibus, festinis, qui non tolerant tarditatem: propterea quod timetur ex eis, quod accidat malicia quae est maior, quam paruum nocumentum intrans propter tempus.	 And especially if a cautery is for pains from necessary pains, strong, frequent, which do not tolerate delay; for this reason it is feared that there may occur a greater harm which would exceed the slight damage caused by time.
Et non cadat in mentibus uestris o filii illud, quod non extimant, nisi uulgus et stolidi medici, scilicet quod illi aegritudini quae sanatur per cauterium, non est reditio semper: et ponunt illud consequens, et res non est sicut putant: propterea quod cauterium non est, nisi loco medicinae, quae alterat complexionem, et exiccat humiditates quae sunt caussae, quare accidunt dolores.	 And let not that thought enter your minds, O sons, that it is not believed, except by the common people and foolish physicians, namely that there is no return for the ailment that is cured by cautery; and they put forth this as a consequence, but things are not so as they think: therefore because cautery is not, except in place of medicine, which alters complexion, and drives out humidities that are causes, wherefore pains occur.
Verumtamen cauterium superfluit super medicinam per uelocitatem ualetudinis suae, et uirtutem suae operationis, et uehementiam dominii sui: et possibile est, ut redeat aegritudo hora aliqua temporis secundum complexionem infirmi, et locationem aegritudinis suae, et uirtutem eius: et quod praeparatur in corpore eius ex aggregatione superfluitatum in eo: et quod peruenit ad ipsum in acquisitione sua ex cibis, et similibus illis ex caussis, nisi fit aegritudo, in qua administratur cauterium.	 However, the cautery is not always necessary for medicine due to the swiftness of its health, and the power of its operation, and the intensity of its dominion: it is possible that the ailment returns after a certain hour of time according to the complexion of the sick person, and the location of his ailment, and the strength of its effect: and whatever is prepared in his body from the accumulation of superfluities within him: and whatever reaches it in its acquisition from food, and similar things as causes, unless the ailment occurs where cautery is administered.
Aegritudo subtilis in membro paucarum superfluitatum, et humiditatum, sicut cauterium dentis, propter dolorem, et similia illi, possibile est enim, ut non redeat in eo ille dolor.	 A subtle ailment in the member of small superfluities and humidities, such as cautery for teeth, due to pain, etc., it is possible that that pain will not return in him.
Sed illud fit in paucis.	 But that happens in a few cases.
At uero sermo uulgi iterum, quod cauterium est postremum medicinae, est sermo rectus: non ad illud quod ipsi intendunt in illo: quoniam ipsi credunt, quod non est curatio quae conferat cum medicina, neque cum alio post occasum cauterii.	 However, the speech of the common people again, that cautery is the last resort of medicine, is correct, not for what they intend in it: because they believe that there is no cure which gives with medicine or anything after the fall of cautery.
Res autem est econtrario illius, et intentio, quod cauterium est postremum medicinae, non est, nisi quod quando nos administramus modos curationis in aliqua aegritudinum, et non conferunt illae medicinae: deinde administramus in fine rei cauterium, et confert: tunc inde cadit, quod cauterium est postremum mediciuae, non secundum intentionem quam intelligunt uulgus et multistolidorum medicorum.	 But the matter is contrary to theirs, and their intention, that cautery is the last resort of medicine, is not, except when we administer modes of cure for some ailments, and those do not give with medicine: then we administer cautery at the end, and it cures: then it falls out that cautery is the last resort of medicine, not according to the intention which the common people and many foolish physicians understand.
Antiqui autem dixerunt, quod cauterium cum auro est melius, quam cauterium cum ferro: et non dixerunt illud, nisi propter aequalitatem auri, et sublimitatem substantiae suae: et dixerunt, quod non facit pus locus cauterii.	 The ancients said that a cautery with gold is better than a cautery with iron; and they did not say this except because of the equality of gold, and the refinement of its substance; and they said that it does not cause pus at the site of cauterization.
Verum non est illud absolute: quoniam ego iam probaui illud, et inueni, quod ipsum non facit illud in quibusdam corporibus absque aliis.	 That is not entirely true; for I have already proven that it does not do this in certain bodies without any other effects.
Et cauterium cum ipso est bonum, et melius quam cum ferro, sicut dixerunt.	 And a cautery with it is good, and better than with iron, as they said.
Verumtamen quando tu ignis cauterium in igne ex auro, non declaratur tibi, quando ignitur secundum quantitatem quam uis, propter rubedinem auri: et quando properat ad ipsum frigus, et si addis super ipsum ignitionem, liquescit in igne, et uertitur in laminas.	 However, when you heat the cautery in fire from gold, it is not known to you when heated according to the quantity desired due to the redness of gold; and when it approaches the same coldness, if you add more heat to it, it liquefies in the fire and turns into sheets.
Quare cadit artifex ex illo in occupationem: et propter illud fit Cauterium cum ferro apud nos uelocius et propinquius, ex rectitudine ad operationem.	 Therefore, the craftsman falls out of occupation because of this; and for that reason a cautery with iron is more expedient and closer at hand among us for the purpose of the operation.
Et ego quidem iam ordinaui hoc Capitulum in Cauterio, secundum capitula: et ordinaui ea a capite usque ad pedes: ut alleuient quaerenti illud quod uult ex eo.	 And I myself have already arranged this Chapter on the Cautery, according to chapters; and I have ordered it from head to foot: so that those who seek it may find what they want from it.
¶ De modo cauterizandi Caput in commissura coronali.	 Chapter on the method of cauterizing a head at the coronary suture.
Caput II.	 Chapter II.
Confert hic cauterizatio ad dominium humiditatis et frigiditatis super cerebrum: quae duae sunt caussae sodae, et multitudinis fluxus humorum ex capite ad partes oculorum et aurium, et multitudinis somni, et doloris dentium, et doloris gutturis: et uniuersaliter omnis aegritudinis, quae accidit ex frigiditate, sicut paralisis, et sodae, epilepsiae, et apoplexiae, et similia illis ex aegritudinibus.	 Here cauterization is applied for the lordship of humidity and coldness over the brain; which are two causes of scurvy, and flow of many fluids from the head to the parts of the eyes and ears, and sleepiness, toothache, sore throat, and in general any sickness that occurs due to coldness, such as paralysis, scurvy, epilepsy, apoplexy, and similar diseases.
Modus cauterizationis est, ut praecipias infirmo: ut euacuetur in primis cum medicina solutiua mundificante caput tribus noctibus, aut quatuor, secundum quod exigit uirtus infirmi, et eius aetas, et consuetudo eius.	 The method of cauterization is to order the sick person: to evacuate it first with medicine dissolved in warm water for three or four nights, according to the strength of the sick person, and his age, and his habit.
Deinde praecipe ei, ut radi faciat caput suum cum nouacula.	 Then command him to make an incision on his head with a new lancet.
Deinde fac eum sedere inter manus tuas quadratum, ita quod iam posuit manus suas super pectus suum.	 Then make him sit facing your hands, so that he now places his hands upon his chest.
Deinde pone radicem palmae tuae super radicem nasi sui inter oculos suos.	 Then place the palm of your hand on the root of his nose between his eyes.
Vbicumque ergo peruenerit digitus tuus medius, signa locum illum cum incausto.	 Wherever your middle finger comes to rest, mark that place with charcoal.
Deinde igni Cauterium Oliuare: cuius haec est forma.	 Then heat the cautery oil: this is its shape. (Here follows a description of the tool.)
Deinde pone ipsum super locum signatum cum incausto, descensione, qua constringatur manus tua paulatim, et tu reuolues ipsum.	 Then place it on the marked spot with charcoal, pressing down gradually with your hand, and you turn it.
Deinde leua manum tuam uelociter, et aspicias locum.	 Then quickly withdraw your hand and look at the place.
Quod si uides iam detegi ex osse quantitatem capitis alkiel, aut quantitatem zeuherbi, tunc eleua manum tuam.	 If you see it has been burned away a quantity of bone from the skull or of hair, then quickly withdraw your hand.
Et si non, itera manum tuam ferro ipso, aut cum alio ab ipso si infrigidatur: donec uideantur ossa, quae dixi tibi.	 And if not, keep pressing with the iron itself or with another until you see the bones that I told you about.
Deinde sume aliquid ex sale, et solue illud in aqua, et imbibe in ipso cotum, et pone super locum: et dimitte ipsum tribus diebus.	 Then take some salt and dissolve it in water, dip a cloth in the solution, and place it on the spot; let it remain for three days.
Deinde pone super ipsum cotum imbibitum in butyro, et dimitte illum super locum, donec destruatur eschara ignis.	 Then place a cloth dipped in butter over the burn and leave it until the scab of fire is destroyed.
Deinde cura illud cum unguento tetrapharmacon, usquequo sanetur.	 Then treat it with the four-ingredient ointment until it heals. (Here follows a recipe for the ointment.)
Iam dixerunt, quod quanto uulnus plus remanet apertum, emittit pus: quare est melius et magis iuuatiuum.	 They have said that as long as a wound remains open, it discharges pus; therefore it is better and more healing.
Et dixerunt quidam eorum, ut cauterizetur cutis usque ad os: et teneatur Cauterium, donec aduratur quiddam spissitudinis ossis.	 Some of them have said that the skin should be cauterized up to the bone; and hold the cautery until something of the thickness of the bone is burned.
Deinde radatur post illud quod adustum est ex osse, deinde curetur.	 Then grind down the burnt bone, then treat it.
Et dicunt alii, quod oportet ut cum cauterio perueniatur ad ultimum, donec imprimat in os impressionem for tem, ita quod cadat os, quod fit sicut forma kirate: aut instrumentum quod mulieres ponunt infuso alphabeti parui: et extimant, quod exspirantur ex hoc loco uapores capitis, et dimittatur uulnus apertum tempore longo.	 Others say that when the cautery is used to its limit, an impression should be made on the bone for as long as it falls off like a layer of skin, or an instrument similar to what women use for infusing a small amount of alcohol, and they believe that vapors of the head escape from this place; and leave the open wound for a long time.
Deinde curetur, donec consolidetur.	 Then it shall be treated until it solidifies.
Mihi autem non uidentur hae duae species Cauterii omnino nisi in quibusdam hominibus secundum uiam timoris.	 To me, these two kinds of cautery do not appear at all except in certain men according to the way of fear.
Et dimittere ipsum, apud me est melius cum salute ipsius.	 And let him be sent away, with me it is better for his own safety.
Debilitatur enim caput ex solutione continuitatis ipsius naturalis: sicut testificati sumus in reliquis membris: et praecipue quando caput infirmi debile est natura: et species quidem Cauterii prima est magis salua et melior apud me, et ea utor: operare ergo cum ea in salute.	 For indeed the head is weakened by the continuity of its own solution; as we have testified in other members; and especially when the head of the weak is naturally frail; and the first kind of cautery is safer and better according to me, and I use it; therefore, operate with it for safety.
¶ De modo cauterizandi capitis in dolore totius capitis.	 Chapter on the method of cauterizing the head when the whole head is in pain.
Caput III.	 Chapter III.
Quando in toto Capite accidit dolor chronicus: et prolongatur illud in infirmo, et utitur hyeris, et cochiis, et caputpurgiis, et oleis, et empleumatis.	 When a chronic pain occurs throughout the whole head: and it is prolonged in the sick, and uses herbs, and poultices, and leeches, and oils, and plasters.
Et praecipue si iam cauterizatum est cauterio uno, quod narrauimus, et non confert ei aliquid ex illis: tunc considera.	 Moreover, if it has already been cauterized with one cautery, as we have mentioned, and it does not improve from these [measures]: then consider.
Nam si caput infirmi est fortis creationis natura, et non est debile, et inuenit frigus uehemens: tunc cauteriza cum cauterio alio sub illo parum.	 If the head of the sick person is strong by nature and not weak, and it finds intense coldness: then cauterize with another cautery gently under that [part].
Deinde cauteriza ipsum super omne cornu capitis sui cauterio, do nec pertranseat cutis, et discooperiatur ex osse quantitas, quam narrauimus.	 Then cauterize it on the whole horn of his head with a cautery, so that the skin is not pierced through, and an amount of bone is uncovered as we have mentioned.
Et cauteriza ipsum cauterio uno in occipitio capitis sui, in loco qui nominatur uas: et est locus in quo ponitur uentosa: et eleua matum tuam in hoc, et non discooperias os.	 And cauterize it with one cautery on the occiput of his head, at the place which is called a vessel; and it is a place where a vent is placed; pour your warm oil into this, and do not uncover the bone.
Infirmus enim inuenit propter illud dolorem uehementem, et diuersum a dolore reliquorum cauteriorum capitis omnium.	 For the sick person finds intense pain from that [source of pain], and different from the pain of all other cauteries of the head.
Et ego dicam hoc Cauterium in loco suo: et oportet quod sit cauterium, quo cauterizantur cornua capitis, et occiput eius subtilius cauterio, quo cauterizatur medium capitis.	 And I will say this cautery for the place itself; and it is necessary that it be a cautery which cauterizes horns of the head, and the occiput more delicately with a cautery which cauterizes the middle of the head.
Et haec est forma eius.	 And this is its form [the shape of the cautery].
¶ De modo cauterizandi in hemicrania, tam cum medicina adustiua, quam cum ferro.	 § On the method of cauterizing in hemicrania, both with heated medicine, as well as with iron.
Caput IIII.	 Chapter III [The third chapter]
Quando accidit in parte capitis dolor et soda, aut extenditur dolor usque ad oculum, et euacuatur cum medicinis mundificantibus caput, et administratur reliqua curatio, quam dixi in diuisionibus aegritudinum, et non confert illud totum: tunc cauterizatio in eo est secundum duos modos: aut cauterizatio cum medicina acuta comburente: aut cum ferro.	 When there is pain and swelling in part of the head, or the pain extends to the eye, and it is treated with purifying medicines for the head, and further treatment is administered as I have said in the division of illnesses, and it does not improve: then cauterization is applied to this [condition] according to two methods: either cauterization with a sharp hot medicine; or with iron.
Cauterium autem cum medicina acuta comburente, est, ut accipias dentem unum allii, et excortices ipsum, et abscindas extremitates eius ex duobus lateribus.	 The cautery with a sharp burning medicine is to receive one garlic clove, peel it, and cut off its ends from both sides.
Deinde scinde locum doloris in tempore cum phlebotomo lato, donec fiat in eo locus sub cute, in quo dens capitur.	 Then divide the place of pain at the time with a wide lance, until there is a place under the skin where the tooth can be captured.
Intromitte ergo eum in ipso sub cute, donec occultetur: deinde stringe super ipsum cum puluillo constrictione decenti, et dimitte ipsum quantitate quindecim horarum deinde solue eum, et extrahe allium, et dimitteuulnus duobus diebus, aut tribus: postea pone super ipsum cotum submersum in butyro, donec locus efficiat pus: deinde cura ipsum cum unguento usquequo sanetur.	 Introduce it into the same place under the skin until it is hidden: then press on it with a suitable ligature and leave it for fifteen hours, then dissolve it and extract the garlic, and leave the wound for two or three days; afterwards put a hot plaster submerged in butter over it until a pus forms: then care for it with an ointment until it heals.
Et si uis fac illud cum quibusdam medicinis comburentibus, quas ego scripsi in tractatu duodecimo, de Medieinis adurentibus.	 And if you wish to perform that procedure with certain burning medicines which I have written about in the twelfth treatise on poisons.
Cauterizatio uero eius cum ferro, est secundum hunc modum.	 But cauterization of this kind is as follows:
Igni Cauterium, cuius forma haec est.	 Fire Cautery, whose form is as follows:
Et nominatur Clauilis: quoniam forma capitis eius est sicut forma claui, in quo est quiddam curuitatis, et in medio eius est quaedam eminentia parua.	 And it is called Clauilis: because its head's form resembles a nail, in which there is some curved part, and in the middle of it there is a small projection.
Deinde pone ipsum super locum, et retine manum tuam: et tu reuolue ferrum paulatim cum uelocitate: et sit quantitas quae aduritur ex spissitudine cutis, sicut medietas eius.	 Then place it on the location and hold your hand; and you rotate the iron slowly with speed; let the quantity to be cauterized be of skin thickness, as its half.
Et eleua manum tuam, ut non aduratur arteria, quae est inferius, et accidat fluxus sanguinis.	 And lift your hand, so that an artery below it is not burned and blood flow occurs.
Deinde imbibe cotum in aqua salis, et pone super locum, et dimitte ipsum tribus diebus: deinde pone cotum cum butyro: postea cura cum unguento usquequo sanetur.	 Then immerse the cotton in a saltwater solution and place it on the location, leave it for three days; then immerse the cotton with butter; afterwards treat it with ointment until it heals.
Et si uis, cauteriza hanc hemicraniam cum extremitate cultellari secunda Cauterii.	 And if you wish, cauterize this hemicania with a second part of the Cautery cutlery.
Et caue ab incisione arteriae in hac hemicrania, non antiqua proprie.	 Beware not to make an incision in the artery of this hemicania, not anciently.
¶ De modo cauteriezandi in hemicrania antiqua.	 [Heading] On the method of cauterization in ancient hemicania.
Caput V.	 Chapter V.
Quando curas hemicraniam, cum eo quod diximus ex curatione praecedente, et quod diximus in diuisionibus aegritudinum, et non confert curatio: et uides ex aegritudine, quod non sufficit ei quod diximus ex cauterio primo cum medicina, aut cum cauterio cum igne, tunc oportet ut ignias Cauterium cultellare, donec albificetur postquam signas super locum doloris cum linea, cuius longitudo sit medietas digiti, aut quasi illud: et depone manum tuam uice una, et stringe eam donec incidas arteriam, et peruenias usque ad os.	 When you treat a hemicania, as we have said in the previous treatment and what we have said in the divisions of diseases, and the treatment does not help; and you see from the disease that it is insufficient for what we have said with the first cautery with medicine, or with cautery with fire, then it is necessary to heat the Cautery cutlery until it becomes white, after you mark the location of pain with a line whose length is half a finger, or about that; and lay your hand aside once, and press it until you make an incision in the artery, and reach the bone.
Verumtamen necesse est tibi, ut caueas a continuatione mandibulae, quae mouetur apud masticationem, ne aduratur latus, aut neruus qui mouet ipsam, unde accidat spasmus.	 However, it is necessary for you to beware of the continuous movement of the jaw, which occurs during chewing, so that the side or nerve that moves it is not burned, and a spasm does not occur.
Et esto super custotiam, et cautelam de fluxu sanguinis arteriae, quae abscisa est.	 And it should be concerning the care and caution regarding the flow of blood from a severed artery.
In abscisione enim eius est timor, et praecipue ei qui ignorat illud quod facit, et non est studiosus, nec expertus: et dimittit operationem cum eo in primis.	 In the cutting (of an artery), fear is present and particularly for him who does not know what he is doing and is not diligent or experienced; and he should first abandon the operation with this person.
Et ego ueniam cum rememoratione regiminis fluxus sanguinis accidentis ex arteria secundum modum suum, et in loco suo huius libri.	 And I shall come (again) with a reminder of the management of bleeding from an artery according to its own method, and in its proper place in this book.
Quod si uides ex aegritudine, quod non sufficit ei hoc Cauterium, et uides corpus infirmi tolerans cauterium in medio capitis, sicut narrauimus, cura uulnus, donec sanetur.	 If you see that this cautery does not suffice for the patient and you see the body of the weak one bearing the cautery in the middle of the head, as we have narrated, care for the wound until it heals.
Et si uis, administra Cauterium, quod diximus in capitulo extractionis arteriae cum Cauterio habente duos cultellos.	 And if you wish, administer cautery, as we have said in the chapter on the extraction of an artery with cautery having two knives.
Est enim cauterizatio melior hac et magis conferens.	 Indeed, cauterization is better in this way and more beneficial.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in dolore Aurium.	 On the method of cauterizing in pain of an ear.
Caput VI.	 Chapter VI.
Quando accidit in Aure dolor a frigore, et curatur cum solutiuis, et reliqua curatione quam diximus in diuisione, et non remouetur dolor, tunc igni Cauterium: et est illud quod nominatur Punctum, cuius forma est haec.	 When there is pain in the ear due to cold and it is treated with solvents, and with other treatments as we have said in division, and yet the pain does not subside, then cauterize with fire: this is what is called Punctum; its form is as follows.
Deinde puncta cum eo post eius ignitionem in circumitu auris totius, sicut reuoluitur: aut in circumitu utriusque, si simul dolor est in utrisque.	 Then the punctum is made with it after its ignition around the entire ear, as it is described; or around both if pain occurs on both sides.
Et elonga te cum Cauterio a radice auris parumper, postquam signaueris loca cum encaustro: et sit cauterii quantitas decem punctorum in omni aure, et quasi illa.	 And extend the cautery slightly away from the root of the ear after marking the spots with pitch; and let the quantity of the cauterization be ten puncta in every ear, and about that.
Deinde cura loca, donec sanentur.	 Then care for the spots until they heal.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Tortura.	 On the method of cauterizing in a torture.
Caput VII.	 Chapter VII.
Tortura quae curatur cum cauterizatione, non est nisi ex speciebus, quae accidunt ex phlegmate, secundum quod diximus in diuisionibus aegritudinum.	 The torture that is cured with cauterization, is not other than those occurring by phlegm, according to what we said in the divisions of illnesses.
Et deuita cauterizationem speciei, quae accidit ex exiccatione, et spasmo nerui.	 And to be avoided are cauterization and bleeding of those occurring by excision, and spasm of a nerve.
Quando curas hanc speciem torturae cum hyeris, et caputpurgiis, et gargarismis, et non confert curatio tua, tunc oportet ut cauterizes infirmum tribus Cauteriis: uno apud radicem auris, et secundo parum inferius a timpore suo, et tertio apud coniunctionem duorum labiorum.	 When this kind of torture cannot be cured by herbs, and purges, and gargles, then it is necessary that you cauterize the sick person with three Cauteries: one at the root of the ear, and second a little below his earlobe, and third at the junction of the two lips.
Et pone Cauterium tuum ex contrario partis infirmae.	 Place your Cautery on the weaker side of the body.
Quoniam mollificatio non accidit, nisi in parte quae apparet sana.	 Since softening does not occur unless in the healthy part.
Et forma cauterizationis est, ut cauterizes ipsum Cauterio in directo extremitatis auris superioris sub cornu capitis parum: et alio in timpore: cuius longitudo sit secundum longitudinem pollicis.	 And the form of cauterization is that you cauterize with the Cautery itself directly on the upper end of the ear lobe near the vertex, and another at the earlobe; whose length should be according to the length of the thumb.
Et depone manum tuam cum cauterio, donec comburatur quantitas medietatis spissitudinis cutis.	 And place your hand with the Cautery until a quantity equal to half the thickness of the skin is burned.
Et haec est forma Cauterii, et est species ex cultellari, cuius forma praemissa est: uerumtamen non est subtilior ea parum, sicut uides: et oportet ut sit cultellus in eo superfluae grossitudinis parum.	 And this is the form of the Cautery, and it is of the type of a scalpel, whose shape was mentioned before; but it should not be too thin, as you can see; and it is necessary that there be a scalpel in it of excessive thickness a little less.
Deinde cura loca, cum eo quod praecessit: donec sanetur.	 Then take care of the places where this was done until they are healed.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Apoplexia antiqua.	 Chapter on the method of cauterizing in ancient apoplexy.
Caput VIII.	 Chapter VIII.
QUando antiquatur Apoplexia, et curas eam cum eo quod diximus, et non confert medicatio tua, et infirmus non habet febrem, tunc cauteriza eum quatuor cauteriis super omne cornu capitis sui, et cauterio in medio capitis, sicut diximus, et cauterio in occipitio capitis, secundum quod praecessit: et modus cauterii sit secundum quod praecessit.	 When apoplexy occurs and it cannot be cured with what has been said, and the sick person does not have a fever, then cauterize him with four Cauteries over all his skull, and a Cautery in the middle of his head, as was mentioned before, and a Cautery on the back of his head, according to what has been described; and the method of cauterization should be according to what has been described.
Etiam cauterizatur cum Cauterio super os stomachi: et est magis ultimum.	 Also cauterized on the face of the stomach with a cautery; and it is more ultimate.
Deinde curetur, cum eo quod praecessit.	 Then cured when that which preceded has been done.

Oportet ut in potu dentur in primis infirmo hyerae magnae, et pillulae mundificantes cerebrum.	 It is necessary that in drink, for the sick head, there be first great hyerae, and purifying pills of brain.
Deinde rade caput infirmi totum, et pone super occipitium eius emplastrum de synapi descriptum in tractatu emplastrorum: et pone ipsum aliquotiens.	 Then shave the sick head entirely, and place on its backside ointment from synapi described in the treatise of ointments; place it there often.
Ipsum namque est modus Cauterii: et fac illud secundum ordinem eundem, quem dixi illic.	 For that is the method of cautery; and make it in the same order as I said there.
Si ergo sanatur per illud, bonum est.	 If then he is healed by this, it is good.
Si non: tunc fac ei cauteria tria in posteriori parte capitis sui, quae sint descendentia a superiori parte capitis usque ad inferiorem partem oculi: et pone inter omne cauterium grossitudinem digiti.	 If not: then make for him three cauteries on the backside of his head, which are descending from the upper part of the head to the lower part of the eye; and place between every cautery a thickness of finger.
Deinde cura Cauterium, cum eo quod praecessit.	 Then care for the cautery, as for what went before.
Si autem uis additionem, et infirmus est tolerans illud: tunc fac ei Cauterium in medio.	 If however you wish an addition, and the sick one can bear it; then make a cautery in the middle.
Quod si uis additionem: tunc cauteriza ipsum super duo cornua.	 And if you want an addition: then cauterize it over two horns.
Deinde cura ipsum, donec sanetur: sitque Cauterium oliuare secundum formam, quae praemissa est.	 Then care for it until he is healed; and let the cautery be anointed according to the shape that was given before.

Then shave the sick head; afterwards cauterize it with a cautery in the middle of the head, and with a cautery on every horn of the head, and with a cautery on the backside of it, and with three on the spine of the neck.
Si autem indiges in aegritudine mollificatione corporis pluribus illis, et infirmus est tolerans, et aegritudo est fortis: tunc cauteriza ipsum quatuor cauteriis super spondiles dorsi, et ultima cum cauterio, donec comburatur ex cute plurimum eius, et eleua manum tuam.	 If however in sickness you require softening of the body with more of these, and the sick one can bear it, and the illness is strong: then cauterize it with four cauteries on the spine, and the last one with a cautery until it burns through the skin most of it, and loosen your hand.
Deinde cura ipsum, donec sanetur: et sic cauterium Oliuare.	 Then take care of yourself until you are healed: and thus cauterize with oil.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Epilepsia.	 On the method of cauterization for epilepsy.
Caput XI.	 Chapter XI.

Oportet ergo ut mundifices cerebrum eius in primis cum hyeris, et cum reliqua curatione quam diximus in diuisione: quando infirmus est magnus, aut est tolerans in accaeptione medicinarum.	 Therefore it is necessary to clean the brain of the epileptic patient first with hyssop and with the rest of the treatment that we have mentioned earlier, when the patient is critically ill or tolerant of medication.
Si autem est puer, qui non tolerat medicinas, tunc administratur gargarisma, et masticationes mundificantes cerebrum, ante illud diebus multis cum bonificatione ciborum.	 If the patient is a child who cannot tolerate medication, then administer gargarisma and cleansing food for the brain, many days before with good nourishment.
Deinde rade caput eius, postea cauteriza ipsum Cauterio uno in medio capitis, secundum quod praecessit in modo: et cauterio alio in occipitio eius, et super omne cornu capitis sui cauterio.	 Then shave his head, then cauterize the patient himself with a single cautery in the middle of the head according to what has been described earlier; and with another cautery on the back of his head and over all the horn of his head.
Quod si infirmus fuerit fortis, et fuerit tolerans, tunc cauteriza ipsum cauteriis, quae dixi in habente paralisim, et mollificationem corporis super spondiles colli, et spondiles dorsi: et sit Cauterium oliuare secundum modum qui praecessit.	 If the patient is strong and tolerant, then cauterize him with the cauteries mentioned earlier for paralysis, and mollification of the body on vertebrae of the neck and backbone; and let it be oil-cauterized as described earlier.

Et si caussa melancholiae est superfluitas decliuis ad melancholiam, et est corpus infirmi humectum, tunc da ei in potu quod mundificet cerebrum eius, secundum quod praecessit in diuisione: deinde rade caput infirmi, et fac postea tortellam decenter factam ex lino, sicut circulum.	 And if the cause of melancholy is an excess of declivis leading to melancholy and the body of the patient is moist, then give him a drink that cleanses his brain as described earlier; then shave the head of the patient, and make a well-centered bandage from linen, similar to a circle.

When the beginning of water appears in the eye through the signs that I said in the division, then begin and wash the sick person while cleansing his head.
Et custodi ipsum ab omnibus humiditatibus, et fac eum sedere in balneo, in ieiunio diebus aliquot.	 And keep him away from all moisture, and make him sit in a bath for several days while fasting.
Deinde praecipe ei, ut radat caput suum, et cauteriza ipsum in medio capitis sui.	 Then order him to shave his head, and cauterize it in the middle of his own head.
Deinde cauteriza ipsum super duo timpora duobus cauteriis, si est incaeptio descensus aquae in duobus oculis simul: aut ex latere uno, si est incaeptio aquae in oculo uno: et abscinde cum cauterio omnes uenas et arterias quae sunt sub cute: et sint cauteria in ea longa in latitudine timporum: et caue a fluxu sanguinis.	 Then cauterize it over two temples with two cauteries, if the descent of water appears in both eyes at once; or from one side, if the water appears in only one eye; and cut off all veins and arteries that are under the skin using the cautery, and let the cauteries be long in length equal to the temples' width; and avoid bleeding.
Quod si uides aliquid ex eo, tunc abscinde eum statim cum quacumque medicina est possibile: et ego ueniam cum sapientia, quae est in extractione arteriarum, et abscisione earum, et cautela a fluxu sanguinis.	 If you see something coming out of it, then cut it off immediately with any medicine that is possible; and I will come with the wisdom that is in extracting arteries and cutting them off, and taking care to avoid bleeding.

Quando lachrymae oculorum sunt antiquae, assiduae: et sunt super uenas, et arterias quae sunt in manifesto capitis exterius, uerificatur quod illud est ex superfluitatibus frigidis, phlegmaticis: tunc cauteriza cauterio eodem quod narraui in incaeptione aquae descendentis, cauterio in medio capitis, et duobus cauteriis super duo timpora, et duobus cauteriis in ceruice sub duobus ossibus.	 When tears of the eyes are chronic and on veins and arteries that are visible externally on the head, it is verified that it is due to an excess of cold, phlegmatic humors; then cauterize with a cautery as I have described in the beginning concerning descending water, a cautery in the middle of the head, and two cauteries above the two temples, and two cauteries on the neck under the two bones.
Et si indiges additione, tunc cauteriza ipsum in omni latere caute oculi, super extremitatem supercilii cum cauterio paruo.	 And if necessary, then cauterize it carefully on all sides of the eye, above the eyebrow with a small cautery.

And if you wish, cauterize it above the eyebrows with two small cauteries in all parts; and they should extend from the temples; and the length of the entire cautery should be according to the length of the eyebrows; and do not bring your hand with the cautery too close, rather according to the quantity that is burned by the third eyelash.

¶ De modo cauterizandi Palpebram cum pili inuersantur pungentes oculum.	 In the manner of cauterizing the eyelid, when hairs are turned inward and piercing the eye.
Caput XVII.	 Chapter Seventeen.
Cauterium in eo est secundum duos modos: aut cauterium cum igne: aut cauterium cum medicina comburente.	 The cautery is in two modes: either a cautery with fire, or a cautery with a burning medicine.
In cauterio autem cum igne, praecipe infirmo ante illud, ut dimittat pilos suos, si est ex illis qui mundant eos, donec prolongentur et aequentur.	 In the cautery with fire, command the sick person to release his hairs if he is among those who clean them, until they grow out and are evened.
Si autem pungunt eum apud ortum suum: tunc constringe oculos eius cum uitta, ut non moueantur, donec nascantur.	 If they pierce him at the root of his eye: then bind his eyes with a plaster so that they do not move until they grow out.
Cum ergo nascuntur et aequantur, tunc pone caput infirmi in sinu tuo: deinde signa super Palpebram oculorum eius cum encaustro, signo quod sit secundum figuram folii myrti: et sit principium signi prope pilos.	 When they grow out and are evened, then place the head of the sick person on your lap. Then mark the eyelids of his eyes with wax, mark that it is in the shape of a myrtle leaf; let the beginning of the mark be near the hairs.
Deinde pone cotum imbibitum in albumine oui: aut in mucilagine psilii super oculum.	 Then put a warm dish on cheesecloth or on psyllium gum over the eye.
Deinde igni cauterium, cuius forma est haec.	 Then apply fire to the cautery, whose form is this.
Deinde cauteriza super figuram, quam signasti paulatim in uicibus multis, donec comburatur superficies cutis, quae est sicut figura folii myrti, totam apparentem proprie.	 Then cauterize according to the shape you marked, slowly in several places until the surface of the skin is burned, which is like the shape of a myrtle leaf, entirely appearing properly.
Et signum sanitatis operis tui est: ut si uideas Palpebram oculi iam contrahi, et pilos eleuari apud puncturam oculi.	 And your mark of health is that if you see the eyelid of the eye already contracting and hairs rising at the site of piercing the eye.
Eleua ergo manum tuam tunc: et dimitte ipsum tribus diebus.	 Then lift up your hand then, and let him go for three days.
Deinde pone super ipsum Cotum cum butyro, donec eradicetur eschara.	 Then put a warm dish with butter on him until the scab falls off.
Deinde cura ipsum cum unguento, donec sanetur.	 Then care for him with an ointment until he is healed.
Quod si redeat aliquod ex pilis post horam, et mollificetur palpebra: tunc itera Cauterium super illum locum, sicut fecisti in primis.	 If some of the hairs return after an hour and the eyelid becomes soft: then repeat the cautery on that spot as you did at first.
Si autem pili sunt in inferiori: tunc cauteriza ipsam, donec eleuetur ad locum suum naturalem: et aequetur ut non pungant pili oculum.	 If hairs are in the lower part [of the body]: then cauterize it until it is brought to its natural place; and ensure that the hairs do not prick the eye.

Est ut praecipias infirmo, ut dimittat pilos, donec prolongentur et aequentur.	 You should advise the sick person to let go of his hairs until they grow longer and match.
Fac ex charta de panno formam folii myrti.	 Make from parchment a shape of a myrtle leaf.
Deinde accipe ex sapone cognito, et ex calce non imbibita ex unoquoque pondus uncia I aut quasi illud: deinde tere ea simul contritione bona, et fac illud cum festinatione, ut non infrigidetur.	 Then take from known soap and unabsorbed lime from each a weight of one ounce or approximately that; then grind them together with good grinding, so that it is done quickly, lest it becomes cold.
Deinde ex pande ex eo super chartam quam fecisti sicut formam folii myrti, et pone ipsum super palpebram oculi unius, aut duorum.	 Then from the ointment spread on parchment as a shape of a myrtle leaf, and place it on the eyelid of one or both eyes.
Et pone sub oculo cotum imbibitum in albumine oui: et caput infirmi sit in sinu tuo.	 And place under the eye a heated cotton soaked in egg white, and the head of the sick person should be in your lap.
Et pone digitum tuum indicem super medicinam, et preme ipsum parumper.	 And place your index finger on the medicine and press it slightly.
Et tu moueas ipsum quotiens sentit infirmus mordicationem medicinae: quoniam inuenit eius mordicatio sicut ignis.	 And you move it whenever the sick person feels the bite of the medicine, since its bite is like fire.
Dum ergo perseuerat hoc quod ipse inuenit mordicatio, tunc dimitte medicinam, et moue ipsam cum digito tuo.	 While he continues to feel this bite, then release the medicine and move it with your finger.
Cum ergo quiescit mordicatio, tunc remoue medicinam, et ablue oculum cum aqua.	 When the bite ceases, then remove the medicine, and wash the eye with water.
Et considera tunc, si uides palpebram eleuari, sicut eleuatur apud contractionem cum igne, aut cum incisione, est bene: et si non, tunc itera super ipsam ex medicina super locum, in quo non imprimit medicina, et non denigrat, donec aequetur operatio tua, et contrahatur oculus.	 And then consider if you see the eyelid raised like when it is drawn up by heat or incision, it is good: and if not, then repeat on the same place from the medicine where the medicine does not press and does not discolor, until your operation is equal and the eye contracts.
Deinde pone super ipsum Cotum cum butyro, donec eradicetur cutis adustionis.	 Then place on it a cotton with butter until the burnt skin is removed.
Deinde cura ipsum cum unguento diaphinicon, aut alio, donec sanetur.	 Then care for it with diaphinicon ointment, or another, until it heals.
Et necesse est tibi apud operationem, ut custodias ultima custodia, ne in oculum cadat aliquid ex medicina.	 It is necessary for you during the operation that you keep the final safeguard, lest anything from the medicine fall into the eye.
Quod si mollificatur palpebra post dies, et pugnat ex capillis aliquid in oculo, tunc itera medicinam super illum locum, qui mollificatur ex palpebra proprie, sicut fecisti in primis.	 If the eyelid becomes softened after days and something fights from hairs within the eye, then repeat the medicine upon that place which became soft due to the eyelid, just as you did at first.
Deinde cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	 Then care for it until it heals.
Et haec est forma folii myrti.	 And this is the shape of the myrtle leaf.
Et scias, quod oculi hominum diuersificantur in magnitudine, et paruitate.	 And know that the eyes of men are diversified in size and smallness.
Ergo secundum illud sit consideratio tua: et non occultatur uia rectitudinis illi, cui est studium de hac arte.	 Therefore according to this your consideration should be: and not hidden the way of rightness for him who has devotion for this art.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Fistula lachrymali.	 Chapter on the method of cauterization in the lacrimal fistula.
Caput XIX.	 Chapter XIX.
Quando curas Fistulam, cum eo quod diximus in diuisionibus aegritudinum, et non confert curatio tua: tunc, oportet ut cauterizes ipsam secundum hunc modum.	 When you treat the fistula, if your treatment does not help as we said in the classification of diseases, then it is necessary that you cauterize it according to this method.
Praecipe infirmo, ut ponat caput suum in sinu tuo, et teneat caput eius minister inter manus suas taliter, ut non moueatur, neque agitetur cum capite suo.	 Order the sick man to put his head in your lap, and hold his head by your hands in such a way that it is not moved or shaken with his head.
Deinde pone Cotum infusum in albugine oui, aut in mucilagine psilii super oculum eius: deinde igni Cauterium, cuius forma est haec.	 Then place the cotton soaked in oil or psillium poultice on his eye: then cauterize it with this cautery whose shape is as follows.
Sit concauum, sicut forma cannae pennae uulturis ab extremitate una, cum qua fit Cauterium: et si uis sit penetrans usque ad extremitatem aliam, et si uis sit sursum sic tenta.	 Be hollowed like the form of a goose feather quill from one end, with which the cautery is made: and if you wish it to penetrate up to the other end, and if you wish it to be bent upward in this way.
Verumtamen hoc concauum est melius ad opus tuum.	 Nevertheless, it is better for your use that it is hollowed.
Deinde exprime fistulam, si est aperta, et extrahe ex ea saniem, et exicca ipsam: et si non est aperta, tunc aperi eam, et extrahe pus eius.	 Then squeeze the fistula if it is open and extract pus from it, and excise it: and if it is not open, then open it and extract its pus.
Deinde pone tunc super eam Cauterium, quod fit ignitum ualde.	 Then place upon it the cautery, which is made very hot.
Et tene cum eo manum tuam parumper apud Cauterium ab oculo, ad partem nasi, ut non erret manus tua, aut inquietetur infirmus: et ponas Cauterium in adipe oculi, et corrumpas ipsum.	 Hold your hand near the cautery, at the nose's part, close to the eye, so that your hand does not wander or tremble; and you place the cautery on the eyelid fat, and burn it.
Si ergo peruenis in principio Cauterii tui usque ad os, erit bene.	 If you therefore reach at the beginning of your cautery to the bone, it will be good.
Et si non: tunc itera Cauterium semel, aut bis, si indiges illo: et dimitte illud tribus diebus.	 And if not: then heat the cautery again, once or twice, as needed; and leave it for three days.
Deinde pone Cotum cum butyro, et cura ipsum cum unguento exiccatiuo, donec sanetur.	 Then place the cotton with butter, and care for it with an drying ointment until healed.
Quod si praeterierint ei quadraginta dies, et non sanatur: tunc pone super ipsum medicinam acutam corrosiuam, donec detegatur os: et rade ipsum secundum quod uenit in capitulo suo.	 If it exceeds forty days and is not healed: then place on it a sharp corrosive medicine until the bone appears; and grind it according to what comes in its chapter.
Et est modus alius Cauterii fistulae, quem quidam primi dixerunt.	 And there is another method of cautery for abscesses, which some first ones said.
Intende ad locum fistulae, et finde ipsum: deinde pone in ipsam fissuram camahan subtile, id est, Cannulam subtilem, cuius forma haec est.	 Direct yourself to the place of the abscess, and open it; then place into the same opening a thin camel bone, that is, a fine cannula, whose shape this is.
Et funde in ipsum quantitatem drachmae ex plumbo liquefacto, et tene manum tuam cum Canna retentione bona, et non moueatur infirmus omnino, ut non currat, uel perueniat plumbum liquefactum ad oculum eius.	 And pour into it a weight of drachmae in melted lead, and hold your hand with the cannula's retention good, and not move at all weak, so that it does not run or reach the melted lead to its eye.
Et oportet ut ponas super oculum infirmi cotum infusum in albumine oui, aut in aqua.	 And it is necessary that you place on the eye of the weak a cotton soaked in egg white or water.
Plumbum enim comburit locum fistulae, et sanat ipsam sanatione mirabili.	 For lead burns the abscess place, and heals it wonderfully with its healing.
Quod si sanatur fistula, cum eo quod diximus ex Cauterio, et curatione, est bonum.	 If the abscess heals as we said with cautery and treatment, it is good.
Et si non, tunc necesse est administrare foramen nasi, et reducere fistulam ad cursum nasi, secundum quod ueniet in loco suo sibi proprio.	 If not, then it is necessary to make a hole in the nose and lead the abscess to the nasal passage, according to what comes in its place itself.

When you treat these fissures, as we said in the division of diseases, and the treatment does not help, then prepare a small cautery tool shaped like this.
Et sit concauitas eius secundum subtilitatem cultelli.	 And let its concavity be like that of a scalpel, fine.
Deinde pone ipsum ignitum festinanter in ipsis fissuris, donec perueniat cauterium ad profundum fissurarum.	 Then place it (the cautery) quickly on the fissures until the cauterization reaches the depth of the fissures.

Caput XXI.	 Chapter XXI.
Quando accidit apostema in radice gingiuae, aut in palato, aut in radicibus dentium: deinde facit pus, et rumpitur: postea antiquatur, et currit pus, et fit fistula: deinde curas ipsam, et non confert in ea curatio, tunc oportet ut ignias cauterium secundum quantitatem, quod capiat in fistula.	 If a boil occurs on the root of the gum, or in the palate, or in the roots of the teeth: then it becomes pus and bursts; afterwards it turns into an old abscess, and the pus runs and forms a fistula: then treat it, but if treatment does not help, then it is necessary to cauterize it with fire according to its size, so that it can fill the fistula.
Deinde intromitte ipsum ignitum in foramine fistulae, et tene manum tuam, donec perueniat ferrum ignitum ad profundum eius, et ultimum eius: fac illud semel, aut duabus uicibus.	 Then insert the hot iron into the hole of the fistula and hold your hand until the heated iron reaches its depth and end; do this once or twice.
Deinde cura ipsum post illud, cum eo quod diximus de curatione usquequo curetur.	 Then take care of it after that, as we said about treatment, until it is cured.
Si ergo abscinditur sanies, et sanatur, erit bonum.	 If the pus separates and heals, it will be good.
Et si non, tunc necesse est detegere locum, et auferre os corrupum secundum quod ueniet in capite suo.	 And if not, then it is necessary to expose the place and remove the rotten bone according to what comes into its head.

Caput XXII.	 Chapter XXII.
Quando mollificatur gingiua propter humiditates, et mouentur dentes, et curas eam cum medicinis, et non confert: tunc pone caput infirmi in sinu tuo.	 If the gum becomes soft due to moisture and the teeth move, and treatment with medicine does not help, then place the head of the patient on your lap.
Deinde igni cauterium, cuius forma ueniet post haec, ita ut ponas Cannulam super dentem: et intromitte in ea Cauterium ignitum festinanter: et tene manum tuam parumper, donec sentiat infirmus calorem ignis iam peruenisse ad radicem dentis.	 Then fire-cauterize, and the shape will come after this so that you can place a Cannula on the tooth and insert the heated cautery quickly into it: hold your hand for a short while until the patient feels the heat of the fire has reached the root of the tooth.
Et eleua manum tuam: deinde itera Cauterium aliquotiens, secundum quod uis.	 And move your hand: then repeatedly apply the cautery as often as you wish.
Deinde impleat infirmus os suum aqua salis, et teneat ipsam hora una: et exspuat ipsam.	 The sick person should fill his own mouth with water of salt and hold it for an hour; then he should spit it out.
Dens enim motus firmatur, et gingiua mollificata stringitur, et siccatur humiditas corrupta.	 For the tooth which is moved firms, and the gums, being softened, are closed, and the corruption of moisture dries up.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in dolore Dentium.	 On the method of cauterizing dental pain.
Caput XXIII.	 Chapter XXIII.
Quando dolor dentis est propter frigiditatem, aut in ipso est frigus, aut uermis, et non confert curatio cum medicinis: tunc Cauterium in ipso est secundum duos modos: aut Cauterium cum butyro: aut cauterium cum igne.	 When the pain of a tooth is due to coldness or there is coldness itself, or worms, and cure with medicines does not help: then cautery in it should be done according to two methods: either cautery with butter; or cautery with fire.
Cauterium autem eius cum butyro est, ut accipias butyrum uaccinum, et bullias ipsum in cochleari ferreo, aut in uenera.	 The cautery with butter is that you take warm butter and boil it in an iron kettle or in a cow's horn.
Deinde accipe cotum, et inuolue ipsum super extremitatem tentae.	 Then take the heated cautery and apply it to the tip of the tooth.
Deinde submerge ipsum in butyro bullito: et pone ipsum super dentem dolorosum festinanter, et tene ipsum donec infrigidet: deinde itera ipsum aliquotiens, donec perueniat uirtus ignis ad radicem dentis.	 Then immerse it in the boiling butter and place it quickly on the painful tooth and hold it until it cools; then apply it again several times until the power of the fire reaches the root of the tooth.
Et si uis, submerge lanam, aut cotum in butyro frigido, et pone ipsum super dentem dolentem: et pone super ipsum ferrum ignitum, donec perueniat ignis ad profundum concauitatis dentis.	 And if you wish, immerse wool or the cautery in cold butter and place it on the painful tooth; then place a hot iron on top of it until the heat reaches the depth of the hollow of the tooth.
Cauterizatio autem eius cum igne est, ut intendas ad cannulam aeris, aut cannulam ferri.	 The cautery with fire is to prepare a pipe of brass or iron.
Et sit in corpore eius quiddam grossitudinis, ut non perueniat acuitas ignis ad os infirmi.	 And let there be something bulky in its body so that the sharpness of the fire does not reach the sick bone.
Deinde igni Cauterium, cuius forma ueniet: et pone ipsum super illum dentem: et tene manum tuam, donec infrigidetur Cauterium.	 Then heat the cautery and place it on the tooth; hold your hand until the cautery cools.
Fac illud aliquotiens, nam dolor remouebitur, aut in illo eodem die, aut die alio.	 Do this repeatedly, for pain will be relieved either on the same day or on another day.
Et oportet in impressione illius Cauterii, ut impleat infirmus os suum buyro bono, et teneat ipsum hora una: deinde exspuat ipsum.	 And it is necessary that in the application of that Cautery, the sick person fills his bone with good oil and holds it for an hour; then he should spit it out.
Et haec est forma Cauterii.	 And this is the form of the cautery.
Cauteriza cum quacumque extremitate uis secundum quod est possibile: et haec est forma Cannulae.	 Apply the cautery with any end as possible; and this is the form of the cannula.

When boils are caused by phlegm and cold humors, and do not obey digestion through medicines, and fire digests them quickly; then use a concave cautery with this form.
Habens duas extremitates apertas, ut egrediatur fumus apud Cauterium ab extremitate altera: et pone ipsum ignitum super ipsum apostema semel, et secundo, si indiges illo, donec perueniat ad profundum apostematis.	 Having two open ends, so that the smoke may come out from one end of the cautery; place it on top of the boil once, and a second time if necessary, until it reaches the depth of the boil.
Quod si apostema est paruum: tunc pone Cauterium secundum quantitatem apostematis.	 If the boil is small; then place the cautery according to the size of the boil.
Deinde dimitte ipsum tribus diebus, et pone super ipsum cotum infusum in butyro, donec remoueatur quod combussit ignis.	 Then leave it for three days, and place a hot cloth soaked in oil on top of it until what the fire burned is removed.

Et si uis sit cauterizatio tua punctando cum cauterio, quod nominatur Punctum, cuius forma praecessit in punctatione doloris aurium: et sint puncta ex triginta punctis usque quasi ad alia.	 And if your cauterization is to be done by pricking with a cautery called "Punctum", whose form preceded in the section on the pain of the ears; and let the pricks be thirty or so, up to the other (side).

When the head is dislocated due to reasons of humidity, and it does not return by itself within the hour following its dislocation, when this habit of returning has become established for it, then the dislocation should be reduced first.
Deinde resupinetur infirmus super dorsum suum, aut super latus sanum.	 Then the sick person lies down on his back or on his sound side.
Deinde eleua cutim, quae est in interiori Titillici ad superiora cum digitis manus tuae sinistrae: et si iunctura dislocatur ad interiora.	 Then you press the skin that is on the inner part of the cheekbone towards the top with your left hand fingers, and if there is a joint dislocation towards the inner parts.
Deinde igni Cauterium habens duo uerua.	 Then taking two-pronged cautery in fire.

Et quandoque fit cauterizatio cum cauterio habente tria uerua, quare fit figura cauterizationis tunc sex cauteriorum: et sunt uerua secundum subtilitatem tentae.	 And when the cautery has three prongs, it forms a figure of cauterization with six cauteries, and there are prongs according to the subtlety of the skin being treated.

When cold and excessive moisture occur in the stomach until it is expelled from its state, and they multiply catarrhs on it, and various methods of treatment are not effective, then the sick person should lie down on his back, spread his legs, and extend his hands.
Deinde cauteriza cum tribus cauteriis, cauterio sub cochleari pectoris quantitate digiti unius cum cauterio clauili, et duobus cauteriis inferius a duobus lateribus cauterii unius, donec ueniat figura cauteriorum triangulata.	 Then cauterize with three cauteries: one cautery of the size of a finger-tip for the cochlea of the breast, another cautery like a nail, and two cauteries below, from both sides of one cautery; until the figure of the cauteries becomes triangular.
Et elonga inter utraque ut non coniungantur, quando facient pus.	 And extend between each so that they do not join, when pus forms.
Et sit profunditas cauterii quantitas duarum tertiarum grossitudinis cutis.	 And the depth of the cautery be the size of two finger-widths of skin.

Quando accidit in Epate dolor ex frigiditate et humiditate, aut ex uentositate grossa, donec egrediatur a complexione sua naturali egressione superflua, et curatur infirmus, cum eo quod diximus, et non proficit in illo: tunc oportet ut resupinetur infirmus super ceruicem suam, et signes cum encaustro tria cauteria secundum hanc figuram, et hanc quantitatem eandem super Epar inferius ab hypocundriis, ubi peruenit cubitus hominis: et sit spacium quod est inter omne cauterium secundum grossitudinem digiti: et sit cauterium secundum longitudinem corporis rectum: et non comprimas manum tuam cum cauterio multum.	 When pain occurs in the epigastrium due to coldness and humidity, or due to excessive gas that cannot pass through its natural exit, and the patient is weak, even when treated as we have said, it does not improve: then the patient should lie on his back with his head, and mark three cauteries with wax according to this form, and the same size below the epigastrium, where the elbow of a man reaches: let the space between each cautery be the width of a finger: let the cautery be of the length of the body upright: and do not press your hand tightly with the cautery.
Et sit quantitas eius quod aduritur ex spissitudine cutis, quantitas medietatis eius non additum: et sit infirmus stans super pedes suos.	 And let the thickness of what is to be burned be half its size without addition: and let the patient stand on his feet.
Si autem non est stans, tunc sit iacens, qui iam extendit crura sua, et eleuauit brachia sua.	 If it is not standing, then it should be lying down, which has already extended its legs, and raised its arms.
Haec est forma cauterii.	 This is the form of the cautery.
Et tibi quidem possibile est, ut cauterizes ista cauteria cum cauterio cultellari, quando tecum est subtilitas et prudentia in arte.	 And indeed it is possible for you to perform cauteries with this cautery using a sharp cautery tool when you are skillful and wise in your craft.
Et custodi te, ut non ultime procedas in cauterizatione, et aduratur spissitudo cutis totius, quare aduratur corpus totum, et perueniat ad intestina: quoniam cutis illic est subtilis, scias ergo illud.	 And beware that you do not proceed too far in cauterization so that the entire thickness of the skin is burned, for the entire body is being burned, and it reaches the intestines; because there the skin is delicate, therefore know this.
¶ De modo cauterizandi apostemata Epatis.	 Chapter on the method of cauterizing liver abscesses.

When there is discharge, and you want to know if the abscess is in the liver flesh or its membrane; then if it is in the liver flesh, an indolent pain and heaviness without sharpness occurs; but if it is in the liver membrane, with a painful sharpness. And now you see that the treatment of this has exhausted the doctors.
Oportet ergo ut resupinet infirmus super ceruicem suam.	 The patient must therefore lie down with his head resting.
Deinde figura locum apostematis cum encaustro: deinde ignias cauterium quod assimilatur radio.	 Next, place the lancet in the form of an apostate's position with the encaustic: then heat the cautery resembling a ray.
Et haec est forma eius.	 And this is its form.
Et cauteriza cum eo cauterium unum, donec comburatur cutis tota, et perueniat ad siphac, donec egrediatur sanies tota: deinde cura ipsum curatione exiturarum, donec sanetur.	 And cauterize it with the cautery until the whole skin is burnt and it reaches the siphac until all pus comes out: then care for him with healing of the wounds, until he is healed.
Et non oportet ut hac cauterii specie utatur, nisi cuius studium in arte medicinae prolongatur: et per cuius manus concurrunt aegritudines istae cum experimento aliquotiens: tunc enim audeat super huiusmodi operationem.	 And it is not appropriate to use this cauterizing method, unless one's dedication to the art of medicine continues: and through whose hands these diseases occur with repeated experience: then he may dare on such operations.
At uero dimittere ipsam, apud me est melius.	 But rather, let it be released, is better with me.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Pleuresi.	 Section on Cauterization in Pleurisy.
Caput XXXI.	 Chapter XXXI.
Dixerunt antiqui, cauterium cum radicibus aristolochiae ad Pleuresim frigidam secundum hunc modum.	 Ancients said that cauterization with roots of Aristolochia for cold pleurisy in this way.
Et est, ut recipias ex radicibus aristolochiae siccae longae, radicem unam longiorem, quae ex ea inuenitur, et sit sicut grossitudo digiti.	 And it is to take from the dry roots of Aristolochia a longer root, which is found among them, and let it be as thick as a finger.
Deinde submerge eam in oleo: et accende ipsam in igne.	 Then immerse it in oil and light it on fire.
Deinde cauteriza cauterio uno in eo quod est inter continuationem furculae cum collo, et duobus cauteriis paruis sub guidezi parum decliuibus ad partem, quae est sub barba.	 Then cauterize it with one cautery where there is continuation of the neck with the collarbone, and with two small cauteries near the area that is beneath the chin.
Et duobus cauteriis etiam in eo, quod est inter costam quintam et sextam decliuibus ad posteriora parumper: et cauterio alio in medio pectoris, et alio supra stomachum.	 And with two cauteries also where there is between the fifth and sixth ribs near the back, and with another cautery in the middle of the chest, and another above the stomach.
Et tribus cauteriis a posterioribus: uno in eo quod est inter duas spatulas: et duobus cauteriis a duobus lateribus pectoris, inferius cauterio quod est inter duas spatulas.	 And with three cauteries from the back: one where there is between two scapulas, and with two cauteries on either side of the chest, the lower cautery where it is between two scapulas.
Et non oportet ut comprimas manum tuam cum cauterio, imo sit in manifesto cutis odorando.	 And do not press your hand with a cautery, rather let it be clearly smelling the skin.
Et iam dixerunt quidam antiqui, quod ex hominibus sunt qui utuntur cauterio ex ferro simili radio: et igniunt, et intus mittunt ipsum in eo quod est inter costas, donec perueniatur cum eo ad ipsum apostema, et egrediatur sanies: sicut diximus in apostemate Epatis.	 And some of the ancients have said that there are people who use a cautery made from iron like a ray and burn it inside where it is between the ribs until it reaches the abscess, and the pus comes out: as we said in the case of the abscess of the liver.
Sed in hac perforatione cum cauterio est ex timore, quod aut moritur infirmus statim, aut accidit in loco fistula, cui non est sanatio.	 But in this perforation with a cautery, there is fear because either the sick person dies immediately, or a fistula occurs in the place where there is no healing.
¶ De modo cauterizandi Splenem Caput XXXII.	 Chapter 32: On the method of cauterizing the spleen.
Quando tu curas aegritudinem splenis, cum eo quod diximus ex curatione in diuisione aegritudinum, et non confert curatio tua, tunc cauterium in ea est secundum tres modos, qui omnes sunt recti.	 When you treat the illness of the spleen, as we said in the treatment and division of diseases, and your treatment is not effective, then cautery is applied to it according to three methods, all of which are correct.
Quorum unus est, ut facias tria cauteria, aut quatuor lineando secundum longitudinem splenis secundum figuram cauteriorum Epatis, quorum praecessit figura.	 One is that you make three or four cauteries, lining them up along the length of the spleen in the shape of the cauteries for the liver, whose figure was described earlier.
Et sit inter omne cauterium quantitas grossitudinis digiti, aut plus parum.	 And the thickness between each cautery should be the size of a finger, or more or less.
Et sit modus cauterii, quem diximus in cauterio epatis aequaliter.	 The method of cauterization should be equal, as we have said in the cauterization of the liver.
Et non comprimas manum tuam cum cauterio: et sit infirmus resupinus super dorsum suum.	 And do not press your hand with the cautery: let the weak one lie on his back.
Et modus alius de cauterizatione est: ut ignias cauterium habens duo uerua, quod diximus in capitulo dislocationis humeri: et eleua cutem, quae est in directo splenis, ubi peruenit cubitus infirmi sinister: et sit eleuatio tua qua eleuas cutem secundum latitudinem corporis, ut cadant cauteria secundum longitudinem corporis.	 Another method of cauterization is: having the cautery with two openings, as we have said in the chapter on dislocation of the humerus; and remove the skin, which is directly above the spleen, where the weak one's elbow comes to be; and your removal should be in accordance with the width of the body, so that the cauteries fall according to the length of the body.
Deinde intromitte duo uerua ignita ualde, donec cum eis penetres cutem a parte altera: deinde extrahe cauterium: fiunt ergo cauteria quatuor.	 Then insert two openings with very hot fire until it penetrates the skin on the other side; then remove the cautery; so four cauteries are made.
Et si uis cauteriza cum cauterio alio habente tria uerua.	 And if you want to cauterize with a cautery having three openings.
Deinde cura cauterium postquam dimittis ipsum emittere pus diebus multis: est enim magis conferens quamque reliqua quae praecesserunt ex curatione.	 Then care for the cautery after you release it, to emit pus for many days; for it is more beneficial than the rest that came before in the treatment.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Hydropisi.	 Chapter on the method of cauterizing in hydropsis.
Caput XXXIII.	 Chapter 33.
Cauterium non cadit in Hydropisi, nisi ascliti proprie.	 The cautery does not fall in hydropsis, unless properly placed on the bladder.
Quando tu curas Hydropicum cum modis curationis, quos diximus in diuisione, et non confert curatio, tunc oportet ut cauterizes ipsum quatuor cauteriis in circumitu umbilici, et cauterio uno super stomachum, et cauterio alio super epar, et cauterio super splenem, et cauteriis duobus post dorsum inter spondiles, et uno in directo pectoris, et alio in directo stomachi: et sit quantitas profunditatis cauterii propinqua spissitudini cutis.	 When you treat a hydropsic person with the methods of treatment that we have mentioned in the division, and the treatment does not work, then it is necessary to cauterize it with four cauteries around the umbilicus, one on the stomach, another on the liver, another on the spleen, two behind the spine, and one on the chest and another on the stomach; and the quantity of the depth of the cautery should be close to the thickness of the skin.
Deinde dimitte cauterium apertum, ut emittat pus tempore longo.	 Then release the open cautery, so that it may emit pus for a long time.
Et non euacues infirmum a curatione post cauterium cum eo: quod oportet ut aggregentur ei duae intentiones: et festinabit ad ipsum sanatio cum auxilio Dei.	 And do not evacuate the weak one from treatment after cauterization with it; for two intentions should be applied to him: and healing will hasten to him with the help of God.
Forma uero cauterii cum quo cauterizatur uenter, sit clauilis: secundum quod praecessit forma eius: et illius cum quo cauterizatur dorsum, sit oliuaris secundum quod praecessit eius forma.	 The form of the cautery used to cauterize the abdomen should be a claw-like shape, following its previous form. And the form of the one used to cauterize the back should be olive-shaped, according to its previous form.
¶ De modo cauterizandi Pedes, et Crura.	 On the method of cauterizing Feet and Legs.
Caput XXXIIII.	 Chapter XXXIV.
Quando apostemantur in Hydropico, et replentur aqua citrina: oportet ut cauterizes super dorsum Pedis in nocrati, quae est inter auricularem et anularem: et eleua manum tuam cum cauterio, et non torqueas ipsum: deinde eleua manum tuam: et non iteres ipsum omnino.	 When draining in Hydropsy and filled with citrus water, it is necessary to cauterize on the top of the foot at the shin, which is between the auricle and ankle; then lift your hand with the cautery, and do not twist it; then lift your hand again; and do not go near it completely.
Resudet enim aqua citrina, et sit cauterium secundum hanc formam.	 Citrus water will flow out, and let the cautery be in this shape.
Deinde fac super duo crura duo cauteria in omni crure, et fiat cauterium cum extremitate cultellari cauterii: et fiat cauterium secundum longitudinem cruris, unum sub genu, et alterum inferius eo, circiter medium cruris: et super omnem coxam cauteria duo: et dimitte cauterium apertum absque curatione tempore longo: ut resudet ex eo aliquod aquae: deinde cura ipsum cum reliquis quae diximus.	 Then make two cauteries on both legs, and let the cautery be at the end of a scalpel-shaped cautery; and let the cautery be along the length of the leg, one below the knee, and the other lower by about half the leg's length; and over the entire hip place two cauteries; leave the open cautery without long treatment, so that some water flows out of it; then treat it with what we have said.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in solutione Ventris.	 On the method of cauterizing in the dissolution of the Abdomen.
Caput XXXV.	 Chapter XXXV.
Quando est solutio uentris ex frigore et humiditatibus, donec debilitet uirtutes retentiuam et digestiuam, quae sunt in stomacho et intestinis: et curatur illud cum modis curationis, et non sanatur: et uides infirmum tolerantem cauterium exuberantis uirtutis, tunc cauteriza ipsum cauterio magno super stomachum suum, secundum quod praecessit in cauterizatione stomachi cum cauterio circuli, et quatuor cauteriis in circumitu umbilici subtilibus, cum cauterio clauili subtili: et cauterio super alcatin supra alhosos magno, aut duobus cauteriis.	 When the solution of the stomach is softened by cold and humidity, until its retentive and digestive powers are weakened which are in the stomach and intestines: and it is cured with methods of treatment, but it does not heal: then one cauterizes it with a large cautionery on the stomach itself, according to what was described before in the cauterization of the stomach with a circular cautionery, and four subtle cauteries around the navel, with a subtle cautery claw: and with a subtle cautionery on top of alum over aloes, or with two cauteries.
Et si uides humiditates exuberantes, et infirmum tolerantem illud, tunc cauteriza ipsum cauterio super pectinem, et cauterio super omne ilium: et fortasse addes duo cauteria parua super stomachum prope magnum.	 If you see humidities in excess and the patient enduring it, then cauterize it with a cautionery on the sternum and a cautionery over the whole ilium: perhaps you may also add two small cauteries near the stomach.
Est enim curatio proficiens, cuius iuuamentum non errat.	 For indeed, the cure is progressing, and its help does not deceive.
¶ De modo cauterizandi Hemorroidas.	 Chapter on the method of cauterizing Hemorrhoids.
Caput XXXVI.	 Chapter XXXVI.
Quando in ano sunt Hemorroides antiquae multae, aut una, et sunt ex humoribus grossis, frigidis, aut humiditatibus corruptis, et curantur cum eo, quod diximus in diuisione, et non confert curatio: tunc cauteriza tribus cauteriis super inferiorem spondilem dorsi sub almeidati parumper triangulatim, et cauterio sub umbilico quasi duobus digitis.	 When in the anus there are many old hemorrhoids, or one, and they are of gross humors, cold, or corrupted by humidity, and are cured with what was said in the division, but the cure does not help: then cauterize them with three cauteries on the lower part of the lumbar vertebra under the almeidate triangle a little, and with a cautionery under the navel as if with two fingers.
Et si cogitas, quod stomachus eius infrigidatus sit, et cibus eius non digeratur, et faciem eius uides apostemari, tunc cauteriza eum super stomachum cauterio magno, secundum quod praecessit: et cauterio super Epar eius, et alio super Splenem ipsius, cum cauterio clauili: et dimitte cauterium apertum tempore aliquo: deinde cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	 And if you think that the stomach of this one is chilled and its food is not digested, and you see his face pallid, then cauterize it on the stomach with a large cautionery, according to what was described before: and with a cautionery over the liver of the same, and another over the spleen of the same, with a cautery claw: and let the open cautionery rest for some time: then care for him until he is healed.
¶ De modo cauterizandi althelul post abscisionem eorum.	 Method of cauterizing althelul after their excision.
Caput XXXVII.	 Head Chapter 37.
Quando tu abscindis althelul, tunc ignias cauterium quod assimilatur radio.	 When you excise althelul, then ignite the cautery that resembles a rod.
Deinde intromittite ipsum ignitum in ipsum althelul abscisum: et ultima manum tuam, donec perueniat cauterium ad orificium uenae, ex qua currit sanguis: fac illud semel, aut bis.	 Then introduce the burning cautery into the excised althelul and bring your last hand to it, until the cautery reaches the opening of the vein from which blood flows. Do this once or twice.
Si ergo althelul fuerint multa, tunc cauteriza unumquodque cauterio secundum quod narrauimus.	 If there are many althelul, then cauterize each one with a separate cautery as we have described.
Deinde cura ea, cum eo quod confert eis ex unguentis, donec sanentur.	 Then care for them with that which you apply to them from the ointments until they heal up.
Et si cauterizas eum cauterio magno super alcatin, est magis ultimum in iuuamento.	 And if you cauterize it with a large cautery upon an alcatin, it is more final in its benefit.
¶ De modo cauterizandi Fistulam in ano.	 Method of Cauterizing a Fistula in the Anus.
Caput XXXVIII.	 Head Chapter 38.
Quando non obedit infirmus sectioni et operi quod narrauimus in loco suo, et terretur ab illo, fortasse sanatur cum cauterio.	 When the sick person does not obey the incision and operation as we have described in its place, and he is afraid of it, perhaps he will heal with cauterization.
Cum ergo accidit alicui Fistula, et antiquatur, currit pus ex ea, et humiditates corruptae.	 When there occurs any fistula, and it breaks, pus flows from it, and the humors are corrupted.
Dignius ergo quod oportet est, ut probes eam cum tenta subtili.	 Therefore, it is necessary to test it with a thin probe.
Deinde cognosce quantitatem profunditatis eius cum tenta.	 Then recognize the depth of it with a probe.
Deinde ignias cauterium, quod est simile radio.	 Then heat the cautery that is like a rod.
Deinde intromit te ipsum ignitum in ipsam Fistulam et quantitatem in qua intrauit clauus.	 Then insert yourself (into the fistula) heated, and the depth where the probe has entered.
Et itera super eam cauterium, donec comburantur illa omnia corpora corrupta, semel, aut bis, aut ter, secundum quantitatem necessitatis tuae.	 And repeatedly heat the cautery over it until all the corrupted bodies are burned, once or twice or three times, according to the necessity of your case.
Et custodi te ab adustione nerui, si est illic, aut uenae magnae: aut si Fistula uadit ad corpus uesicae, aut ad corpus intestini, tunc custodi te ab istis locis omnibus.	 And beware of burning the nerve or large vein if there is one nearby; or if the fistula flows toward the bladder or intestine, then beware of these places altogether.
Et non facias illud, nisi quando fistula est in loco carnoso: et cogitas, quia non est penetrans.	 And do not perform it unless the fistula is in a fleshy place; and remember that it does not penetrate.
Deinde cura locum usquequo sanetur.	 Then take care of the place until it heals.
Si autem sigillatur locus, et abscinduntur ab eo materiae, et remanet sic tempore longo: tunc scias, quia iam sanatus est integre.	 If however the place is sealed and the matter is cut away from it, and remains in that state for a long time; then you will know that it is healed completely.
Et si non abscindunt ab eo materiae, tunc scias quia est penetrans, aut in profundo eius est os corruptum, aut quasi illud ex illis: quorum rememoratio ueniet in loco suo.	 If however the matter is not cut away from it, then you will know that it penetrates, or that its deep part has become corrupted, or something like that, which will remind itself at its place.
¶ De modo cauterizandi Renes.	 [Chapter on cauterizing kidneys]
Caput XXXIX.	 Chapter XXXIX.
Quando accidit in Renibus dolor ex frigore, aut ex uentositate grossa, et minuitur propter illud coius infirmi, tunc oportet ut cauterizes ipsum super almethenem super ipsos renes, cauterio super omnem renem cum cauterio clauili, cuius praecessit rememoratio.	 When pain occurs in the kidneys from cold or from thick wind, and it decreases due to the weakness of the body, then it is necessary that you cauterize it over alum on top of the kidneys, with a cautery over all the kidney with cautery claw, whose preceded remembrance.
Et fortasse cauterizamus ipsum secundo in ipso almeidatu.	 And perhaps we cauterize it for the second time in the same alum.
Quare uenient tria lineata.	 Because three lines will come.
Ergo erunt magis ultima in iuuamento.	 Therefore, there will be more benefit in the liniment.
¶ De modo cauteritzandi Vesicam.	 § On the method of cauterizing the bladder.
Caput XL.	 Chapter XL.
Quando accidunt in Vesica debilitas, et mollificatio a frigo re et humiditatibus, donec non retineat infirmus urinam, tunc cauteriza ipsum in inferiori parte suminis super Vesicam, ubi incipiunt pili pectinis, et cauterio a dextra suminis, et alio a sinistra illius: et sit longitudo illius cauterizationis lateris secundum quantitatem nodi pollicis: et cauteriza ipsum cauterio inferiori dorsi, aut duobus cauteriis, si indiges illo: et sit secundum quod praecessit cauterium clauile.	 When weakness occurs in the bladder and it becomes soft due to cold and humidity until the sick person cannot retain urine, then cauterize it at the lower part of the anus on the bladder where the hair of the beard begins, and with a cautery from the right anus, and another from the left of it: and let the length of the cauterization on the side be according to the size of a knuckle: and cauterize it with a lower back cautery, or two cauteries, if necessary: and let it follow the preceding cautery claw.
¶ De modo cauterizandi Matricem.	 § On the method of cauterizing the womb.
Caput XLI.	 Chapter XLI.
Quando accidunt in Matrice frigus et humiditates, et prohibetur per illud ab impregnatione, et corrumpuntur menstrua eius, et tardatur prouocatio eorum, et accidit ei apud aduentum eorum dolor, tunc oportet ut cauterizetur tribus cauteriis in circumitu umbilici, sicut diximus in cauterizatione uesicae, et cauterio super alcatim inferius dorso, aut duobus cauteriis: et sit cauterium clauile.	 When coldness and dampness occur in the matrix (womb) and it is forbidden by that from conception, and its menstrua are corrupted, and their provocation is delayed, and pain occurs at their approach, then it is necessary to be cauterized with three cauteries around the umbilicus, as we said in the cauterization of the bladder, and a cautery on top below the back, or with two cauteries: and let the cautery be claw-shaped.
¶ De modo cauterizandi Ancham in dislocatione.	 On the method of cauterizing the anus in dislocation.
Caput XLII.	 Chapter XLII.
Quando effunduntur humiditates mucosae ad pixidem Anchae, et fiunt caussa exitus eius a loco suo: et signum illius est, quod prolongatur crus super alterum, quando comparantur adinuicem: et inuenitur locus dislocationis in eo uacuus.	 When the humidities of the mucosa flow out to the perianal area, and become the cause of its exit from its place; and a sign of this is that the leg is stretched over the other when they are compared with each other; and a place of dislocation is found empty in it.
Oportet ergo ut cauterizes infirmum super pixidem Anchae ipsius cauterio simili circulo: postquam tu signas cum encaustro in circumitu pixidis, sicut reuoluitur: et ut cadat ipsa pixis in medio circuli.	 Therefore it is necessary to be cauterized weakly over the perianal area with a similar cautery circle; after you have marked it with the encaustic (beeswax) around the perianal area, as it is described; and so that the perianus falls in the middle of the circle.
Et sit cauterium cuius forma praecessit in cauterizatione stomachi.	 And let the cautery be of the same form as that which preceded in the cauterization of the stomach.
Quod si tibi non est praesens hoc cauterium, tunc cauteriza ipsum tribus cauteriis, cum cauterio oliuari magno: et fiat cauterio profunditas secundum quantitatem spissitudinis cutis totius.	 If this cautery is not present to you, then be cauterized with three cauteries, with a large oil-soaked (oiled) cautery; and let the depth of the cautery be according to the thickness of the skin in total.
Deinde cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	 Then take care of it until it is healed.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Sciatica.	 On the method of cauterizing in Sciatica.
Caput XLIII.	 Chapter XLIII.
Quando accidit dolor in pixide anchae, et sunt caussa illius frigus et humiditates: et curatur infirmus cum eo, quod diximus in diuisione, et non confert curatio, et antiquatur illud: tunc oportet ut soluas infirmum ab humoribus grossis cum pillulis foetidis, aut cum pillulis artificialibus, et similibus.	 When there is pain in an ulcer of the anus and its cause is coldness and moisture: it should be treated as mentioned in the division, but the treatment does not help, then that should be aged: then it is necessary to dissolve the sick person from thick fluids with stinking pills or with artificial pills or similar ones.
Deinde cauteriza eum.	 Then cauterize him.
Et modus cauterii in ea est secundum duos modos: aut cauterium cum medicinis adurentibus, aut cauterium cum igne.	 And the method of cauterization is according to two methods: either cauterization with medicines advancing or cauterization with fire.
Cauterium cum igne, est secundum multos modos.	 Cauterization with fire, is according to many modes.
Quorum unus est, ut cauterizes super pixidem anchae ipsius tribus cauteriis triangulatis, secundum hanc formam.	 One of them is that you cauterize on the ulcer of the anus itself with three triangular cauteries in this way.
Et fac eis profunditatem bonam, uel malam.	 And make a good or bad depth for them.
Et sit spacium quod est inter omne cauterium quantitatis grossitudinis digiti: sitque cauterium oliuare.	 And let the space be between each cautery of the thickness of a finger, and let the cautery be oiled.
Quandoque autem fit cauterium in medio super caput anchae ipsius.	 Sometimes it is done that the cautery takes place in the middle on the head of the anus itself.
Quare sunt quatuor cauteria.	 Why are there four cauteries?
Et si uis cauteriza cum circulo, cuius praecessit forma in cauterizatione dislocationis anchae, uno: ut sit circulus continens ancham totam.	 And if you want to cauterize with a circle whose form preceded the cauterization of the displacement of the anus, one: so that the circle contains the entire anus.
Et combure spissitudinem cutis totius.	 And burn the thickness of the skin all over.
Iste est modus cauterii in Sciatica, quando dolor est adhaerens anchae ipsi, et non extenditur usque ad coxam et crus.	 This is the method of cauterization for Sciatica, when the pain is attached to the anus itself, and it does not extend to the hip and leg.
Si autem extenditur usque ad coxam et crus, tunc cauteriza ipsum duobus cauteriis super coxam, super locum ad quem innuit illic infirmus, in quo est dolor, et cauterio tuo super cauillam quatuor digitis ad partem syluestrem parumper: et sit cauterium cultellare.	 If it extends to the hip and leg, then cauterize it with two cauteries on the hip, at the place where the sick person indicates, where there is pain, and your cautery four fingers on the forest part a little: let the cautery be sharp.
Et sit profunditas cauterii secundum profunditatem spissitudinis cutis.	 And the depth of the cautery should be according to the thickness of the skin.
Quod si infirmus innuit quod dolor extenditur usque prope digitos pedis, tunc cauteriza ipsum illic ubi innuit cum cauterio puncti, tribus, aut quatuor, aut pluribus, si indiget illo.	 If the sick person indicates that the pain extends near the toes of the foot, then cauterize it there where he indicates, with a cautery of points, three, or four, or more, if necessary.
Et si innuit dolorem esse sub genu uersus crus, tunc cauteriza ipsum illic cauterio uno cultellari.	 If he indicates that the pain is turned towards the shin of the leg, then cauterize it there with a knife-like cautery.
Et caue tibi in omni cauterizatione tua, ut non ultimes cum cauterio ad hoc ut comburas neruum, aut arteriam magnam, et attrahas per illud super infirmum nocumentum malum, aut contractionem.	 And be careful in all your cauterizations that you do not burn a nerve or the great artery with it, and draw harm upon the sick person by that, or cause shrinkage (contraction).
Et ego quidem iam uidi unum et alium, ex eis qui cauterizauerunt supra cauillam, et ultimauerunt in cauterizatione, et inflatum est crus, donec tumor consecutus est pedem, et perforatus est totus, et corruptus est totus pes: deinde accidit solutio uentris, et mors post illud.	 And I myself have seen one and another of those who cauterized above the heel, and burned in the cauterization, and the leg became swollen until it reached the foot, and it was completely perforated, and the whole foot was corrupted: then follows the opening of the stomach, and death after that.
Quod si dolor est in duabus partibus simul, cauteriza utramque secundum hunc modum.	 If the pain is in two parts at once, cauterize each one according to this method.
Et sapientes quidam dixerunt in cauterizatione anchae, cuius cauterii iste est modus.	 And some wise men have said in cauterizing the anus, that this method of cautery is appropriate for it.
Fac simile samio ex ferro, cuius diametrus sit medietas palmi: et sit apud orificium suum secundum grossitudinem nuclei dactyli, aut minus parumper: et intra illud samium sit samium tertium.	 Make a similar probe of iron, whose diameter is half the breadth of the palm: and let it be at its opening according to its size, that of the nucleus of the thumb or less: and within this probe there should be a third probe.
Et sit spacium quod est inter omne samium per quantitatem nodi pollicis: et sint samia aperta a duabus partibus: et sit altitudo eorum quasi nodus, aut duo nodi: et fac eis manubrium ex ferro decenter aptatum in samiis.	 And let the distance between all probes be the size of a knuckle: and let the probes be open at two ends: and their height should be like that of a knuckle, or two knuckles: and make handles of iron suitably placed on the probes.
Et haec est forma eius.	 And this is its form.
Deinde igniatur in igne, donec rubeat, et proiiciat scintillas: deinde ponatur super pixidem anchae infirmo accubitato super latus sanum.	 Then it is heated in the fire until it turns red and sparks fly: then it should be placed on a basin for the anus of the sick person lying on his healthy side.
Cauteriza ergo eum tribus cauteriis rotundis in uice una.	 Cauterize it therefore with three round cauteries at one time.
Deinde dimitte ipsum tribus diebus.	 Then let him be for three days.
Postea emplastra cum butyro: et dimitte uulnus apertum diebus multis.	 Afterward, pack it with butter: and let the open wound be for many days.
Deinde cura ipsum cum unguento, donec sanetur.	 Then care for him with ointment, until he is healed.
Inquit Albucasis, hac specie cauterii o filii, parum usi sumus, propter terrorem aspectus eius: et propterea, quod paucos inuenimus qui expectent super ipsum.	 Says Albucasis, in this manner of cauterizing, we are not used to it much, due to the frightening appearance of it: and therefore, few are found who will wait on it.
Verumtamen est ex bonis cauteriis ei qui suffert, et inuenit cum eo locum eius.	 Nevertheless, it is good for him who endures it, and finds a place for it.
Cauterium autem cum medicinis adurentibus est, ut tu facias duo samia habentia perforatam armillam, in quam descendit cardo portae eius ex aere, aut ferro, longitudo parietis: quorum in altitudinem eorum sint duo nodi, aut quasi ipsi.	 The cautery with medicines for the ailment is that you should make two openings on each side of the perforated armillary sphere, through which goes the key of its door from bronze or iron, the length of the wall: whose height in them shall be two knots, or almost themselves.
Et sit spacium quod est inter utraque quantitas grossitudinis digiti, et sint aperta inferius et superius: et sit quod contineant se adinuicem, secundum hanc formam.	 And let the space that is between both be of the thickness of a finger's joint, and let it be open below and above: and let them contain each other according to this shape.
Deinde depone eam super pixidem anchae, infirmo iacente super latus sanum.	 Then place it on an ointment box, with the weak one lying on the healthy side.
Et comprime manum tuam super pixidem anchae multum.	 And press your hand strongly upon the ointment box.
Deinde funde inter duos circulos ex aqua calida, quae sit calefacta cum igne parumper, et tene eam quantitate horae temporalis: et toleret infirmus mordicationem eius, et ipsius adustionem, nam ipse inuenit mordicationem sicut ignis, donec quiescat mordicatio.	 Then pour water between two circles which has been slightly heated by fire and hold it for the amount of an hour: and let the weak one bear the biting of it, and his burning, for he finds the biting as if by fire, until the biting stops.
Deinde eleua manum tuam cum instrumento, et absterge aquam calidam ab ancha tota cum aqua dulci: deinde dimitte illud tribus diebus.	 Then clean your hand with the tool and remove hot water from the ointment box along with sweet water: then let it be for three days.
Et pone super illud butyrum, donec remoueatur nigredo adustionis: et dimitte illud diebus aliquot, et curret ex eo pus.	 And place butter on it until the soot of burning is removed: and let it be for some days, and pus will flow from it.
Est enim ultimum in iuuamento.	 It is indeed the last aid.
Deinde cura illud cum unguentis, donec sanetur.	 Then treat it with ointments until it heals.
Quod si extendatur dolor usque ad coxam, aut crus: fac ei statuam in eo quod continet aquam, secundum quod fecisti in ancha aequaliter.	 If the pain extends to the hip or leg, make a splint for him in such a way as you made the splint for an ankle equally.
Et iste est modus aquae calidae: et ego iam scripsi eam in tractatu rectificationis medicinarum.	 This is the method of hot water: and I have already written it in the treatise on the correction of drugs.
Sume alcali, et calcis non extinctae amborum ana partem unam: tere utraque, et pone ea in ollam nouam, cuius inferior pars sit perforata foramine uno paruo, secundum quantitatem quod ingrediatur ipsum radius: et pone sub fundo ollae ollam aliam uitreatam: et proiice super alcali et calcem ex aqua dulci, quod submergat utraque per digitum: post quam tu comprimas ea manu tua compressione bona: et dimite ollam, donec descendat aqua acuta inferiori parte ollae uitreatae.	 Take alkali and half of unburnt lime: grind both of them well, and put them in a new pot, whose lower part is perforated with a small hole according to the quantity that enters the radius: and place another earthen pot below it: and pour over alkali and lime from sweet water, so that they are submerged by about a finger: after which you press them with your hand: and leave the pot until the water becomes sharp at the lower part of the earthen pot.
Deinde aggrega illam aquam totam, et proiice eam super aliam calcem: et cola, donec renouetur.	 Then gather up all that water and pour it over another lime: and boil until it returns.
Ipsa enim erit tunc fortis acuitatis ualde, quae administratur in multis operationibus medicinae, et in cauterizatione reliquorum membrorum.	 For indeed it will then be very strong for sharpness, which is administered in many operations of medicine, and in the cauterization of other members.
Quoniam efficit operationem ignis ipsius.	 Since it performs the operation of fire itself.
Et ex medicinis sunt, cum quibus cauterizantur ancha, etiam sicut tesisie, et mel anacardi, et calx cum sapone, ita quod utraque sint permixta. ¶	 And among the medicines are those with which the anal fissures, and also tes-sie, and honey of cardamom, and lime with soap, so that both are mixed. [Section break]
Et Galenus quidem narrando retulit, cuiusdam uiri ex antiquis curationem, qua curatus est dolor anchae et uenae sciaticae: et magnificauit esse eius ualde.	 And Galen himself reported the cure of a certain man from the ancients, who was cured of pain in the anal fissure and sciatic vein: and he praised it very highly.
Et dixit, quia non indiguit alia curatione, et quia sanatus est ex uice una, donec retulit, quia ipse fortasse intrauit balneum delatus, et exiuit ex eo iam sanus.	 And he said that it does not require another cure, and that he was cured from the disease in one bath, until he reported that perhaps he himself was bathed and came out already healed.
Et est, ut accipiatur ex seitaragi uiridi: et si non inuenitur uiride, sumatur siccum, recens: et teratur multum cum aliquanto adipe, et ponatur super ancham, ubi est dolor, aut crus, aut in coxa: et ligetur, et dimittatur quantitate trium horarum, aut per quantitatem quod sentiat infirmus sedationem adustionis.	 And it is to be taken from green senna: and if not found, dry one may be used, recently prepared: and grind a lot with some fat, and place it on the anal fissure, or thigh, or hip: and bind it, and leave for three hours, or until he feels weak sensation of burning.
Deinde intromitte eum in balneum.	 Then introduce him into the bath (or basin).
Cum ergo roridum fit corpus eius, intromitte ipsum in solium.	 When his body becomes hot, introduce him into the bed.
Nam dolor recedit, et sanatur.	 For pain retreats, and it heals (or gets cured).
Et scias, quia non oportet ut utatur aliquis cauterio cum istis medicinis, nisi post euacuationem corporis.	 And know that no one should use cautery with these medications unless after evacuation of the body.
Et Dioscorides qui dem dixit, quod stercus caprarum, quando cum eo cauterizatur uena sciatica, confert ei: et fit cauterium secundum hunc modum.	 And Dioscorides said that the feces of a goat, when it is cauterized upon the sciatic vein, gives it: and it becomes cautery according to this method.
Sumatur lana, et imbibatur oleo antiquo, et ponatur super locum profundum, qui est inter pollicem pedis, et inter focile, et est propinquior focili.	 Wool is taken, and it is soaked in old oil, and it should be placed over a deep place which is between the big toe of the foot and the heel, and is closer to the heel.
Deinde accipe stercus caprarum siccum, et inflamma ipsum in igne, donec fiat carbo.	 Then take dry feces of a goat, and burn it in fire until it becomes charcoal.
Deinde pone ipsum super lanam, et dimitte ipsum, donec extinguatur.	 Then place it upon the wool, and let it be until it is extinguished (or quenched).
Deinde itera illud.	 And then repeat this (procedure) again.
Non cesses ergo facere illud, usquequo perueniat sensus super mediatione usque ad ancham, et quiescat dolor.	 Do not stop doing that until the sensation arrives over the middle (point), up to the ankle, and the pain rests.
Et iste modus cauterii nominatur cauterium Vaccinum.	 And this method of cautery is named cautery "Vaccinum".
¶ De cauterizatione doloris Dorsi.	 Chapter on Cauterizing Pain in the Back.
Caput XLIIII.	 Chapter XLIII (forty-third chapter).
Quandoque accidit dolor in Dorso ex caussis multis, aut a casu, aut a percussione, aut euacuatione superflua, et illis similibus, ex infusione materiei frigidae, et humidae: et cauterium quidem non cadit, nisi in hac specie sola, quae fit ex infusione materiei frigidae.	 When pain occurs in the back due to many causes, either from a fall, or blow, or excessive evacuation, and similar things, from the influx of cold and moist matter: and cauterization indeed does not apply unless in this single manner, which is made by the influx of cold and moist matter.
Oportet ergo post euacuationem infirmi cum pillulis foetidis, et eis similibus, ut fiant super Dorsum, ubi est dolor, tres lineae secundum latitudinem almeidati ipsius, postquam signas cum encaustro in omni linea quinque cauteria, aut plura secundum quantitatem quae uenit ex tolerantia infirmi uirtute eius: et fiat cauterizatio cum cauteriopuncti.	 Therefore, after the evacuation of a sick person with foul pills and similar things, they should be placed on the back where there is pain, three lines according to the width of the palm, after signing them with encaustic in each line five times, or more according to the quantity that comes from the strength of the patient: and cauterization shall be made with cauteriopuncti (cauterizing punctures).
Et si uis, cauteriza tribus cauteriis, aut quatuor, cum cauterio clauili mediali, secundum hanc formam.	 And if you wish, cauterize with three or four cauteries, along with a middle claw cautery, in this manner.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in incaeptine Gibbositatis.	 On the method of cauterizing in the beginning of a Hump.
Caput XLV.	 Chapter Forty-Five.
Multotiens accidit haec aegritudo infantibus paruis.	 This disease frequently occurs among small children.
Et signum incaeptionis eius in pueris est: quod accidit super eum strictura in anhelitu apud eleuationem, et motum: et inuenis in ultima spondilium Dorsi et nodorum eius, quod iam incaepit eminere super reliquos spondiles.	 And the sign of its beginning in children is that it happens on top of a stridor in breathing during elevation and movement; and you find at the end of the backbone and its knots, which has already begun to emerge above the other vertebrae.
Cum ergo uides illud, et uis facere illud, tunc cauteriza ipsum cum cauterio quod sit circulus secundum hanc formam.	 When you see that and wish to do it, then cauterize it with a circular cautery in this manner.
Et capiat cauterium super omnem partem spondilis aequaliter: et si uis cauteriza in circumitu spondilis cum cauterio puncti duas lineas, aut tres: et sint puncta propinqua adinuicem.	 And the cautery should envelop all parts of the vertebrae equally; and if you wish to cauterize around the vertebrae with a pointed cautery, take two or three lines; let the points be close to each other.
Deinde cura locum, donec sanetur cum eo quod diximus.	 Then take care of the place until it heals as previously described.
Et caue, ne administres cauterium in gibbositate, quae fit in spasmo nerui.	 And be careful not to administer cautery in a hump that occurs due to a muscle spasm.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Podagra, et doloribus iuncturarum.	 Chapter on the method of cauterizing in Gout and joint pains.
Caput XLVI.	 Chapter Forty-Six.
Quando dolores iuncturarum sunt ab humiditatibus frigidis, quae effunduntur ad cuiuslibet membra corporis, tunc quando accidunt dolores in pedibus, de consuetudine medicorum est, ut nominent illud Podagram proprie.	 When joint pains occur from cold humors that are discharged to any part of the body, then when pains occur in the feet, it is customary among physicians to call it gout properly.
Cum ergo curatur Podagra frigidae caussae cum modis curationis, et non remouentur dolores, tune cauterium remouet eos.	 When cold gout is being treated with the methods of treatment and the pain does not subside, then cautery can remove them.
Et est, ut cauterizes eum post euacuationem in circumitu iuncturae pedum, cauteriis multis: et sit cauterium Oliuare.	 And it is to be cauterized after evacuation around the joint of the foot, with many cauteries; and the cautery should be an Olive one.
Cuius haec est forma.	 This is its form.
Et si indiges ut punctes super faciem pedis, tunc fac cum cauterio puncti.	If it is necessary to make punctures on the face of the foot, then do so with a cautery.
Quod si ascendunt dolores usque ad genua, aut reliquas iuncturas, et multotiens accidit illud, tunc cauteriza ipsum super omne genu tribus cauteriis, aut quatuor ab omni parte, cum hoc eodem cauterio Clauili.	 If the pains ascend to the knees or other joints, and this often happens, then cauterize it on all the knee with three or four cauteries from every side, using the same cautery of Clavius.
Si autem necessaria sunt tibi plura hoc cauterio, tunc cauteriza ipsum.	 If more than one cautery is necessary for you, then cauterize it.
Et non submergas manum tuam cum cauterio, imo sit circiter spissitudinem cutis tantum.	 Do not immerse your hand with the cautery, rather let it be about the thickness of the skin.
Si autem ascendunt dolores ad genua, et dorsum: tunc administra quod diximus ex cauterio in capitulo suo.	 If pains ascend to the knees and back: then administer what we have said in its own chapter.
Quod si dolores sunt in manibus tantum, tunc puncta in circumitu focilium, sicut reuoluuntur duae lineae.	 If there are pains only in the hands, then puncture around the hinges of the fingers, just like two lines are rolled up.
Si autem remanet ex doloribus in digitis, tunc puncta eos, super omnem nodum punctum, et super pectinem manus.	 If there remain pains in the fingers, then puncture them on every knot and on the back of the hand.
Si autem ascendunt dolores post dies ad cubitos, aut ad humeros, tunc cauteriza utrosque ab omni parte.	 If the pain ascends after days to the elbows or shoulders, then cauterize them from every side.
Et non euacues infirmum ex regimine bono, ex recaeptione medicinarum.	 Do not evacuate a sick person from good care, from receiving medications.
Nam si bonum fiat regimen, et euacuetur phlegma, sanabitur auxilio Dei cum isto cauterio.	 For if the regimen becomes good and phlegm is evacuated, it will be cured with the help of God using this cautery.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Rupturis.	 Chapter on Cauterizing in Ruptures.
Caput XLVII.	 Chapter XLVII.
Quando accidit Ruptura in inguinibus, et descendit intestinum, aut zirbum ad testiculum, et est illud incipiens propinquum: tunc oportet ut praecipias infirmo dimittere comestionem in die suo.	 When a rupture occurs in the groins and the intestine or bladder descends to the testicle, which is beginning: then it is necessary to order the sick man to fast on his own day.
Et utatur ex lenientibus, quo descendat stercus a uentre suo.	 And he should use lenients so that the feces will descend from his own bowels.
Deinde sedeat inter manus tuas super dorsum suum: et praecipe ei, ut teneat anhelitum suum, donec egrediatur, uel appareat zirbum, aut intestinum.	 Then let him sit on your hands upon his back; and command him to hold his breath until it comes out, or a hernia or intestine appears.
Deinde reduc ipsum digitis tuis, et signa cum encaustro sub Ruptura super os pectinis, cum signo cuius extremitas sit similis medietati circuli ad superiora corporis.	 Then reduce him with your fingers and mark the place of rupture on his neck, with the sign whose end is like half a circle above the body.
Deinde igni cauterium, cuius haec est forma, donec ueniat album, et proiiciat seintillas.	 Then apply the cautery of this shape until it turns white and let it drop seeds.
Deinde reduc intestinum, aut zirbum ad concauitatem suam.	 Then reduce the intestine or hernia into its hollow place.
Deinde ponat minister manum suam super locum, ut non exeat intestinum: et tu iam aperuisti inter crura infirmi, et posuisti sub eo puluinar, et seruiens alius super crura eius, et alius super pectus eius qui tenet manus.	 Then let the servant place his hand on the place so that the intestine does not come out; and you have already opened between the legs of the weak one, and placed a weight there, and another servant is over his legs, and another over his chest who holds his hands.
Deinde depone cauterium super ipsum signum, manu tua cum cauterio stante recta.	 Then place the cautery on the mark with your hand holding the cautery straight.
Et tene ipsum, donec cum eo consequaris os: aut itera cum eo uice alia, si non consecutus fueris cum eo in prima usque ad os.	 And hold him until you come to the bone with it; or repeat with another tool if you have not reached the bone with it the first time.
Et prudenter obserua ab exitu intestini in hora cauterizationis tuae, ne comburas ipsum, et eueniat per illud super infirmum aut mors, aut malicia magna.	 And be careful when the exit of the intestine occurs during your cauterization lest you burn him and it happens over the weak one or death or great harm.
Et scias, quod quando tu non consequeris cum cauterio os, non confert operatio tua.	 And know that when you do not reach the bone with the cautery, your operation does not succeed.
Et oportet ut sit cauterium infantium subtile, secundum mensuram eorum.	 And it is necessary that the cautery for children be delicate, according to their measure.
Deinde cura cum reliquis unguentis, donec sanetur.	 Then care for him with the rest of the ointments until he is healed.
Et sit infirmus iacens super dorsum suum quadraginta diebus, donec sigilletur uulnus.	 And let the weak one lie on his back for forty days until the wound is healed.
Et oportet, ut ponas nutrimentum eius longitudine temporis curationis eius, quod leniat uentrem eius: ut non exeat intestinum apud conamen et egestionem.	 And it is necessary that you give him nourishment of the duration of his treatment to soften his stomach so that the intestine does not come out during effort and evacuation.
Deinde quando uult surgere post quadraginta dies, tunc administra ligamentum decenter factum, et teneat ipsum quadraginta diebus aliis.	 Then when he wants to get up after forty days, then administer a well-made bandage and let him hold it for another forty days.
Et minoretur a labore, et repletione cibi et potus, et uocibus uehementibus.	 And it should be diminished by labor, and filling with food and drink, and vehement voices.
Nam quando utitur hoc regimine, ita sanatur sanatione integra.	 When using this regimen, it is cured with an entire cure.
Et ego dicam curationem Rupturarum cum incisione in capitulo suo.	 And I will say the treatment of ruptures with incision in its own chapter.
Quando autem Rupturae accidunt in reliquo uentre, et sunt incipientes, et uis ut non addantur, tunc cauteriza Rupturam eius cauterio rotundo secundum quantitatem eius: et sit illud quod aduritur ex tunc sicut tertia eius.	 But if ruptures occur in the remaining abdomen and are beginning, and force does not add to them, then cauterize the rupture with a round cautery according to its size; and let that which is burned be as the third of it from then on.
Deinde cura ipsum, cum eo quod diximus: et non addetur.	 Then care for it, just as we said; no more should be added.
Et iam dixerunt quidam primi: ut cauterizetur Ruptura cum cauterio triangulato, secundum hanc formam.	 And some of the first have said: that the rupture should be cauterized with a triangular cautery in this shape.
Postquam signatur cum encaustro, et ponitur linea quae est per latitudinem in latere superiori Rupturae, et linea altera ad inferius.	 After it is marked with the enkaustrum, and a line is placed that is across its width on the upper side of the rupture, and another line downward.
Et depone manum tuam in medio cum cauterio clauili.	 And place your hand in the middle with the clawed cautery.
Sed cauterium primum est facilius et melius.	 But the first cautery is easier and better.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in doloribus propter casum, aut percussionem.	 Chapter on the method of cauterization for pain due to a fall or blow.
Caput XLVIII.	 Chapter 48.
Quando accidit in quibusdam membris a casu, aut percussione dolor: et perseuerat ille dolor tempore longo, et non confert in eo curatio cum medicinis: tunc oportet ut cauterizetur cum cauterio Puncti.	 If pain occurs in certain limbs from a fall or blow and it persists for a long time and does not help with medicine, then it should be cauterized with the puncture cautery.
Et sit cauterium omnis membri cauterium secundum magnitudinem eius, et ipsius paruitatem, et debilitatem eius, et ipsius uirtutem, et locationem torsionis, et doloris ex eo.	 And the puncture cautery for every limb should be according to its size and the part affected by it, and its weakness and strength, and the location of the twist, and the pain from it.
Si ergo sanatur ex cauterio primo, est bene.	 If it is cured by the first cautery, it is good.
Si non: tunc itera super ipsum cauterium.	 If not: then apply a second cautery to it.
Quoniam de consuetudine horum dolorum est, ut permutentur ex membro ad illud quod appropinquat ei.	 Because by custom the pain of these limbs is, that they are changed from one member to the other which approaches it.
Quare oportet ut consequaris eos cum cauterio, donec sanetur infirmus.	 Because it is necessary that you follow them with a cautery, until the sick person heals.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Lepra.	 On the method of cauterizing leprosy.
Caput XLIX.	 Chapter XLIX.
Leprosi autem quandoque iuuantur cauterio iuuamento maximo.	 Leprosy is sometimes greatly helped by cautery.
Et praecipue species Leprae, quae fit propter putrefactionem phlegmatis et melancholiae: cum ergo uis cauterizare ipsam considera.	 And especially the kind of leprosy that occurs due to corruption of phlegm and melancholy: when considering the need to cauterize it.
Si ergo Lepra est ineipiciens, et curasti eam cum eo, quod diximus in diuisione, et non descendit, neque stat: et times super infirmum, quod comprehendat corruptio super totam complexionem eius: tunc cauteriza eum super caput quinque cauteriis: uno in medio capitis noto, et secundo inferius eo uersus frontem apud finem capillorum, et duobus super duo cornua, et uno posterius super nucea ceruicis.	 If leprosy is beginning and you have treated it as I said in the division, but it does not subside or stop: then beware of corruption spreading over the entire body of the sick person. Then cauterize him on the head with five cauteries: one in the middle of the head, known as the "fifth spot," and a second below it, facing the forehead at the end of the hairline, two on either side of the horns, and one behind, on the nape of the neck.
Et ultima manum tuam cum cauterio parumper, donec imprimat in os impressionem paruam, et dislocentur ex eo cortices: ut alleuietur expiratio uaporum grossorum ex eo, et cauteriza cauterio etiam super ipsum splenem, secundum quod praecessit.	 And with the last finger of your hand, apply the cautery slightly, so as to make a small impression on the bone, and let the scabs be displaced: to relieve the expiration of coarse vapors from it, and cauterize also the spleen, according to what has preceded.
Sin autem Lepra iam sparsa est super infirmum, et apparet manifeste: tunc oportet ut cauterizes cum istis cauteriis, quae diximus in capite, et cauterio super extremitatem nasi, et duobus cauteriis super duas maxillas, et duobus cauteriis super spondiles colli, et sex super spondiles dorsi, et uno magno super alhahosos apud gran caudae et uno supra ipsum, in ipso almeidati: et duobus super anchas: scilicet super omnem ancham uno, et duobus super genua: uno super omne genu, et duobus super humeros, et duobus super cubitos, et duobus super teneritudines pectoris sui: et cauteriza ipsum super omnem iuncturam, ex iuncturis digitorum manuum suarum, et pedum suorum: et cauteriza super omnem calcaneum pedum suorum, et focilia manuum suarum.	 If leprosy has spread over the sick person and is manifestly apparent: then it is necessary to cauterize with these cauteries that I have mentioned on the head, and with a cautery on the end of the nose, and two on either side of the cheeks, and two on the spondyles of the neck, and six on the spondyles of the back, and one large one over the alhahosos at the base of the coccyx, and another above it, in the same place as the anus: and two more on the hips: that is, one on each hip and two on either shoulder, and two on each elbow, and two on the soft parts of the chest: and cauterize him over all the joints, from the joints of his fingers and toes, and cauterize over every calcaneum of his feet, and the fleshy parts of his hands.
Et caue tibi a neruis qui sunt super postremum calcanei, ut non comburas eos.	 Be careful not to burn the nerves that are above the last heel bone (calcaneus).
Et quandoque cauterizatur cauterio super os pectinis, et alio super os stomachi, et alio super epar.	 Whenever cauterization is performed using a cautery on the ear lobe (pectinus), on the ear (stomachi) and another place (epar).
Et scias, quod quanto plus addis cauterium, est magis iuuamentum, et magis conferens.	 Know that the more you apply the cautery, it is more helpful and effective.
Et scias, quod infirmus non inuenit in cauterio dolorem, sicut inueniunt ipsum sani: propterea, quod corpus eius iam stupefactum est.	 Know that the sick person does not feel pain from the cautery as the healthy ones do; this is because his body is already anesthetized.
Et oportet ut sint cauteria ex magnitudine, et paruitate secundum membra et iuncturas: secundum quod praecessit ex speciebus ferramentorum.	 The cauteries should be in proportion to the size and shape of the limbs and joints according to their respective species (types) of iron tools.
Deinde cura cauterium ex farina herbi cum melle, et reliqua curatione, donec sanetur.	 Then, care for the cautery by applying powdered herb flour mixed with honey and the rest of the treatment until it heals.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Stupore.	 Chapter on Cauterization in Anesthesia.
Caput L.	 Chapter L (chapter 32): Cauter
Quando stupet aliquod membrum, et curatur cum medicinis, et oleis, et emplastris, et non sanatur, tunc cauteriza ipsum membrum stupefactum cauteriis, secundum quod meretur magnitudo membri, aut paruitas eius.	 When a part of the body is anesthetized and treated with medicines, oils, plasters and it does not heal, then cauterize the anesthetized part using appropriate cauteries according to the size or smallness of the member.
Et sit cauterium tuum intrans in spissitudinem cutis parumper.	 Let your cautery penetrate only a little deeper than the skin.
Deinde cura ipsum cum unguento, donec sanetur.	 Then care for it with an ointment until it heals.
Et quandoque cauterizatur ad quiddam stuporis, qui accidit manui, et pedi, in spondilibus dorsi apud exitum neruorum, qui mouent illud membrum: et remouetur stupor.	 Whenever cauterization is performed for a numbness that occurs in the hand and foot, in the joints of the spine near the nerve exits, which move that member; the numbness is removed.
Verum non praesumat super illud, nisi qui est sapiens in anatomia membrorum, et egressione neruorum mouentium corpus.	 But do not presume to do it unless you are wise in the study of body anatomy and the exit of the nerves moving the body.

Quando antiquatur Albaras, et non confert in eo aliquid ex ingeniis medicinae: tunc cauteriza super ipsam cauterio profundo parumper, secundum quantitatem spissitudinis cutis, donec remoueatur albedo, et mutetur color eius.	 When Albaras (piles) are old and do not respond to any medical treatment; then cauterize it with a deep cautery, according to the thickness of the skin, until the white part is removed and the color changes.
Deinde cura ipsum cum farina herbi, et lentis cum oleo rosa, et foliis arnoglossae, et sanguine columbae, et sanguine hyrundinis: de unoquoque sit pars una: misceantur haec omnia, et liniantur super pannum, et adhaereant loco, donec sanetur.	 Then care for yourself with the flour of herbs, and with oil of roses, and leaves of arnoglossa, and blood of a dove, and blood of a heron: let each part be one: mix all these together, and anoint them on a cloth, and adhere to the place until it heals.

Sapientes autem dixerunt, ut cauterizetur cauterio ultimo in medio.	 But the wise said that it should be cauterized by a last cautery in the middle.
Mihi autem non uidetur illud: quoniam timeo quod ulceretur: et ego iam uidi illud aliquotiens.	 It does not seem good to me: because I fear that it will burn: and I have already seen that many times.
Et rectius est, ut cauterizetur in circumitu eius cum circulo, sicut diximus: aut cauteriis multis.	 And it is more correct to cauterize around it with a ring, as we said, or with several cauteries.

Quando aliquis habet Adubelati, et tardatur in maturatione, aut propter superfluitatem facientem eam, aut propter aetatem infirmi, quando est decrepitus pauci sanguinis, aut propter tempus, et uis festinare in maturatione Adubelati, tunc cauteriza in circumitu eius cum cauteriis paruis multis punctando.	 When someone has Adubelati and it delays in maturing, either due to excessive amounts causing delay or due to the weakened state of an aged person, when there is scarcity of blood, or due to time, and a hurry to mature Adubelati, then cauterize around it with many small cauteries.
Deinde dimitte eam.	 Then let it be released.
Nam ipsa festinabit cum maturatione.	 For it will hasten with the maturation.
Si autem uis perforationem eius cum cauterio, tunc igni cauterium, cuius haec est forma.	 If you wish to perforate it with a cautery, then heat the cautery in fire, and this is its form: (drawing or description follows)
Et depone ipsum in medio Adubelati, donec penetret cutem: et sit cauterium ab eo quod sequitur infirmus, ut alleuietur cursus puris.	 Place it in the middle of Adubelati until it penetrates the skin; and let the cautery be weakened so that the flow of pus may cease.
Deinde cura ipsum donec sanetur.	 Then care for it until it heals.

Corrodens non est nisi corruptio in membro ambulans, et corrodit ipsum: sicut ignis comedit ligna sicca.	 A cancer is not anything other than a walking corruption that devours the member; just as fire consumes dry wood.
Si ergo uides corrodentem in loco qui toleret cauterium cum igne, tunc igni cauteria multa, clauilia parua et magna, secundum quod conueniet illi loco in quo est corrodens.	 If you see a cancer in a place that can tolerate cautery with fire, then use many small and large cauteries according to the location where the cancer is.
Deinde cauteriza ipsum ab omni parte donec eradices corruptionem totam, et non remaneat ex ea aliquid penitus.	 Then cauterize it from all sides until you completely remove the corruption and nothing remains deep within.
Deinde dimitte ipsum tribus diebus, et pone super loca cauterizata sulphur tritum cum oleo, donec eradicentur escharae omnes, et omnis corruptio.	 Then let it be released for three days, and place over the cauterized places sulfur powder with oil until all scabs and corruption are removed.
Deinde cura ipsum cum unguentis generantibus carnem.	 Then care for it with unguents that promote healing of the flesh.
Si ergo uides, quod post tres dies caro nascitur natiuitate sana, in qua non est corruptio, est bonum.	 If after three days you see that fresh flesh is growing in a healthy manner without corruption, it is good.
Et si non: tunc itera cauterium super illud quod remansit ex locis corruptis.	 And if not: then cauterize again over the remaining parts from the corrupted areas.
Et corrodens medicatur quandoque cum medicina acuta.	 A cancer is sometimes treated with a sharp medicine.
Ipsa namque surgit loco cauterii.	 The text arises in the place of cautery.
Verumtamen cauterium cum igne est uelocioris iuuamenti: et ego quidem iam dixi cauterizationem eius cum medicina acuta in diuisione: accipe ergo eam illic quando ea indiges.	 Nevertheless, cautery with fire is quicker in aid: and I myself have already said the cauterization of it with sharp medicine in division: therefore take it when you need it there.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Clauis, et Verucis.	 Section on the method of cauterizing in nails and warts.
Caput LV.	 Chapter LV.
Multotiens accidit in inferioribus partibus pedum haec aegritudo: et est res grossa, filtrata, quae laedit pedem.	 Often occurs in the lower parts of the feet this disease: and it is a thick, filtered matter that injures the foot.
Et cauterium quidem in eis est secundum duos modos: cauterium cum igne, et cauterium cum aqua calida.	 The cautery indeed is for them in two ways: cauterization with fire, and cauterization with hot water.
Quantum autem cum igne est, ut ignias cauterium concauum simile pennae uulturis: quod fiat ex ferro, secundum quantitatem quod contineat clauum ab omni parte: et sit subtilium marginum.	 As for the one with fire, it should be made convex like a vulture's claw, which is made of iron, in accordance with its size to contain a nail from all sides: and it should have a thin edge.
Deinde depone ipsum ignitum super clauum.	 Then place the heated object upon the nail.
Deinde reuolue manum cum cauterio in circumitu claui, donec perueniat cauterium ad profunditatem claui: et dimitte ipsum tribus diebus, donec incipiat emittere pus.	 Then turn the hand with the cautery around the nail, until the cautery reaches the depth of the nail: and leave it for three days, until it begins to emit pus.
Deinde emplastra ipsum cum maluis syluestribus, contritis cum sale: et dimitte emplastrum super ipsum in nocte.	 Then apply ointment made of forest mints, crushed with salt: and leave the ointment upon it during the night.
Ipse enim eradicabitur ex radicibus suis.	 For this reason, it will be uprooted from its roots.
Deinde cura locum unguento generatiuo carnis, donec sanetur.	 Then care for the place with an ointment for generating flesh, until it is healed.
Quod si sunt non conuersi, et multotiens accidunt in superficie corporis, praecipue in manibus et pedibus: tunc administres in eis cauterium cum aqua calida: et est, ut accipias cannulam ex aere, aut ferro, aut ex penna uulturis: et depone eam super clauum, aut althelul.	 If they are not turned around and often occur on the surface of the body, especially in hands and feet: then administer cauterization with hot water: and it is to be noted that you receive a cannula made of brass, iron or vulture's claw: and place it upon the nail or athlete's foot.
Deinde proiice in cannulam ex aqua calida quantitatem paucam: retine manum tuam, et tu reuolue eam cum compressione manus tuae parumper, ut imprimatur margo cannulae in radice claui, et inueniat aqua calida uiam ad profundum, ad radicem claui: et expectet infirmus parumper super mordicationem aquae calidae hora una.	 Then pour a small amount of hot water into the cannula: retain your hand, and you turn it with the compression of your hand slightly, so that the edge of the cannula is pressed against the root of the nail, and the hot water finds its way to the depth, to the root of the nail: and let the patient wait for a short time over the bite of the hot water, for an hour.
Deinde dimitte ipsum, nam clauus eradicatur cum radicibus suis.	 Then release it, as the nail is uprooted with its roots.
Ita fac cum eis uno post unum, donec uenias super omnes qui ex eis sunt in corpore.	 Follow them one after another until you reach all who are among them in the body.
Deinde cura eos postquam eradicantur, cum eo quod generat carnem ex unguentis.	 Then care for them after they have been removed, with that which generates flesh from unguents.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Tremore.	 On the method of cauterizing in tremor (trembling or shaking).
Caput LVI.	 Chapter 64.
Quando accidit alicui Tremor ex frigore in neruo, aut ex febre quartana, aut alio: tunc oportet ut cauterizes ipsum quatuor cauteriis, aut quinque super spondiles dorsi, et inter omnem spondilem cauterio, et in pectore eius cauterio, et super stomachum eius cauterio.	 When a tremor occurs in a nerve due to cold or quartan fever or something else: then it is necessary that you cauterize it with four or five cauteries on the dorsal vertebrae, and with a cautery between every vertebra, and with a cautery on its chest, and with a cautery on its stomach.
Tremor enim quiescit cum cauterio oliuari, et festinat sanitas aegritudinis frigidae.	 The tremor subsides when it is cauterized with oil, and hastens the health of cold sickness.
¶ De modo cauterizandi Albathir.	 Chapter on the method of cauterization by Albucasis.
Caput LVII.	 Chapter LVII.
Quandoque expelluntur in corpore Albathir foedae, id est, pustulae, quae fiunt a materiis grossis corruptis.	 At times, Albucasis expels foul matter from the body, that is, pustules, which are produced by rotten substances.
Oportet ergo in primis cum apparent, ut cauterizentur super omne caput pustulae cauterio subtili cum ligno myrti, cuius extremitas accensa est cum igne.	 Therefore, when they appear, it is necessary to first cauterize over every head of the pustule with a subtle cautery together with myrtle wood, whose tip is burned with fire.
Aut cum radice aristolochiae longae.	 Or with the long root of Aristolochia.
Aut cum cauterio lenticulari.	 Or with a lentil-shaped cautery.
Et quandoque cauterizantur ademenul, in principio expulsionis suae secundum hunc modum: et non augentur: et disrumpitur superfluitas faciens eos, et sanatur ex eis.	 And sometimes they cauterize bladder stones, at the beginning of their expulsion according to this method: and they are not increased: and the excess is torn away making them, and it heals from them.
Verumtamen oportet ut fiat illud post euacuationem cum phlebotomia.	 Nevertheless, it must be done after evacuation with bloodletting.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in fluxu sanguins ex arteria in uulnere.	 Chapter on the method of cauterization for bleeding from an artery in a wound.
Caput LVIII.	 Chapter LVIII.
Multotiens accidit fluxus sanguinis ex arteria, quae incisa est apud uulnus, quod accidit extrinsecus, aut apud incisionem apostematis, aut cauterium membri, et similia eis: et fit difficile abscindere eum.	 Many times there is bleeding from an artery that has been cut at a wound which happens externally, or at the incision of an abscess, or cauterization of a limb, and similar to these: and it is difficult to separate it.
Cum ergo accidit alicui illud, tunc propera cum manu tua ad orificium arteriae, et pone super ipsum digitum tuum indicem: et stringe eum multum, donec obsessus sit sanguis sub digito tuo, et non egrediatur ex eo aliquid.	 When this happens to someone, then quickly come with your hand to the opening of the artery and place your index finger on top of it: and squeeze it very much until the blood is compressed under your finger and nothing escapes from it.
Deinde pone in ignem cauteria oliuaria parua, et magna numero plura: et suffla super ea, donec fiant ignita ualde.	 Then place in fire small oil-burning cauteries, and many in number: and blow upon them until they become very hot.
Deinde accipe ex eis unum, aut paruum, aut magnum, secundum uulnus et locum, in quo disrupta est arteria, et depone cauterium super ipsam uenam, post quam tu remoues digitum tuum festinanter: et tene cauterium, donec abscindatur sanguis.	 Then take one of them, either small or large, according to the wound and place where the artery is severed, and place the cautery on top of the vein, after you have quickly removed your finger: then hold the cautery until the blood is cut off.
Quod si expellatur cum eleuas digitum ab orificio arteriae, et extinguis cauterium, tunc accipe cauterium aliud festinanter, ex cauteriis quae in igne sunt praeparata.	 If it is pushed out along with the removal of your finger from the opening of the artery and the cautery is extinguished, then take another cautery quickly, from those which are prepared in the fire.
Non ergo cesses facere illud cum uno post aliud, donec abscindatur sanguis.	 Therefore, do not stop doing that with one after the other until the blood is cut off.
Et caue, ne comburas neruum qui est illic, et accidat super infirmum malicia alia.	 And beware lest you burn the nerve which is there and another mischief happen to the weak.
Et scias, quod quando ex arteria fluit sanguis, tunc non est possibile abscindere ipsum: praecipue quaudo arteria est magna, nisi cum uno quatuor modorum.	 And know that when blood flows from the artery, then it is not possible to cut it: especially because the artery is large, unless with one of four methods.
Aut cum cauterio, sicut diximus.	 Or with a cautery, as we have said.
Aut cum extractione, quando non est extracta.	 Or with extraction, when it has not been extracted.
Nam quando extrahitur, contrahuntur extremitates eius, et abscinditur sanguis.	 For when it is drawn out, the ends of it contract and the blood is cut off.
Aut ligetur cum filo ligatione forti.	 Or it is tied with a strong thread.
Aut ponantur super ipsum medicinae de proprietate, quarum est abscindere sanguinem, et stringatur cum puluinari constrictione decenti.	 Or medicine with the property of cutting off blood is placed on it and it is tightened with a decent ligature.
Qui autem administrat abscisionem eius cum ligamento, et strictura cum panno, aut positione rerum comburentium, et similium, non confert ei penitus, nisi raro.	 Whoever administers the cutting off of it with a ligature and tightening with cloth or with things burning and similar, does not completely benefit him, unless rarely.
Si autem accidat alicui illud, et non sit ei praesens medicus, neque medicina: tunc incipiat cum positione digiti indicis super orificium uenae ipsius, sicut narrauimus, et constrictione eius ualde, donec obsessus sit sanguis a superiori parte uulneris, et super arteriam.	 If it happens to anyone that, and the doctor is not present nor medicine: then begin with the position of the index finger on the opening of the vein as we have said, and with strong constriction, until the blood is surrounded from above by the wound, and over the artery.
Et digitus non remoueatur, desuper ipsum cum aqua frigida uehementis frigoris semper, donec congeletur sanguis, et ingrossetur, et abscindatur.	 Do not remove the finger, place it on top with cold water of intense coldness always until the blood freezes and becomes swollen, and then cut it off.
Et interim consideret in eo, quid indiget ex cauterio, aut ex medicina.	 And meanwhile, consider what it needs from cautery or medicine.

Liber Chirurgici Albucasis Pars II.	 Book of Surgery by Albucasis, Part II.
¶ De Incisione, Perforatione, et Phlebotomia in uulneribus, et his similibus.	 On incisions, perforations, and phlebotomy on wounds and similar things.
Iam Diximus in Capitulo Primo, omnem aegritudinem in qua conueniens est cum igne cauterium et medicina comburente, et occasiones eius, ipsius caussas, et instrumenta eius, et formas cauteriorum.	 We have said in Chapter 1 that every disease where burning with fire is appropriate and medicine, its occasions, causes, instruments, and forms of cautery should be discussed.
Et posui illic capitula a uertice usque ad pedem.	 And there I placed chapters from head to foot.
Et ego procedam in hoc capitulo illa eadem uia: ut alleuietur super quaerentem quaesitum eius.	 And I shall proceed in this chapter by the same way: to relieve the seeker of his sought-after thing.
Et antequam incipiam illud, oportet ut addiscatis o filii, quod in hoc capitulo est ex terrore illud quod est in capitulo primo de cauterizatione.	 And before I begin that, you sons should learn what is in this chapter regarding the fear that was mentioned in Chapter 1 about cautery.
Et propter illud oportet, ut sit cautela in eo uehementior, quoniam in operatione quae est in hoc capitulo, multotiens cadit euacuatio cum sanguine, cum quo stat uita apud apertionem uenae, aut incisionem super apostema, aut apertionem exiturae, aut curationem uulneris, aut extractionem sagittae, aut incisionem super lapidem, et illis similia: ex quibus omnibus associatur tremor, et timor, et cadit in pluribus eorum mors.	 And for that reason, there should be a greater caution because, during the operation that is in this chapter, evacuation often occurs with blood, on which life depends when opening a vein, or an incision over a boil, or opening of an abscess, or treatment of a wound, or extraction of an arrow, or incision over a stone, and similar things: from all of these, tremor, fear, and death occur in many cases.
Et ego moneo uos, ne cadat super uos illud in quo est haesitatio, nam quandoque cadunt ad uos in hac arte modi hominum cum modis infirmitatum.	 And I warn you, lest that happen to you where there is hesitation, for sometimes, when dealing with this art, people like you fall into the modes of weak and frail men.
Ex eis enim est qui irascitur cum aegritudine sua, et est leuis apud eum mors: propter uehementiam eius quod inuenit ex infirmitate sua et longitudine eius maliciei.	 For there are those who get angry with their disease and death is easy for him because of his excessive anger, which comes from his weakness and length of wickedness.
Et cum aegritudine est ex timore quod significat mortem.	 And when sickness is from fear which signifies death.
Et ex eis est, qui dat tibicensum suum, et ditat te cum eo, sperans sanitatem, et aegritudo eius est perniciosa.	 And it is he who gives you his trumpet and tells you with it that he hopes for health, but his illness is fatal.
Non ergo oportet ut consentiatis ei qui uenit ad uos ex eis, cuius modus est talis.	 Therefore, it is not appropriate to agree with him who comes to you from those whose manner is such.
Et sit cautela uestra uehementior, quam cupiditas et uestra rapacitas.	 And let your caution be greater than your desire and your greed.
Et non praesumatis super aliquid ex illo, nisi post scientiam certam, quae uerificat apud uos illud ad quod peruenit successio laudabilis.	 And do not presume about anything from it unless after certain knowledge, which verifies at your place the praiseworthy result of that to which it has reached.
Et utimini in curatione omnium infirmorum uestrorum, prognosticatione et indicatione de eo ad quod conuenienter sit salus.	 And use in the care of all your patients, prediction and indication as to what it is appropriate for healing to be attained.
In illo namque est uobis adiutorium super acquisitionem famae et gloriae, et memoriae et laudis.	 For in that there is help for you in acquiring fame and glory, memory and praise.
Inspiret uobis Deus o filii, intellectum suum, et non auferat uobis directionem et inspirationem: quoniam illud est in manu eius.	 May God inspire you, O sons, with his understanding and not take away from you guidance and inspiration, for that is in his hand.
Et ego quidem ordinaui hoc Capitulum distinguendo per capitula, secundum quod praecessit in capitulo Cauterii, a ceruice usque ad pedes: ut alleuietur uobis quaesitum quod uultis ex eo, et quo indigetis.	 And I myself have arranged this chapter by dividing it into sections according to what preceded in the chapter on cautery, from neck to feet: so that you may be relieved of what you seek from it and what you need.
¶ De curatione Aquae quae aggregatur in capitibus puerorum.	 Chapter on the cure of water that collects in children's heads.
Caput I.	 Chapter 1.
Scias, quod haec infirmitas multotiens accidit pueris apud partum: aut quando stringit obstetrix caput pueri absque leuitate.	 Know that this weakness often happens to boys during childbirth: or when the midwife tightens the boy's head without mercy.
Et quandeque accidit etiam ex caussa occulta quae non scitur.	 And sometimes it also occurs due to unknown causes that are not known.
Et ego quidem non uidi hanc aegritudinem in aliis quam in pueris: et ad omnem quem ex eis uidi properauit mors: propter illud ergo uisum est mihi dimittere operationem in ea.	 And indeed, I myself have not seen this illness in anyone other than boys: and to every one of them whom I saw it approached death: therefore it seemed to me fitting to abandon the operation in that case.
Et ego quidem uidi ex eis puerum, cuius caput impletum erat aqua, et caput magnificabatur in omni die, donec non poterat sedere super seipsum, propter magnitudinem capitis sui: et humiditas augmentata fuit, donec mortuus est.	 And indeed, I myself have seen a boy whose head was filled with water and his head grew every day until he could not sit on himself due to the size of his head: and the moisture increased until he died.
Et haec quidem humiditas, aut aggregatur inter cutem et os: aut aggregatur sub osse super sifac.	 And this moistness, it either collects between the skin and the bone: or it collects under the skull bone.
Et operatio in illo, si est humiditas inter cutem et os, et apostema est paruum, tunc oportet ut findas in medio capitis fissura una in latitudine: et sit longitudo fissurae quasi duo nodi, donec currat humiditas.	 And the operation on this case, if the moistness is between the skin and the bone and there is a small abscess, then it is necessary to make a middle split in the skull: and the width of the split should be as two knots, until the moisture runs out.
Et haec est forma spatumilis.	 And this is the form of a trepan.
Si ergo humiditas est magis augmentata, et apostema est maius, tunc pone eas duas fissuras, secundum formam hanc.	 If therefore the moistness is more increased and the abscess is larger, then place these two splits according to this form.
Et si humiditas est sub osse, et signum eius est, quod uides commissuras capitis apertas ab omni parte: et aqua deprimitur quando comprimis eam manu tua ad interiora, et non occultatur tibi illud: tunc oportet ut findas in medio capitis tribus fissuris, secundum hunc modum.	 And if the moistness is under the skull and there is a sign of it that you see that the openings of the skull are wide open from all sides: and water sinks down when you press it with your hand towards the inside, and it does not hide itself from you: then it is necessary to make three splits in the middle of the skull according to this method.
Et post incisionem extrahe humiditatem totam.	 And after the incision, remove all the moistness completely.
Deinde stringe fissuras cum pannis et puluillis.	 Then tie up the splits with cloths and plugs.
Deinde embroca illud desuper cum uino et oleo usque ad diem quintum.	 Then pour oil and wine over it until the fifth day.
Deinde solue ligamentum, et cura uulnus cum tentis, et unguentis.	 Then untie the knot, and care for the wound with salves and ointments.
Et non dimittas stringere caput cum aequalitate.	 And thou shalt not let go of binding the head with equality.
Et ciba infirmum omni cibo sicco paucae humiditatis, usquequo confortetur membrum, et sanetur.	 Feed the sick person with all dry food of slight moisture until the member is strengthened and healed.
Et modus alius incisionis est, ut consideres ubi apparet magnitudo apostematis, et collectio aquae.	 Another method of cutting is that you consider where it appears the size of the abscess, and the collection of water.
Quoniam quandoque est in occipitio plus, aut in sincipite, aut in dextra, aut in sinistra.	 Whenever it is more in the occiput, or in the skull, or in the right, or in the left.
Ascende ergo cum incisione ubi apparet tibi apostema et impletio aquae: et scinde illud secundum quod tibi possibile est.	 Therefore ascend with an incision where it appears to you that there is an abscess and fill it with water: and cut it as far as possible.
Et obserua, ne incidas arteriam, et accidat fluxus sanguinis, et moriatur infirmus ex illo fluxu cum euacuatione humiditatis.	 And observe that you do not cut an artery, and there be a flow of blood, and the sick person die from that flow with the evacuation of moisture.
¶ De incisione Arteriarum quae sunt post aures.	 Chapter on the incision of the arteries that are behind the ears.
Caput II.	 Head II.
Quando accidunt alicui catarri ad oculos, aut ad pectus, et antiquatur illud, et non confert curatio medicinarum: tunc magis ultima curatio est in illo, incisio harum duarum arteriarum.	 When someone has cataracts on the eyes, or on the chest, and it becomes old and medical treatment does not help: then the final cure is more in him, incision of these two arteries.
Oportet ergo quando uis incidere eas, ut radat infirmus caput suum.	 Therefore, when one wants to cut them, let the sick man shave his head.
Deinde frica locum cum panno aspero, ut appareant arteriae.	 Then rub the place with a rough cloth, so that the arteries appear.
Deinde stringat infirmus collum suum, cum quolibet panno suo.	 Then let the sick man tighten his neck with any cloth of his.
Deinde considera, ubi pulset uena.	 Then consider where the vein pulses.
Et loca utriusque sunt loca quae sunt post aures depressa: et raro occultatur, nisi in quibusdam hominibus.	 And the places of both are places that are depressed below the ears: and it is rarely hidden, unless in some men.
Deinde signa cum encaustro super utraque: et incide utramque cum spatumili utrimque acuro, incisione perueniente ad os: et fiat illud per latitudinem capitis.	 Then mark with wax both sides: and cut each side with a lancet on both sides, the incision reaching to the bone: and let it be made in the width of the head.
Et si uis, intromitte spatumile sub arteria, et incide eam ad superiora cum incisione.	 And if you wish, insert the lancet under the artery, and cut it with the incision upward.
Et sit longitudo incisionis quasi duo digiti iuncti.	 Let the length of the incision be about two joined fingers.
Nam quando inciditur uena, egreditur sanguis egressione pulsatili, qui salit ad interiora saltu frequenti.	 For when a vein is cut, blood flows out with a pulsating flow, which jumps to the inside frequently.
Si autem arteria non apparet sensui, tunc oportet ut mensures ab aure quantitatem spacii trium digitorum.	 If, however, the artery does not appear to the senses, then it is necessary that measurements from the ear determine the quantity of space of three fingers.
Deinde signa cum encaustro, et finde usque ad os.	 Then mark with wax and cut to the bone.
Et illud quod oportet emittere ex sanguine, est VI uncia et fortasse emittis ex eo plus, aut minus.	 And what is necessary to be taken out from blood is VI ounces, and perhaps you may take more or less out of it.
Totum illud secundum quantitatem quae apparet tibi ex uirute infirmi et repletione arteriae eius.	 The whole thing according to the quantity that appears to you from the strength of the sick person and the filling of the artery of it.
Deinde considera ad uulnus.	 Then consider the wound.
Tunc si remanet ad os ex sifac aliquid, tunc incide illud, ut non accidat apostema calidum: tunc stringe uulnus cum liciniis ex panno lini.	 Then if something remains on the bone from the wound, then cut it so that no abscess forms hot: then tighten the wound with linens from a linen cloth.
Deinde cura ipsum cum unguento, donec sanetur.	 Then care for it with an ointment until it heals.
¶ De extractione arteriarum, quae sunt in timporibus.	 On the extraction of arteries that are in the temples.
Caput III.	 Chapter III.
Quando accidit homini hemicranea antiqua, aut catarri acuti propter humiditates acrimoniales, et caliditate in lacertis timporum, aut soda antiqua, uehemens, et similia illis: et medicatur cum modis curationis medicinae, et non confert illud: tunc experti sumus in his aegritudinibus extractionem arteriarum ex timporibus, aut cauterizationem earum, sicut narrauimus.	 When an old hemicrania or acute catarrh due to acid, moist humours and heat in the temples occurs, or an old sores, vehement and similar: and it is treated with methods of curative medicine, but it does not help: then we have experience in dealing with these ailments by extracting the arteries from the temples, or cauterizing them, as we have narrated.
Et modus operationis in extractione earum, est, ut radat infirmus pilos qui sunt in timporibus, et intendat ad arteriam apparentem in timpore.	 The method of operation in extracting them is that the sick person shaves the hairs on the temples and exposes the visible artery in the temple.
Ipsa namque ostenditur tibi ex pulsu suo, et raro occultatur nisi in paucis hominibus, aut uehementia frigoris.	 It is indeed shown to you by its pulse, and it rarely hides itself unless in a few men, or from violent cold.
Quod si occultatur tibi, tunc stringat infirmus caput suum cum quolibet panno suo: deinde frica locum cum panno aspero.	 If it is hidden to you, then let the sick person squeeze his head with any cloth of his, and then rub the place with a rough cloth.
Aut uapora locum cum aqua calida, donec appareat tibi apparitione manifesta.	 Or boil the place with hot water until it appears to you in a clear manifestation.
Deinde accipe spatumile, quod paulo ante formaui.	 Then take the probang that I have prepared earlier.
Deinde excoria cum eo cutem cum facilitate, donec peruenias ad arteriam.	 Then peel off the skin with it easily until you reach the artery.
Deinde proiice in eam uncinum, et extrahe eam ad superiora, donec extrahas eam ex cute, et facias eam euadere ex tunicis quae sunt sub ea ab omni parte.	 Then thrust a hook into it and draw it out towards the top until you extract it from the skin, and make it come out from all sides of the layers beneath it.
Si autem arteria est subtilis: tunc inuolue eam cum extremitate uncini.	 If the artery is delicate: then roll it up with the end of the hook.
Deinde incide ex ea partem secundum quantitatem qua elongentur extremitates eius, et contrahantur, et non accidat fluxus sanguinis.	 Then cut off a portion according to the length that its ends will extend and contract, so as to avoid blood flow.
Nam si non inciditur, et si non abscinditur, non ascendit sanguis penitus.	 For if it is not cut, and if it is not severed, the blood does not rise up deeply.
Deinde euacua ex sanguine ana VI unci, usque ad .III.	 Then evacuate the blood to six ounces, down to three.
Quod si arteria est magna: tunc oportet ut liges eam in duobus locis ex filo duplo, forti, ex serico: aut ex chordis alhohod, ut non properet ad ipsam putrefactio ante consolidationem uulneris, et accidat fluxus sanguinis.	 If the artery is large: then it must be tied in two places with a thick thread, strong, of silk or hemp; or with cords made of wool, so that decay does not approach it before the wound is consolidated and blood flow occurs.
Deinde incide superfluitatem, quae est inter duo ligamenta.	 Then cut off the excess which is between two ligaments.
Fac illud in illa hora, aut post horam aliam.	 Do this at that hour, or after another hour.
Et si uis, cauteriza eam cauterio usque ad os, cum cauterio cultellari: donec incidantur extremitates eius, et stabit loco eiusdem operis.	 And if you wish, cauterize it with a cautery to the bone, with a small-bladed cautery: until its ends are cut off, and it remains in place for this same operation.
Et est melius opus, nisi si infirmus habet febrem, autest calefactae complexionis.	 And it is better work, unless he who is ill has a fever, or his condition is heated.
Quoniam cauterium est ex eis, quae iuuant ad finiendas humiditates.	 Because the cautery is from those things which aid in ending moisture.
Ergo est melius iuuamentum.	 Therefore it is better to aid (him).
Et oportet post extractionem arteriarum, ut impleatur locus cotto antiquo: et ponantur super ipsum puluilli decenter facti.	 And after the extraction of the arteries, it is necessary that the place be filled with cooked old linen: and small pieces of freshly made wool should be placed on top.
Et post solutionem curetur cum medicinis siccis, quae faciunt nasci carnem, et cum liciniis, donec sanetur.	 And after the dissolution (of a wound), it is to be treated with dry medicines which cause flesh to grow, and with linen, until it heals.
Quod si interim dum operaris accidit fluxus sanguinis ex arteria, tunc propera ad abscindendum eum cum cauterio, aut ut impleas locum cum zegi: et stringe manum tuam, donec abscindatur sanguis.	 If in the meantime while you are operating blood flow occurs from an artery, then hasten to cut it with a cautery, or fill the place with wax: and press your hand until the blood is cut off.
Quod si nihil ex illis est tibi praesens, tunc pone super locum digitum tuum, donec congeletur sanguis.	 If nothing of those things is present to you, then place your finger on the place until the blood freezes.
Et embroca locum cum aqua uehementis frigoris, donec quiescat acuitas, et stringatur secundum quod oportet.	 And wet the place with water of intense coldness, until the sharpness subsides and it is constricted as required.
Et ex eo quod est leuius et facilius extractione arteriae, est, ut cauterizes uenam cum hoc cauterio habente duos cultellos: sitque acuitas duorum cultellorum similis almagdatem.	 And because the vein which is lighter and easier to extract is to be cauterized with this cautery having two small blades: let the sharpness of the two blades be similar to amalgamated metal.
Verumtamen sunt multo minoris acuitatis, quam duo cultelli.	 Nevertheless, they are much less sharp than two small knives.
Quoniam si sunt acutae, sicut duo cultelli, properat utrisque frigus: et non incidunt carnem cum uelocitate.	 Because if they are as sharp as two small knives, frost should be applied to both of them: and flesh will not be cut with speed.
Cum ergo in eis est aliquantulum grossitudinis, tenetur in eis calor ignis, et abscinditur caro uelociter: cum hoc ergo opus est melius omni opere, et leuius, et facilius.	 When there is a slight thickening [in the body], heat from fire should be applied, and the flesh should be cut off quickly; for this operation is better than any work, and easier, and lighter.
Et sit spacium quod est inter duos cultellos quantitas grossitudinis digiti, postquam tu signas duo loca cum encaustro: et depone utrosque ignitos ualde, donec perueniant ad os, et incidant uenam in duobus locis: ut elongetur quod est inter extremitates eius.	 And let the space between the two knives be of the size of a finger's thickness, after you have marked two places with hot iron; place both very hot knives until they reach the bone and cut through the vein in two places: so that what is between its extremities will be removed.
Nam non consolidantur cum hoc cauterio penitus.	 For this cautery does not solidify completely.
Et haec est forma cauterii.	 And this is the form of the cautery.
¶ De cura cursus lachrymarum acutarum assiduarum ab oculis.	 Chapter on the treatment of continuous sharp tears from the eyes.
Caput IIII.	 Chapter IV.
Quando sunt lachrymae assiduae, et est cursus earum ex uenis, quae sunt super craneum capitis exterius: et non confert in eis aliquid curationis medicinae cum medicinis, et uides faciem infirmi iam rubere, et sentit in fronte sua deambulationem, sicut est deambulatio formicarum: et oculi eius sunt extenuati, humidi, ita quod iam corrosi sunt pili eorum cum corrosione: et calefactae sunt palpebrae eius ex acuitate lachrymarum: tunc antiqui indiguerunt in curatione earum hac operatione, et denominauerunt eam curationem, cum Ense.	 When tears are persistent and run from the veins on the exterior of the skull at the top of the head: and no healing medicine is applied to them with medicines, and the face of the sick person turns red, and a movement like that of ants is felt on the forehead: and the eyes are exhausted, wet, so much that the hair around them has started to rot due to rotting: and the eyelids have been heated by the sharpness of tears: then the ancients resorted to this treatment for them, and they called it a cure with the knife.
Et est, ut praecipias infirmo radere pilos qui sunt in fronte sua.	 And is it to instruct the sick person to shave the hair that are on his forehead.
Deinde incide in fronte tres fissuras aequedistantes secundum longitudinem frontis: et sit longitudo fissurae quasi duo digiti, et fissura una sit aequedistans longitudini nasi in medio frontis, et secunda secundum longitudinem parumper a motu lacertorum, et tertia a parte altera: et caue ab incisione arteriarum quae sunt in duobus lateribus: et elonga manum tuam a continuatione duarum mandibularum, et sit spacium omnis incisionis quantitas trium digitorum coniunctorum: et sit tibi frustum spongiae praeparatum, aut panni siccati multi, cum quibus exsicces sanguinem.	 Then make three cuts on the forehead, each equal in length to the forehead, and let the length of the cut be about two fingers, and one of them should be centered at the middle of the forehead, and the second slightly below the movement of the arms, and the third on the other side: and avoid cutting arteries that are on both sides: and extend your hand from the continuation of the two jaws, and let the distance between all cuts be the width of three connected fingers: and have a piece of prepared sponge or dried cloth ready with which you will absorb blood.
Deinde intromitte spatumile duarum acutarum extremitatum, cuius mox sequens est forma.	 Then introduce a spatula with two sharp ends, which is followed by the following shape:
Ab incisione quae est a parte timporis, usque ad incisionem secundam: et excoria cum eo totam cutem, quae est inter duas incisiones, cum sifac, quod est super os.	 From the first incision that is at the temple, up to the second incision: and scrape with it all the skin that is between the two cuts, including the part above the eye.
Deinde fac illud etiam ab incisione media usque ad incisionem secundam.	 Then do the same from the middle incision up to the second incision.
Deinde extrahe hoc spatumile, et intromitte in incisionem primam iterum instrumentum aliud, quod nominatur cultellare acutum, ab una parte lene, non acutum ab altera parte.	 Then remove the spatula and insert another tool called a sharp scalpel, blunt on one side, but not blunt on the other side, into the first incision again.
Et haec est forma eius.	 And this is its form.
Et pone latus eius acutum uersus carnem annexam cum cute, et latus eius lene uersus os: et impelle ipsum, donec perueniat ad fissuram mediam: et abscinde cum eo omnia uasa, quae descendunt a capite ad oculos: praeter quod continuetur incisio usque ad illud quod apparet de cute.	 And place its sharp side turned towards the flesh attached with skin, and its blunt side turned towards the bone: and push it in until it reaches the middle fissure: and cut off along with it all the vessels that descend from the head to the eyes: except for the incision should be continued up to where it appears on the skin.
Deinde fac illud in fissura media usque ad fissuram aliam.	 Then make this, in the middle fissure until another fissure.
Et postquam currit ex sanguine quantitas aequalis, exprime loca ex frustis sanguinis coagulati.	 And when the quantity of blood flows out equal, squeeze places from the fragments of coagulated blood.
Deinde pone in omnem fissuram licinium ex cotto ueteri, et pone super eos puluillos imbibitos in uino, et oleo, aut aceto.	 Then place linen cloth from old cooking on all the fissures and place upon them small lice soaked in wine, oil or vinegar.
Et uide ut non accidat apostema calidum.	 And see to it that no abscess becomes hot.
Et in die tertia solue ligamentum, et administra infusionem multam cum aqua tepida.	 And on the third day loosen the binding and administer a large infusion with warm water.
Deinde cura illud ex unguento basilicon, et reliquis quibus curantur uulnera: usquequo sanetur.	 Then take care of it with basilicon ointment, and the rest that heal wounds, until it is healed.
¶ De cura lachrymarum acutarum et catarrorum ad oculos ex interioribus capitis.	 Chapter on the care of sharp tears and catarrh for the eyes from the inner parts of the head.
Caput V.	 Chapter 5.
Quando accidunt alicui catarri acuti, acres, assidui: et uides oculos eius extenuatos, paruos, et iam debilitatus est aspectus eorum: et palpebrae ulceratae, et cadunt pili ex eis, et in profundo capitis est dolor acutus, laedens, et sternutatio consequens: tunc sume ex istis accidentibus, quod illae materiae, et catarri non ueniunt, nisi ex uenis multis.	 When sharp catarrh or frequent and intense occurs to someone, you see their eyes strained, small, and the sight is already weakened: and the eyelids are ulcerated, and hairs fall out from them, and in the deep parts of the head there is acute pain, hurting and sneezing follows: then take the matter that comes from many veins, which sharp catarrh or these conditions do not occur unless from numerous veins.
Et melior curatio in eis est haec.	 A better treatment for them is this.
Et est, ut praecipias infirmo radere frontem suam.	 And it should be ordered that a shaving of the forehead [should be given] to the sick one.
Deinde incide in eam fissuram unam in medio frontis, aut alterius parumper per latitudinem, et incipe cum fissura a timpore sinistro ad timpus dextrum: et sit incisio usque ad os: et elonga manum tuam a lacertis timporum, qui mouentur apud masticationem: donec quando detegitur os: et exsiccabis totum sanguinem cum spongia.	 Then make one incision in the middle of the forehead, or somewhat less wide, from the left temple to the right temple; and let the incision reach the bone; and move your hand away from the temples that are moved during chewing until when the bone is exposed; and dry up all the blood with a sponge.
Tunc separa inter duo labia fissurae cum cotto ueteri, aut cum liciniis ex lino.	 Then separate the two lips of the incision with a heated iron or with scissors made of flax.
Deinde stringe desuper cum puluillis: et imbibe puluillos cum uino et oleo, ut non accidat apostema calidum.	 Then bind them above with thread; and moisten the threads with wine and oil so that no hot abscess occurs.
Et quando soluis illud, et uides quod apostema calidum iam imminuitur: tunc oportet ut frices os, donec incipiat in eo nasci caro.	 And when you remove it, and see that the hot abscess is about to burst; then it must be scraped until flesh begins to grow in it.
Deinde cura ipsum cum regimine exiccatiuo quod facit nasci carnem: sicut si accipias ex farina tritici partes duas, et ex colophonia quatuor partes: et praepares ex eis emplastrum, et administretur ad natiuitatem carnis in istis uulneribus.	 Then treat it with astringent dressing that promotes growth of flesh; as if you were to take two parts of wheat flour and four parts of colophony; and prepare an ointment from them, and administer it for the growth of flesh in these wounds.
¶ De cura eius quod cadit in Aurem.	 [Section on the treatment falling into the ear.]
Caput VI.	 Chapter VI.
Omne Quod in Aurem cadit, est una quatuor specierum: aut lapis mineralis, aut simile lapidi, sicut ferrum, et uitrum: aut est ex planta, sicut est cicer, et fabae: aut est res fluxibilis, sicut aqua, et acetum, et eis similia: aut aliquod animal.	 Everything that falls into the ear is one of four kinds: either a mineral stone, or something similar to a stone like iron and glass: or it is from a plant such as peas and beans: or it is liquid, such as water, vinegar, and similar things: or it is some animal.
Quando ergo cadit in aurem lapis, aut genus lapidis ex eis quae non adduntur, neque crescunt in aure, expone Aurem soli: si ergo uides lapidem, tunc distilla in Aurem aliquid ex oleo uiolato, aut sisamino.	 When a stone falls into the ear or anything similar to stones that do not grow within the ear and are not added, expose only the ear: if you see a stone, then pour something from broken oil or sesame into the ear.
Deinde administra extractionem eius, et fac sternutare cum condisi, et opila nares apud aduentum sternutationis, postquam tu ponis in circumitu auris frusta ex pannis, aut lana, et extendis aurem ad superiora.	 Then administer its extraction and make it sneeze with pepper and poppy seeds placed near the nose when you place around the ear fragments of cloth or wool and stretch the ear upward.
Multotiens enim egreditur cum hac cura.	 It often goes out (the stone) with this care.
Si autem non egreditur, tunc administra extractionem eius cum Gesti, id est, Pizigarolis subtilibus: cuius forma est haec.	 If it does not go out, then administer its extraction with Geista (phenazone), that is, subtle pizigaroli: whose shape is as follows.
Si ergo egreditur cum gesti, est bonum.	 If it goes out with geista, it is good.
Et si non, tunc administra extractionem eius cum uncino caeco subtili paucae duplicationis.	 And if not, then administer its extraction with a subtle blind hook (forceps) a few times.
Si ergo non egreditur per illud, tunc fac cannulam ex aere, et intromitte extremitatem cannulae in foramen auris multum, et opila quod est in circumitu cannulae cum caera mollificata cum oleo, ut non sit uento uia nisi cannulae: deinde extrahe cum uento tuo attractione forti.	 If it does not go out through that (the blind hook), then make a tube from metal and insert the end of the tube into the ear opening a lot and seal what is around the tube with softened wax so that there is no way for the wind to pass except by the tube: then pull it out with your strong force.
Multotiens enim egreditur cum eo quod narrauimus.	 It often goes out (the stone) with what we have said.
Si autem non egreditur hoc modo: tunc accipe ex helkalimbat, aut ex uisco, id est, gluten praeparato, cum quo capiuntur aues, rem modicam: et pone ipsum in extremitate radii postquam tu inuoluis super eam cotum decenter positum: deinde intromitte ipsum in foramen auris cum facilitate, postquam tu exiccas aurem ab humiditate.	 If it does not go out in this way: then take from helkalimbath or vinegar (acetic acid), that is, prepared gluten, which birds are caught with, a small amount of it: and put it on the end of a radius when you have placed the cup correctly over it: then insert it into the ear opening gently, after you have everted the ear from moisture.
Si ergo non egreditur cum omnibus quae narrauimus, tunc propera ad scindendum, antequam accidat apostema calidum, aut spasmus.	 If therefore it does not emerge with all that I have mentioned, then hurry to cut, before a hot abscess or spasm occurs.
Et modus fissurae est, ut phlebotomes infirmum in primis in cephalica: et extrahe ei ex sanguine secundum mensuram uirtutis eius.	 The method of lancing is that the bloodletting instrument (phlebotome) should first be applied to the sick person, and then blood drawn from him according to its strength.
Deinde fac sedere infirmum inter manus tuas, et conuerte aurem eius ad superiora, et finde fissuram paruam in radice auris apud adipem eius in loco depresso ipsi: et sit fissura lunaris figurae, donec peruenias ad lapidem: deinde aufer eum cum eo, quod est tibi possibile ex instrumentis.	 Then make the sick person sit with his hands in yours, and turn his ear towards upwards, and make a small incision at the root of the ear in the fatty part of it, depressed to that place; let the incision be lunar shaped, until you reach the stone (earring); then remove it along with it, if possible using your instruments.
Deinde sue fissuram ab hora tua cum uelocitate, et cura ipsam, donec sanetur.	 Then let the incision heal by itself and take care of it until it heals.
Quod si res cadens in aurem est ex uno granorum, quae crescunt, et inflantur: tunc administra extractionem eius.	 If something falling into the ear is one of the grains that grow and swell, then administer its removal.
Si autem non obedit tibi ad exitum, tunc accipe spatumile tenue, subtile, secundum hanc formam.	 But if it does not obey to come out by itself, then take a thin, fine probe of this shape.
Et administra cum eo abscisionem illius speciei ex granis, quae cadunt in aurem, et non facias illud, quando tu cogitas, quod illud granum iam humectatum est per uaporem auris, donec ponis ipsum frusta multa: deinde extrahe ea cum uncinis, aut cum gesti subtili, aut cum suctione, sicut diximus, nam extractio eius alleuiatur.	 And administer with it the removal of this kind of grains that fall into the ear and do not do it when you think that the grain is already damp from the moisture of the ear, until you put many pieces (of cotton) on it; then remove them with forceps, or with a fine probe, or by suction as we have said, for its removal will be relieved.
In aqua autem quae ingreditur in aurem, oportet ut utatur infirmus sternutatione cum condisi in primis: et iam impleuit aurem suam cum aliquanto cotto ueteri: et est iacens super illam aurem, in qua est aqua.	 In water that enters the ear, the sick person should cough with it first; and his ear has already filled with some cotton of old age; and it lies on top of that ear where the water is.
Si ergo egreditur per illud, est bonum.	 If therefore it comes out through this (the probe), it is good.
Et si non: tunc accipe lapides multos, secundum longitudinem digiti, tenues, lenes, et calefac eos cum igne parumper, et intromittat infirmus ex eis unum in foramen auris suae: et saliat super pedem suum unum ex illa parte, et percutiat cum lapide alio super lapidem qui est in aure.	 And if not, then take many small, soft, and warm stones about the length of a finger; heat them slightly with fire; and make the sick person insert one from those into the ear canal; and let him throw salt on his foot from that side and strike with another stone on the stone in the ear.
Non ergo cesset facere illud cum lapide et lapide, donec egrediatur tota aqua.	 Therefore, it should not cease to do that with stone and stone until all water comes out.
Et iam egreditur aqua ita, ut accipias ex parpyro, aut ex iunco unum, et intromittas extremitatem eius unam in aurem: et accendas extremitatem alteram cum igne, donec comburatur plurimum eius.	 And the water now comes out in such a way that you take one from a brazier or from a reed and insert one end into the ear; and light the other end with fire until it is burnt as much as possible.
Deinde itera iuncum alium, et fac illud multotiens, donec egrediatur tota aqua: et extrahe ipsam cum cannula secundum quod praemissum est in lapide.	 Then take another reed and do this many times until all water comes out; and withdraw it with a cannula as described above in the stone.
In extractione autem animalis intrantis in eam, si est parui corporis, ut pulex, et ei simile, cura ipsum sicut dixi in diuisione.	 In the extraction of an animal entering into it (if it is a small body, like a louse, and similar), care for it as I said in the division.
Sed si est corporis magni, quod appareat sensui: tunc administra extractionem eius cum gesti, et uncinis: et res eius est facilior omnibus, quae tenentur in aure.	 But if it is of a large body that appears to the senses: then administer the extraction of it with forceps and with hooks; and its removal is easier for all who hold it in the ear.
In extractione autem uermis generati in aure, quando curas eum cum eo quod diximus in diuisione, et in tractatu distilationum, et non confert curatio tua: tunc oportet ut aspicias aurem in sole.	 In the extraction of worms generated in the ear, when you care for it as I said in the division and in the treatment of distillations, and your care does not help: then it is necessary that you look at the ear in the sun.
Si ergo apparet illic aliquid ex uermibus, tunc extrahe illud cum gesti, aut cum uncinis subtilibus.	 Therefore, if something appears from worms there, then withdraw it with forceps or with fine hooks.
Si autem non apparet illic aliquid, tunc accipe cannulam, cuius haec est forma, stricta inferius, ampla superius: et intromitte extremitatem subtilem in aurem secundum quantitatem quod tolerat eam infirmus: deinde suge cum ea suctione forti.	 But if nothing appears there, then take a cannula, whose shape is narrow below and wide above; and insert the fine end into the ear according to the size that the sick one can bear; then suck with strong suction.
Fac illud multotiens, donec egrediantur omnes uermes.	 Do this many times until all worms come out.
Si autem non obediunt tibi ad exitum, tunc opila circumitum cannulae cum caera, sicut dixi in lapide.	 But if they do not obey you to go out, then wrap the cannula with hops, as I said in the stone.
Quod si non egrediuntur cum eo quod diximus: tunc administra distillationes quas iam experti sunt antiqui in interfectione uermium: et inuenies illud in tractatu distillationum.	 But if they do not come out with what I said: then administer the distillations that ancient people have been experienced in the treatment of worms; and you will find it in the treatment of distillations.
Et sit effusio tua qua effundis olea et medicinas in aurem cum hoc instrumento, cuius forma depicta est hic.	 And let your flow [be] that you pour oil and medicines into the ear with this tool, whose form is depicted here.
Sicut uides fac ipsum ex argento, aut aere, inferius strictum, in quo sit foramen paruum, amplum superius.	 As you see, make it from silver or bronze, narrow below, with a small hole at the bottom and wide above.
Sit ergo ut impellens quod est in concauitate cannulae, sit ex aere decenter factum.	 So, let what is within the concavity of the tube [be] made of bronze, well-made.
Et si uis, accipe radium, et inuolue in extremitate eius cottum inuolutione decenti: deinde proiice oleum, aut succum, aut quod uis ex istis medicinis in cannulam: et ipsa sit in aure: deinde intromitte radium cum cotto desuper, et exprime ipsum manu tua compressione temperata, donec impellatur oleum in concauitate auditus, et sentiat ipsum infirmus interius: et illud quod infunditur in aurem, sit iam calefactum cum igne parumper: et caue ne sit res quae distillatur in eam frigida ualde: medicinae enim non tolerant illud.	 And if you wish, take the radium and wrap its end with a suitable winding; then pour oil or juice, or whatever medicine you desire into the tube; let it be in the ear; then insert the radium with the heated rod on top and squeeze it with moderate pressure until the oil is forced into the concavity of the ear, so that the sick person may feel it inside; and what is poured into the ear, let it already be slightly heated with a little fire; and beware not to pour anything that distills in it extremely cold, for medicines do not tolerate this.
¶ De cura opilationis accidentis Auri.	 [Title] Treatment of Ear Blockage.
Caput VII.	 Chapter VII.
Quandoque egrediuntur quidam infantes ex uentribus matrum suarum non perforati.	 When certain infants emerge from their mothers' wombs not pierced.
Et iam accidit etiam quibusdam hominibus opilatio in meatu Auris a uulnere, aut carne nata in ea.	 It also happens to some people that ear blockage comes from a wound or flesh born in the ear.
Et haec opilatio quandoque fit in profundo foraminis Auris, quam non consequitur uisus: et quandoque accidit ad exteriora foraminis parum, et consequitur eam uisus.	 This blockage sometimes occurs in the deep opening of the ear that is not visible to the eye; and sometimes it occurs near the external opening of the ear that can be seen.
Illa ergo quae accidit in profundo Auris, et quam non comprehendit aspectus, est in pluribus dispositionibus difficilis sanationis.	 Therefore, that which occurs in the deep part of the ear and is not perceived by the eye, is difficult to cure in many positions.
Et in illa quam consequitur uisus, oportet ut ponas Aurem infirmi in sole, et aspicias in ea: tunc si uides opilationem apparentem, aperi eam cum spatumili subtili, cuius forma est haec quae sequitur, sit extremitas eius in qua sit quaedam latitudo parua, cuius quaedam pars sit acuta: et reliquum spatumile sit duarum laterum lenium: ut non laedat aurem.	 And in the one that is visible to the eye, it is necessary to place the sick person's ear on the sun and look into it; then if you see the blockage appearing, open it with a fine spatula whose shape is as follows: its end should have a small notch, part of which is acute; and the rest of the spatula should be made of two flat sides to avoid damaging the ear.
Si ergo opilatio est a carne nata in meatu auris: tunc tene eam cum uncino subtili, et incide eam cum facilitate uehementi, donec auferatur tota caro.	 If therefore the abscess arises from the flesh within the ear: then hold it with a fine hook and cut it out easily and forcibly until all the flesh is removed.
Quod si opilatio est in profundo auris: tunc accipe radium subtilem, lenem, et calefac ipsum cum igne parumper: deinde mitte ipsum in meatum auris.	 If therefore the abscess is deep within the ear: then take a fine and slender probe, heat it slightly with fire, and then send it into the ear.
Si ergo senseris opilationem cum eo, quod inuenit infirmus cum grauitate auditus, conare apertionem eius cum facilitate: et caue, ne uulneres neruos auris.	 If you should feel an abscess with the symptom that the person is weak and afflicted with hearing loss, make an incision of it easily: and beware lest you wound the nerves of the ear.
Deinde pone in aurem licinium secundum quantitatem amplitudinis foraminis, quod inuoluisti in unguento aegyptio: fac illud aliquot diebus, donec sis securus de consolidatione uulneris.	 Then place linen in the ear according to the size of the opening you have made and wrap it with Egyptian ointment. Do this for several days until you are sure that the wound has healed.
Aut accipe licinium, et infunde ipsum in aqua rosata, et pulueriza super ipsum zegi tritum, et utere ipso.	 Or take linen and soak it in rosewater, grind cinnamon into powder over it, and use it.
Quod si uides aurem iam apostemari: tunc oportet ut extrahas licinium, et permittas ipsum cum licinio alio, quod inuolues in caeroto quod sit factum cum oleo rosato, donec sedetur apostema calidum: deinde cura ipsum usquequo sanetur.	 If you see the ear already suppurating: then you must remove the linen and allow it to be covered with another linen soaked in a pot made with rose oil, until the suppuration becomes warm; then take care of it until it is healed.
Si autem accidat fluxus sanguinis: tunc submerge spongiam, aut pannos in aqua frigida, et pone super eam aurem: et utere reliqua curatione, quae abscindit fluxum sanguinis praedicta in tractatu distillationum.	 If, however, there is bleeding: then immerse sponges or cloths in cold water and place it on the ear; and use the remaining treatment that stops the described bleeding by distillation.
¶ De cura Altheli palpebrarum.	 Chapter of Altheus on the Treatment of Eyelids.
Caput VIII.	 Chapter VIII.
Isti Althelil qui accidunt in Palpebris oculi, quandoque sunt humidi, et sunt sicci.	 Those who occur in the eyelids of the eyes are sometimes moist and sometimes dry.
Oportet ergo ut teneas eos cum tenaliis: aut cum uncino, et incidas eos cum spatumili a radicibus suis.	 Therefore you must hold them with tweezers or with a hook and cut them from their roots.
Deinde pone super loca zegi tritum.	 Then place cinnamon powder over the site.
Si autem ex eis fluat sanguis, tunc cauteriza eos cum cauterio lenticulari subtili.	 If however blood flows from them, then cauterize them with a subtle lentil-shaped cautery.
Et cauterizare eos, est melius post incisionem.	 To cauterize them is better after the incision.
Multotiens enim redeunt quando remanet ex radicibus suis aliquid.	 For many times they return when something remains from their roots.
Et quando cauterizantur cum igne, comburuntur illae radices, et non redeunt.	 And when they are cauterized with fire, the roots are burned and do not return.
¶ De cura Grandinum palpebrarum oculi.	 [Section on Treatment of Tumors of the Eyelids]
Caput IX.	 Section IX:
Multotiens accidit in palpebris aliquid quod assimilatur Crandini in fortitudine sua, et sua duricie, et propter illud nominatur Grando: et est aggregatio humiditatis grossae in palpebra superiore, et palpebra inferiore.	 Often something happens in the eyelids resembling sand in its hardness and stubbornness, and for this reason it is called grain; and it is an accumulation of thick moisture in the upper eyelid and the lower one.
Operatio ergo in eis est, ut consideres tunc, si est Grando procedens in eo, quod apparet de palpebra, et mouentur ad omnem partem, et res eius est facilis.	 Therefore, the operation for this is to examine whether it is a grain coming out from the eyelid that appears, and to move everything around it, and its removal is easy.
Finde ergo super eam fissura per latitudinem.	 Find then a crack over it in width.
Deinde excoria eam ab omni parte cum facilitate, donec euadat.	 Then scrape it from every side with ease until it comes out.
Deinde suspende eam cum uncino, et abscinde ipsam.	 Then hang it with a hook and cut (or remove) it.
Si autem non praeparatur tibi abscisio eius, nisi postquam tu penetras palpebram cum incisione parumper, tunc nocet infirmo illud in aliquo.	 But if its removal is not prepared for you unless after you have penetrated the eyelid with a slight cut, then it hurts the weak in some way.
Quod si fissura est magna: tunc aggrega ipsam cum sutura: et cura ipsam, donec sanetur.	 If the crack is wide: Then sew it up with suture; and care for it until it heals.
Et si est parua, non superueniet tibi malum ex ea.	 And if it is small, no harm will come to you from it.
Vnguentum enim restaurat ipsam, et incarnat eam.	 Oil indeed restores it and fills (or heals) it.
Et si grando est decliuis ad interiora auris uersus superficiem intrinsecam, tunc inuersa palpebram, et suspende grandinem cum uncino: praeter quod indigeas incisione, et preme eam ab omni parte.	 And if the grain is turned towards the inside of the ear and faces the inner surface, then turn the eyelid inside out, hang the grain with a hook; beyond that, you will need an incision, and press it from every side.
Quod si elongatur palpebra per incisionem, non nocet illud in aliquo.	 If the eyelid is stretched by an incision, then no harm will come to you from it.
Deinde ablue oculum post incisionem grandinis, cum aqua salsa: et cura locum cum eo quod incarnat, donec sanetur infirmus.	 Then wash the eye after the removal of the grain with salt water; and care for the place with it so that it heals, until the weak one is healed.

Axirnath est adeps qui generatur in tunicis palpebrae superioris: et plurimum quidem accidit illud pueris: et ipsum grauat oculos eorum, et accidunt eis catarri in matutinis, et non possunt intueri lumen solis, propterea, quod lachrymae properant ad eos, et propter illud uides eos discumbere super facies suas semper, et super eas dormiunt, et sunt palpebrae eorum sub superciliis humidae, quas iam cooperuit inflatio: et eminentia quidem Axirnath apparens est oculo, et quando tu premis locum cum digitis tuis, sentis Axirnath inter eos.	 Chapter X. On the care of eyelids. Axirnath is a crust that is generated in the upper eyelid; and it mostly happens to children; and it weighs down their eyes, and they get cataracts at dawn, and they cannot see the light of the sun, because tears flow towards them, and therefore you see them always lying on their faces, and on these they sleep, and their eyelids are always wet under the eyebrows, which have already swollen; and indeed, the appearance of Axirnath is visible to the eye, and when you press the place with your fingers, you feel Axirnath among them.
Et modus operationis eius est, ut ponat infirmus caput suum in sinu tuo.	 The method of his operation is that the sick man places his head in your bosom.
Deinde accipe pannum lini, et praepara in eo licinia, et fac ex illo licinio circulum secundum quantitatem quod continet Axirnath ab omni parte.	 Then take a piece of clean cloth and prepare a bandage on it. And make from this cloth a circle according to the size that contains Axirnath in all parts.
Deinde pone eum super eam, et preme cum digitis tuis ab omni parte, ut aggregetur Axirnath in medio circuli.	 Place it on top of it and press with your fingers from all sides, so that Axirnath is gathered in the middle of the circle.
Deinde finde in medio illius humiditatis cum spatumili incidente fissuras per latitudinem, et non sit fissura maior illa quae fit in phlebotomia in profundo.	 Then find in its center the moisture with a spathule penetrating fissures through its length, and let the fissure not be larger than that which occurs in phlebotomy in depth.
Aut oportet ut findas cutem totam, donec peruenias ad Axirnath in pluribus enim dispositionibus procedit Axirnath ex fissura secundum formam frusti pinguedinis albae.	 Or it is necessary that you find the entire skin until you reach Axirnath, for in many positions Axirnath comes out from the fissure according to the shape of a white butterfly's wing.
Extrahe ergo eam cum panno, quem infiltrasti inter digitos tuos ad exteriora: et tu reuoluis manum tuam ad dextram et sinistram, donec dispergatur: et caue, ne addas in fissura, ut non peruenias cum spatumili ad oculum, et laedas eum.	 Therefore extract it with the cloth which you have soaked between your fingers to the outside. And you turn your hand to the right and left until it is dispersed, and be careful not to add in the fissure, lest you come with a spathule to the eye, and injure it.
Si autem non appareat tibi Axirnath in principio fissurae, tu addas in fissura parum cum facilitate, donec procedat Axirnath.	 If, however, Axirnath does not appear to you at the beginning of the fissure, you shall add a little in the fissure with ease, until Axirnath comes forth.
Deinde extrahe eam, sicut diximus.	 Then extract it as we have said.
Deinde submerge pannos in aceto et aqua, et pone eos super locum, et stringe eum cum puluillis.	 Then immerse the cloths in vinegar and water, and place them on the site, and bind it with small stones.
Et ex hominibus sunt qui terunt salem, et ponunt ipsum in concauitate fissurae, ut liquefiat quod remansit ex illa humiditate.	 And among men there are those who grind salt and put it into the hollow of the fissure to dissolve what remains from that moisture.
Deinde cura ipsam, donec sanetur.	 Then care for it until it heals.
Si autem accidat in loco apostema calidum, tune cura ipsum cum emplastris sedatiuis, donec sanetur.	 If, however, an abscess hot occurs at the site, then care for it with soothing plasters until it heals.
¶ De modis Ataxmir oculi, id est, cum palpebra mollificatur oculi, unde fit ut rugetur sicut non debet.	 On the ways of the weakened eye, that is, when the eyelid becomes soft and it weeps as it should not.
Caput XI.	 Chapter XI.
Quando nascuntur in palpebris oculi pili additi praeter cursum sub pilis naturalibus, et antiquantur: tunc ipsi nocent oculo, et faciunt accidere modos aegritudinum, sicut lachrymas assiduas, et mollificationem palpebrarum, et albuginem, donec fit illud caussa destructionis oculi.	 When hairs grow in the eyelids beyond the normal course of natural hair growth and turn grey: then they harm the eye and cause illnesses such as constant weeping, softening of the eyelids, white spots (albuginea), until it leads to the destruction of the eye.
Et Ataxmir quidem oculi curatur secundum quatuor modos.	 And indeed the weakened eye is treated according to four methods.
Aut per cauterium cum igne.	 Or by cautery with fire.
Aut cum medicina acuta, secundum quod praemissum est in capitulo cauterii.	 Or with sharp medicine, according to what was mentioned in the chapter on cautery.
Aut curatur Ataxmir per incisionem et suturam.	 Or the weakened eye is treated by incision and stitching.
Aut per cannas, secundum quod ego dicam.	 Or with reeds, according to what I shall say (i.e., as described in the following text).
Oportet ut ponas caput infirmi in sinu tuo.	 The head of the weakened eye should be placed in your lap.
Deinde conuerte palpebram oculi manu tua sinistra.	 Then turn the eyelid of the eye with your left hand.
Si ergo conuertitur, bonum est.	 If it is turned (i.e., if the eyelid can be moved), that is good. If not, move the other eye so
Et si non: intromitte acum in eam, in qua sit filum ab inferiori parte palpebrae, et fac penetrare acum cum filo desuper, et sit illud prope pilos ipsos, id est, prope marginem palpebrae, in quo nascuntur pili: et trahe filum ad superiora cum palpebra, et conuerte eam cum radio.	 and if it cannot be moved, insert the point into it (i.e., the eyelid), where there is a thread below the lower part of the eyelid, and let the point penetrate through the thread from above, so that it is close to the hairs themselves, that is, near the edge of the eyelid, where the hairs grow: and pull the thread towards the upper part of the eyelid, and turn it with a spatula.
Deinde finde in interiori parte palpebrae sub pilis additis cum spatumili incidente a lachrymali maiore usque ad lachrymale minus.	 Then find in the inner part of the eyelid, below the additional hairs, with the spatula penetrating from the greater tear duct to the lesser tear duct (i.e., across the eyelid).
Deinde extrahe filum, et pone sub palpebra puluillum paruum ex cotto, aut panno: deinde signa super palpebram cum encaustro, quod sit sicut figura folii myrti.	 Then pull out the thread, and place a small ball of wool or cloth under the eyelid; then mark the eyelid with hot wax, as if in the shape of a myrtle leaf (i.e., making a dot).
Verumtamen oportet, ut fit figura secundum quantitatem et eleuationem palpebrae: quoniam iam diuersificatur illud in hominibus.	 It is necessary that the figure be made according to the size and elevation of the eyelid; since it varies greatly among men.
Ex eis enim est, qui indiget ut incidatur ex palpebra quantitas magna, secundum quantitatem quae mollificatur a palpebra.	 From these [cases], there are those who need to be cut according to the large size of the eyelid, according to the softening that occurs in it.
Deinde cum spatumili finde super duas lineas quas signasti, et incipe a lachrymali maiore usque ad lachrymale minus, et sit fissura una prope pilos naturales, sicut est grossitudo radii.	 Then, when you find the space between two lines which you marked, and begin from the greater lacrimal [canal] to the lesser one, and let there be a cleft nearby the natural hairs, as in the thickness of a radius.
Deinde intromitte uncinum in uno duorum angulorum cutis.	 Then insert the hook into one of the two angles of the skin.
Deinde excoria ipsam totam.	 Then scrape it all [the area].
Deinde aggrega cum sutura duo labia, cum acu et filo lana subtili: et absterge sanguinem, et fac adhaerere quod superfluit ex filis super duo supercilia, cum quibusdam rebus inuiscantibus, si uis facere illud: et si non, non cures.	 Then sew together the two lips with thread and a fine needle of wool; remove the blood and make the excess from the threads adhere to the eyebrows, if you wish to do so; otherwise, do not care for it.
Deinde dimitte suturam et fila usque ad tres dies, aut quatuor: postea cura illud.	 Then release the suture and the threads for three or four days; afterwards, take care of it.
Et si uis, dimitte uulnus absque sutura, et cura ipsum cum eo, quod exsiccat et constringit.	 And if you wish, let the wound heal without stitching, and take care of it as it dries and contracts.
Nam palpebra eleuatur apud sigillationem uulneris et aggregationem eius: sed futura est melior.	 Since the eyelid is elevated during the sealing of the wound and its suturing, but it will be better in the future.
Hunc modum curandi Ataxmir docuerunt antiqui.	 This method of healing was taught by the ancients (Atrebas).
Verumtamen in eo est sollicitudo super infirmum, et est ex bona operatione, et non est in eo timor.	 However, there is concern about the patient in this method, and it is from a good procedure, but there is no fear in it.
Et modus alius est in Ataxmir etiam: et est, ut signes super palpebram figuram, quae sit sicut figura folii myrti, sicut narrauimus.	 And another method is also found in Atrebas: it is to mark a figure on the eyelid like the shape of a myrtle leaf, as we have said before.
Deinde eleua palpebram cum tribus uncinis separatis, aut aggregatis, secundum formam hanc quae sequitur, deinde incide quod superfluit cum forficibus paruis, secundum hanc formam, cum aequalitate incisionis.	 Then elevate the eyelid with three separated or combined hooks according to the following shape, then cut off what is excessive with small scissors according to this shape, with equal cuts.
Si autem non est tibi possibile tenere uncinum, et non aequatur illud: tunc accipe acum in qua sit filum, et intromitte ipsum in medio figurae: et intromitte filum aliud prope lachrymale maius, et filum secundum prope lachrymale minus: et aggrega inter digitos tuos fila cum aequalitate.	 If it is not possible for you to hold the hook, and it does not match that [description]: then take a probe with thread, and insert it into the middle of the figure; and insert another thread near the larger tear, and insert a second thread near the smaller tear; and gather the threads equally between your fingers.
Deinde eleua manum tuam eleuatione aequali: et eleua cutem super quam est signatum cotum, sicut narrauimus.	 Then move your hand evenly with equal elevation; and raise the skin over which the incision is marked, as we have said.
Deinde aggrega duo labia uulneris cum sutura: et cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	 Then gather together the two edges of the wound with a stitch; and care for it until it heals.
Si uero accidat apostema apud incisionem tuam, aut fissuram tuam: seda illud apostema cum caeroto, et his similibus, ex unguentis sedantibus.	 If, however, an abscess occurs at your incision or tear: sew the abscess with linen and similar materials from ointments that soothe.
Et quandoque accidit palpebrae etiam, ut conuertantur pili eius.	 And sometimes even eyelashes may turn over.
Oportet ergo ut utaris in ea quod diximus in incisione: sed sutura utrisque magis est artificialis.	 Therefore, you must use the method that I have said for the incision; but stitching is more artificial [requires greater skill].
¶ De cura Ataxmir cum cannis.	 [Section] On the care of the axilla with dogs.
ET Est, ut conuertas palpebram, et scindas fissuram quae est deintus, secundum quod narraui.	 And it should be turned over that eyelash, and you should make an incision in the tear that is inside, as I have said.
Deinde arte fac duas cannas, aut duo ligna subtilia: quarum longitudo sit secundum longitudinem palpebrae, et latitudo earum sit minor latitudine spatumilis: et tu iam incidisti in extremitatibus utriusque ab utrisque partibus ubi tenes fila.	 Then make two dogs or two thin sticks of the same length as that of the eyelid, and their width shall be less than that of a thumbnail; and you have already made an incision at both ends on both sides where you hold the threads.
Deinde aggrega utramque cum subtilitate super illud quod superfluit ex palpebra oculi, et stringe duas cannas ab utrisque partibus strictura forti, et dimitte eam diebus aliquot.	 Then gather both together with delicacy on top of the excess skin from the eyelid, and stitch the two sticks tightly on either side with a strong suture, and leave it for several days.
Cutis enim stricta morietur, et denigrabitur, et putrefiet, donec cadet per se.	 For a constricted skin will die and darken and rot until it falls away by itself.
Si ergo tardatur, tunc incide eam cum forficibus.	 If it is delayed [in healing], then cut it with scissors.
Deinde cura eam, donec sanetur.	 Then take care of her, until she gets well.
Cum ergo consolidatur, eleuatur palpebra: et non pungunt pili.	 When it solidifies, raise the eyelid; do not pluck the hairs.
Et haec est forma duarum cannarum, quas facies secundum hanc figuram, et quantitatem in longitudinem et latitudinem.	 And this is the shape of two scoops, which you should make according to this figure, and their length and width.
¶ De eleuatione pilorum pungentium in oculo cum acu.	 On plucking hairs sticking in the eye with a needle.
Caput XII.	 Chapter 12.
Operatio in illo est, ut accipias acum subtilem, et intromittas in eam filum ex serico subtile, lene.	 The operation is to take a sharp thin needle and insert a fine silk thread gently into it.
Deinde aggreges extremitates eius, et nodes utramque nodo subtili ualde: et sit longitudo filorum palmus unus.	 Then tie the ends of it and knot them both with a very thin knot; let the length of the threads be one palm (about 5 inches).
Deinde compone in Alinxotati filum aliud subtile sub eo in breui, et noda extremitates eius si uis.	 Then prepare another fine thread under it briefly and knot its ends if you wish.
Deinde ponat infirmus caput suum in sinu tuo, et sit prope solem ut declaretur operatio: quoniam est operatio subtilis, uel minuta.	 Then the sick person should place his head in your lap and be near the sun so that the operation may be seen; because this is a delicate or minor operation.
Deinde intromitte acum cum alinxotati in radicem palpebrae, et fac eam penetrare in palpebram festinanter, donec extrahas eam desuper pilum naturalem.	 Then insert the needle with the silk thread into the root of the eyelid and make it penetrate the eyelid quickly until you draw out the natural hair from above.
Deinde trahe pilum usque supra alinxotati: et intromitte in alinxotati illum pilum: si est unus, aut duo, aut tres, non plures.	 Then pull out the hair over the silk thread; and insert the hair into the silk thread; if it is one, or two, or three, do not more than that.
Deinde trahe manum tuam cum eo, donec egrediatur pilus cum alinxotati in palpebra cum pilo naturali.	 Then pull your hand with it until the hair comes out with the silk thread from the eyelid along with the natural hair.
Si autem trahatur alinxotati, et non egrediatur pilus cum ea: trahes alinxotati ad inferiora, cum filo quod tu composuisti in ea, donec egrediatur alinxotati ex foramine superiori, et uideas eam uisione oculi: tunc enim trahes alinxotati, et filum: et extrahe utraque, et claude oculum: et dimitte ipsum clausum duobus diebus, aut tribus, donec adhaereat pilus loco suo, et nascatur super ipsum caro.	 If, however, the silk thread is pulled out and the hair does not come out with it; pull the silk thread downwards with the thread you have prepared in it, until the silk thread comes out from the upper opening, and you see it with the eye; then pull the silk thread and the thread, and extract both, and close the eye; and leave the closed one for two or three days, until the hair adheres to its place, and a flesh grows over it.
Quod si pilus est breuis, tunc aut associa ei pilum longum ex pilis naturalibus, et eleuatur cum eo: aut dimitte ipsum, donec elongetur post spacium, et tunc eleua ipsum.	 If the hair is short, then either combine it with a long hair from natural hairs and lift it together; or leave it until it grows out some space, and then lift it.
¶ De cura Alxatrati quae accidit in palpebra superiori.	 On the treatment of Alzheimer's occurring in the upper eyelid.
Caput XIII.	 Chapter Thirteen.
Quando accidit oculo haec Alxatrati, nominatur Leporina.	 When this Alzheimer's occurs in the eye, it is called Leporina.
Et haec Alxatrati est aut naturalis, aut accidentalis.	 And this Alzheimer's can be either natural or accidental.
Accidentalis ergo fit ex consolidatione uulneris, aut sectionis, aut cauterii, et similium illis.	 Therefore, it becomes accidental from the congelation of wounds, cuts, burns, and similar things.
Et modus operationis in ea est, ut tu findas illam consolidationem, et ut separes labia eius, et ponas in eo quod est inter ea licinium ex lino, et liges eam, donec sanetur.	 The method of treatment is to find that congelation and to separate the lips of it, and to place a linen cloth between them and tie it until it heals.
Et non oportet, ut utaris in curatione eius rebus quae exiccant et constringunt: nam si tu facis illud, redit Alxatrati deterior quam fuit: imo utere in ea rebus quae mollificant, sicut foenumgraecum: et embroca cum aqua, in qua cocta sit althea, semen lini: et unguento dyaquilon, quod liquefactum sit cum aliquo ex oleis: et inuolue cum eo licinium, et cura cum eo.	 It is not necessary to use in its treatment things that dry and constrict; for if you do so, the Alzheimer's worsens rather than heals: but rather use softening things, such as flaxseed oil; and a syrup made with vinegar, in which althea has been cooked, along with flax seeds; and an ointment of dyaquilon, which has been melted with some oil; and apply a cloth soaked in it, and treat it with it.
Et thesaurus curationis tuae est, ut coneris omni ingenio, ut non consolidetur, secundum formam quae fuit in primis.	 And the storehouse of your treatment is to make every effort not for it to become congeled again, according to its original shape.
Et haec quidem operatio quam diximus, non est nisi quaedam rectificatio Alxatrati, ut non redeat forma loci secundum quod fuit omnino.	 Indeed, the operation that we have mentioned is nothing but a correction of Alzheimer's, so that it does not return to its original shape.
¶ De cura Alxatrati quae fit in palpebra inferiori, et est rugatio uel contractio sursum ad dextrum et sinistrum.	 On the treatment of Alzheimer's occurring in the lower eyelid, which is a swelling or contraction upward towards right and left.
Caput XIIII.	 Chapter Fourteen.
Haec Alxatrati quae fit inferius, est quae uere nominatur Alxatrati.	 The Alzheimer's occurring below is the one that is truly called Alzheimer's.
Et est naturalis, et est accidentalis.	 And it is natural, and it is accidental.
Et accidentalis fit ex uulnere, aut fissura, aut cauterio, et illis similibus.	 From wound, or fissure, or cautery, and similar things, it becomes accidental.
Et uia operationis in ea est, ut accipias acum, in qua sit filum duplum, et tingas eam in carnem, et facias eam penetrare a lachrymali sinistro usque ad lachrymale dextrum, donec perueniat filum in duabus extremitatibus carnis.	 The method of operation in this is that you take the needle, which should have a double thread, and moisten it with flesh, and make it pass from the left tear duct to the right tear duct until the thread reaches the two ends of the skin.
Deinde extende carnem ad superiora cum acu, et incide eam cum spatumili lato.	 Then stretch the skin upwards with a needle and cut it with a flat knife.
Si ergo redit figura palpebrae secundum quod oportet, est bonum.	 If therefore the shape of the eyelid returns as required, it is good.
Et si non, accipe radium, et pone ipsum in fissuram, et conuerte cum eo palpebram: et finde duas fissuras in latere interiore palpebrae, et sint extremitates duarum fissurarum ex duobus angulis incisionis, donec concurrant et fiat ex eis angulus: donec quando aggregantur fiat figura earum haec figura, et est litera lauda graeca.	 And if it does not, take the probe, and put it into the fissure, and turn the eyelid along with it; and cut two fissures on the inner side of the eyelid, and their ends should be from the two corners of the incision, until they converge and form an angle: until when they join together, this shape is formed, and it is a laudable Greek letter.
Deinde aufer illam carnem per quantitatem, quod est latus eius acutum inferius, ab eo quod sequitur palpebram.	 Then remove that skin to the extent of its lower sharp part, following the eyelid.
Deinde aggrega partes separatas: sue eam cum filo lanae.	 Then bring together the separated parts: or bind them with a wool thread.
Deinde cura eas cum eo quod diximus, de medicinis mollificantibus, et liciniis, donec sanentur.	 Then care for those (parts) with what I said, from soothing medicines and linens, until they heal.
Et si Alxatrati accidat ex fissura, et sutura, aut cauterio: tunc oportet ut findas fissura plana sub pilis palpebrarum, etiam secundum quod praecessit.	 If al-Khater occurs from the fissure, and suture, or cautery: then it is necessary to cut a flat scar under the eyelashes, even as before.
Deinde separa inter duo labia cum licinio, secundum quod diximus.	 Then separate between two lips with a linen cloth, as I said.
Et summa sermonis de cura Alxatrati, quando est desuper, aut inferius, est, ut currat in ea operatio, secundum quod praeparatur ex forma Alxatrati.	 The summary of the discourse on the care of al-Khater, whether it is above or below, is that the operation should be carried out on it according to the preparation for the shape of al-Khater.
Ipsa namque est multarum diuersitatum in forma: et artifex prudens praeparat ingenium cum quocunque modo est possibile ei, donec redire faciat figuram ad formam naturalem, aut prope eam, et ipsemet infirmus, secundum quod conuenit ei ex operatione et instrumentis in plurimis dispositionibus.	 The artisan, being prudent, prepares his skill with whatever method is possible for him, until he makes the figure return to a natural form or one that is close to it, and himself being ill, according to what suits him from the operation and instruments in many dispositions.
¶ De adhaerentia palpebrae oculi cum coniunctiua, aut cornea.	 On the adhesion of the eyelid with conjunctiva, or cornea.
Caput XV.	 Chapter XV.
Quandoque accidit haec consolidatio multis hominibus, ita ut consolidetur palpebra superior cum albedine oculi, et prohibeat ipsum ab operationibus suis naturalibus.	 Sometimes this consolidation happens to many people, so that the upper eyelid adheres to the white of the eye and prevents it from performing its natural functions.
Oportet ergo quod intromittas extremitatem radii sub palpebra, et eleues eam sursum: aut extendas eam cum uncino: deinde incide adhaerentiam cum spatumili subtili, quod non sit cum acuitate incisionis spatumilium, imo sit obtusum parumper: ut non inquietetur infirmus apud operationem, et remoueatur spatumile, et laedat oculum cum acuitate sua: et sit incisio tua quasi tu excories illam adhaerentiam cum facilitate, donec quando redit palpebra secundum formam suam naturalem, et sanetur adhaerentia tota.	 Therefore, it is necessary that you insert the end of a radius under the eyelid and lift it up; or stretch it with a hook; then cut the adhesion with a subtle spatula, not with the sharpness of spatulas, but slightly blunted; so as not to disturb the sick person during the operation, and remove the spatula, and harm the eye with its sharpness; and let your incision be like you are excoriating that adhesion easily, until when the eyelid returns to its natural form, and the adhesion is healed completely.
Funde tunc in oculum aquam salsam, cum aqua ablue ipsum: aut distilla in ipsum ex sief facto, ex ziniar dissoluto cum aqua.	 Then pour salty water into the eye and rinse it; or drip it onto him from seives made of linen soaked with water.
Deinde separa inter palpebram et oculum cum licinio lini: et pone super oculum lanam infusam cum albugine oui: et post diem tertium utere sief, et cum solidatiuis, donec sanetur.	 Then separate between the eyelid and the eye with a linen cloth; and place wool soaked with white of egg on the eye; and use seives made of linen and solidified materials for three days until it is healed.
¶ De incisione ungulae et eminentiae carnis lachrymarum.	 On the incision of nails and protrusions of skin around the eyes.
Caput XVI.	 Chapter XVI.
Scias, quod ungula est secundum duos modos.	 You should know that a nail is according to two modes.
Aut est neruosa: et est similis sifac duro, subtili.	 Or is nerve-like: and it is similar to the hoof, tough, delicate.
Aut est non neruosa, similis humiditati congelatae albae: quae quando tangit cam ferrum, aut conaris capere eam cum uncino, abscinditur, et non figitur in ea uncinus.	 Or is not nerve-like, similar to frozen white moisture: which, when touched with iron, or when you try to grasp it with a nail, it breaks off and the nail does not take hold of it.
Et utraeque species non incipiunt, nisi a lachrymali maiore, usquequo uadit paulatim, donec cooperit uisum, et prohibet lumen, et motum oculi.	 And both kinds do not begin, unless from the greater tear, until it slowly approaches the sight, and stops the light, and hinders the movement of the eye.
Et modus operandi in incisione eius est: ut ponat infirmus caput suum in sinu tuo.	 And the method of operation for cutting it is: that the weak one places his head in your armpit.
Deinde aperi oculos eius, et eleua palpebram manu tua.	 Then open the eyes of the one, and lift the eyelid with your hand.
Deinde collige ungulam cum uncino paucae duplationis, et extende eam ad superiora.	 Then grasp the nail with a pair of nails and extend it upwards.
Deinde accipe acum, et intromitte in eam pilum ex pilis equi, et bouis, aut uaccae: et sit filum forte, et duplica extremitatem acus parumper, et fige eam in medio ungulae: et penetra eam cum acu, et liga cum filo ungulam, et extende eam ad superiora: et excoria cum pilo latus ungulae quod sequitur pupillam, ac si tu serres eam cum pilo usque ad postreimnum eius.	 Then take the awl and insert it into her with a horse hair or oxen or sheep hair; let it be a thread, and bend the tip of the needle slightly, and pierce it in the middle of the nail and sew the nail with the thread and extend it upwards; and scrape with the hair the side of the nail following the pupil, as if you are squeezing it with the hair until the end of its socket.
Deinde incide residuum in radice lachrymalis cum spatumili subtili, aut cum forficibus paruis: et dimitte carnem lachrymalis naturalem, ut non accidat ex incisione eius cursus lachrymarum assiduus.	 Then cut the remaining part in the root of the tear with a thin spatula or small forks; and let the natural flesh of the tear escape, so that it does not happen from the cutting of it a constant flow of tears.
Et quandoque extenditur ungula cum uncino solo: aut cum filo, sicut diximus.	 And sometimes the nail is extended with the nail alone; or with the thread, as we have said.
Deinde excoriatur cum spatumili leni, cuius haec est forma.	 Then it is scraped with a soft spatula in this form:
Et caue, ne tangat spatumile tunicam corneam, et accidat in ea ruptura, et perforetur pupilla.	 And beware that the spatula does not touch the corn layer and causes a crack in it and pierces the pupil.
Deinde post incisionem, proice in oculum aliquid salis contriti, aut ex sief facto ex ziniar, et dimitte ipsum usque ad diem alium.	 After the incision, throw something crushed salt into the eye, or made from zinc, and leave it for another day.
Deinde cura ipsum cum eo quod oportet, usquequo sanetur.	 Then take care of it as necessary, until it heals.
Quod si ungula est non neruosa, et non potes intromittere in eam acum, neque figitur in ea uncinus, tunc multotiens curatur haec species ungulae cum medicinis, et sanatur sicut narraui in diuisione.	 If the nail is not nerve-rich and you cannot insert a probe into it nor set a wedge under it, then this type of nail should be repeatedly treated with these remedies and healed as I described in the division.
Quod si uis incidere eam, tunc aperi oculum infirmi, et accipe spatumile subtile, lene, debilis acuitatis, secundum hanc formam.	 If you want to cut it (the nail), then open the eye of the patient and take a fine, soft, weakly sharpened probe, shaped like this.
Et rade ungulam desuper rasione cum subtilitate.	 And file the nail from above with fineness.
Quod si uides quod ipsa rarificatur et confringitur, et imprimit in eam rasio, tunc distilla ex hora tua in oculum ex sief facto ex ziniar, aut ex sief rubeo, aut sale trito: et opila oculum usque ad diem alium.	 If you see that it is becoming rough and breaks, and if you grind it with the file, then distill hour by hour from zinc made from zinc ore or red pigment, or ground salt into the eye until another day.
Deinde itera super ipsam operationem, donec remoueatur totum eius.	 Then repeat this procedure until the whole thing is removed.
Nisi contrarium sit tibi in oculo apostema calidum: tunc enim dimitte ipsam, et cura apostema, donec sanetur.	 Unless it is a hot abscess in the eye: then leave it alone and treat the abscess until it heals.
Deinde itera operationem super ipsam cum rasione, donec sanetur.	 Then repeat this procedure on it with a file until it heals.
Eminentia autem carnis lachrymalis, si nocet in oculo nocumento magno, suspendatur cum uncino, et incide ex ea partem eius: et non ultimes incisionem, ut non accidat cursus lachrymarum.	 But if the growth of flesh near the tear duct is harmful to the eye and causes great injury, it should be suspended with a wedge, and cut off that part of it; not at the end, so as not to interfere with the flow of tears.
Deinde stilla in lachrymale sief rubeum, aut factum ex ziniari, donec sanetur.	 Then distill red pigment or zinc made from zinc ore into the tear duct until it heals.
¶ De incisione Alguardenic, et carne nata in oculo.	 Chapter on Albucasis' incision and tissue born in the eye.
Caput XVII.	 Chapter XVII.
Nascitur quandoque in quibusdam oculis hominum caro rubea composita, uel superposita, donec cooperit pupillam, aut appropinquat, aut stringit super palpebras, et fortasse conuertit palpebras ad exteriora: et assimilatur rosae balaustinae.	 A red mass composed or placed on certain human eyes is sometimes born, which covers the pupil, approaches it, presses against the eyelids, and perhaps turns the eyelids outward; resembling a rose bush.
Et operatio in ea etiam est, ut ponat infirmus caput suum in sinu tuo.	 And there is also an operation for placing the sick person's head in your armpit.
Deinde aperi oculos eius, et collige illam carnem totam cum uncinis conuenientibus ad illud: et tene illud cum forcipe uno, aut gesti.	 Then open the eyes and collect all the tissue with suitable forceps; hold it with one forceps or a clamp.
Deinde incide carnem in primis, donec finiatur totum eius cum incisorio.	 Then cut the flesh first until it is completely finished with the scalpel.
Et caue ab oculo, ut non laedas ipsum apud operationem: et sit incisio tua qua ipsam incidis, aut cum spatumili, quod narrauimus in incisione ungulae: aut cum forficibus paruis, cum quibus colligitur asebel, secundum quod ueniet forma eius post hoc capitulum.	 Be careful not to injure the eye during the operation; make your cut such that you cut the flesh only, or with a spatula as we described in the chapter on the nail incision, or with small forceps, as used for collecting asbestos, according to the shape it will have after this chapter.
Cum ergo completur incisio tua, et remouetur tota alguardenici, tunc imple oculum ex sale contrito: aut distilla in eum puluerem rubeum, et similia illi ex medicinis corrosiuis: et pone super oculum deforis cottum cum albugine oui: ut securetur ab apostemate calido.	 When your cut is completed and all the alguardenici (fatty tissue) has been removed, then fill the eye with salt powder, or drip red powder or similar corrosive medicines into it; place over the outside of the eye a piece of cotton with white of the egg: to protect it from a hot infection.
Quod si remanet ex alguardenici aliquid, et dominatur tibi sanguis calidus, et times apostema calidum: tunc dimitte oculum, et cura ipsum cum eo quod sedat apostema.	 If there remains some alguardenici or if you have a hot bleeding, and you fear a hot infection, then leave the eye alone, and treat it with whatever soothes an abscess.
Deinde itera super ipsum cum operatione, donec sanetur.	 Then repeat the operation over it until it heals.
Et similiter fac cum carne addita quae accidit in oculo ex hac specie.	 And do similarly with the flesh that occurs in the eye of this kind.
Verumtamen oportet, ut alienes curationem omnis oculi debilis ex uia naturali, aut ex uia accidentali, operando cum ferro: et non intromittas manum tuam in aliqua harum operationum, donec uideas, quod illud membrum est tolerans illam operationem.	 Nevertheless, it is necessary to let strangers treat any weak eye from a natural or accidental way, by working with iron; do not insert your hand into any of these operations until you see that the limb can bear this operation.
¶ De collectione Sebel ex oculo.	 Chapter on collecting asbestos from the eye.
Caput XVIII.	 Chapter XVIII.
Sebel sunt uenae rubeae quae texuntur super oculum, et prohibent uisui operationem suam: et debilitant oculum cum longitudine dierum.	 Asbestos are red veins that cover the eye and prevent the operation from being seen; they weaken the eye with the passing of days.
Necesse est ergo tibi in primis, ut consideres, si oculus in quo est Sebel, est fortis, et non est in eo aegritudo aliqua, praeter Sebel: tunc collige Sebel eius.	 It is necessary for you, firstly, to consider whether the eye where Sebel is, is strong, and if there is no illness in it besides Sebel; then gather Sebel from it.
Et est, ut praecipias infirmo, ut ponat caput suum in sinu tuo.	 And you should instruct the weak to place their head in your lap.
Deinde suspende illas uenas cum uncino uno, aut duobus secundum prudentiam tuam: et sit uncinus subtilis duplationis, secundum hanc formam, aut sint duo uncini gradat in corpore uno, secundum hanc formam.	 Then suspend those veins with one or two needles according to your discretion; let the needle be subtle and doubled in this shape, or let there be two needles graduated in the same body according to this shape.
Deinde collige cum forficibus subtilibus illas uenas cum subtilitate, et absterge sanguinem hora post horam, donec uideas illas uenas remoueri ex oculo, et resoluuntur: et caue ne laedas oculum cum extremitatibus spatumilis.	 Then collect those veins with subtle forceps and remove the blood by the hour; until you see those veins separated from the eye and resolved; take care not to harm the eye with the ends of the forceps.
Et sit operatio tua in meridie coram sole, et sis firmus in operatione tua ualde: ut non incidas nisi illas uenas.	 Let your work be at midday before the sun, and let you be very firm during your operation; so that you do not cut except those veins.
Et cum tu expleueris, tunc distilla in oculum sief uiride, aut rubeum: ut sua acuitate corrodat quod remansit ex sebel.	 And when you have finished, then distill into the eye either green or red; so that its acidity may corrode what remains of Sebel.
Si autem non est tibi possibile colligere illud totum in illa hora, tunc emplastra oculum cum eo, quod sedat dolorem oculi: et dimitte ipsum diebus aliquot, donec sedetur dolor eius: et securetur ab apostemate calido: deinde itera super ipsum secundum modum eundem, donec sanetur.	 If however it is not possible for you to collect all of it in that hour, then plaster the eye with it, which relieves the pain of the eye; and leave it for some days until the pain subsides; and secure it with warm compresses; then repeat over it according to the same method until it heals.
Et haec est forma forficis.	 And this is the form of the forceps.
¶ De reductione Arissati ad nasum.	 Chapter on the reduction of Arissatum to the nose.
Caput XIX.	 Chapter XIX.
Nominant medici Arissati Fistulam, quam curas cum cauterio, aut cum medicina acuta comburente, secundum quod praecessit eius narratio.	 The physician Arisatha treats a Fistula, which he cures with a cautionery or with a medicine burning sharply, according to the narrative that preceded it.
Et si non sanatur, tunc non est ingenium in ea: nisi ut findas super apostema apud natiuitatem eius, et extrahas totam humiditatem quae est in eo et pus, donec detegatur os.	 And if it does not heal, then there is no skill in it; except that you may incise above the abscess at its birthplace, and extract all moisture that is in it and pus, until the bone appears.
Cum ergo detegitur os, et uides in eo corruptionem, aut nigredinem, tunc rade ipsum cum instrumento, cuius forma est haec.	 When therefore the bone appears, and you see in it corruption or blackness, then grind it with this instrument, whose form is as follows:
Et nominatur Asperi capitis.	 And it is called Asperi Capitis (Head Grinder).
Fiat ex ferro indo, et sit caput eius rotundum sicut azir, quod sit punctatum punctatione limae, aut punctatione aliskilferi punctatione subtili: et pone ipsum super locum corruptum ossis.	 Make it from iron indo, and let its head be round like an azir, which is pierced with the marking of a file, or the piercing of aliskilfer with its subtle piercing; and place it over the corrupted bone.
Deinde reuolue ipsum inter digitos tuos, et tu preme manum tuam parumper, donec scias quod illa corruptio iam rasa est: et fac illud aliquotiens.	 Then turn it with your fingers, and you press your hand slightly, until you know that the corruption is already ground down; and do this several times.
Deinde restaura locum cum medicinis exiccatiuis stipticis.	 Then restore the place with the most astringent ointments.
Si ergo consolidatur locus, et nascitur in eo caro, et abscinditur cursus saniei: et remanet quadraginta diebus, et non renouatur, et non apostematur, et non accidit in eo accidens: tunc scias quia iam sanatus est.	 If the place consolidates, and flesh grows there, and the flow of pus is cut off; and it remains for forty days, and is not renewed, and there is no abscess, and no accident occurs in it; then you know that it has been healed.
Et si non, tunc non est in eo ingenium, nisi reducere fistulam ad foramen nasi, secundum hanc formam.	 And if not, then there is no skill in it, except to reduce the fistula to the opening of the nose, according to this shape:
Et est, ut detegas ab osse secundo cum ferro, aut cum medicina acuta: et cum detectum est os, tunc accipe terebrum secundum hanc formam, sit extremitas ferrea, triangulata: et lignum eius sit pyramis extenuata usque ad extremitatem, sicut uides.	 And it is, to expose the bone of the second with iron, or with a sharp medicine; and when the bone has been exposed, then take a trepan according to this shape, with an iron end, triangular: and the handle of it should be a pyramid extended until the end, as you see.
Deinde pone illud super os ipsum: et sit illud prope lachrymale: et elonga manum tuam ab oculo parum.	 Then place it on the bone itself; and let it be near the tear duct: and extend your hand slightly away from the eye.
Deinde reuolue manum tuam cum terebro, donec penetret os, et sentiat illud infirmus: per hoc quod inuenit uentum exire ex eo, quando tenet manum suam super nasum suum.	 Then turn your hand with the lancet until it penetrates the bone and feels weak; by this you will find air coming out of it when you hold your hand over his nose.
Ergo tunc restaura locum cum medicinis stipticis exiccantibus, sicut docui te.	 Then restore the place with healing ointments drying up, as I have taught you.
Cum ergo nascitur caro, et induratur locus: tunc materia quae effundebatur ad exteriora, redit ad nasum: est ergo leuius illud super infirmum.	 When the flesh is born and the place hardens; then that which was flowing out to the outside returns to the nose; it is therefore lighter over the weak.
¶ De reductione eminentiae Oculi.	 Chapter on the reduction of eyelid swelling.
Caput XX.	 Chapter XX (twenty).
Quando eminet Oculus cum totalitate sua, et non accidit in uisu nocumentum, neque diminutio: tunc oportet ut soluas infirmum: deinde phlebotomes eum: postea ponas uentosas in ceruice absque scarificatione, sed cum suctione.	 When the eye bulges entirely and no harm or reduction occurs in sight: then it is necessary to dissolve the afflicted one; afterwards apply leeches to him; finally place warm poultices on his neck without incision, but with suction.
Deinde pone super Oculum linimentum quod fit ex acacia, et aloe, et olibano, et sarcocolla.	 Then apply a salve to the eye which is made from acacia, aloes, frankincense, and colophony.
Deinde stringe Oculum desuper super emplastrum cum puluillis multis.	 Then bind the eye tightly on top with many plasters.
Et modus puluillorum est: ut accipias pannos lenes, multos, et duplicetur omnis pannus ex eis super quatuor: fac ex eis multos: deinde pone eos unum super alium, secundum quantitatem qua indiget Oculus: deinde stringe super ipsos cum panno duro strictura forti.	 And the method of the plasters is: that you take soft cloths, many, and let each cloth be divided over four; make many from them; then place one on another according to the amount that the eye needs; then bind strongly over them with a stiff cloth.
Et itera uentosas cum suctione sine scarificatione.	 And repeat the warm poultices with suction without incision.
Deinde aufer uentosas, et dimitte oculum strictum die et nocte.	 Then remove the warm poultices and release the bound eye day and night.
Si autem ligamentum iterum mollificatur, tunc oportet ut stringatur multum: deinde aufer ligamentum post diem et noctem, sicut diximus.	 If, however, the binding softens again, then it is necessary to bind it very tightly; afterwards remove the binding after a day and night, as we have said.
Si ergo uides oculum iam redisse uuae tunicae, est bonum: et si non, tunc itera emplastrum, et puluillos, et stricturam, et uentosas, donec sanetur.	 If therefore you see the eye return to its natural state (covering), that is good; and if not, then repeat the salve, plasters, binding, and warm poultices until it heals.
¶ De incisionie Vuae tunicae.	 Chapter on Incision of the Eye Covering.
Caput XXI.	 Chapter 21.
Quando accidit disruptio in tunica Vuea, deinde eminet et procedit extra palpebras sicut granum Vuae, et foedatur forma hominis propter illud, et uis incidere illud: tunc operatio in eo est, secundum quod narro: et est, ut intromittas acum in radice Vuae ab inferiori ad superiorem partem.	 Chapter 21: When there is a rupture in the eye covering, it then bulges and protrudes beyond the eyelids like a grain of sand, and defiles the human form because of this, and desire to cut it; then the operation on him is as follows: insert a pointed instrument at the base of the eye from bottom to top.
Deinde intromitte acum aliam in qua sit filum duplum a parte lachrymalis, et fac eam penetrare: et dimitte acum primam secundum dispositionem suam.	 Then insert another pointed instrument with a doubled thread from the lacrimal part and let it penetrate; release the first instrument according to its position.
Deinde incide locum fili dupli, et liga cum eo partem Vuae in circumitu acus: et stringe eam multum.	 Then cut a place for the double thread, and tie it with the part of the vein in the round (or circumference) with a needle; and tighten it strongly.
Deinde extrahe acum, et pone super oculum lanam infusam in albugine oui: et dimitte eum, donec cadat filum cum Vua.	 Then draw out the needle, and place infused wool on the white part of the eye; and leave it until the thread falls with the vein.
Deinde cura oculum cum eo, quod confortat ipsum, donec sanetur uulnus.	 Then care for the eye so that it recovers, until the wound heals.
Et quandoque stringitur Vua ab omni parte cum circulo ex panno, donec addat oculus eminentiam magnam.	 And sometimes, tie the vein from all sides with a circle made of cloth until the eye protrudes greatly.
Deinde perforetur cum spatumili subtili, quod perueniat ad profundum oculi, et currat humiditas albuginea, et descendat oculus, et ingrediatur statim: deinde stringe eum, donec sanetur.	 Then it is pierced with a thin spatula that reaches to the depth of the eye, and the albuginea moistens, and the eye descends, and immediately enters; then tie it, until it heals.
¶ De curatione Alcomnati.	 [Title: On the treatment of Alcomant.]
Caput XXII.	 Chapter XXII.
Haec Aegritudo quae nominatur Alcomnati, non, est nisi sanies, quae aggregatur in oculo, similis aquae descendenti, et non est ipsa.	 This disease called Alcomant is not anything other than pus that accumulates in the eye, similar to descending water, and it is not the same as the eye itself.
Et modus operandi in ea est, ut facias sedere infirmum super sedem praeparatum, uel directum.	 And the method of operation for this is that you make the sick person sit on a prepared seat or directly.
Deinde accipe caput eius manibus tuis a partibus duabus, et moue ipsum, donec uideas saniem peruenire ad inferiora oculis tuis.	 Then take his head with your two hands, and move it until you see the pus reach the lower parts of your eyes.
Deinde figatur, et non descendat, et absoluatur lumen: et uideat infirmus res sicut uidebat: et si non descendit inferius, scias quia est aqua.	 Then it is shaped, and does not descend, and the sight is purified; and the sick person sees as he saw before; if it does not descend further, know that it is water.
Si autem non praeparatur descensus saniei cum eo quod diximus, tunc fac sedere infirmum inter manus tuas.	 If, however, the descent of pus is not prepared as we have said, then make the sick person sit between your hands.
Deinde accipe spatumile subtile, et finde cum eo supra panniculum corneum parumper apud continuationem coniunctiuae cum tunica cornea in corona, donec egrediatur sanies.	 Then take a thin spatula and cut it with it on the corn layer slightly near the junction of the conjunctiva with the cornea in the corona (or crown), until the pus comes out.
Cum ergo egreditur, tunc distilla in oculum aquam calidam in qua miscuisti mel: aut aquam in qua iam bullisti foenumgraecum et mel: deinde curetur cum reliqua curatione, donec sanetur.	 When it comes out, then pour warm water into the eye in which you have mixed honey; or hot water in which you have already boiled fenugreek and honey; then treat it with the rest of the treatment until it heals.
¶ De cura aquae, quae descendit in oculo, uel cataracta.	 On the treatment of water that descends into the eye, or cataract.
Caput XXIII.	 Chapter XXIII.
Iam Diximus species aquae in diuisione, et quae conuenit ad perforandum sermone declarante et exponente, tunc accipe illud idem secundum sanitatem.	 We have already discussed the types of water in division, and what is suitable for piercing when it is declared and explained in speech, then receive the same thing according to health.
Tunc ergo oportet ut facias sedere infirmum inter manus tuas quadratum, oppositum lumini, prope solem: et liga oculum eius sanum, et stringe eum ualde: deinde palpebram oculi eius manu tua dextra, si oculus in quo est aqua, est oculus sinister: aut manu tua sinistra, si oculus est dexter.	 Then it is necessary that you make the patient sit between your hands square, facing the light, near the sun; and bind the healthy eye and squeeze it strongly; then with your right hand close the eyelid of the eye in which there is water, or with your left hand if the eye is on the right.
Deinde accipe manu tua dextra almagda, si oculus est sinister: aut manu tua sinistra, si oculus est dexter.	 Then take your right hand, if the eye is left: or take your left hand, if the eye is right.
Deinde pone extremitatem almagda prope coronam per grossitudinem radii in ipsa albedine oculi apparente lachrymalis minoris: deinde impelle almagda cum uirtute: et tu reuoluis cum eo manum tuam, donec penetret in albuginem oculi: et sentias, quod almagda iam peruenit ad rem uacuam.	 Then place the edge of your right hand near the crown of the eye, on the apparent side of the smaller lacrimal duct within the white part of the eye: then push your right hand with force: and you pull your hand with it, until it penetrates into the white part of the eye: and you feel that your right hand has reached an empty place.
Et oportet, ut sit mensura itineris almagda ad profundum, mensura spacii quod est a pupilla usque ad finem nigredinis: et est corona oculi.	 And it is necessary that the measure of the journey of the hand to depth is the measurement of space from the pupil to the end of the darkening: and this is the crown of the eye.
Uidebis enim ea in ipsa pupilla uisione oculi, propter claritatem tunicae corneae.	 For indeed you will see it in the same pupil vision of the eye, because of the clarity of the cornea layer.
Deinde pone almagda usque ad locum in quo est aqua.	 Then place your hand up to where there is water.
Deinde preme ipsum inferius uice una post aliam.	 Then press it repeatedly with one blow after another.
Si ergo descendit aqua statim, tunc infirmus uidet illud super quod aperit uisum suum statim, et almagda in oculo suo.	 If water then immediately flows out, then the sick person immediately sees what is above and opens his sight, and the hand in his eye.
Deinde quiescas paululum.	 Then remain still for a little while.
Si ergo descendat aqua, tunc depone eam secundo, praeter quod egrediatur almagda.	 If water then flows out, then put it aside, but leave the hand to come out.
Quando ergo figitur, et non ascendit: tunc extrahe almagda cum facilitate: et tu reuoluis manum tuam paulatim.	 When it is tightened and does not rise up: then pull out the hand easily: and you slowly withdraw your hand.
Deinde dissolue in aqua aliquid ex sale claro gemmae: et ablue cum eo oculum deintus.	 Then dissolve something from salt in clear water: and wash the eye inside with it.
Deinde pone extra oculum totum stuppam, aut lanam infusam oleo rosato, et albugine oui: et liga cum eo oculum sanum.	 Then place over the entire eye a piece of wool soaked in rose oil and white thread: and bind the healthy eye with it.
Nos autem, et illi qui sunt nostri temporis, ponimus super eum ciminum tritum cum albumine oui.	 We and those who are of our time place over him camomile powder with white thread of the eye.
Quod si non obedit tibi almagda ad introitum in oculum propter duriciem suam, quoniam ex hominibus est, cuius oculus est durus ualde: tunc oportet ut accipias spatumile, quod nominatur Alberid, cuius haec est forma.	 If the hand does not obey you to enter the eye because of its hardness, since it is a man whose eye is very hard: then it is necessary that you take Spatule, which is called Alberid, and this is its form.
Pefora ergo cum eo ipsam coniunctiuam tantum, et non ultimes manum tuam in foramine: et non est nisi ut facias uiam ad almagda locum subtilem.	 Perforate therefore only the joint itself and not the tendon; and do not insert your finger into the hole; it is only to make a way to a subtle place.
Deinde intromitte almagda, secundum quod diximus.	 Insert almagda (an instrument), as we have said previously.
Et apud complementum operis tui, praeparetur infirmo dormitorium decenter factum, in quo dormiat super dorsum suum in domo tenebrosa: et prohibeatur ab omnibus motibus, et a tussi: et pone cibum eius illud quo lenitur natura eius: et non moueat caput suum dextra, neque sinistra omnino.	 For the completion of your work, prepare for the sick person a suitable sleeping place well made, in which he will lie on his back in a dark house; and let him be prevented from any movement, and from coughing; and place food for him that soothes his nature; and do not move his head to the right or left at all.
Et sit ligamentum secundum dispositionem suam usque ad diem tertium.	 And let the bandage be according to its composition until the third day.
Deinde solue illud in illa domo tenebrosa, et experire uisum eius: et fac eum uidere res.	 Then dissolve it in that dark house, and test his sight; and make him see things.
Deinde reduc ligamentum usque ad diem septimum.	 Then return the bandage until the seventh day.
Et non oportet ut faciat illud in hora curationis, aut post incisionem statim: imo oportet, ut alienes illud: propterea quod aqua ascendit uelociter per aspectum uehementem.	 And it is not appropriate to do this at the time of treatment or immediately after cutting; rather, it should be given by others because water rises quickly through a strong wound.
Si autem accidit apostema calidum: tunc oportet ut soluas oculum ante septimum: et rectifica illud cum eo quod sedat apostema, donec sedatur: tunc absolue ipsius uisum, et pone super faciem eius orale quo regatur uisus eius sub eo diebus aliquot, ipso existente in illa domo tenebrosa.	 If, however, there arises a hot abscess: then it is necessary to dissolve the eye before the seventh day; and correct this with what soothes the abscess until it subsides; then without his sight, and place on his oral cavity that which regulates his vision for several days, while he remains in that dark house.
Deinde egrediatur a domo gradatim, et conuersetur in casis suis.	 Then gradually leave the house, and change into his cases.
Et scias, quod in zaltea non excusatur discipulus a uisione aliquotiens: tunc enim audeat super operationem.	 And know that a student is not excused from viewing a dissection at times; then he dares to perform an operation.
Et iam quidem peruenit ad nos quidam ex illis qui sunt de Alayrach, qui dixit, quod factum fuit in Alayrach magdan perforatum, quo sugitur aqua.	 Now indeed a certain one of those from Alayrach has come to us who said that it was perforated with a large opening in Alayrach, through which water flows.
Verum ergo non uidi aliquem in terra uostra, qui fecerit illud: neque legi illud in aliquo ex libris antiquorum: et est possibile, ut sit illud nouum.	 Therefore, I have not seen anyone in your land who has done that; nor have I read it in any of the ancient books; and it is possible that it is new.
Et istae sunt formae specierum ex magda, ut stet super ea qui ea ignorat.	 These are the forms of species from Magda, so that they may stand above him who knows them not.
Fiant ex aere proprie: et sint extremitates eorum cum hac eadem subtilitate triangulatae, et extremitas acuta.	 Make them out of bronze; and let their extremities be with the same subtlety triangular and pointed.
Formae magda.	 Forms of Magda.
¶ De cura Carnis natae in naso.	 [Section] On the care of a newborn's flesh on the nose.
Caput XXIIII.	 Chapter XXIII.
Quandoque nascuntur in naso Carnes diuersae additae, ex quibus est aliquid quod assimilatur scorpioni multorum pedum: et ex ea est caro cancerosa, lapidea, fusci coloris: et ex ea est quae est caro lenis, non fusci coloris.	 When there are born in the nose diverse growths, of which some resemble many-footed scorpions; and from it is cancerous flesh, stone-like, dark colored; and from it is soft flesh, not dark colored.
In ea ergo quae ex istis carnibus est lenis, non fraudulenta, neque cancerosa, oportet ut facias sedere infirmum inter manus tuas oppositum soli, et aperi nares eius, et proiice uncinum in illas carnes: deinde trahe eas ad exteriora, et incide quod comprehendisti ex eis cum spatumili subtili acuto a parte una, donec scias quod caro tota iam ablata est.	 In the soft flesh, not fraudulent, nor cancerous, it is necessary that you make the patient sit facing the sun with his nose opposite it, and open its nostrils, and throw a hook into those growths; then draw them out to the outside, and cut what you have grasped from them with a thin, sharp spatula until you know that all the flesh has been removed.
Quod si remaneret aliquid ex ea cuius abscisio non est possibilis: tunc rade illud cum uno instrumentorum subtilium cum facilitate, donec non remaneat ex eo aliquid.	 If something remains from that which cannot be removed: then shave it off with one of the subtle instruments with ease, until nothing remains from it.
Si autem sanguis tibi dominatur, aut accidat apostema calidum: tunc oppone ei per id quod oportet: aut est ex apostematibus malignis, tunc propera cauterizando eum, donec abscindatur sanguis, et auferantur omnes carnes.	 If blood dominates you, or a hot abscess happens: then apply whatever is necessary; or if it is from malignant abscesses, then hasten to cauterize him until the blood is removed, and all flesh is taken away.
Deinde proiiciatur in nasum post incisionem acetum, et aqua, aut uinum.	 Then pour vinegar, water, or wine into the nose after the incision.
Si autem aperitur nasus, et procedat ex eo humiditas usque ad palatum, tunc scias quia iam sanus est.	 If the nostril opens and moisture comes out to the palate, then you know that he is now well.
Si uero non penetrat humiditas, secundum quod oportet, tunc scias quod intra ipsum est caro nata in superioribus ossibus naris, ad quae non peruenit cum incisione instrumentum.	 If moisture does not penetrate as required, then you know that within it is flesh born in the upper bones of the nose, to which the instrument did not reach with the incision.
Tunc ergo oportet, ut intromittas filum lini cui sit quaedam grossitudo, et noda in eo nodos multos: et pone inter omnem nodum quantitatem digiti, aut minus: et ingeniet infirmus, ut mittat extremitatem unam fili in nasum cum radio, aut cum quo possibile est ei postquam fecerit ipsum simile azer: et trahat odoratum suum, donec perueniat usque ad caassum, et egrediatur super guttur suum.	 Therefore, it is necessary to introduce a thread of linen with some thickness and many knots; place between each knot a quantity equal to or less than a finger; make the patient weak, so that he sends out one end of the thread into the nose with the probe, or as possible for him after he has done this, similar to the case of Azer; draw out its smell until it reaches the cavity, and exits above the throat.
Et multotiens quidem faciunt simile huic Attomi pueri in scholis: et est res facilis ei, qui uult.	 And indeed, many times boys make similar to this what Attomus does in schools; and it is easy for him who desires so.
Deinde pone duas extremitates fili, extremitatem unam quae egreditur super nasum, et alteram quae remansit in naso.	 Then place two ends of the thread, one that exits above the nose, and the other that remains in the nose.
Deinde ac ministra serraturam carnis cum nodis qui sunt in filo.	 Then, with scissors, cut the flesh along with the knots that are on the thread.
Fac illud donec scias quod carnes iam sunt cum nodis fili.	 Do this until you know that the flesh is now with the knots of the thread.
Deinde extrahe filum: et pone in nasum post abstersionem sanguinis licinium quod imbibisti in unguento aegyptio: fac illud tribus diebus, aut plus, donec unguentum corrodat totum quod remansit ex carnibus.	 Then draw out the thread; place in the nose after the withdrawal of blood linen which you have soaked in Egyptian ointment; do this for three days or more until the ointment has completely eaten away the remaining flesh.
Deinde pone in fine rei in nasum cannulam de plumbo, diebus aliquot, donec sanetur.	 Then, at the end, put a tube of lead into the nose for some days until it heals.
Si autem indiget curatione quae exiccet, utere illa.	 If it requires a cure that dries, use it.
Ad caputpurgium faciendum, cum quo distillantur olea, et aliae medicinae in nasum, fac illud ex argento, aut aere: quod sit simile lampadi paruae, apertum sicut conchula: et meatus eius similiter.	 To make the nose cure with what is distilled from olive oil and other medicines into the nose, make it of silver or copper; it should be similar to a small lamp, open like a snail shell, and its passage similarly.
Et si uis fac cannulam clausam, sicut canna.	 And if you want to make a closed tube, like a reed.
Et conchula instrumenti ad caputpurgium faciendum, sit plena, detecta: cui sit manubrium in postremo eius, cum quo teneas ipsam, quando calefacis in ea oleum, aut quod uis ex succis, et rebus fluxibilibus.	 And make the instrument for the head-lance completion, be it full, exposed: to which have a handle at its end, with which you hold it, when you heat oil or what you wish from juices and flexible things in it.
Et haec est forma instrumenti.	 This is the form of the instrument.
¶ De cura Thelul nasi.	 Chapter on the care of the nose.
Caput XXV.	 Chapter 25.
Multotiens nascitur in extremitate nasi Thelul, et magnificatur, et augmentatur cum diebus, donec foedus fit aspectus eius.	 Often a boil arises at the end of the nose called Thelul, and it becomes larger and increases in size with days until its appearance is repulsive.
Et propter illud oportet, ut in cidas illud in principio apparitionis eius, et eradices totum eius.	 And because of that, it is necessary that you cut it at the beginning of its appearance and remove the entire thing.
Deinde pone super locum, aut cauterium, aut medicinam comburentem quae stat loco eius.	 Then place on that location, either a cautery or a medicine burning in its place.
Si ergo tardatur incisio eius, donec magnificetur, tunc considera, si est lapideum, durum, fusci coloris, pauci sensus: tunc non tangas ipsum cum ferro: quoniam apostema est cancerosum.	 If its cutting is delayed until it becomes larger, then consider if it is made of stone, hard, dark in color and few senses: then do not touch it with iron, because it is a cancerous boil.
Multotiens enim uidi, qui incidit hmoni apostema, et accidit ex eo malicia magna super illum qui ipsum habebat.	 For often I have seen that someone cut an abscess with iron and great harm befell the one who had it.
Et si apostema est lenis tactus, non fusci coloris, et uides quod incisio possibilis est in toto eius, tunc euacua infirmum, et incide ipsum sine timore, absque pauore: et cura locum cum eo quod exiccat et constringit, donec sanetur.	 And if the boil is soft when touched, not dark in color, and you see that it is possible to cut the entire thing, then evacuate the weak, and cut it without fear or hesitation; and take care of the place with it that drains and constricts until it heals.
¶ De sutura nasi, et labii, et auris.	 Chapter on sewing the nose, the lip, and the ear.
Caput XXVI.	 Chapter 26.
Scias Quia quando accidit solutio continuitatis in una harum cartilaginum, parum confert in ea operatio, nisi in quibusdam hominibus.	 Know that when there is a separation of the continuity of one of these cartilages, an operation does not have much effect unless in certain people.
Oportet ergo quando accidit alicui aliquid ex illo, ut consideres, si est uulnus recens cum sanguine suo: et tunc aggrega duolabia uulneris cum sutura: deinde cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	 Therefore, when something happens to anyone from it, you should consider if it is a recent wound with its own blood: and then apply double stitches on the wound with suturing; then take care of it until it heals.
Et si solutionis continuitatis labia iam separata sunt, et facta est unaquaeque pars sana: tunc oportet ut excories omnem partem a cute sua apparente, donec sanguinetur.	 If the continuity of the solution has already been separated and each part is now healthy: then it is necessary to cure every part from its apparent skin until it bleeds.
Deinde aggrega duo labia cum sutura, et stringe ea, et pulueriza super ipsum sanguinem draconis, et olibanum trita: et pone supra pulueres frustum emplastri diafinicon, et alicuius alterius ex emplastris consolidatiuis: et dimitte ipsum ligatum duobus diebus, aut tribus.	 Then join the two lips with suturing and sew them together, and sprinkle powdered dragon's blood over it along with pulverized opopanax; and place a piece of plaster containing diafinicon on top of the powders, as well as some other consolidated plasters; and leave it bound for two or three days.
Deinde solue ipsum, et permuta medicinam: et dimitte ipsum, donec abscindantur fila per se.	 Then dissolve it, and change the medicine; and let it remain until the sutures have dissolved by themselves.
Deinde cura ipsum cum unguento, donec sanetur.	 Then treat it with an ointment until it heals.
Modus autem suturae est, ut aggreges solutionem continuitatis, aut cum acubus, sicut narrauimus in sutura uentris: aut aggrega solutionem cum filo, sicut feci te scire.	 The method of suturing is to join the continuity of the solution or with needles, as we have said in the suture of the abdomen; or join the solution with a thread, as I have taught you.
¶ De extractione nodorum labiorum.	 Chapter on the removal of lip tumors.
Caput XXVII.	 Chapter 27.
Multis Quidem hominibus accidunt plaerumque in interioribus labiorum suorum apostemata dura similia granis herbi: et quaedam eorum minora, et maiora.	 Many people have hard sores similar to grains of wheat growing on their inner lips; some of them are smaller and others larger.
Ergo oportet ut conuertas labium, et findas super omnem nodum eius, et suspendas ipsum cum uncino, et incidas ipsum ab omni parte.	 Therefore, you must turn the lip over, and make an incision on every tumor of it; and hang it with a hook and cut it from all sides.
Deinde impleas locum post incisionem zegi trito, donec abscindatur sanguis.	 Then fill the place after the incision with sulphur until the blood stops flowing.
Deinde colluatur cum aceto, et curetur locus cum eo, in quo est stipticitas, usquequo sanentur uulnera.	 Then it is scraped with vinegar and the place where the sore is, until the wounds heal.
¶ De incisione carnis natae super gingiuam.	 Chapter on the incision of the born flesh on the gums.
Caput XXVIII.	 Chapter 28.
Multotiens nascitur super gingiuam caro addiat, quam antiqui nominant abuluss.	 Often a mass of flesh grows on the gum that ancient people called abuluss.
Oportet ergo ut suspendas eam cum uncino: aut teneas eam cum forcipibus, et incidas eam apud radicem suam, et dimittas saniem currere, aut sanguinem.	 Therefore, you must hang it with a hook or hold it with forceps and cut it at the root, and let pus or blood flow out.
Deinde pone super locum zegi tritum, aut alios pulueres stipticos, exiccatiuos.	 Then place over the sore area crushed pomegranate peel or other styptic powders, extractive.
Quod si redit illa caro post curationem, nam multotiens redit, tunc incide eam secundo, et cauteriza ipsam: ipsa namque non redit post cauterium.	 If the flesh returns after treatment (which often happens), then cut it again and cauterize it; for it does not return after cauterization.
¶ De rasione Dentium cum ferro.	 Chapter on tooth extraction with iron.
Caput XXIX.	 Chapter 29.
Quandoque aggregantur in superficiebus Dentium ab interiori et extetiori parte, et inter gingiuas cortices asperi, turpes, et quandoque denigrantur, et citrini fiunt, et uirides, donec peruenit ex illo corruptio ad gingiuam, et foedi fiunt dentes per illud.	 When they (teeth) are gathered on the surfaces of teeth from both the inner and outer parts, and between gums and rough cortices, sometimes they turn yellowish or greenish, until that corruption reaches the gum, and the teeth become foul due to it.
Oportet ergo ut facias sedere infirmum inter manus tuas, et caput eius in sinu tuo, et rade molam et dentem, in quo apparent tibi cortices, et res similis arenae: donec non remaneat ex eis aliquid, et similiter fac de nigredine, et uiriditate, et citrinitate, et aliis donec mundentur.	 Therefore, you should make the patient sit between your hands and support his head in your lap, and grind the tooth and root where the cortex appears to you like sand: until nothing remains from it, and similarly do with blackness, greenness, yellowness, and others until they are cleaned.
Si ergo auferatur quod in eis est a principio rasionis, bonum est: et si non, tunc itera super eos rasionem die alio, secundo, et tertio, donec ad ultimum perueniat studium in eo quod uis.	 If therefore what is within them (teeth) is removed at the beginning of reasoning, it is good: and if not, then you should repeat the grinding process on them day after day, second and third, until finally your efforts reach what you desire.
Et scias, quod dens indiget rasoriis diuersarum formarum, multarum figurarum: secundum quod praeparatur operationi tuae: proptera, quod rasorium quo raditur dens ab inferiori parte, est aliud a rasorio quo raditur inter dentes, secundum formas alias.	 And know that the tooth needs razors of various shapes and forms, many kinds, according to what is prepared for your operation: because the rasp that grinds the tooth from below is different from the rasp that grinds between the teeth, according to other shapes.
Et istae formae rasoriorum sint apud te praeparatae, quas uides.	 These forms of razors should be prepared by you, which you see.
¶ De extractione doloris Dentium.	 Chapter on the extraction of tooth pain.
Caput XXX.	 Chapter 30.
Oportet ut cures Dentem a dolore suo cum omni ingenio, et tardes in eradicatione eius.	 It is necessary to cure the tooth from its pain with all your skill, and to be slow in its extraction.
Non est enim quod uicem eius suppleat quando eradicatur: quoniam est substantia sublimis: donec quando non est excusatio de eradicatione eius, tunc oportet quando cogitur infirmus eradicare ipsum, ut firmetur, et certificetur apud te dens dolens.	 For its place will not be supplied when it is extracted: since it is a substance that rises: until there is no excuse for its extraction, then if the patient is forced to extract it himself, he must firmly decide and assure you of a tooth in pain.
Multotiens enim decipit infirmum dolor, et putat quia est in dente saha et eradicat ipsum: deinde non recedit dolor, donec eradicetur dens infirmus.	 For often the pain deceives the patient and he believes that there is saha (a poison) in the tooth and extracts it himself: then the pain does not go away until the diseased tooth is extracted.
Nos enim iam uidimus illud ex operatione phlebotomatorum.	 We have indeed already seen that from the operation of phlebotomists.
Cum ergo certificatur apud te dens dolens ipsemet, tunc oportet ut scarifices in circumitu dentis cum spatumili, in quo sit quiddam uirtutis, donec soluatur gingiua ab omni parte: deinde moue ipsum digitis tuis, aut cum forcipibus subtilibus in primis paulatim, donec concutias ipsum.	 When therefore it is certain that the tooth itself feels hard, then it is necessary to incise around the tooth with a spatula, in which there is something of virtue, until it dissolves the gums from all sides: then move it yourself with your fingers, or with subtle forceps first, little by little, until you shake it.
Deinde loca tunc in eo forcipes magnos locatione bona, et caput infirmi inter genua tua: quod iam bene tenuisti, ita quod non moueatur: deinde trahe dentem secundum rectitudinem, ut non frangas ipsum.	 Then place large forceps there with good positioning, and hold the head of the weak between your knees: what you have already firmly grasped, so that it does not move: then pull out the tooth in a straight line, so as not to break it.
Si ergo non egreditur, tunc accipe aliquod illorum instrumentorum, et intromitte ipsum sub eo ab omni parte cum facilitate, et conare motionem eius, sicut fecisti in primis.	 If therefore it does not come out, then take one of those instruments and insert it under it from all sides with ease, and try to move it as you did at first.
Si autem dens est perforatus, aut corrosus: tunc oportet ut impleas illud foramen panno: et stringas ipsum cum extremitate radii subtilis, ut non frangatur in hora constrictionis tuae super ipsum cum forcipibus.	 If the tooth is pierced or rotten: then it is necessary to fill that hole with a cloth and tighten it with the end of a subtle radius so as not to break it during your constriction on top of it with forceps.
Et oportet, ut exquisite agas cum scarificatione in circumitu gingiuae ab omni parte multum.	 And it is necessary that you are careful when incising around the gums from all sides a lot.
Et custodi fortitudinem tuam, ut non frangas ipsum, et remaneat pars eius, et redeat super infirmum ex ea malicia quae sit maior dolore eius primo.	 And keep your strength so as not to break it, and a part of it remains, and returns on the weak from that malice which is greater than its first pain.
Et caue, ne facias illud quod ignorantes faciunt phlebotomatores in festinatione sua, et audacia ipsorum super eradicationem eius, praeter quod administrent illud quod narrauimus.	 And beware, lest you do what ignorant phlebotomists do in haste and their own audacity regarding its removal, except that they administer what I have mentioned.
Multotiens enim faciunt euenire super homines infirmitates magnas, quarum difficiliores sunt ut frangantur, et remaneant radices eius omnes, aut quaedam earum: aut ut extrahant ipsum cum quibusdam ossibus mandibulae: sicut testificati sumus multotiens illud.	 For many times they bring upon men great weaknesses, the more difficult of which are to break and all its roots remain or some of them: or to extract it with certain bones of the jaw as we have often testified.
Deinde colluatur post eradicationem eius cum uino, aut cum aceto et sale.	 Then it is to be scraped after its excision with wine, or with vinegar and salt.
Quod si accidat fluxus sanguinis ex locis (multotiens enim accidit) tunc tere aliquid ex zegi, et imple cum eo locum: et si non, cauteriza ipsum si non confert tibi zegi.	 If there occurs a bleeding from the places (for it often happens), then grind some alum and fill the place with it; and if not, cauterize it if you have no alum.
Formae forcipum subtilium quibus mouetur dens in primis, sint longarum extremitatum, breuis manubrii, grossi, ut non duplicentur quando cum eis premitur super dentem: sint sicut uides grossorum manubriorum, donec quando stringis cum eis, non dent seipsas, neque duplicentur: breuium extremitatum, et sint ex ferro indo, aut ex faled decenter facti, directarum extremitatum: et in eorum extremitatibus sint dentes, quorum quidam ingrediantur in quosdam, et stringant constrictione decenti, forti.	 The handles of subtle forceps by which the hard tooth is moved should be long at one end, short at the other, thick, so that they do not split when pressed against the tooth; they should resemble the handles of large forceps, until when you press them with them, they do not bend themselves or split: short in length, and made of good iron or well-made steel, straight at their ends: and at their ends there should be teeth, some of which enter into some and tighten by proper constriction, strong.
Et quandoque fiunt extremitates sicut forma oris auis quae nominatur ciconia, et sunt fortis constrictionis.	 And sometimes the ends are shaped like the beak of a bird called a ciconia and are strong in constriction.
¶ De eradicatione Dentium, et extractione ossium mandibularum fractorum.	 Chapter on the extraction of teeth and breaking of fractured jawbones.
Caput XXXI.	 Chapter XXXI.
Quando remanet apud eradicationem Dentis qui frangitur aliquid, tunc oportet ut ponas super locum cotum cum butyro die uno, aut duobus diebus, donec mollificetur locus: deinde intromitte ad ipsum algasti, aut forcipes: quorum extremitates assimilantur ori auis quae nominatur ciconia.	 When a tooth remains after its extraction and breaks something, then one must put hot oil on the place for one or two days until the place becomes soft; then introduce alum or forceps into it, whose ends are shaped like the beak of a bird called a ciconia.
Forma autem haec est forcipum.	 The form of the forceps is as follows.
Sint extremitates eorum factae sicut lima deintus: aut sicut aliskilfegi.	 The ends of them should be shaped like a plane iron or an aliskilfe.
Si ergo non obedit tibi ad exitum cum istis forcipibus, tunc oportet, ut caues super radicem, et detegas carnem totam, et intromittas instrumentum quod nominatur Palanca parua, cuius forma est haec.	 If it does not come out with these forceps, then you must cauterize the root, remove all the flesh and introduce an instrument called a small palanca, whose shape is as follows.
Sit breuis extremitatis, grossae parumper: et non sit imbibitum, ut non frangatur.	 The extremity should be short and rather thick; and it should not be filled (or saturated), so that it does not break.
Si ergo egreditur radix per illud, est bonum: et si non, iuuare oportet cum istis instrumentis aliis quorum formae sunt istae.	 If the root comes out through that (incision), it is good; and if not, help with other instruments of similar form.
Forma primi triangulatae extremitatis, in qua est quaedam grossitudo.	 The first form is a triangle at the end, where there is some thickness.
Forma triangulatae extremitatis subtilis.	 The form of the subtle triangle (or pointed tip).
Etiam iuuatur cum hoc instrumento habente duos ramos, cuius haec est forma.	 Also helps with this instrument having two branches, with this form.
Et cum aliis instrumentis et ferramentis quae praecesserunt in rasione dentium.	 And with other instruments and tools which have come before (in the process of dental extraction).
Etiam sit iuuamentum cum hoc instrumento quod assimilatur uncino magno, huius formae, triangulatae extremitatis tortae, in qua est quiddam grossitudinis, ut non frangatur: et sit non imbibitum.	 Also help with this instrument resembling a large hook, with this form (triangular and twisted tip), having some thickness to avoid breaking; and it should not be filled.
Et scias, quod instrumenta dentium sunt multa: et similiter reliqua instrumenta non computantur, et artifex prudens, subtilis in arte sua inuenit per se ipsum instrumentum, secundum quod significant ei operatio et aegritudines ipsae.	 And know that there are many dental instruments; similarly, the other instruments are not counted (or considered), and a skillful artisan, subtle in his craft, finds for himself the tool according to what the operation and the disease itself signify.
Quoniam ex agritudinibus sunt ad quas non dixerunt antiqui instrumentum, propter diuersitatem specierum earum.	 Because from diseases there are those for which no ancient instrument was made, due to the diversity of their forms.
Si autem frangatur os ex mandibula, aut ex aliis ossibus oris, aut putrefit: tunc perscrutare super ipsum in loco suo cum eo quod conuenit ei ex instrumentis et forcipibus quae dixi in extractione radicum, et iuuare cum gesti, cuius forma est haec.	 If the bone breaks out from the jaw or from other bones of the face, or rots: then examine (or explore) on it in its place with that which suits it among the instruments and forceps I mentioned for root extraction, and help with what is being done, whose form is as follows.
Sit in eo quiddam grossitudinis paulatim, ut stringatur, uel teneatur cum eo os, et non fugiat et uadat, donec egrediatur os: et restaura locum cum medicinis conuenientibus ad illud.	 Let there be some thickness gradually, in order to tighten or hold the bone with it so that it does not escape and move away until the bone comes out; and restore the place with appropriate medicines for that.
Si autem in osse est putredo parua, tunc rade ipsum a putredine sua, et cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	 If there is a small rottenness (or decay) in the bone, then clean it from its own decay, and care for it until it heals.
De serratura Dentium eminentium super alios.	 On the serration of protruding teeth.
Caput XXXII.	 De curatione alvii et de dentium extractione
Quando Dentes eminent non secundum cursum suum naturalem, foeda fit per illud forma: et praecipue quando accidit illud in mulieribus, et puellis, scilicet uenalibus.	 On the treatment of the jaw and tooth extraction. When teeth protrude not according to their natural course, it becomes foul due to that shape; especially when this happens in women and girls, namely, venereal.
Oportet ergo ut consideres.	 It is necessary therefore to consider the following points.
Nam si dens est natus post dentem alium, et non locatur, uel est possibilis eius serratura, neque limatura ipsius: tunc eradica ipsum: et si est annexus cum dente alio, tunc incide ipsum cum isto instrumento, cuius haec est forma.	 For if a tooth is born after another tooth and it does not settle or its serration or cutting is possible, then extract it; and if it is attached to another tooth, then cut it with this instrument, whose form is as follows.
Est simile rostro paruo, et fit ex ferro indo, acutae extremitatis ualde.	 It resembles a small beak, and is made from hard iron with an extremely sharp end.
Et sit incisio tua qua ipsum incidis in diebus multis, et propter duriciem dentis, et ut non commoueatur alius ex dentibus.	 And your cut should be such that you make the cut over many days due to the hardness of the tooth and so as not to disturb another tooth.
Si autem est eminens expositus limaturae suae: tunc lima ipsum cum lima ex indo, cuius forma est haec.	 If it is protruding, exposed for serration; then smooth it with a rasp made of hard iron, whose form is as follows.
Sit totum ex indo, et manubrium eius minutorum punctorum ualdae, sicut lima cum qua fiunt acus: cum quo limetur dens paulatim in diebus multis cum facilitate, ut non commoueatur dens, et cadat: deinde leni ipsum, in fine rade ipsum cum quibusdam rasoriis.	 Let the entire instrument be made of hard iron and its handle have many small pointed teeth like a rasp with which to smooth the tooth gradually over many days with ease, so as not to disturb another tooth and let it fall; then soften it and finally grind it smooth with some rasps.
Quod si est dens, ex quo frangatur pars, et laedit linguam: tunc oportet ut limes eum etiam, donec auferatur asperitas illius fractionis, et aequetur: et applanetur, et non laedat linguam, neque corrumpat sermonem.	 If the tooth breaks and injures the tongue; then it is necessary to rasp it until the roughness of the break is removed and it is made even; and to smooth it so as not to injure the tongue or corrupt speech.
¶ De retatione Dentium cum filis auri.	 About the winding of teeth with threads of gold.
Caput XXXIII.	 De extractione dentium eosdemque remediationib
Quando accidit Dentibus anterioribus concussio et commotio a percussione, aut casu: et non potest infirmus stringere super illud quod comedit ut non cadat: et curasti eos cum medicinis stipticis, et non ualuit curatio: tunc ingenium in eis est, ut stringantur cum filo auri: quoniam argentum fit uiride, et putrefit post dies: sed aurum nunquam mutatur.	 When there is shock and commotion of the anterior teeth due to impact or accident; and the weak person cannot bite down on what they eat so as not to let it fall; and you have treated them with medicines and bandages, but the treatment has not helped; then it is appropriate for them to be tied with a thread of gold; because silver becomes green and putrefies after days, but gold never changes.
Et sit filum medium in subtilitate et grossicie secundum quantitatem quod capiat inter Dentes.	 The thread should be of a middle fineness and thickness according to its quantity that it may pass between the teeth.
Et forma quidem retationis est, ut accipias filum, et intromittas duplum eius inter duos dentes sanos: deinde texeas cum duabus extremitatibus fili inter dentes motos, siue unus sit, aut plures, donec peruenias cum tela usque ad dentem sanum alterius partis.	 The form of the rete is such that you take a thread and pass it twice between two healthy teeth; then you weave it with its two ends between moving teeth, either one or several, until you reach with the lance to the tooth of the other side.
Deinde itera texturam usque ad partem a qua incaepisti: et stringe manum tuam cum subtilitate et sapientia, donec non remoueatur prorsus: et sit constrictio tua qua stringis filum, apud radices dentium, ut non euadat.	 Then weave the fabric until you reach the part from where you started; and bind your hand with subtlety and wisdom until it is not moved entirely; and let your binding that binds the thread be at the roots of the teeth, so that it does not slip away.
Deinde incide extremitates fili superfluentes cum forficibus: et aggrega utrumque, et conuerte eas cum gesti: et occulta ipsas inter dentem sanum et dentem motum, ut non laedat linguam: deinde dimittatur ita strictum dum remanet.	 Then cut the excess ends of the thread with scissors; gather both and turn them to each other; hide these under a healthy tooth and a moving tooth so as not to harm the tongue; then release it thus bound until it remains.
Si autem soluitur, aut inciditur, stringe eos cum filo alio, et stabit cum eo taliter tempore toto.	 If it is loosened or cut, bind it with another thread and let it stand thus for the whole time.
Et haec est forma Dentium, et figura retationis duorum dentium sanorum, et duorum dentium motorum, sicut uides.	 And this is the form of teeth, and the figure of the rete of two healthy teeth, and two moving teeth, as you see.
Et quandoque fit, ut redeat dens unus, aut duo post casum urriusque in locis suis, et retentur sicut narrauimus, et remaneant: et non facit illud nisi artifex, prudens, et expertus.	 And sometimes it happens that a tooth or teeth return after loss at their respective places and are retained as we have said and remain; this does not happen unless the skilled and experienced craftsman does it.
Et quandoque aptatur aliquod ex ossibus uaccinis: et fit ex eo sicut forma dentis, et ponitur in loco, ex quo munitur dens et stringitur, sicut diximus: et remanet, et seruitur cum eo tempore longo.	 And sometimes a tooth is made from the bones of the cow; and it is made like the form of a tooth, and placed in the place where the tooth is braced and bound as we have said; and it remains and serves for a long time.
¶ De incisione ligamenti quod accidit sub lingua, et prohibet loquelam.	 Chapter on the cutting of the ligament that happens under the tongue, and prevents speech.
Caput XXXIIII.	 Chapter XXXIV.
Quandoque ligamentum hoc quod accidit sub lingua, est aut naturale, cum quo nascitur homo, aut accidentale, a uulnere quod iam consolidatum est.	 When sometimes a ligament occurring under the tongue is either natural, with which a man is born, or accidental, from a wound that has already healed.
Et operatio in eo est, ut aperias os infirmi in capite eius in sinu tuo, et eleua linguam eius: deinde incide illud ligamentum neruosum per latitudinem, donec soluatur lingua a retentione sua.	 And the procedure for it is to open the weak bone of its head in your pocket, and lift up its tongue; then cut that nerve ligament through its width until it is released from its constraint.
Quod si in eo fuerit quiddam duriciei et nodationis, et fuerit illud ex consolidatione uulneris: tunc proiice in illud uncinum, et finde illud per latitudinem, donec incidas ligamentum, et soluatur nodatio.	 If there is something hard and knotted in it, and it is from the consolidation of a wound; then throw a hook into it, and break through it across its width, until you cut the ligament, and the knot is loosened.
Et caue, ne sit fissura in profundo carnis, et incidas arteriam illic, et accidat fluxus sanguinis.	 And beware, lest there be a split in the deep flesh, and you cut the artery there, and blood flow ensues.
Deinde colluatur in uestigio incisionis cum aqua rosata, aut cum aceto, aut aqua frigida.	 Then it is rubbed with water of rose, or with vinegar, or with cold water.
Deinde pone sub lingua licinium ex lino, quod teneat infirmus in omni nocte: ut non consolidetur secundo.	 Then place linen cloth beneath the tongue, which holds the weak one all night; so that it does not heal again.
Si autem accidat fluxus sanguinis, tunc pone super locum zegi tritum.	 But if blood flow occurs, then put on the place crushed lupine seeds.
Si uero uincit te sanguis, tunc cauteriza locum cum cauterio lentiginoso, quod conuenit ad illud: deinde cura ipsum cum reliqua curatione, donec sanetur.	 But if blood prevails, then cauterize the place with a lentigo-like cautery, which is suitable for that; afterwards take care of it with the rest of the cure until it heals.
¶ De extractione Ranulae quae fit sub lingua.	 Chapter on the extraction of a ranula occurring under the tongue.
Caput XXXV.	 Chapter XXXV.
Quandoque accidit sub lingua apostema quod assimilatur Ranae paruae, prohibens linguam ab operatione sua naturali: et fortasse magnificatur adeo, donec implet os.	 Sometimes an aposteme occurs under the tongue which resembles a small ranula, preventing the tongue from its natural function; and perhaps it swells so much that it fills the bone.
Et operatio in eo est, ut aperias os infirmi coram sole: et considera apostema.	 And the procedure for it is to open the weak one's head facing the sun, and consider the aposteme.
Si ergo uides ipsum fusci coloris, aut nigri, durum, cui non inuenit infirmus sensum: tunc non tangas ipsum, quoniam est cancer.	 If you see it of a dark or black color, hard, without any sensation to the weak one; then do not touch it, because it is a cancer.
Et si est decliue ad albedinem, in quo est humiditas, tunc proiice in ipsum uncinum, et incide ipsum cum spatumili subtili, et libera ipsum ab omni parte.	 If it is cut to the white part, where there is moisture, then throw in the hook and cut it with a sharp knife, and free it from all sides.
Quod si uincit te sanguis in hora tuae operationis, tunc pone super ipsum zegi tritum, donec abscindatur sanguis: deinde redi ad operationem tuam, donec extrahas ipsum cum complemento eius.	 If blood seeps out on your operation hour, then place a crushed zegi on it until the blood is cut off; afterwards return to your operation until you pull it out with its whole.
Deinde colluatur cum aceto et sale: et cura ipsum reliqua curatione conueniente ad illud, donec sanetur.	 Then it should be washed with vinegar and salt; and care for it with an appropriate treatment until it heals.
¶ De curatione apostematis duarum Amigdalarum.	 Chapter on the treatment of double cheek amygdala.
Caput XXXVI.	 Chapter 36.
Quandoque accidunt inter guttur godad, id est, glandulae, quae similantur algodad, quae accidunt deforis: et nominantur duae Amigdalae: quas quando curas cum eo quod diximus in diuisione, et non sanantur, tunc considera.	 Whenever glands similar to goiters occur near the throat, that is, the two amygdales: which, when treated as we have said, and do not heal, then consider.
Si ergo est apostema durum, fusci coloris, pauci sensus: tunc non tangas ipsum cum ferro.	 If it is a hard aposteme of dark color with few senses, then do not touch it with iron.
Et si est rubei coloris, et radix eius est grossa: tunc non tangas ipsum etiam cum ferro, timens fluxum sanguinis, imo dimitte ipsum, donec maturetur.	 And if it is of red color and its root is thick, then do not touch it even with iron, fearing bleeding, rather let it be until it matures.
Et tunc aut perforabis ipsum: aut rumpetur per se.	 Then either pierce it yourself or it will burst by itself.
Et si est albi coloris, rotundum, et est radix eius subtilis: tunc oportet ipsum incidi.	 And if it is white in color, round and its root is subtle, then it must be cut.
Et operatio in ipso est, ut consideres ante operationem suam, si quieuit apostema eius calidum quiete completum, aut imminuitur quadam diminutione: tunc ergo fac sedere infirmum coram sole, et caput eius sit in sinu tuo: et aperi os eius, et accipiat seruiens inter manus suas, et premat linguam eius inferius cum instrumento, cuius haec est forma.	 And the operation on it is that you consider before the operation whether its aposteme has quieted down with warm completion or decreased somewhat: then let the patient sit facing the sun, and his head in your lap; and open his mouth and let a servant hold it between his hands; and press the lower part of his tongue with an instrument, whose shape is as follows.
Fiat ex argento, aut aere, quod sit subtile sicut cultellus.	 Let it be made of silver or brass, which is thin like a knife.
Cum ergo premis cum eo linguam, et ostenditur tibi apostema, et cadit super ipsum uisus tuus: tunc accipe uncinum, et fige ipsum in amigdalam, et extrahe eam ad exteriora quantum potes, praeter quod trahas cum ea aliquid ex tunicis.	 When you press the tongue with it and the aposteme is shown to you and falls on top of it, then take a hook, and fix it in the amygdale, and pull it out as far as possible, taking something along with it from the tunics.
Deinde incide eam cum instrumento, cuius haec est forma quae sequitur.	 Then cut it with an instrument, whose shape is as follows.
Assimilatur forficibus: uerumtamen extremitates eius sint curuatae, ita quod orificium cuiusque earum est in directo alterius acute: unde cura ut sit ex ferro indo, aut alfuled imbibitum.	 It resembles tweezers; however, its ends should be curved so that the opening of each is directly opposite and sharp: therefore care should be taken that it is made of iron or aluminum treated with resin.
Si autem non est praesens hoc instrumentum, tunc incide ipsum cum spatumili, cuius haec est forma.	 If this tool is not present, then cut it with a spatula, whose shape is as follows.
Sit acutum a parte una, non acutum a parte altera.	 Sharp on one side, not sharp on the other side.
Et postquam incidis amigdalam unam, incide alteram secundum hanc eandem speciem incisionis.	 And after you cut one almond [tooth], cut the other one according to this same type of incision.
Deinde post incisionem gargarizet infirmus cum aqua frigida, aut cum aceto et aqua.	 Then, after the incision, the sick person shall rinse with cold water or with vinegar and water.
Si autem accidat ei fluxus sanguinis, gargarizet cum aqua in qua bulliti sunt cortices granatorum: aut folia myrti, et similia illis ex stipticis, donec abscindatur fluxus sanguinis: deinde cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	 If however there is a flow of blood, he shall rinse with water in which the bark of pomegranates has been boiled; or the leaves of myrtle and similar ones from other bitter plants, until the flow of blood stops: then take care of him until he is healed.
Et quandoque nascuntur in gutture apostemata alia, praeter amigdalas duas.	 And sometimes boils other than the two molars arise in the throat.
Incide ergo ea secundum quod dixi in incisione duarum amigdalarum aequaliter.	 Therefore cut them equally according to what I said about the incision of the two molars.
Et ego quidem iam medicatus fui mulierem ex apostemate, quod natum erat inter guttur eius, quod trahebat ad fuscedinem, pauci sensus, quod iam fere clauserat guttur: et mulier respirabat a meatu stricto, et iam prohibuerat ei comestionem, et potum aquae: et iam peruenerat ad mortem, si remansisset uno die, aut duobus diebus.	 And I myself have healed a woman from a boil that had arisen in her throat, which was drawing toward gangrene and had impaired her senses so that she could barely breathe through a narrow opening; and the woman had already been forbidden food and drink; and death was imminent if she had remained for one or two more days.
Et apostema tantum ascenderat, quod emiserat duos ramos, donec exierant super duo foramina nasi.	 And the boil had risen so much that it had expelled two branches until they emerged through the two nostrils.
Properaui ergo festinanter, et fixi in unum eorum uncinum.	 I therefore hastened and tied up one of them with a hook.
Deinde traxi ipsum, et tracta ex eo est portio magna.	 Then I pulled it out, and a large portion came out with it.
Deinde abscidi eam, ubi comprehendi ex foramine nasi.	 Then I cut it off where it was taken from the nostril.
Deinde feci illud ei quod processit ex foramine nasi altero.	 Then I did to it what came out of the other nostril.
Deinde aperui os eius, et pressi linguam eius: et postea fixi uncinum in ipsum apostema: deinde abscidi ex eo partem eius, et non cucurrit ex eo nisi sanguis paucus: absolutum est ergo guttur mulieris, et incepit statim bibere aquam, deinde accepit ex cibo.	 Then I opened his mouth and pressed his tongue; then I tied a hook to the boil; then I cut off a piece of it, and only a little blood flowed out: the woman's throat was therefore healed, and she immediately began to drink water, then she received food.
Non ergo cessaui incidere ex illo apostemate multotiens tempore longo: et apostema succedebat loco eius quod incidebam, donec prolongatum est nimis et cum ea illud.	 I did not cease to cut from that ulcer many times over a long period of time: and the ulcer succeeded in the place which I was cutting, until it was prolonged too much and with it that.
Ingeniaui ergo, et cauterizaui apostema inter guttur.	 I heated (or set fire to) therefore, and burnt the ulcer at the throat.
Stetit ergo ab additione: deinde ambulaui a parte, et non sciui quid fecit Deus cum ea post me.	 Therefore it stood firm after adding (something): then I went away from there, and I did not know what God had done with it after me.
¶ De incisione apostematis uuulae.	 Chapter on the incision of ulcers in the throat.
Caput XXXVII.	 Chapter XXXVII.
Quando descendit catarrus ad uuulam, et apostematur, et est long: tunc ipsa nominatur perpendicularis: et si est in inferiori parte grossa, rotunda, tunc ipsa nominatur uua.	 When the catarrh descends to the throat and an ulcer forms that is long: then it is called the perpendicular; and if it is large and round in the lower part, then it is called a goitre.
Quando curatur cum eo quod diximus in diuisione, et non confert curatio: et uides quod apostema calidum quieuit ab ea, et est subtilis: tunc oportet ut incidas eam.	 When it is treated with what I said in the division, and the treatment does not work; and you see that the ulcer has become warm and soft: then it should be cut.
Et quae ex ea est aggregata rotunda, et non est ei longitudo, et est sanguinea, aut fusci coloris, aut nigri, et non est ei sensus: tunc oportet ut deuites incisionem eius.	 And what is gathered round from it, and is not long, and is bloody or dark red or black, and has no sensation: then it should be cut.
In ea enim est timor super infirmum.	 For there is fear over the weak (person).
Oportet ergo quando uides eam secundum modum quem dixi ex albedine, et longitudine sua, ut facias sedere infirmum coram sole: et premas linguam eius cum instrumento, cuius praecessit narratio: deinde fige uncinum in uuam, et trahe eam inferius: et incide eam cum uno duorum instrumentorum quae dixi in incisione duarum amigdalarum.	 Therefore when you see it according to the way I said from whiteness, and its length, to make the weak person sit before the sun; and press his tongue with the tool whose use was previously described; then fix a hook in the throat, and pull it downward; and cut it with one of two tools which I mentioned in the incision of the two salivary glands.
Et oportet ut non incidas ex ea, nisi illud quod additur super naturalem terminum sine additione.	 And it should not be cut from it unless what is added exceeds its natural limit without additional treatment.
Nam si tu incidis ex ea plus, laedes uocem et sermonem.	 For if you cut from it too much, you will damage the voice and speech.
Deinde post incisionem utere eo quod narrauimus in incisione duarum amigdalarum: et cura eam, donec sanetur.	 Then after the incision, use what was described in the incision of the two salivary glands; and care for it until it heals.
Si autem terretur infirmus ab incisione: tunc oportet ut utaris ingenio in cauterizatione eius absque timore et pauore.	 If the patient is afraid of incision: then it is necessary that you use your skill in cauterizing him without fear and cowardice.
Et modus cauterii in ea non est, nisi cum aqua acuta: et est, ut ponas caput infirmi in sinu tuo.	 The method of cauterization is not other than with sharp water: it is to place the head of the patient on your lap.
Deinde preme linguam eius cum instrumento quod diximus.	 Then press his tongue with the instrument that I have mentioned.
Deinde accipe ex aqua quam dixi tibi in capitulo cauterizandi, et confice cum ea calcem non extinctam, et pone eam non spissam, neque subtilem, et imple ex ea concauitatem huius instrumenti, cuius haec est forma.	 Then take from the water that I have told you in the chapter on cauterization, and make a non-extinguished lump of it, not thick, nor thin, and fill the depression of this instrument with it, which has this shape.
Sit extremitati eius in qua ponitur medicina concauitas, sicut concauitas cochlearis radii.	 Let the end where the medicine is placed be concave like the concavity of a seashell's edge.
Et pone instrumentum cum medicina super uuulam ipsam: et infirmus sit iacens super latus suum, ut currat saliua ex ore eius ex intrinseca medicina, ut non descendat ex ea ad guttur ipsius aliquid, et laedat ipsum.	 Place the instrument with the medicine on the wound itself: and let the patient lie down on his side so that saliva from his mouth runs out of his mouth with the internal medicine, so that something does not drop from it to his throat and hurt him.
Deinde tene manum tuam cum medicina.	 Then hold your hand with the medicine.
Et tu ex primas eam super uuulam quantitate medietatis horae, donec uideas eam iam denigratam, et sedatam mordicationem medicinae.	 And you from above apply it to the wound in quantity equal to half an hour until you see it becoming blackened and sedated by the bite of the medicine.
Et si uis ut accipias cotum, et inuoluas ipsum super extremitatem radii, et infundas cotum cum medicina, et intromittas radium cum coto in cannulam desuper, donec adhaereat cotum super uuulam.	 And if you wish to take a hot iron, and wrap it on the end of the ray, and pour the hot iron with the medicine, and introduce the ray with the heated iron into the canal from above until the hot iron adheres to the wound.
Fac illud multotiens, donec consequaris quod uis de cauterizatione uuae.	 Do that often until you achieve what you want in the cauterization of the wound.
Deinde dimitte eam: ipsa namque arescit et cadit post tres dies, aut quatuor.	 Then let it go: for it burns and falls away after three or four days.
Quod si indiges ut iteres medicinam, itera ipsam: et post cauterizationem absterge in circumitu uuae cum coto imbibito in butyro, et mundifica cum eo quod est in circumitu eius ex medicina: et colluatur cum aqua frigida.	 If you need to repeat the medicine, do so: and after cauterization wipe the wound with a hot iron dipped in butter, and clean it with what is around the wound from the medicine: and wash it with cold water.
Et curetur extrinsecus cum embrocis, et deintus cum gargarismis, donec sanetur.	 And it is treated externally with embrocisions, and internally with gargarisms, until it heals.
Haec ergo species curationis est salubrior incisione et longinquior a timore.	 This kind of treatment is healthier than incision and farther from fear.
Et quandoque curatur uuula etiam cum eo quod est subtilius quam cauterium et incisio: curatur enim cum suffumigatione, secundum hunc modum.	 And sometimes the windpipe is also treated with something more subtle than cautery and incision: it is treated with suffusion in this manner.
Sume calamentum, et hyssopum, et origanum, et rutam, et sseah, et chamomillam, et abrotanum, et similia eis ex herbis: et aggrega ea omnia, aut quaedam eorum in olla, et submergantur cum aceto, et bulliant: et olla sit lutata cum luto decenter: et sit in medio ollae foramen, super quod componatur instrumentum concauum secundum hunc modum.	 Take calamus, hyssop, origanum, ruta, asafoetida, chamomile, abrotanum and similar herbs from the field: gather them all together, or some of them in a pot, immerse them with vinegar, boil it: the pot should be well coated with clay: and there should be a hole in the middle of the pot, over which a concave instrument is placed in this manner.
Fiat ex argento, aut aere: et intromittatur extremitas, in qua est granatum, in os infirmi, donec ascendat uapor ad uuulam super cannulam, donec obscuretur uuula multum.	 It should be made of silver or copper: and the tip, where there is a grain, is inserted into the sick man's mouth until the vapor rises to the windpipe through the cannula, until the windpipe becomes greatly obstructed.
Deinde itera super ipsam multotiens, donec arescat.	 Then repeatedly over it several times, until it burns.
Et caue, ne facias hanc curationem in principio aduentus apostematis.	 And be careful, not to perform this treatment at the beginning of an abscess's arrival.
Plaerumque enim addit in apostemate: et non oportet ut facias illud nisi apud declinationem apostematis eius calidi.	 For it is usually added to an abscess: and it should not be done except at the decline of the abscess's heat.
Si autem non est praesens tibi hoc instrumentum, tunc accipe cannam, et compone in extremitate eius corticem oui: ut non comburatur os infirmi: quoniam cortex oui prohibet uaporem comburere os: et haec est ex bona curatione cum salute.	 If this instrument is not present to you, then take a cannula and prepare the bark of an ox's horn at its tip: so that the sick man's bone is not burned: because the ox's horn bark prevents the vapor from burning the bone: and this is from good treatment with safety.
¶ De extractione spinarum, et ossium de gula.	 Chapter on the extraction of thorns and bones from the throat.
Caput XXXVIII.	 Chapter 38.
Multotiens adhaeret in gutture os, aut spina piscis, aut aliud.	 Often a bone or a fish's spine or something else adheres to the throat.
Oportet ergo ut extrahas quod ex eis est apparens super quod cadit uisus, postquam premis linguam cum instrumento apud solem, et declaratur tibi quod est in gutture.	 It is necessary therefore that you extract what appears visible on it where vision falls, after pressing the tongue with an instrument in the sun, and it is made clear to you that it is in the throat.
Et quod non apparet tibi et occultatur in gutture, oportet ut facias uomere infirmum antequam digeratur cibus in stomacho.	 And what is not visible to you and concealed in the throat, it is necessary that you make vomit before the food is digested in the stomach.
Fortasse enim egredietur res annexa per uomitum.	 Perhaps therefore it will come out the attached thing by vomiting.
Aut deglutiat infirmus frustum napi, aut radicem lactucae, aut deglutiat buccellam panis sicci: aut accipiat frustum spongiae marinae siccae lenis: et liga ipsum in filo, deinde deglutiat ipsum.	 Or the sick person should swallow a piece of nutmeg, or the root of lettuce, or a crumb of dry bread; or he should take a piece of dried sponge (soft): and bind it with thread, then he should swallow it.
Cum ergo peruenit ad locum ubi sunt spinae, aut os, et extrahitur, tunc egreditur.	 When therefore it reaches the place where there are thorns or bone, and it is extracted, then it comes out.
Si ergo non egreditur cum eo quod diximus: tunc utere instrumento ex plumbo secundum hanc formam.	 If therefore it does not come out as I said; then use an instrument of lead in this form.
Sit grossius quam Radius parumper, et in extremitate eius sit curuitas, quam intromittat in guttur suum cum facilitate: et ipse habeat caput suum eleuatum sursum.	 Let it be thicker than a finger joint, and at its end let there be a hollow, which he should introduce into his throat with ease; and let him have the head raised upward.
Et caueat a tactu suae epiglotis, ut non accidat ei tussis, et impellat cum eo os, aut spinam, aut intromittat ipsum medicus manu sua.	 And let him be careful to avoid touching his epiglottis, so that he does not cough; and push the bone or thorn with it, or the physician may insert it with his hand.
Verum quod infirmus intromittat, hoc est melius: propter scientiam suam de loco rei annexae: et impellat inferius, aut trahat manum suam cum instrumento sursum, totum illud secundum quantitatem quae praeparatur ei, donec egrediatur.	 But what the sick person inserts is better: because of his knowledge about the place of the attached thing; and he pushes it downward, or pulls his hand with the instrument upward, all of it according to its quantity that is prepared for him, until it comes out.
¶ De extractione Sanguisugae.	 Section on Extraction of Leeches.
Caput XXXIX.	 Chapter 39.
Quando medicatur sanguisuga cum eo quod dixi in diuisione ex curatione cum medicinis, et non confert, tunc considera in gutture infirmi coram sole, siue apud solem postquam premis linguam eius cum instrumento quod narraui tibi.	 When a leech is treated with what I said in the division of cure with medicines, and it does not function; then consider in the throat of the sick person before the sun, or after pressing his tongue with the instrument that I told you about.
Si ergo cadit uisus tuus super sanguisugam, extrahe eam cum uncino paruo, aut cum gesti subtilibus decenter.	 If therefore your sight falls upon a leech, remove it with a small hook, or with forceps carefully handled.
Quod si non est possibile cum eis: tunc accipe cannulam concauam, et intromitte eam in guttur infirmi usque prope guttur: deinde intromitte in concauitatem cannulae ferrum ignitum cum igne.	 If not possible with them (forceps or hook): then take a concave cane, insert it into the throat of the sick person up to its throat; afterwards insert the hot iron into the hollow of the cane.
Fac illud multotiens: et abstineat infirmus ab aqua tota die.	 Do this often: and let the sick person abstain from water all day.
Deinde accipiat uitreatam plenam aqua frigida, et aperiat os eius in ea: et colluat os suum cum ea, et non deglutiat ex ea aliquid: et moueat aquam una hora post aliam cum manu sua.	 Then let him take an enema full of cold water, and open his mouth in it; and clean his face with it, and drink nothing from it; and move the water one hour after another with his hand.
Sanguisuga enim ilico cum sentit aquam cadit.	 For a leech indeed drops off immediately when it feels the water.
Si autem non egreditur cum eo quod narrauimus, tunc suffumiga infirmum cum cimicibus, aut cum asa cum instrumento quod narraui in suffumigatione uuulae.	 If it does not drop off with what has been said, then fumigate the sick person with bed bugs or with sand in the fumigation of the throat (as described earlier).
Fac illud multotiens, quoniam ipsa cadet.	 Do this often, for it will drop off by itself.
Et modus operationis in suffumigatione est, ut accipias ollam, in qua sint prunae uiuae cum igne: et olla sit cooperta cum coopertorio, in cuius medio sit foramen: et componatur in illo foramine extremitas instrumenti.	 And the method of fumigation is that you take a pot with live prunes and fire; and let the pot be covered with a lid, in the middle of which there should be a hole; and arrange the end of the instrument in that hole.
Deinde proiice suffumigationem, et ponat infirmus os suum in extremitate cannulae, et claudat os suum, ut non egrediatur suffumigatio, donec scias quod suffumigatio iam peruenit ad sanguisugam.	 Then throw the fumigation, and let the sick person place his mouth at the end of the cane, and close it, so that the fumigation does not escape, until you know that the fumigation has reached the leech.
Nam sanguisuga statim cadet.	 For a leech immediately drops off.
Quod si non cadit, tunc itera suffumigationem multotiens.	 If it does not drop off, then repeat the fumigation often.
Et toleret infirmus sitim, et comedat salsa, et allia, et non bibat aquam.	 Let the sick person endure thirst, and eat salt and other foods, but drink no water.
Necesse est ergo ut egrediatur cum hoc regimine.	 Therefore it is necessary for it to drop off with this treatment.
Et haec est forma instrumenti cum quo extrahitur sanguisuga ex gutture, quando cadit super ipsam uisus.	 This is the form of the instrument with which a leech is removed from the throat when it falls upon the eyesight.
Est simile forcipibus, sicut uides: nisi quia est ei haee curuitas quae intromittitur ad guttur.	 The instrument is similar to forceps, as you see: except that it has this curvature which enters the throat.
Et extremitas eius similis ori auis quae nominatur ciconia, in quo est asperitas limae: quando comprehendit aliquid, non dimittit ipsum omnino.	 And its tip resembles a bird's beak called stork, where there is the roughness of a file: when it grasps something, it does not let go of it entirely.
¶ De apertione Apostematum, et eorum sectione, et cura in genere.	 On the opening of abscesses, their incision, and treatment in general.
Caput XL.	 Chapter XL.
Apostematum species sunt multae, multorum modorum, secundum quod uenit rememoratio eorum, scilicet unius, et unius in hoc libro: et sunt diuersae in perforatione eorum, et sectione ipsorum ex duobus modis.	 The species of abscesses are many, according to their recollection, that is, one and one within this book: and they differ in the perforation of them, and cutting of themselves by two methods.
Quorum unus est ex specie apostematis in seipso, et eo quod comprehendit ex humiditatibus.	 Of these, one is a species of abscess within itself, and it is grasped from humidities.
Et modus secundus est propter loca, in quibus accidit ex corpore.	 The second method is due to the places where it occurs from the body.
Quoniam apostema accidens in capite, est aliud ab apostemate accidente in ano: et apostema accidens in loco carnoso, est aliud ab apostemate accidente in iuncturis: et unicuique eorum est iudicium suum ex operatione.	 Since a tumor occurring on the head is different from a tumor occurring in the anus: and a tumor occurring in a fleshy place is different from a tumor occurring in joints: and each of them has its own judgment according to the operation.
Et ex apostematibus sunt quae non oportet ut perforentur, nisi post maturationem saniei in eis, et complementum eius: et ex eis sunt, quae oportet ut perforentur, dum sunt cruda, et non maturantur secundum complementum.	 And from tumors there are those which should not be pierced unless after the ripening of pus in them, and the completion of it: and there are those which should be pierced while they are raw, and do not ripen according to the completion.
Sicut apostemata quae sunt propinqua iuncturis.	 As tumors which are near joints.
Quoniam apostema quando accidit prope iuncturam, et prolongatur esse eius, donec putrefit quod est in circumitu eius fortasse corrumpuntur ligamenta, aut nerui illius iuncturae: quare est caussa propior contractionis illius membri.	 Since a tumor which occurs near a joint, and prolongs itself until it rots what is around it possibly corrupts the ligaments or nerves of that joint, therefore it is the cause of the limitation of that member.
Aut est apostema apud membrum principale: quoniam si tu tardas perforationem eius, donec maturetur, nocebit uel illi, uel per illud membro principali.	 Or it is a tumor near the main member: since if you delay piercing it until it ripens, it will harm either that member or through the main member.
Aut est prope anum, perfora ergo ipsum immaturum: et non oportet, ut perfores, apostema crudum, non completae digestionis, nisi quod est prope anum, ut non putrefiat profundum, et longetur ad interiora ani, et fiat fistula, aut fiat in termino eius quod non sanatur.	 Or it is near the anus, then pierce it while immature: and it is not necessary to pierce a raw tumor, not completed digestion, unless it is near the anus, so that it does not rot deeply, and extends to the interior of the anus, and becomes a fistula, or becomes at its end which does not heal.
Oportet ut scias horam perforationis apostematis, quod maturatum est secundum complementum: et est apud sedationem doloris, recessionem febris, et diminutionem rubedinis, et pulsationis, et acuitatem capitis apostematis: et reliqua signa.	 It is necessary that you know the hour of piercing the tumor, which has ripened according to completion: and it is in sedation of pain, retreat of fever, and decrease of redness, and pulsation, and acuity of headache of the tumor: and the remaining signs.
Et oportet, ut facias eandem perforationem in inferiori loco apostematis, et uehementioris eminentiae: et sit perforatio uadens in longitudine corporis, si apostemata sunt in partibus manuum et pedum, et locis lacertorum, et chordarum, et neruorum, et arteriarum, et ad ultimum in omnibus locis aequalibus, quibus non est reflexio.	 And it is necessary that you make the same incision in the lower place of the tumor, and more prominent: and the incision should be going in length of the body, if tumors are in parts of hands and feet, and places of arms, shoulders, cords, nerves, arteries, and finally in all places equal to those where there is no reflection.
In illis autem quae reflectuntur, uade cum perforatione secundum illud membrum.	 In those (things) that are reflected, proceed with a perforation according to that member.
Quando uero apostema est in locis carnosis: tunc melius est ut dimittas perforationem eius, donec confirmetur eius digestio, sicut diximus secundum complementum.	 If the abscess is in fleshy places, it is better to delay the perforation until its digestion is confirmed, as we have said in fullness.
Quoniam si tu perforas ipsum ante illud, prolongatur cursus uirus ex eo, et est multae sordis et sordiciei, et fortasse indurantur labia eius, et profunditas eius.	 Because if you perforate it before that, the course of the virus from it is prolonged, and there are many filths and impurities, and perhaps its edges harden and its depth increases.
Et quaedam apostemata perforantur secundum latitudinem corporis apud necessitatem: aut secundum illud quo indiget membrum.	 Some abscesses are to be perforated according to the width of the body in necessity, or according to that part where a member is needed.
Et oportet, ut administres in apostematibus paruis perforationem paruam, et in apostematibus magnis perforationem amplam: aut sectiones multas per similitudinem magnitudinis apostematis.	 And it is necessary that you administer small perforations to small abscesses, and large perforations to large abscesses, or many sections according to the similarity of the size of the abscesses.
Et sunt ex apostematibus, in quibus oportet ut concauetur cutis: et incidatur quando iam facta est sicut pannus, et facta est in termino, quod iam mortua est: sicut illud quod accidit in multis, ut dubelet, et bubonibus.	 And among abscesses, there are some in which the skin should be concaved: and cut when it has become like a cloth and made at the end that is already dead, as happens often with buboes and scrofula.
Et ex eis sunt quae secantur sectione habente tres angulos.	 And among these (abscesses) there are some which are to be cut by a section having three angles.
Et ex eis est, ex quo inciditur sicut figura folii myrti.	 And from these (abscesses), one is to be cut like the figure of a myrtle leaf.
Sicut apostema inguinum.	 Like an inguinal abscess.
Et ex eis sunt in quibus administratur sectio rotunda, et sectio lunaris: et similes eis ex sectionibus.	 And among these (abscesses), there are some in which a round incision is administered and a crescent-shaped incision, and similar ones from sections.
Illud uero cui non est caput, sicut sunt apostemata lenia superficialia, oportet ut perfores ipsum perforatione superficiali, uel plana tantum.	 However, that which has no head, such as superficial lenticular abscesses, it is necessary to perforate it by a shallow perforation or only superficially.
Et oportet, quando apostema est grossum, et iam collegit saniem multam, et perforas ipsum, ut non properes et extrahas pus totum in illa hora: imo extrahe ex ipso partem eius.	 And it is necessary that when the abscess is large and has collected a lot of pus, you perforate it so as not to expel all of the pus at once during that hour; rather, extract a part of it from it.
Deinde opila apostema usque ad diem alium.	 Then open the boil until another day.
Deinde extrahe quiddam ex pus iterum.	 Then draw out something from the pus again.
Fac illud multotiens secundum gradationem, donec egrediatur: praecipue si infirmus est debilis uirtutis, aut mulier praegnans, aut puer paruus, aur senex decrepitus: spiritus enim animalis ab animali multotiens resoluitur cum egressione saniei: et fortasse moritur infirmus, et tu non percipis.	 Do it often according to the degrees, until it is expelled: especially if the patient is weak or of poor vitality, or a woman who is pregnant, or a young child, or an old man in decay: for the animal spirit is many times resolved with the discharge of pus: and perhaps the sick person may die, and you will not benefit.
Caue ergo hoc capitulum cautela magna.	 Be therefore very careful about this chapter.
Et post perforationem tuam, qua ista perforas apostemata, oportet ut abstergas uulnus: et considera.	 And after your puncture, which you make on the boils, it is necessary to clean the wound: and reflect upon it.
Si ergo est uulnus apostematis paruum, aut est sectio plana, tunc administra licinia ex lino, aut coto antiquo.	 If the wound of the boil is small, or the incision is flat, then apply linen cloth or an old bandage.
Et si est apostema magnum, et fissurae perforationis multae sunt, oportet tunc ut intromittas in omnem fissuram licinium, donec perueniant adinuicem.	 And if the boil is large, and there are many cracks or openings in it, then you should insert linen into every crack until they meet on the other side.
Et si in apostemate abscidisti partem cutis, aut in circumitu concauasti eam: tunc oportet ut impleas eam coto ueteri, aut sicut quando texitur pannus, aut raditur lanugine lini absque humiditate: et stringe ipsum usque ad tertium diem.	 And if you have cut off a piece of skin from the boil, or hollowed out its surrounding area: then it is necessary to fill it with an old bandage, or as when fabric is woven, or shorn of linen wool without moisture: and tie it up for three days.
Deinde proiice ipsum, et cura illud cum eo quod oportet ex unguento, donec sanetur.	 Then expel it, and care for it with what is necessary from the ointment, until it heals.
Si autem accidat fluxus sanguinis in hora tuae operationis, tunc administra aquam frigidam, et acetum, postquam imbibitur in eis pannus: et ponis ipsum super locum fluxus sanguinis multotiens.	 If however bleeding occurs during your operation, then administer cold water and vinegar, after it has been absorbed by the cloth: and place it on the site of the bleeding many times.
Si autem perseuerat fluxus sanguinis, tunc oportet ut administres regimen, et curationem, et pulueres, quae narraui in locis multis huius nostri libri, et ex diuisione.	 If the bleeding continues, then it is necessary to administer treatment and care, and powders, as I have mentioned in many places of our book, and by division.
Si autem est in tempore hyemis, et locus apostematis est multorum neruorum: tunc oportet ut infundas puluillos cum uino, et oleo calidis: et ponas eos super loca.	 If it is winter time, and the site of the boil is near many nerves: then it is necessary to pour powders with wine and warm oil on them, and place them on the areas.
Et si fuerit in aestate, et loca sunt carnosa: tunc oportet ut ponas puluillos imbibitos in aqua, et oleo, aut eum uino et oleo, et totum illud frigidum.	 If it [the wound] is during summer and the places are fleshy: then it is necessary that you place lice soaked in water, or oil, or in wine and oil, and all of that cold.
Donec quando erit dies tertius, sicut diximus, tunc oportet ut soluas apostema, et abstergas ipsum, et administres in curatione eius quod ei conuenit, donec sanetur.	 Until the third day, as we said before, then it is necessary to dissolve the abscess, and remove it, and administer for its healing what is suitable for it until it heals.
Hoc est ergo quod necessarium est ex cognitione curationis apostematum uniuersaliter.	 This is therefore what is universally necessary in the knowledge of abscess treatment.
Secundum semitam uero distinctionis, iam dixi de omni apostemate, qualiter est uia ad curationem eius capitulatim singulariter.	 In fact, regarding the method of distinguishing [the type of abscess], as I have said about every abscess, how the way to treat it is done step by step has been set out individually.
¶ De sectione apostematum quae accidunt in cute capitis.	 Chapter on incision of abscesses occurring on the skin of the head.
Caput XLI.	 Chapter XL (40).
Accidunt in cute capitis apostemata parua, et sunt ex speciebus Nodorum, quos continent tunicae, quae sunt eis sacci: quasi ipsa sint hausolati gallinae.	 Small abscesses occur on the skin of the head, and are of the kind called knots, which are contained by the membranes that are sacs for them: they are as if they themselves were poulticed by chickens.
Et ipsorum species sunt multae.	 And their [the abscesses'] kinds are many.
Ex eis sunt pingues: et ex eis sunt quae continent humiditatem similem limo: et ex eis quae continent humiditatem similem frisatis et pultibus: et eis similibus, et ex eis sunt, quae sunt lapidea dura.	 Among them [the abscesses] are fat ones: and among them are those that contain a moisture similar to mud: and among them are those that contain a moisture similar to roasted and poulticed things: and similar to these, and among them are hard stone-like ones.
Et in sectione omnium, et ipsorum extractione non est timor, dum apud ipsorum sectionem non facit contrarietatem arteria.	 And in the incision of all [abscesses], and their removal there is no fear, as long as it does not make a contradiction with an artery at its incision.
Et operatio in sectione eorum est, ut experiaris ea cum instrumento, cuius forma uenit post haec, quod nominatur Intromissum, donec scias quid contineat.	 And the operation in their [the abscesses'] incision is that you try it with the tool whose shape comes later, which is called "Intromissum", until you know what it contains.
Nam si est illud quod continet humiditas, tunc seca ipsum sectione secundum longitudinem sectione superficiali: secundum hanc formam.	 For if it [the abscess] contains moisture, then cut it with a longitudinal incision according to the superficial section of this shape.
Et incipe cum sectione ex linea b. ad lineam, g. Cum ergo euacuatur humiditas, tunc excoria kistin quae continet illam humiditatem, et non dimittas ex ea aliquid penitus.	 And begin with a cut along line b to line g. Therefore, when the moisture is evacuated, then scab over the cyst that contains that moisture, and do not allow anything to remain deeply within it.
Multotiens enim redit, si remanet ex ea aliquid.	 For many times, if something remains in it, it will return.
Deinde submerge cotum in unguento aegyptio, si est praesens: et si non, in aqua et sale: et imple cum eo uulnus, et dimitte ipsum usque ad diem alium.	 Then immerse the wound in Egyptian ointment if it is present; and if not, in water and salt; and fill the wound with it and leave it until another day.
Ipsum enim corrodet quod remansit ex kisti.	 For it eats away what remains from the cyst.
Deinde itera super ipsum cotum cum aegyptio secundo, et tertio, et si indiges illo, donec confidas quia non remanserit ex kisti aliquid, tunc enim cura uulnus cum unguento, donec sanetur.	 Then repeatedly apply Egyptian ointment on the wound twice, and thrice, and as much as needed, until you are sure that nothing remains from the cyst; then take care of the wound with the ointment until it is healed.
Quod si apostema continet nodum pinguem: tunc seca ipsum secundum hanc formam, sectione habente formam crucis: et proiice uncinos inter duolabia sectionis, et excoria ipsum ab omni parte: et conare uirtutem tuam in extractione tunicae quae continet ipsum.	 If the boil contains a thick knot: then cut it in this shape, with a cross-like incision; and insert probes between the folds of the incision, and scab over it from all sides; and strive for your strength in the extraction of the membrane that contains it.
Si autem contrarietatem facit tibi arteria, tunc fac illud quod narrabo tibi post.	 If an artery opposes you, then do what I will tell you later.
Et similiter fac in apostemate, si est lapideum, ex sectione, et curatione eadem, secundum quod diximus.	 And similarly do for a boil that is hard (or solid), through incision and the same treatment, as we have said.
Et sectio super apostema lapideum est facilior: quoniam est pauci sanguinis et humiditatis.	 Incision on a hard (or solid) boil is easier because there is little blood and moisture.
Et quandoque sunt quaedam horum apostematum quae sunt in capite in quibusdam hominibus, cum quibus penitus non est humiditas.	 Sometimes there are such boils on the head of some people where there is no deep moisture.
Quod est: quia ego secui super apostema in capite mulieris uetulae, et inueni apostema sicut lapis solidus et durus, asper, albus, qui non poterat frangi: et si percuteretur cum eo aliquis proiiciendo, uulnerat ipsum.	 This is: because I have made an incision on a woman's old boil on the head, and found the boil to be as hard and solid as a stone, rough, white, which could not be broken; and if anyone struck it with force, he would wound himself.
In aliis uero apostematibus accidentibus in capite, praeter haec scilicet apostemata quae accidunt in capitibus puerorum, et apud radices aurium, sectio eorum omnium sit sectio superficialis.	 In other cases of boils in the head, except for those boils that occur in children's heads and near the roots of ears, a section of all of them should be a surface cut.
Vel pone perforationem eorum semper ab inferiori parte eorum, ut alleuietur cursus saniei ad inferiora.	 Always make a perforation from below their part (boils) to alleviate the course of pus towards lower areas.
Deinde cura ea cum eo quod conuenit eis ex curatione.	 Then, care for this (the wound) with whatever is suitable for it in terms of treatment.
¶ De sectione Strophularum in collo.	 Section on the Strangulated Hernia in the neck.
Caput XLII.	 Chapter XLII.
Multotiens acccidunt ista apostemata in collo, et sub assellis, et inguinibus: et quandoque accidunt in reliquo corpore.	 These boils often occur in the neck and under the buttocks, and sometimes they occur in other parts of the body.
Et super illa quae ex eis accidunt in collo, sunt unum, et multa: et generantur ab inuicem: et omnis Strophula ex eis est intra tunicam propriam ei, sicut est in nodis et apostematibus capitis, sicut narrauimus.	 Above these (boils) that occur on the neck are one and many; they originate from one another; and every strangulated hernia among them is within its own sheath, as is the case with knots and boils of the head, as we have said.
Et species harum Strophularum sunt multae.	 And the types of these (strangulated hernias) are many.
Et ex eis enim sunt lapideae: et ex eis sunt quae continent humiditates: et ex eis sunt malignae, quae non obediunt curationi.	 For among them there are those that are stone-like; and among them there are those that contain moisture; and among them there are malignant ones that do not obey treatment.
In illa ergo quam ex eis uides bonae dispositionis in tactu, cuius manifestum est propinquum colori cutis, et mouetur ad omnem partem, et non est annexa cum neruis colli, neque cum guidegi, neque cum arteria, neque est profunda: oportet ut seces eam sectione superficiali a superiori parte ad inferiorem partem corporis ex linea, b. ad lineam, g. et excoria eam ab omni parte: et extende duo labia cutis cum uncino, aut cum uncinis multis, si indiges illo, sicut diximus in apostematibus capitis, et extrahe eam paulatim.	 In the good one that you see among them, whose manifestly close to the skin color and moves in all directions, and is not attached with the neck muscles, nor with the buttocks, nor with the artery, nor deep; it is necessary to cut it through a surface cut from its upper part to its lower body part along the line b to the line g. And scrape it off from every side: and spread the two skin flaps with a scalpel or multiple scalpels if necessary, as we have said for boils of the head, and remove it gradually.
Et est super cautelam, ut non incidatur uena, aut neruus.	 And it is advisable to be careful not to cut a vein or nerve.
Et sit spatumile non acutum ualde: ut non addat tibi manum tuam cum incisione, aut inquietet infirmum, et incidas quod non est necesse.	And let the lancet not be very sharp: so that it does not cut your hand with the incision, or disturb the sick one, and you shall incise what is necessary.
Si autem incidis uenam, aut arteriam, aut prohibet te ab operatione, tunc pone in uulnus zegi tritum, aut quosdam pulueres qui abscindunt sanguinem, et stringe uulnus, et dimitte ipsum, donec quiescat acuitas apostematis, et mollificetur uulnus: uel incipit et uult putrefieri.	 If you cut a vein or an artery, or it prevents you from operating, then place in the wound alum powdered, or certain powders that absorb blood, and tie the wound, and leave it alone until the sharpness of the abscess subsides and the wound becomes soft: or if it begins to rot.
Nam sanguis abscinditur tuncia Redi ergo ad operationem tuam, donec compleas.	 For the blood is withdrawn, cut off the tunica. Return then to your operation until you have finished.
Deinde inquire digito tuo indice, si remansit aliquid ex Strophulis aliis paruis: ergo incide eas, et munda eas.	 Then examine with your index finger if there remains anything of the Strophulus (sutures) or small ones: therefore cut them and clean them.
Quod si est in radice Strophulae uena magna: tunc oportet ut non incidas illam Strophulam ex radice sua: imo oportet ut liges eam cum filo duplato forti, et dimittas eam donec cadat per se absque nocumento.	 If there is a large vein in the root of the suture: then it must not be cut from its root; instead it must be tied with a strong double thread and left until it falls off by itself without harm.
Deinde imple uulnus coto ueteri, quod iam submersisti in unguento aegyptio.	 Then fill the wound with old linen cloth that you have previously soaked in Egyptian ointment.
Deinde cura ipsum.	 Then take care of it (the wound).
Si inciditur Strophula tota, tunc oportet ut aggreges labia duo uulneris: et suas ipsum statim, postquam uides quia prorsus non remansit superfluitas.	 If the suture is cut off completely, then the wound edges should be brought together: and sew it immediately, after you see that there is no superfluity remaining.
Si autem uides quod remansit superfluitas propter magnitudinem Strophulae, tunc oportet ut intendas ad incidendam radicem eius, et extrahendam eam: et administra suturam quam diximus.	 If you see that there remains superfluity due to the size of the suture, then it must be intended to cut off its root and extract it: and administer the suture as I have said.
Et quae ex Strophulis continet humiditates, perfora illam perforatione superficiali: ut appareat tibi locus maturitatis eius: et pone perforationem ab eo quod sequitur inferius corporis, sicut diximus.	 And what contains humidity among the sutures, perforate it with a superficial perforation: so that the place of its maturity appears to you: and place the perforation from where it follows below the body, as I have said.
Deinde administra post perforationem licinia cum unguento, et similia eis, ut corrodat quod remansit ex corruptione, donec quando uides uulnus iam mundatum esse: tunc cura ipsum cum unguento generatiuo carnis, donec sanetur.	 Then administer after perforation linseed with ointment, and similar ones, to corrode what remains from corruption, until when you see the wound already clean: then care for it with regenerative flesh ointment, until it heals.
¶ De sectione Epiglotis ab apostemate intra guttur accidente.	 On section of Epiglottis due to gangrene occurring within the throat.
Caput XLIII.	 Chapter XLIII.
Dixerunt antiqui hanc sectionem in Epigloti, et non uidi aliquem in terra nostra, qui eam fecerit: et haec est scriptura sermonis eorum.	 The ancients spoke of this section in the Epiglottis, and I have not seen anyone in our land who has done it; this is their writing.
In habentibus autem synanchiam, oportet ut deuitetur sectio Epiglotis: cum non fiat iuuamentum per illud: propterea, quod omnes uenae et pulmo sunt infirmi.	 However, in those with synanchema (a type of choking), it is necessary to avoid section of the Epiglottis: because no benefit arises from it, for all veins and lungs are weakened.
In illis uero qui habent apostema calidum in ore, aut gutture, aut duabus amigdalis, quando non est aegritudo in cannali, oportet uti sectione Epiglotis, ad fugiendum ex perditione quae fit ex praefocatione.	 However, in those who have a hot gangrene in the mouth, or throat, or both molars, when there is no discomfort in the nasal cavity, it is necessary to use section of the Epiglottis to escape from the danger that arises due to suffocation.
Oportet ergo quando uolumus illud, ut secemus Epiglotim sub tribus circulis Epiglotis, aut quatuor, sectione parua per latitudinem, in eo quod est inter duos circulos per quantitatem, quod sit sectio in sifac, non in cartilagine: et iste quidem locus est conueniens sectioni, quoniam est priuatus carne, et uasa sanguinis ab eo sunt longinqua.	 Therefore, when we wish to do that (section of Epiglottis), it should be done under three or four rings of the Epiglottis, with a small section along its width, in the place between two rings by quantity, which is the section in sifac (a cartilage) not in cartilage: and this place is suitable for section because it lacks flesh, and the blood vessels from it are distant.
Quod si medicator est timidus, tunc oportet ut extendat cutem gutturis cum uncino.	 If the physician is afraid, then it is necessary that he stretches the throat skin with a spatula.
Deinde findat cutem, donec quando peruenit ad cannalem: deuitet uas sanguinis, si uidet ex eis aliquid.	 Then divide the skin until you reach the nasal cavity: avoid blood vessels if you see anything from them.
Deinde secet sifac quod narrauimus: et significatur super sectionem cannalis ex phlegmate quod egreditur ex ea, cum eo quod disrumpitur, et abscisione uocis.	 Then cut the sifac as we mentioned: and it is signified by the phlegm that comes out of it, with what breaks open, and separation of the voice.
Et dimitte uulnus apertum tempore aliquo.	 Let the open wound heal at some time.
Cum ergo remouetur hora in qua timetur praefocatio, aggrega duo labia uulneris cutis, et sue ipsam solam absque cartilagine.	 When the hour is removed when fear of putrefaction exists, bring together two lips of the wound skin, and either that alone without cartilage.
Deinde administra medicinas quae faciunt nasci carnem, usquequo sanetur.	 Then administer medications that cause flesh to grow until it is healed.
Inquit Albucasis.	 Says Albucasis.
Summa huius sermonis quem narrauimus, expositio non est, nisi quando uident, quod aliquod horum apostematum iam opilauit guttur infirmi: et sublimatus est infirmus super mortem, et uult intersecari anhelitus eius: uadunt ad secandum Epiglotim, ut respiret infirmus super locum uulneris quadam respiratione, et saluetur a morte: et propter hoc praeceperunt dimittere uulnus apertum, donec consumatur malicia aegritudinis, et est malicia eius tribus diebus, et quasi ipsa: tunc ergo praecaeperunt suere uulnus, et curare ipsum, donec sanetur.	 The sum of this discourse which I have told is an explanation only when it appears that one of these abscesses has already opened the throat of the sick: and he is raised up on death, and wishes to be cut; they go to the Epiglottis to breathe, so that the sick person may breathe over the place of the wound by a certain breathing, and be saved from death: and for this reason they commanded to let the open wound, until the malignancy of the disease is consumed, and the malignancy of it is for three days and almost as if itself: then therefore they commanded to sew up the wound, and care for it until it is healed.
Et illud quod uidi per me ipsum est, quod una ancilla accaepit cultellum, et misit cum in guttur suum, et incidit cum eo partem cannalis pulmonis.	 And that which I saw myself is that a maidservant took a knife, and sent it into her own throat, and cut a part of the windpipe.
Et uocatus sum ad curationem eius, et inueni eam mugire, sicut est mugitus mortui.	 And I was called to treat her, and found her to moan, as is the moaning of the dead.
Detexi ergo a uulnere, et inueni sanguinem qui egressus fuerat ex uulnere paruum.	 I then uncovered (the wound), and found blood that had come out from the wound to be little.
Confisus ergo sum, quod ipsa non absciderat uenam, neque guidegi: et uentus egrediebatur ex uulnere.	 Therefore I was reassured that she had not cut the vein nor artery: and wind came out from the wound.
Properaui ergo, et sui uulnus, et curaui ipsum, donec sanum est: et non accidit ancillae aliquid, nisi raucedo in uoce: et rediit post dies ad meliorem dispositionum suarum.	 I therefore approached and sewed up her wound, and cured it until she was well: and nothing happened to the maidservant, except a hoarseness in her voice: and she returned after days to a better state of health.
Hinc ergo dico: quod in sectione Epiglotis non est timor.	 Therefore I say: that there is no fear in cutting the Epiglottis.
¶ De sectione Herniae gutturis.	 On the operation for hernia of the neck (of the intestine).
Caput XLIIII.	 Chapter XLIIII.
Hoc Apostema nominatum Hernia gutturis, est apostema magnum, secundum colorem corporis: et est in mulieribus multum.	 This is called a hernia of the neck (gutturis), which is a large abscess, according to the color of the body; and it occurs in women much.
Et est secundum duos modos: aut enim est naturale: aut est accidentale.	 It follows two ways: for it is either natural or accidental.
In naturali certe non est ingenium.	 In the natural, it certainly is not a congenital condition.
Accidentale uero est secundum duos modos: quorum unus est similis nodis pinguibus.	 The accidental (one) is of two types: one of which resembles fatty nodes.
Et modus alter, est similis apostemati quod fit ex nodatione arteriae.	 And the second type, it is similar to an abscess which occurs due to the knotting of an artery.
Et in ipso est timor, et non oportet ut praesumptio fiat ad ipsum cum ferro, nisi in eo quod est paruum: et tu proba ipsum, et inuestiga ipsum cum Intromisso.	 And there is fear (risk) involved in it, and it should not be presumed to cut it with a knife unless it is small; examine it and investigate it using a probe.
Si ergo inuenis ipsum simile nodo pingui, et non est suspensum cum aliqua uenarum: tunc seca ipsum, sicut secantur nodi: et extrahe ipsum cum eo quod continet ex kisti, si est in kisti: et si non, tunc perscrutare totum eius.	 If you find it similar to a fatty node and it is not suspended with any veins; then cut it off as knots are cut off, and extract it along with what contains it from the cyst, if there is one in the cyst; and if not, then explore the entire area thoroughly.
Deinde cura locum cum eo quod oportet ex curatione, donec sanetur.	 Then care for the place (area) with what is required for healing, until it heals.
¶ De sectione super species Nodorum.	 Chapter on Surgery of Nodes.
Caput XLV.	 Chapter XLV.
Nodorum multae sunt species, et ego iam dixi omnes species eorum in diuisione: et oportet ut narrem hic differentiam inter Nodum, et Exituram: cum sit dubitationem faciens.	 There are many kinds of nodes, and I have already said all their species in division; it is necessary that I here explain the difference between a node and an abscess, as there may be doubt about it.
Dico ergo, quod cum Exitura est caliditas, et febris, et dolores uehementes, donec sedatur ebullitio superfluitatis, et completur putrefactio: tunc enim quiescunt febris et calor.	 Therefore, when an abscess is present, there is heat, fever, and intense pain, until the boiling of excess fluid subsides and the putrefaction is completed; then the fever and heat subside.
Cum Nodo uero non est caliditas, neque febris, neque dolores, et continet eos kistis sifachin, qui est eis saccus proprius, et est secundum colorem corporis: et est incaeptio eorum sicut cicer, et fit sicut batecha, et maior et minor.	 A node, however, is not accompanied by heat or fever or pain; it contains them in a cyst or sac proper to them, which is of the color of the body; and it develops like a chickpea (cicer) or a pouch (batecha), and it can be large or small.
Et sunt secundum duas species: aut pingues: aut continent humiditatem.	 And they are according to two types: either fatty; or containing moisture.
Et colores humiditatis sunt multi, secundum quod dixi in diuisione.	 Colors of moisture are many, as I have said in the division.
Oportet ergo, quando peruenis ad curationem Nodi, ut experiaris eum, et inquiras ipsum in primis cum instrumento quod nominatur Intromissum, secundum quod ueniet forma eius in capitulo quod est post hoc.	 Therefore, when you come to the treatment of a Node, it is necessary that you examine it first and investigate it with the instrument called Probe, according to its form which will be found in the chapter following this.
Et modus inquisitionis apostematum, et Nodorum omnium est, ut accipias hoc instrumentum, et intromittas ipsum in humidiorem locum, quem inuenis in apostemate: et tu reuolue digitos tuos cum eo paulatim, donec scias quod instrumentum iam penetrauit cutem.	 The method of investigation for boils and all nodes is that you take this instrument, and insert it into the moist place which you find in the boil: and you rotate your fingers with it gradually until you know that the instrument has already penetrated the skin.
Deinde ultima manum tuam secundum mensuram magnitudinis apostematis.	 Then, place your hand on it according to the measurement of the size of the boil.
Deinde extrahe Intromissum, et considera illud quod egrediur in uestigio eius.	 Then remove the Probe and observe what comes out with its trace.
Si ergo egreditur humiditas currens, quicunque color sit: tunc seca ipsum sectione superficiali, secundum quod dixi in reliquis apostematibus.	 If moisture flows out running with any color, then cut it off by a superficial incision as I said in the other boils.
Et si non egreditur humiditas in uestigio Intromissi, tunc scias quia est pinguis: seca ergo super ipsum sectione habente formam crucis, secundum formam hanc, sicut docui te: et suspende ipsum cum uncinis, et excoria cutem ab omni parte cum facilitate: et custodi kistin si potes super illud, ut extrahas ipsam sanam cum Nodo.	 If no moisture flows out with the trace of the Probe, then you will know that it is fatty; cut off above it with an incision in the shape of a cross as I taught you: and peel the skin from all sides with ease: and protect the box if possible on top of it to draw out the healthy one along with the Node.
Si autem disrumpitur kistis apud operationem, et non est possibile extrahere ipsam sanam, multotiens enim accidit illud, tunc extrahe ipsam frustatim, donec non remaneat ex ea aliquid.	 If the box bursts during the operation and it is not possible to draw out the healthy one, then remove it in pieces until there remains something from it.
Nam si remanet ex ea aliquid parum, aut multum, redit Nodus secundum plurimum.	 For if a little or much remains from it, the Node returns most frequently.
Quod si uincit te, et remanet ex eo parum: tunc imple uulnus apud completionem tuam, quibusdam pulueribus corrosiuis acutis: et stringe uulnus, et pone supra ipsum quod sedet apostema calidum, et cura ipsum cum reliqua curatione, donec sanetur.	 If it overpowers you and a little remains from it: then fill the wound at its completion with some corrosive sharp powders: and tie the wound, and place hot on top of it where the boil sits and cure it with the rest of the treatment until it heals.
Si ergo est Nodus magnus, tunc sue duo labia eius, et cura ipsum cum eo quod incarnat.	 If therefore it is a large knot, then its two folds (or lips), and take care of it along with what surrounds it as it becomes inflamed.
Si autem est tibi contraria uena pulsatilis, aut non pulsatilis: tunc propera, et imple locum zegi trito, et dimitte ipsum strictum duobus diebus, aut tribus, donec putrefiat uulnus, et quiescat ebullitio sanguinis: deinde redi ad incidendum illud quod remansit ex Nodo.	 If it is a pulsating vein or non-pulsating vein for you: then approach (the area), fill the place with linen cloth, and leave it compressed for two or three days until the wound rots and the boiling of blood subsides; afterwards return to cut what remains from the knot.
¶ De foris instrumentorum pro sectione et perforatione.	 § On the tools for cutting and piercing (incision and perforation).
Caput XLVI.	 Chapter XLVI.
EX Eis sunt formae Intromissorum, et sunt trium specierum.	 There are forms of probes, and there are three kinds.
Ex eis enim est magnum, et ex eis est medium, et ex eis est paruum.	 Among them is the large one, among them is the medium-sized one, and among them is the small one.
Fiant ex ferro alfulud quadratarum extremitatum decenter, ut festinent introitum in apostemate.	 Let them be made of iron in a square shape at the ends properly, so that they can quickly enter into the cavity (or incision).
Et istae sunt formae Experientium, et no, id est, perforantia: et unum eorum nominatur beris, idest, peforans: et sunt trium specierum.	 And these are the forms of probes, and noses (or perforating tools): one of them is called a beris, which means piercing; they are three kinds.
Ex eis enim est magnum, et medium, et paruum.	 Among them is the large one, among them is the medium-sized one, and among them is the small one.
Conueniunt, ut inuestigentur per ea apostemata, et exiturae, et fistulae, et bubones ab eo quod inter ea est ex ossibus.	 They come together to be inserted into cavities (or incisions), and for emptying out boils and fistulas, and abscesses that are between the bones.
Et aliis fiunt rotunda, tersa, lenia, sicut acus magnae quibus subsellia suuntur, ex citrino scilicet, aut ex aere, aut ferro, aut argento.	 And others are round, smooth, and flexible, such as the large needles that are used for sewing; they are made of citron (wood), or brass, iron, or silver.
Et meliora eorum sunt quae fiunt ex citrino.	 The better ones are those which are made from citron (wood).
Et fiunt Experientia etiam de plumbo nigro, quae conueniunt ut per ea experiantur fistulae, quarum concauitate sunt reflexiones, ut reflectantur cum lenitate sua cum illis reflexionibus.	 And probes are also made of black lead, which come together to be inserted into the concave part of the fistulas so that they can be reflected with their smoothness along with those reflections.
Et sunt iterum trium specierum.	 They are again three kinds.
Quoniam ex eis sunt longa, ex eis media, et ex eis breuia, secundum quantitatem amplitudinis fistulae et stricturae eius.	 Because among them are long ones, medium ones, and short ones, according to the quantity of the fistula's or constriction's width.
Forma Vncinorum, et sunt multarum specierum.	 The forms of veins, and there are many species.
Quoniam ex eis sunt simplices, scilicet quibus est curuitas una: et sunt trium specierum sicut uides, Magni, Medii, et Parui.	 Because among them are simple ones, that is, those with one opening; and there are three species as you see, Large, Medium, and Small.
Et ex eis sunt Vncini caeci: et sunt trium specierum.	 And among them are blind veins; and there are three species.
Et ex eis sunt uncini habentes duas curuaturas, et sunt trium specierum: et ex eis sunt uncini habentes tres curuaturas, et sunt trium specierum: et omnes isti sunt necessarii in loco suo.	 And among them are veins having two openings; and there are three species of these: and among them are veins having three openings; and there are three species of these; and all of these are necessary in their place.
Et istae sunt formae Scalpellorum, quibus secantur et excoriantur Nodi, et apostemata: et sunt trium specierum: quoniam ex eis est magnum, medium, et paruum.	 And these are the shapes of scalpels, with which knots and swellings are cut and scraped; and there are three species: because among them is large, medium, and small.
Eorum extremitates quibus fit sectio sunt acutae, extremitates aliae sunt non acutae: et non ponuntur taliter, nisi ut cum eis fiat iuuamentum in excoriatione Nodorum apud timorem incisionis uenae, aut nerui: et ut sanetur per ea infirmus, et inueniat tranquillitatem parumper ex adustione quam inuenit apud excoriationem apostematis.	 The extremities by which the section is made are sharp, other extremities are not sharp; and they are not placed thus except for assistance in scraping knots near fear of vein or nerve incision; and so that the weak may be healed by it, and find temporary relief from the heat as found during the scraping of swellings.
Istae sunt Magda, et sunt specierum trium.	 These are called Magda, and there are three species of them.
Fiunt ex aere, et sunt similia Radio, cum quo fit alcohol: et in extremitate lata est puncta Spatumilis occultata: et in ea currit ad interiora, et ad exteriora quando uis, sicut uides.	 They are made of copper and are similar to a syringe with which alcohol is made; and at the wide end there is a hidden hole called Spatumilis; and it runs inside or outside as desired, as you see.
Forma Spatumilium quae absconduntur inter digitos apud perforationem apostematum: et non percipiunt ea infirmi: et sunt trium specierum, magnum, medium, et paruum.	 The form of the Spatumiliums hidden among the fingers for perforating swellings; and these are not taken by the sick; and there are three species, large, medium, and small.
Fomae Ventosarum cum quibus abscinditur fluxus sanguinis: et sunt trium specierum, magnae, mediae, et paruae.	 The shapes of the Ventosarum with which blood flow is cut off; and there are three species, large, medium, and small.
Fiant ex aere, aut citrino, rotundae, ad longitudinem parumper, sicut uides: et sint ad subtilitatem.	 Make round ones from copper or brass, slightly shorter in length as you see, and let them be delicate.
Et oportet ut sint istae species Ventosarum apud te magnae, et paruae: ut abscindas per eas sanguinem cum uelocitate apud necessitatem, et tunc quando non est tibi praesens medicina.	 These (species of) ventosas should be large and small with you, so that you can cut blood quickly in case of need, and then when there is no medicine present for you.
Verumtamen non utaris eis in abscisione sanguinis in omni loco corporis, et non utaris nisi in locis carnosis: sicut lacertis cruris, et coxae, et lacertis brachiorum, et mammillarum, et uentris, et inguinum, et similibus eis, ex lacertis carnosis, humidis.	 However, do not use them (ventosas) for the cutting of blood in every part of the body, and do not use them except in fleshy places: such as arms (lacerti cruris), thighs (coxae), arms (lacerti brachiorum), breasts (mammillarum), abdomen (uentris), groin (inguinum), and similar (places) from fleshy parts, wet.
Et quandoque fiunt ex eis instrumenta parua alia similia corticibus fisticorum, secundum suam formam: quibus abscinditur sanguis quando fluit ex loco phlebotomiae, aut apud incisionem uenae, aut arteriae: et quandoque fiunt ex eis rotundae secundum hanc formam.	 And sometimes they (ventosas) are made into small instruments similar to the fists of boxers, according to their shape, with which blood is cut when it flows from the site of phlebotomy or incision of a vein or artery; and sometimes they are made round in this shape.
¶ De cura Mammillarum hominum quae mammillis mulierum assimilantur.	 Chapter on the care of human breasts, which resemble the breasts of women.
Caput XLVII.	 Chapter XLVII. (47)
Quandoque inflantur Mammillae quorundam hominum apud complementum somni (id est, cum incipiunt pollui in somno) donec similantur mammillis mulierum: et remanent apostemosae foede.	 Sometimes the breasts of some men swell during sleep (that is, when they begin to become dirty in sleep), until they resemble the breasts of women and remain as foul wounds.
Qui ergo abhorret illud, oportet ut secet super mammillas sectione lunari, secundum hanc formam ex linea, b. ad lineam, g. Deinde excoria pinguedinem totam.	 Whoever dislikes this (condition), let him cut the breasts with a lunar incision, according to this shape from line 'a' to line 'b', and then scrape off all the fat 'g'.
Postea imple uulnus ex medicamine incarnatiuo.	 Then fill the wound with a healing ointment.
Deinde aggrega duo labia uulneris cum sutura, et cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	 Then gather two lips of the wound with suture and take care of it until it heals.
Si autem declinat mammilla ad inferiora, et mollificatur propter magnitudinem suam, sicut accidit mulieribus: tunc oportet ut findatur in duobus lateribus suis superioribus duabus sectionibus similibus figurae lunari, quarum unaquaeque continetur cum altera apud fines utriusque, donec sit linea maior continens minorem, secundum hanc formam ex linea, b. ad lineam, g. Postea excoria cutem quae est inter duo labia, et aufer pinguedinem, et administra quod diximus de sutura et pulueribus, quod est necessarium ex curatione, donec sanetur.	 If the breast has descended towards the lower part and softened due to its size, as happens with women; then it is necessary to open it in two upper sections like a lunar incision, each of which contains the other at their ends so that the larger line encloses the smaller, according to this shape from line 'a' to line 'b', and then scrape off the skin between the two lips, remove the fat, and apply what has been said about suture and powders necessary for healing until it heals.
Si autem non comples incisionem eius quod oportet te incidere, propter inquietudinem infirmi, aut propter fluxum sanguinis: tunc oportet ut impleas uulnus coto submerso unguento corrosiuo, et dimitte ipsum, donec corrodat illud quod remansit ex pinguedine.	 If however you do not close the incision as required because of the restlessness of the sick, or because of bleeding: then it is necessary that you fill the wound with a linen bandage soaked in a corrosive ointment, and leave it until it corrodes what remains of the fat.
Deinde cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	 Then care for it until it heals.
¶ De perforatione apostematis, quod accidit sub Titillico.	 On the Perforation of an Aboarted Boil, which happens under the armpit.
Caput XLVIII.	 Chapter XLVIII.
Ista apostemata quae accidunt sub Titillico, sunt ex speciebus Strophularum dura, quae continet kistis, et ex eis sunt quae continent humiditates.	 These aborted boils which occur under the armpit are of the type of cysts that contain coagula, and among them are those containing liquids.
Quae ergo sunt ex eis quae continent humiditates, oportet ut secentur sectione lunari, secundum hanc formam, ex linea b. ad lineam, g. cum ergo euacuatur totum quod est in apostemate ex sanie, tunc imple ipsum coto ueteri, et dimitte ipsum usque ad diem alium.	 Those which contain liquids should be opened by a lunar incision according to this form, from line b to line g. When everything within the abscess has been evacuated through draining, then fill it with an old linen cloth and leave it until the next day.
Deinde auferatur cotum, et curetur cum unguento conueniente ad illud, donec sanetur.	 Then remove the linen cloth, and treat it with a suitable ointment until it heals.
Quod si apostema fuerit ex specie nodorum Strophularum, tunc scinde super ipsum, sicut diximus in sectione super Strophulas aequaliter.	 If the abscess is of the type of knotty cysts, then cut it open as we said regarding incision on cysts equally.
Si autem extenditur uulnus in hoc ut emittat pus, tunc administra in eo cauterium, secundum quod diximus in eo quod praemissum est.	 If the wound extends so as to emit pus, then administer cautery to it, according to what we said regarding cautery in the preceding section.
¶ De sectione apostematis quod accidit propter Arteriam et Venam.	 On incision of an abscess which occurs due to an artery and vein.
Caput XLIX.	 Chapter XLIX.
Quando disrumpitur Arteria, et consolidatur cutis quae est supra eam, tuno multotiens accidit inde apostema: et similiter accidit Venae etiam, ut accidat in ea apostema et inflatio.	 When an artery bursts and the skin above it thickens, there often results an abscess; similarly, a vein can also break, causing an abscess and swelling to occur in it.
Et signa quibus cognoscitur, quod apostema et inflatio sint propter Arteriam et Venam, sunt: quoniam, quando apostema est propter arteriam, est longum, aggregatum in profundo corporis: et quando impellis apostema digits tuis, sentis quasi sit ei stridor.	 And the signs by which an abscess and swelling are recognized as being due to an artery or vein are: because when the abscess is due to an artery, it is long and aggregated in the depth of the body; and when you press the abscess with your fingers, it feels like a grating sensation.
Et illud quod est propter Venam, est rotundum in manifesto corporis.	 That which is for the Vein, is round in the evident body.
Et sectio super hoc apostema est error, et praecipue quod est sub ascellis, et inguinibus, et collo, et in locis multis corporis: et est magnum ualde.	 And the incision above this abscess is an error, and particularly so when it is under armpits, groins, neck, and in many parts of the body; and it is very large.
Oportet ergo ut deuitetur eius cura cum ferro, et quod ex eis etiam est in extremitatibus, aut in capite, oportet ut deuitetur.	 Therefore, care with the iron should be avoided from it, and what is also on its extremities, or in the head, should be avoided.
Super illud ergo quod ex eis est ex inflatione orificii Arteriae, finde in cute sectione in longitudine.	 Therefore, over that which is due to the swelling of the artery opening, find an incision in the skin in length.
Deinde aperi sectionem cum uncinis, postea Arteriam: et libera eam ex tunicis, donec detegatur.	 Then open the incision with scissors, afterwards the artery; and free it from tunics until it is exposed.
Deinde intromitte sub ea acum, et fac eam penetrare usque ad latus aliud, et stringe Arteriam cum filo duplo in duobus locis, secundum quod docui te in extractione duarum Arteriarum quae sunt in timporibus.	 Then insert the point beneath it and make it penetrate to the other side, and tie the artery with double thread in two places, according to what I taught you regarding the extraction of two arteries that are in the temples.
Deinde punge locum, qui est inter duo ligamenta cum spatumili, donec egrediatur sanguis qui est in eo totus, et soluatur apostema.	 Then prick the place which is between two ligaments with a lancet until all the blood that is in it flows out, and the abscess is solved.
Deinde administra curationem quae generat pus, donec cadant ligamenta: postea cura illud cum unguentis conuenientibus ad illud, donec sanetur.	 Then administer a treatment that generates pus until the ligaments fall; afterwards take care of it with appropriate ointments until it heals.
Quod si fuerit apostema propter sectionem Venae, tunc oportet ut teneas manu tua quod tibi possibile est ex apostemate cum cute.	 If the abscess is due to a vein incision, then you must hold with your hand what you can from the abscess with the skin.
Deinde intromitte acum sub loco quem tenuisti manu tua, et fac eam penetrare: et sit in ea filum duplum, donec extrahas ipsum ex latere altero.	 Then insert the point beneath the place you held with your hand, and make it penetrate; and let there be a double thread in it until you draw it out from the other side.
Deinde liga cum ipso apostema ligamento bono: secundum quod dixi tibi in ligamento uuae, a duabus partibus cum duabus extremitatibus fili.	 Then tie the abscess with a good ligament; according to what I told you regarding a vein ligament, from two parts with two ends of the thread.
Si autem times quod extrahatur filum, tunc intromitte acum aliam cum filo alio sub apostemate toto apud incisionem acus: preme, et stringe fila tua in quatuor locis.	 If you fear that the thread will be drawn out, then insert another point with another thread under the entire abscess near the incision; press and tie your threads in four places.
Deinde seca apostema in medio sui, donec quando egreditur quod in eo est: tunc incide superfluitatem cutis, et dimitte quod ligatum est ex ea.	 Then cut the aphthmoma (boil or abscess) in the middle of it, until what is inside comes out; then cut off the excess skin and release what is bound from it.
Deinde pone super ipsum puluillum quem submersisti in uino, et oleo.	 Then place upon it the louse which you have submerged in wine and oil.
Deinde administra curationem, quae fit cum liciniis et unguentis, donec sanetur.	 Then administer the treatment, which is made with linseed and ointments, until it heals.
¶ De apostemate quod accidit ex torsione Neruorum.	 Chapter on an aphthmoma (boil or abscess) that occurs from twisting of the nerves.
Caput L.	 Title: Chapter L.
Sicut accidit apostema in Arteria et Vena, similiter accidit apostema in Neruis: quod accidit in eis percussio, aut accidit a labore superfluo, et similibus: et fit plurimum illis in locis adiutoriorum, aut calcanei, et in omni loco in quo mouentur iuncturae: et est apostema graue.	 As an aphthmoma (boil or abscess) occurs in the artery and vein, similarly it occurs in nerves; this occurs by blow or excessive labor, and similar causes; and it happens most often in places of joints, such as the heel or any place where joints move; and the aphthmoma is severe.
Similatur color eius reliquo corpori, et est in pluribus dispositionibus absque dolore: et quando stringitur cum uehementia, sentit in eo infirmus simile stupori.	 It resembles the color of the rest of the body and is in several dispositions without pain; and when it is tightly pressed with great force, it feels weak, like numbness.
Et non est apostema aggregatum in profundo corporis, imo est sub cute, et ipsum mouetur ad omnem partem, et non uadit ad anteriora, uel ante, neque retro ad posteriora.	 And the aphthmoma is not aggregated in the deep parts of the body, rather it is under the skin; and itself moves to all parts, and does not go to the front or anterior areas, nor to the rear or posterior areas.
Quod ergo ex eis est in iuncturis, non oportet ut inuadatur cum ferro.	 What is present in the joints, therefore, should not be penetrated with iron.
Fortasse enim accidet contractio.	 Perhaps it will occur that constriction (occurs).
In illo autem quod ex eis est in capite, aut in fronte, finde cutem cum spatumili.	 In that which is present in the head or forehead, incise the skin with a lancet.
Si ergo est apostema paruum, tunc tene ipsum cum forficibus, et abscinde ipsum a radice.	 If therefore the aphthmoma is small, then hold it with forceps and cut it off from its root.
Et si est magnum, tunc suspende ipsum eum uncino, et excoria ipsum: deinde aufer ipsum, et aggrega uulnus cum sutura: et cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	 If it is large, then suspend it with a hook and scrape it; then remove it, and make an ulcer with suture; and treat it until it heals.
¶ De sectione apostematis, quod accidit in uentre.	 On the section of an abscess, which occurs in the belly.
Caput LI.	 De sectione apostematis, quod accidit
Accidunt quibusdam hominibus multotiens in uentribus eorum, et in reliquis corporibus ipsorum, thelil, quae nominantur Fungalia, per similitudinem ipsorum cum fungis.	 Chapter LXI.
Quorum radix est subtilis, et ipsorum caput est grossum, et conuersa sunt labia eorum.	 The root of them is subtle, and their head is coarse, and their lips are turned back.
Et est ex eis paruum: et est ex eis quod magnificatur ualde.	 And there is something small among them, and there is something that is greatly magnified among them.
Et ego quidem iam uidi uirum, et in uentre eius erant duo thelil, quae erant magis quam rebus aliis similia fungis: non erat differentia inter ea, alba, minutae radicis, et inuersabantur labia eorum, et findebantur, et humiditas currebat ex eis semper.	 And I myself have seen a man, and within his belly there were two growths which resembled other fungi more than usual: they were not distinguished by any whiteness or small root; their lips turned back and closed up, and moisture ran out of them constantly.
Incidi ergo ea, et inueni in pondere unius quasi X et VIII uncia et in altero quasi VI uncia Et operatio in incisione eorum est, ut consideres tunc, si infirmus est humidus, et color thelil est albus, humidum, subtilis radicis: tunc incide ipsum cum spatumili lato, et sint in praesentia tua cauteria in igne.	 I therefore cut them, and found that one weighed about 8 and 8 ounces, and the other about 6 ounces. The operation in cutting them is as follows: you should consider whether the person is weak and moist, and the growth is white, soft, with a subtle root: then you should cut it with a broad spatula, and have cauteries ready for use in your presence.
Multotiens enim expellitur apud sectionem eius sanguis multus: propera ergo si te uincit sanguis, tunc cauteriza ipsum.	 For many times blood is often expelled during the cutting of it: therefore be careful if you are overpowered by the blood, then cauterize it.
Quod si uides infirmum pauidum et timidum ab incisione cum ferro, tunc accipe filum ex plumbo decenter factum, et stringe cum eo athelul: cuius modus est quem diximus, et dimitte ipsum duobus diebus.	 If you see a weak person who is afraid and timid about the cutting with iron, then take a well-made lead thread and bind it around the growth; the method for this is as we have said, and release it after two days.
Deinde adde in strictura plumbi.	 Then add in the narrowing of the lead.
Non ergo cesses stringere plumbum, quotiens imprimit in thelil, donec abscindatur, et cadat per se absque labore.	 Therefore do not cease to bind the lead around the growth as long as it presses against the growth until it is separated and falls off without effort.
Si autem thelil grossae fuerit radicis, tunc in incisione eius est quiddam timoris et pauoris: praecipue quod est in uentre.	 If the growth has a thick root, then there is some fear and trembling in cutting it out; this is especially so when it is in the belly.
Verumtamen possibile est, ut incidas medietatem eius.	 Nevertheless, it is possible to cut through the middle of it.
Deinde cauteriza ipsum, ut non redeat.	 Then cauterize it so that it does not return.
Deinde cura ipsum, donec sanetur uulnus.	 Then take care of it until the wound heals.
Et caue ne praesumas incidere thelil quod est fusci coloris, pauci sensus, foedi aspectus: ipsum enim est apostema cancerosum: et ego ueniam cum rememoratione Cancri post hoc.	 Beware not to incise a thelil (gland) of dark color, few senses, foul appearance; for it is a cancerous aposteme; and I will be with you in the remembrance of Cancer after this.
¶ De cura eminentiae Vmbilici.	 On the care of umbilical hernia.
Caput LII.	 Chapter LII.
Fit eminentia Vmbilici ex caussis multis.	 An umbilical hernia occurs for many reasons.
Aut ex fissuris sifac, quod super uentrem est: et exit ex eo althub, aut intestinum, secundum quod accidit in reliquis rupturis.	 Or it arises from fissures (of the abdomen) that are above the belly; and (the hernia) comes out of it either an althub (intestine), or the intestines, according to what happens in other ruptures.
Aut ex sanguine qui fluit ex Vena, aut ex Arteria, secundum quod praemissum est.	 Or it arises from blood that flows out of a vein, or an artery, according to what was stated before.
Aut ex uentositate coartata in eo.	 Or it arises from a distended belly (obstruction) in it.
Si autem est propter fissuram sifac, et exitum thirbi: tunc est color apostematis similis colori corporis: et est lene, absque dolore: et apparet diuersi situs.	 If, however, it is due to a fissure (of the abdomen) and an outlet for urine; then its color is similar to that of an aposteme; it is loose, without pain; and it appears in various positions.
Et si est propter egressionem intestini, tunc est situs eius, cum eo quod narrauimus, uehementioris diuersitatis.	 And if it is due to the protrusion of the intestine, then its position is, with what we have mentioned, of more violent diversity.
Cum ergo tu premis ipsum digitis tuis, occultatur: deinde redit, et fortasse est cum eo sonitus: et magnificatur multum apud introitum balnei, et laborem uehaementum.	 When you press it with your fingers, it is hidden; then it returns and perhaps there is a sound; and it expands greatly at the entrance of the bath, and the pain is intense.
Si uero est propter humiditatem, est lene, tunc non occultatur quando premis ipsum manu tua, neque constringium, neque additur.	 But if it is due to moisture, then it is flaccid; therefore, when you press it with your hand, it does not hide, nor does it tighten up, nor does it swell.
Quod si est propter sanguinem, tunc cum istis signis apparet apostema ad nigredinem de cliue.	 If it is due to blood, then with these signs appears an abscess darkening from the hernia.
Si autem est propter carnem natam: tunc est apostema graue, grossum, durum, et figitur secundum quantitatem unam.	 But if it is due to a born flesh: then the abscess is heavy, large, hard, and punctured according to its size.
Si uero est propter uentositatem, tunc tactus eius est lenis.	 If it is due to windiness, then when touched it is flaccid.
Et operatio in illo est, ut consideres tunc, si eminentia umbilici est propter sanguinem Arteriae, aut Venae, aut uentositatem: tunc oportet ut prohibearis a curatione eius.	 And the operation on it is to consider then whether the protrusion of the navel is due to blood from an artery, or vein, or windiness; then it is necessary to forbid its treatment.
Nam in illo est timor et pauor, sicut docui te in capitulo, in quo dixi apostemata propter arteriam et uenam.	 For in it there is fear and dread, as I taught you in the chapter where I said that abscesses due to an artery and a vein.
Quod si eminentia umbilici est propter intestinum, aut zirbum: tunc oportet ut praecipias infirmo, quatenus teneat anhelitum suum, et stet stans extensus.	 If the protrusion of the navel is due to intestine, or hernia: then it is necessary to command the weak one, that he holds his breath and stands stretched out.
Deinde signa cum encaustro in circumitu umbilici totius.	 Then mark with the brand around the entire navel.
Postea praecipe ei, ut resupinetur inter manus tuas super dorsum suum.	 Then command him to lie on his back between your hands.
Deinde circunda cum spatumili lato in circumitu umbilici super locum quem signasti cum encaustro.	 Then surround with a broad band around the navel over the place which you have branded with fire.
Postea extende medium apostematis ad superiora, cum uncino magno.	 Then extend the middle of the abscess to above with a large hook.
Deinde liga eum in circumitu forti cum filo, aut cum chorda de serico ligamento firmo: et sit nodus ligamenti alenxotati.	 Then bind him around tightly with thread or cord from strong silk; and the knot of the ligament should be loosened.
Deinde aperi medium apostematis extensum supra ligamentum.	 Then open the extended middle part of the abscess above the ligament.
Si ergo inueneris ipsum iam captum a ligamento: tunc extrahe alenxotati, et intromitte in ipsum digitum indicem, et impelle intestinum ad interiora uentris: et si inueneris zirbum, tunc accipe ipsum cum uncino, et incide superfluitatem eius.	 If you find it (the foreign body) already caught by the ligament: then extract the cauterized one, and insert your finger into it, and push the intestine towards the inner part of the abdomen; if you find a stone, then take it with a hook, and cut off its superfluous part.
Si autem contraria est tibi arteria, aut uena: tunc circunda ipsum multum.	 If, however, an artery or vein is encountered, then surround it much.
Deinde redi ad operationem tuam.	 Then return to your surgery (procedure).
Et accipe duas acus, et intromitte in eis duo fila fortia: et intromitte duas acus in circumitu quem fecisti circa apostema in modum crucis, quas facis penetrare.	 And take two needles and insert strong threads into them; and insert the needles into the stitch you made around the abscess in the manner of a cross, which you make pass through.
Deinde stringe apostema in quatuor locis super acus: et si uis, aufer acus, et dimitte locum, donec putrefiat caro extensa: et cadat per se: aut incide ipsam quando subtiliatur et putrefit.	 Then suture the abscess in four places with the needles; and if you wish, remove the needles and leave a gap until the rotten flesh extends itself and falls off on its own; or cut it when it becomes soft and rots.
Deinde cura ipsum cum eo quod oportet ex unguentis, donec sanetur.	 Then take care of it with whatever is appropriate from the unguents until it heals.
Quod si eminentia umbilici est ex carne nara in eo, aut ex humiditate: tunc oportet ut concaues apostema, sicut diximus.	 If the projection of the navel is from the raw flesh or moisture in it, then it must be hollowed out, as we have said.
Et extrahas sanguinem, aut humiditatem, quam inuenis in eo.	 And you extract blood or moisture that you find in it.
Deinde cura ipsum cum eo quod solidat locum.	 Then take care of it to heal the place.
¶ De cura CANCRI.	 Chapter on the treatment of cancer.
Caput LIII.	 Title LIII.
Iam diximus in diuisione species Cancri, et qualiter est uia ad curationem eius cum medicinis: et cauendum ab eo cum curatione eius cum ferro, ut non ulceretur: et diximus Cancrum generatum in matrice, et cautelam a curatione eius.	 We have already said about the species of Cancer in division, and how to cure it with medicines: and it should be avoided when curing it with iron, so as not to ulcerate: and we have said that Cancer is generated in the matrix, and warned against cauterization of its cure.
Et dixerunt antiqui, quod quandoque Cancer est in loco, ubi possibilis est eius eradicatio: sicut Cancer qui est in mammillis, aut in coxa, et eis similibus, ex membris locatis ad extrahendum totum eius: praecipue quando est incipiens paruus.	 And the ancients said that sometimes Cancer is in a place where its removal is possible; such as Cancer in breasts or hips, and similar limbs, to be removed completely: especially when it is just beginning small.
Quando uero antiquatur, et est magnus, non oportet ut appropinques ei.	 But when it becomes ancient, and is large, it should not be approached.
Ego enim non potui sanare ex eo aliquem: neque uidi alium ante me qui peruenerit ad illud.	 For I was not able to heal anyone from that; nor did I see anyone before me who succeeded in reaching it.
Et operatio in eo, quando est locatus sicut diximus, est, ut praecedas, et soluas infirmum ex cholera nigra aliquotiens.	 And the operation on it, when located as we said, is to precede and release a weak person from black cholera several times.
Deinde phlebotoma ipsum si inuenis cum repletione manifesta.	 Then, if you find phlebotomy itself with obvious congestion.
Deinde praepara infirmum praeparatione, in qua locetur cum operatione.	 Then prepare the weak one with a preparation in which the operation is to be performed.
Deinde proiice in Cancrum uncinos qui conueniunt ei.	 Then thrust the awls that fit into Cancer.
Postea concaua ipsum ab omni parte cum cute, secundum perscrutationem, donec non remaneat aliquid ex radicibus eius: et dimitte sanguinem currere, et non abscindas ipsum uelociter, imo exprime loca, et absterge sanguinem grossum totum manu tua, aut cum quo possibile est ibi ex instrumentis.	 Then hollow out Cancer from all sides with skin, according to the examination, until nothing remains of its roots: and let the blood flow, and do not cut it quickly, rather press out the places, and remove all thick blood with your hand, or as possible there with instruments.
Si autem contrarietatem facit tibi fluxus sanguinis grossi ex incisione arteriae, aut uenae: tunc cauteriza uenam, donec abscindatur sanguis.	 If on the other hand, a flow of thick blood from an incision in the artery or vein opposes you; then cauterize the vein until the blood is cut off.
Deinde cura ipsum cum reliqua curatione, donec sanetur.	 Then cure Cancer with the rest of the treatment, until it heals.
¶ De cura Hydropisis.	 [Chapter] On the care of Hydrophobia.
Caput LIIII.	 Chapter LIV.
Iam narrauimus in diuisione species Hydropisis, et qualiter fit aggregatio aquae: et signa omnis speciei, et curationem eius cum medicinis.	 We now describe the division of Hydropisis species, and how water accumulation occurs; and all signs of each species, and its cure along with the medicines.
Et illa quae curatur cum ferro, non est nisi species asclitis sola: et non approximatur cum ferro speciei timpanitis: neque speciei hyposarcae penitus: nam illud mortale est.	 And that which is cured with iron, is only the species of asclitis; it does not approach with iron the species of timpanitis; nor deeply with the species of hyposarcae; for it is deadly.
Quando tu iam medicatus es hanc speciem Hydropisis timpanitis cum medicinis, et non contulit medicatio tua: tunc considera.	 When you have been treated for this species of Hydropisis with medicines and the treatment did not help: then consider it.
Nam si infirmo iam consecuta est debilitas, aut est cum eo infirmitas alia praeter Hydropisim: sicut si sit cum eo tussis, aut uentris solutio, et similia illis: tunc caue ne mediceris ei cum ferro: quoniam est timor illud.	 For if the patient has already come to weakness or there is another illness with it besides Hydropisis, such as a cough, or diarrhea, and similar ones: then beware of treating him with iron; for it is dangerous.
Si autem uides infirmum exuberantis uirtutis, neque est cum eo aegritudo praeter Hydropisim solam: et non est puer, neque senex: tunc modus operationis in eo est, ut tu eleues infirmum stantem inter manus tuas, et minister post ipsum exprimat uentrem eius manu sua impellendo aquam ad inferiorem partem pectinis.	 But if you see a patient who is overflowing with strength and there is no other illness with it besides Hydropisis alone, and he is neither a child nor an old man: then the method of operation in him is that you lift up the patient standing between your hands, and the servant following behind him presses his abdomen with his hand to drive water towards the lower part of the chest.
Deinde accipe spatumile spinosum, secundum hanc formam.	 Then take a pointed spatula, in this shape.
Sit duarum partium acutarum, longum, acutae extremitatis sicut Spatumile.	 Let it have two sharp parts, long, and pointed ends like a spatula.
Verumtamen in eo sit quiddam breuitatis paulatim, ut non pertranseas cum eo apud operationem usque ad intestinum, et laedas ipsum.	 However, there should be something of shortness in it, so that you do not penetrate it during the operation up to the intestine and injure him.
Deinde considera.	 Then consider it.
Nam si est generatio Hydropisis ex parte intestinorum, tunc oportet ut elongeris cum sectione ab umbilico quantitate trium digitorum, ad inferiora in directo eius supra pectinem.	 For if the generation of Hydropisis is from the intestines, then it is necessary to extend with a section from the navel by the length of three fingers downwards over the chest.
Si uero generatio Hydropisis est propter aegritudinem epatis: tunc sit sectio tua sinistra ab umbilico tribus digitis.	 But if the generation of Hydropisis is due to liver illness: then let your incision be on the left from the navel by three fingers.
Et si generatio eius est propter splenem, tunc sit sectio in latere dextro: et non oportet etiam ut sit sectio in latere super quod uult iacere infirmus, ut non currant superfluitates ad illum locum debilem.	 If its generation is due to the spleen, then let the incision be on the right side: and it is not necessary that there should also be an incision on the side towards which the sick person is to lie, so that superfluidities do not run to that weak place.
Deinde perfora cum instrumento cutem totam.	 Then pierce the skin with an instrument entirely.
Deinde intromitte in illam sectionem, et eleua manum tuam cum Spatumili inter cutem, et sifac, quasi tu excories ipsum: et sit quantitas quae excoriatur quantitas unguis, aut circiter ilud.	 Then insert into that incision and separate your hand with a probe between the skin, and ligature, as if you were coring it; let the quantity that is being cored be of the size of a fingernail or approximately that.
Deinde perfora sifac, donec perueniat Spatumile ad locum uacuum: et est locus aquae.	 Then bore the ligature (sifac), until the probe reaches an empty place; and that is a watery place.
Deinde extrahe ipsum, et intromitte in foramen instrumentum, cuius haec est forma.	 Then remove it (the spleen), and insert an instrument into the opening, of which this is its form.
Et est simile cannulae: fit ex argento, aut aere, aut aurichalco, lene, tersum: cui in inferiori parte sui est foramen paruum, et in lateribus eius sunt tria foramina, duo ab una parte, et unum a parte altera: et facia est extremitas eius incisa, secundum modum incisionis calami, sicut uides: in extremitate eius superiore est armilla.	 It is similar to a cannula; it is made of silver, brass or copper, linen, cleaned; at the lower part of it is a small opening, and on its sides there are three openings, two on one side and one on the other; and the end of it is slit, in the manner of an incision of a reed, as you see; at the upper end of it is a string.
Nam quando instrumentum peruenit ad aquam, tunc ipsa descendit statim super instrumentum, ergo euacua ex aqua in hora quantitatem mediam.	 For when the instrument reaches water, then it immediately descends upon the instrument, therefore evacuate from the water a half measure.
Quoniam si tu euacuas ex ea plus quam oportet, in hora fortasse moritur infirmus per resolutionem spiritus sui animalis: aut accidit ei syncopis quae appropinquat morti.	 Since if you evacuate more than is necessary from it, perhaps the sick person may die from loss of his animal spirit; or he may experience a syncope that approaches death.
Verum euacua ex ea secundum quantitatem uirtutis eius, et secundum quod significant tibi dispositiones infirmi ex uirtute pulsus eius, et ex bonitate eius.	 But evacuate from it according to its strength and according to the signs that indicate to you the dispositions of the sick person from the force of his pulse, and from the quality of it (the spleen).
Deinde extrahe instrumentum, et retine aquam.	 Then remove the instrument, and retain the water.
Quod est, quia retinetur statim propter cutem quae retinet foramen quod est super sifac: de quo narraui, ut perfores ipsum secundum illum modum.	 That is because it (the water) is retained immediately because of the skin which retains the opening that is on the ligature; about this I told you to bore it in that manner.
Deinde itera instrumentum die altero, si uides infirmum tolerare illud: et extrahe etiam ex aqua quantitatem paruam.	 Then repeat the operation on the second day, if you see the patient can bear it: and extract even a small quantity from water.
Fac illud diebus aliquot sine timore, et custodi te ab errore: donec non remaneat ex aqua nisi parum.	 Repeat that procedure on several days without fear, and be careful to avoid error: until there remains only a small amount in water.
Si autem times super infirmum, et dimittis ex aqua rem multam: tunc cura ipsum cum sepultura in harena calida, et sudore multo in balneo et sole, et expectet super sitim: et cura ipsum cum medicinis exiccatiuis, donec sanetur: et cauteriza super stomachum, et epar, et splenem, post extractionem aquae: secundum quod narraui in eo quod praecessit.	 If you fear for the patient and let out a large amount from water: then care for him with warm sand, much sweating in a bath and sun, and watch for thirst; and care for him with drying medicines until he is cured: and cauterize over the stomach, spleen and liver, after the extraction of water: as I narrated in what preceded.
¶ De cura infantium qui nascuntur locis urinae eorum non perforatis.	 Chapter on the care of infants born in places where their bladder are not pierced.
Caput LV.	 Chapter LV. (Chapter fifty-fifth.)
Quando egreditur aliquis infantium ex uentre matris suae, et caput mutonis eius est non perforatum, aut est foramen strictum, aut in non suo loco.	 When any infant comes out from his mother's womb and the head is not pierced with a lamb's bone, or the opening is narrowed or in an incorrect position.
Oportet ergo succurrere cum perforatione eius statim cum nascitur cum Spatumili subtili ualde, secundum hanc formam.	 Therefore, it is necessary to perforate it immediately upon birth with a thin spatula of Subtilis, according to this form.
Deinde pone in foramine clauum subtilem ex plumbo, et liga ipsum: et tene ipsum tribus diebus, aut quatuor.	 Then put a fine nail of lead in the opening and tie it; hold it for three or four days.
Quando ergo uult urinam emittere, remoueatur, et mingat.	 When he wants to urinate, remove it and mix with it.
Deinde reduc ipsum.	 Then return it.
Et si tu non ponis plumbum, iam possibile est, ut urina quae incedit super locum, non permittat ipsum claudi.	 And if you do not put lead, it is now possible that the urine flowing over the place does not allow it to close.
Ille autem cuius foramen est strictum, medicatur cum plumbo, sicut diximus, diebus multis, donec amplificetur.	 That one whose opening is narrowed is treated with lead, as we said, for many days until it is enlarged.
Illi autem in quibus est foramen in non suo loco, laeduntur.	 Those in whom the opening is in an incorrect position are injured.
Quod est, quia ex eis qui nascitur, foramen est apud finem capitis uirgae: quare non potest mingere ad anteriora, donec eleuat uirgam manu sua ad superiora.	 Because from those who are born, the opening is at the end of the spine: hence it cannot urinate towards the front until it raises the spine with its own hand towards higher parts.
Neque est ei generatio, propterea, quod sperma non potest peruenire ad matricem secundum rectitudinem: et est aegritudo foeda ualde.	 The generation is not in it, because the seed cannot reach the matrix according to rightness; and it is a very foul disease.
Et modus operationis in illo est, ut resupinetur infirmus super dorsum suum.	 And the method of operation in him is, that the sick one lies on his back.
Deinde extende caput uirgae eius manu tua sinistra extensione uehementi, et incide caput capitis uirgae ex loco priapi, cum acumine, aut spatumili acuto: sicut est incisio calami, aut sicut tu radis aliquid, ut medium eius ueniat simile capiti uirgae: et ut cadat foramen in medio secundum quod oportet.	 Then extend the head of his penis with your left hand by a strong extension, and cut off the head of the penis' rod from its place at the priapus, with the point or the sharp spine; like cutting a reed or like you root something out, so that the middle comes similar to the head of the penis; and so that it falls through the hole in the middle as needed.
Et caue tibi apud operationem tuam a fluxu sanguinis.	 And beware of yourself during your operation from bleeding.
Multotiens enim accidit illud.	 For this often happens.
Oppone ergo ei cum eo quod abscindit sanguinem, et cura uulnus, donec sanetur.	 Therefore, oppose to him with it what cuts blood, and take care of the wound until it heals.
¶ De Albather quae accidunt in praeputio et capite uigae, et corruptione, nigredine, et adhaerentia.	 Chapter on Albather that happen on the foreskin and head of the penis, and decay, blackening, and sticking.
Caput LVI.	 Chapter 66.
Multotiens accidunt istae Albather in uirga, et est eminentia carnis foedae.	 These Albather often happen in the penis, and it is a protuberance of foul flesh.
Et ex ea alia est maligna, et alia non maligna.	 And from this one is malignant, and the other is not malignant.
Non malignam ergo oportet ut suspendas cum uncino subtili, et abscindas eam, donec mundes eam totam.	 Therefore, it is necessary to hang the non-malignant one with a fine hook and cut it off until you clean it all.
Deinde pone super eam cotum submersum in unguento aegyptio.	 Then put on it a shallow container immersed in Egyptian ointment.
Deinde cura ipsum post illud cum unguento dyafinicon, donec sanetur.	 Then take care of him afterwards with dyafinicon ointment until he heals.
Quod si Albather est maligna, foedi coloris, tunc oportet ut administres in ea cauterium post incisionem eius et ipsius rasionem.	 If the Albather is malignant and of a foul color, then it is necessary to administer cautery after its incision and its reason.
Si autem Albather est in praeputio captiui, non circumcisi, et est pars Albather inter praeputium, et pars eius extra: tunc oportet ut auferas Albather, quae est intus in primis, donec quando consolidatur, tunc cura ipsum exterius: quoniam quando tu curas eam simul, non securatur praeputium quin preforetur.	 If, however, the Albather is in the foreskin that has not been circumcised, and there is a part of the Albather inside and a part outside; then it is necessary to remove the Albather that is inside first, until it consolidates; then take care of him outside; because when you care for it simultaneously, the foreskin will not heal unless it swells.
Et iam accidunt etiam in testiculis, et praeputio nigredo et corruptio.	 And even occur in testicles, and darkening and corruption of the foreskin.
Oportet ergo, ut tu concaues totum quod iam denigratum est, et quod uult corrumpi, aut iam corruptum est.	 Therefore, it is necessary that you hollow out everything that has become darkened, and what is about to be corrupted, or already corrupted.
Deinde line super ipsum post illud cum melle quod iam concussum est cum farina corticum granatorum, et herbi tritorum cribellatorum.	 Then apply a line over it after that with honey that has been beaten up with flour of quince, and sieved herbs of miller's straw.
Deinde cura illud cum reliqua curatione, donec sanetur.	 Then take care of it with the remaining treatment until it is healed.
Si autem accidat fluxus sanguinis, tunc administra cauterium cum cauterio lunari, secundum hanc formam.	 If there should be bleeding, then apply cautery with lunar cautery in this form.
Cauterium enim est iuuatiuum ad duas dispositiones simul, scilicet ad fluxum sanguinis, et uulnus quando corrumpitur.	 For cautery is useful for two conditions at the same time, namely for bleeding and a wound when it is corrupted.
Quod si corroditur caput uirgae, et destruitur totum in hora: tunc oportet ut intromittas in meatum priapi cannulam ex plumbo, ut mingat infirmus super eam.	 If the head of the arrow is corrupted and destroyed completely within an hour: then it is necessary that you insert a cannula made of lead into the urethra, so that the sick one urinates over it.
In adhaerentia uero praeputii cum capite uirgae, et haec quidem adhaerentia non accidit, nisi in eo cuius praeputium est sanum, et non exigitur super ipsum circumcisio: et quandoque accidit adhaerentia propter uulnus, aut apostema: oportet ergo ut excories eam cum Spatumili obtuso, donec soluatur ligamentum, et liberetur caput uirgae ab omni parte.	 In the case of an adhesion between the foreskin and the head of the arrow, and this adhesion does not occur except in one whose foreskin is healthy and circumcision is not required on it: and sometimes adhesion occurs due to a wound or abscess: therefore, it is necessary to remove it with a Spatulili obtuse until the ligament is loosened and the head of the arrow is released from all sides.
Quod si est difficile discernere ea exquisite, tunc oportet ut excories aliquid ex capite uirgae, et ex praeputio.	 If it is difficult to distinguish it with great precision, then it is necessary to remove something from the head of the arrow and from the foreskin.
Quod est, quia praeputium quando est subtile, fortasse perforatur propter subtilitatem suam uelociter.	 Because the foreskin, when it is thin, is perhaps quickly perforated due to its thinness.
Deinde separa inter praeputium, et caput uirgae cum panno lini subtili, qui iam madefactus est in aqua frigida, ut non adhereant iterum.	 Then separate between the foreskin and the head of the arrow with a thin linen cloth that has been made in cold water, so that they do not adhere again.
Deinde curetur cum uino stiptico, donec consolidetur.	 Then it shall be treated with sticky wine until it hardens.
¶ De mundificatione infantium, et curatione ex errore eis accidente.	 On the purification of infants and treatment for error occurring to them.
Caput LVII.	 Chapter LVII.
Circumcisio non est solutio continuitatis, sicut reliqua uulnera: uerumtamen cum sit ex operatione nostra, uoluntate nostra, et usus eius sit in pueris proprie, est necesse ut signemus in ea operationem meliorem, et uiam leuiorem perducentem ad salutem.	 Circumcision is not a solution to continuity, as with other wounds: however, since it is from our operation, by our will, and its use is specifically for boys, it is necessary that we mark in it a better procedure, and a lighter way leading to health.
Dico ergo, quod antiqui non dixerunt circumcisionem in aliquo suorum librorum: quoniam non utuntur in legibus suis, et non est nisi quod acquisiuimus per experimentum.	 I say therefore, that the ancients did not speak of circumcision in any of their books: since they do not use it in their laws, and it is only what we have acquired through experience.
Quod est, quia ego inueni maiorem partem artificum, et phlebotomatorum uti mundificatione, circumcidendo cum nouacula, et cum forficibus: et utuntur alfecati, et ligaudo cum filo, et incisione cum ungula.	 It is because I found the majority of artificers and phlebotomists to use purification by circumcision with a knife and with scissors: they use algued, ligature with thread, and incision with the nail.
Et ego quidem iam probaui omnes istos modos, et non inueni meliorem mundificatione cum forficibus, et ligamento cum filo.	 And I have indeed tested all these methods, and did not find a better purification with scissors, and ligature with thread.
Quoniam in mundificatione cum nouacula, multotiens effugit cutis.	 Since in circumcision with the knife, the skin often escapes.
Quoniam cutis praeputii duas habet tunicas: ergo forsitan inciditur cutis superior, et temanet tunica inferior: cogitur ergo ad incisionem ad incidendum alteram, et dolorem futurum.	 Since the foreskin has two skin layers: perhaps the upper skin is cut, and the lower layer is torn: it is therefore necessary to make another incision in order to cut the other one, and pain will result.
Et cum mundificatione quae fit per alfecati, id est, digitalis, quo utuntur sutores, non securatur incisio extremitatis uirilis membri: quoniam fortasse ingreditur in foramen eius.	 And with the purification that is done by the algued, that is, the digital method, which tailors use, is not cut at the extremity of the masculine member: since perhaps it enters its opening.
In mundificatione autem cum ungula, fortasse euadit ferrum, et corrumpit operationem tuam: et cutis quidem pueri est breuis natura, et multotiens nascuntur taliter, quod non indigent mundificatione: et iam uidi illud.	 However, in circumcision with the nail, perhaps iron slips out and spoils your operation: and indeed the skin of a boy is short by nature, and often they are born like that, not needing purification: and I have already seen this.
Mundificationis autem cum forficibus, et ligamento cum filo, bonum experimentum detexit mihi: quoniam forfices sunt proportionalis incisionis: propterea, quod acuitas quae est superius, est sicut acuitas quae est inferius.	 The purification with scissors and ligature with thread has shown to be a good experiment for me: because the blades are proportional to the incision: therefore, the sharpness that is above is like the sharpness that is below.
Cum ergo premis manum tuam, proportionantur duae acuitates, et incidunt secundum operationem unam in tempore uno: et fit compressio simili figura, continens cutem uirgae ab omni parte, cum qua non cadit error omnino.	 When therefore you press your hand, two sharp edges correspond and cut according to one operation at the same time; a compression of similar shape is made, containing the skin of the staff from all sides, with which no error whatsoever can fall.
Et modus operationis propriae est, ut facias extimare, puerum praecipue, si est ex eis qui intelligunt parumper, quod tu non facis, nisi quod ligas filum in uirga sua tantum: et dimittas ipsum usque ad diem alium.	 And the method of your operation is that you should make him examine, primarily a boy who understands something, if he is from those who understand briefly, which you do not do unless you tie the thread on his own staff only; and then you will release it for another day.
Deinde fac eum gaudere et laetari omnimodo quo possibile est tibi illud, ex eo quod recipit intelligentia sua.	 Then make him rejoice and be happy in every way possible from you because he receives understanding of himself.
Deinde fac eum stare inter manus tuas praeparatae staturae, et non sit sedens: et occulta forfices in manica tua, aut sub pede tuo, ne uideat eos puer omnino, neque aliquid ex instrumentis.	 Then make him stand between your prepared hands with the stature and let him not be seated; and hidden scissors in your hand or under your foot, so that the boy does not see them at all, nor anything from the instruments.
Deinde intromitte manum tuam ad uirgam eius, et suffla in cutem, et trahe eam sursum, donec egrediatur caput uirgae.	 Then insert your hand to his staff, and blow on the skin, and draw it upwards until the head of the staff comes out.
Deinde mundifica ipsam ex eo quod aggregatur in ea sordicie.	 Then cleanse it from this because dirt has gathered in it.
Deinde liga locum signatum cum filo duplo.	 Then tie the marked place with a double thread.
Postea liga inferius eo parumper ligamentum secundum.	 Then tie below it a little ligament at the same time.
Deinde tene cum indice tuo, et pollice locum ligamenti inferioris retentione bona, et incide inter duo ligamenta.	 Then hold with your index finger and thumb the place of the lower ligament in a good grip, and cut between two ligaments.
Deinde eleua cutem sursum uelociter, et extrahe caput uirgae.	 Then peel the skin quickly upwards and take out the head of the staff.
Deinde dimitte sanguinem currere paulatim (est enim melius) et pone puluerem desuper: et super puluerem pannum in quo expansus est uitellus oui decocti in aqua rosata, concussum cum oleo ros recenti bono: et dimitte eum super ipsum usque ad diem alium: et cura ipsum reliqua curatione, donec sanetur.	 Then let the blood flow slowly (it is better) and put powder on top; and above the powder, a cloth in which the boiled lamb's fat has been spread with fresh rose oil; and let him be on it until another day; and take care of him with the rest of the treatment, until he is healed.
Forma autem forficis ad mundificationem haec est.	 The form of the scissors for cleansing is as follows.
Sint hebetes duae extremitates, et sint incidentes: ne egrediatur in eis ramus claui: et sit longitudo duarum acuitatum, sicut longitudo duorum manubriorum aequaliter.	 The two extremities are blunt, and they are incised: let not the branch of the nail go forth into them: and let the length of the two points be equal to the length of two handles equally.
Error uero cadens in mundificatione est: quoniam fortasse effugit cutis intrinseca tota, aut pars eius apud incisionem.	 The falling error in excision is because perhaps the entire inner skin escapes, or a part of it at the incision point.
Ergo oportet, ut extendas eam ex hora tua cum ungue tuo ante apostemationem loci: et incidas eam secundum aequalitatem.	 Therefore, it is necessary to stretch it out from your side with your nail before the excision of the location, and cut it evenly.
Quod si non potes tenere eam cum ungue tuo, tunc extrahe eam cum uncino, et incide eam.	 If you cannot hold it with your nail, then pull it out with a tweezers and cut it.
Si autem praeterierint ei tres dies, et remanet quod est sub uirga inflatum, apostematum: tunc dimitte illud, donec sedetur apostema calidum, et excoria illud cum facilitate, et incide illud secundum quod praeparatur tibi: et caue tibi a capite uirgae.	 If three days have passed and what is under the abscess remains inflated, excise it: then leave it until the abscess settles down and becomes warm, and peel off the scab easily and cut it as prepared for you: be careful not to cut the base of the abscess.
Non enim nocebit ei illud.	 For it will not harm him that.
Cura ergo illud cum eo quod consolidat uulnus ex pulueribus, quos narrauimus in tractatu de pulueribus: et si inciditur ex cute supra mensuram, et euadit ad superiora, non nocet ei illud etiam.	 Take care of that with him as it consolidates the wound with the powders we mentioned in the chapter on powders: and if it is cut deeper than the measure and reaches the superficial layers, it will not harm him even then.
Cura ergo illud cum eo quod diximus, donec sanetur.	 Take care of that with him until it heals.
¶ De extractione Vrinae retentae in uesica.	 Chapter on the extraction of a retained bladder in the bladder.
Caput LVIII.	 Chapter LVIII.
Urinae retentio in uesica, fit ab opilatione facta ex lapide, aut sanguine congelato, aut pus, aut carne nata, et similibus illis ex eis quae diximus ex modis curationis in diuisione.	 Retention of urine in the bladder, occurs due to a blockage made from stone, frozen blood, pus, flesh born, and similar things from what we mentioned under methods of treatment in division.
Et si non soluitur Vrina, et uides retentionem eius esse propter Lapidem, qui iam est in collo uesicae: tunc oportet ut sit infirmus super genua sua curuatus.	 If urine is not resolved and you see that its retention is due to a stone already in the neck of the bladder: then it is necessary for him who is ill to be bent over his knees.
Deinde componantur pedes eius super dorsum eius, et extendat uentrem suum ex superiori parte dorsi eius, et stringat infirmus anhelitum suum quantum possibile est ei.	 Then place his feet on top of his back, and let him stretch out his abdomen from the upper part of his back, and he should compress his breath as much as possible for him.
Cogitur ergo cum collo uesicae ad expulsionem Lapidis ad posteriora: quare absoluitur Vrina.	 Therefore, when the neck of the bladder is compressed towards the back, the stone in the bladder is expelled; thus, urine is released.
Quod si non soluitur cum eo quod diximus, et uehemens sit res super infirmum: tunc oportet ut administres extractionem eius cum instrumento, quod nominatur siringa, cuius haec est forma Sit ex argento, et sit subtile, lene, concauum sicut cannula pennae auis in subtilitate radii, longum in similitudine palmi unius et medii: cui sit cannula subtilis in capite eius.	 If it is not resolved with what has been said and the patient is strong on the sick man: then it is necessary to administer extraction of it with an instrument called syringe, whose form is like this Sit from silver, and be subtle, flexible, concave as a feather quill in subtleness of radius, long in the likeness of one and a half palms: to which a small-bore tube should be attached at its head.
Et modus exitus Vrinae per ipsum est, ut accipias filum duplicatum, et liges in extremitate eius lanam, aut cotum, ligatura bona: et intromittas extremitatem fili in inferiori parte Siringae: et incide cum forficibus si superfluit aliquid ex lana, uerum intromitte in cannulam cum uehementia, sicut alzer.	 And the method of urine exit through it is to take a double thread, tie at its end wool or cotton, good binding: and insert the end of the thread into the lower part of the syringe; and cut with scissors if there is any excess from the wool, but introduce into the tube with force, like squeezing.
Deinde inunge siringam cum oleo, aut cum butyro, et albugine oui: et fac sedere infirmum super sedem, et embroca uesicam, et ipsius uirgam cum oleis humidis, et oleo oliuae, et aqua tepida.	 Then grease the syringe with oil or butter, and lard, and egg white: let the sick man sit on a chair, and anoint the bladder, and his penis with moist oils, olive oil, and warm water.
Deinde intromitte siringam in uirgam cum facilitate, donec perueniat ad radicem uirgae.	 Then insert the syringe into the vein with ease, until it reaches the root of the vein.
Deinde dupla ipsam superius a parte umbilici.	 Then fold it twice above the navel.
Deinde impelle siringam intra ipsam, donec perueniat ad Vesicam, et sentiat eam infirmus iam peruenisse ad rem uacuam: et non fit hoc secundum hunc ordinem, nisi quoniam meatus, in quo uadit, est in quo est tortuositas.	 Then push the syringe inside it until it reaches the bladder, and feel that it has already reached the empty space: this is not done according to this order unless because the channel through which it goes is where there is a twisting.
Deinde extende filum cum lana paulatim.	 Then extend the thread slowly with wool.
Vrina enim sequetur lanam.	 For it follows wool (as in the direction of).
Deinde extrahe eam, et fac currere Vrinam per uiam urinae: et itera siringam, et non cesses facere illud, donec euacuetur uesica, et inueniat infirmus alleuiationem.	 Then pull it out and make the vein run through the urine way: and repeat the syringe, and do not stop doing this until the bladder is emptied, and the weak person finds relief.
¶ De qualitate clisterizationis uesicae cum Clepshydra.	 Chapter on the quality of clysters for the bladder with a clepsydras (water clock).
Caput LIX.	 Chapter LIX (99 in Roman numerals).
Quando accidit in uesica ulcus, aut sanguis in ea congelatur, aut coartatur in ea pus, et uis distillare in eam aquas et medicinas: tunc fiat cum instrumento quod nominatur Clepshydra, et haec est forma eius.	 When there is an ulcer or blood congeals or pus collects in the bladder and it desires to discharge waters and medications into it: then it should be done with an instrument called a clepsydras, and this is its form.
Est enim surda, id est, clausa.	 It is indeed deaf (or closed).
Et in eo sunt tria foramina, duo ex parte una, et unum ex parte altera, sicut uides.	 And in it there are three openings, two on one side and one on the other side, as you see.
Et locus concauus, in quo est illud quod impellit, sit secundum quantitatem quod opilet ipsum sine additione, donec quando trahitur cum eo aliquid, ex humiditatibus attrahatur: et quando impellitur, cum eo expellatur ad longinquum: secundum quod facit clepshydra, qua proiicitur naphta, id est, ignis graecus in praeliis martis.	 And the hollow place where that which pushes it is located should be of such a size that it can hold it without addition until when it is pulled out with something from the humidities it is attracted: and when it is pushed, with it it is expelled to a great distance: this is how a clepsydras works, by throwing naphta (or Greek fire) in the war of Mars.
Cum ergo uis proiicere humiditates in uesicam, intromitte extremitatem clepshydrae in humiditatem, et trahe cum eo quod impellit ad superiora, humiditas enim trahitur in concauitatem clepshydrae.	 Therefore when the desire is to throw the waters into the bladder, insert the end of the clepsydras into the water and pull it out with that which pushes it towards the upper parts: for the water is drawn into the hollow of the clepsydras.
Deinde intromitte extremitatem eius in uirgam, secundum quod narrauimus in siringa.	 Then insert its end into a rod, as we previously described in a syringe.
Deinde impelle humiditatem cum eo quod impellit illa namque humiditas peruenit ad uesicam statim, ita quod sentit eam infirmus.	 Then push the moisture with it, because that moisture immediately reaches the bladder, so that it feels weak.
Forma clisteris subtilis quo clisterizatur uesica.	 Make a thin suppository for bladder cleansing.
Fiat ex argento, aut auricalco: cuius caput altius sit simile alcama paruo, et sub eo sinus inter quem cadat ligamentum.	 Make it from silver or gold: its head should be like a calk (a hollow cylinder) with a small hole in it, and under the hole there should be a space for the string to pass through.
Deinde accipe uesicam arietis, et pone in ea humiditatem, qua uis clisterizare uesicam.	 Then take the bladder of a ram and place the moisture in it, which you wish to use for bladder cleansing.
Deinde liga eam inter duos sinus ligatura forti cum filo duplo: et calefac illam humiditatem parumper super ignem.	 Then tie it with a strong ligature between two spaces using double thread, and heat the moisture slightly over fire.
Deinde intromitte extremitatem clisteris in uirgam, postea stringe manum tuam super uesicam cum humiditate strictura decenti, donec sentiat infirmus, quod illa humiditas iam peruenit ad uesicam.	 Then insert the end of the suppository into a rod, then press your hand on the bladder with the moisture and tight stringer until it feels weak, because that moisture has already reached the bladder.
Si autem non est tibi praesens uesica, tunc accipe frustum pergameni, et fac ex eo circulum, et perfora ipsum ab omni rotunditate sua.	 If the bladder is not present for you, then take a piece of parchment and make a circle out of it, and pierce it completely from its entire roundness.
Deinde intromitte filum forte in illis foraminibus, sicut reuoluuntur.	 Then insert the thread forcefully into those holes as they are turned.
Deinde aggrega circulum, sicut aggregatur alsofratu: postquam tu ponis in eo illud quod uis ex humiditatibus, et oleis, et aquis.	 Then roll up the circle like a scroll; when you put into it what you wish from the moistures, oils, and waters.
Deinde liga ipsum in instrumento: et fac cum eo sicut fecisti cum uesica ex expressione cum manu tua, donec perueniat humiditas ad uesicam.	 Then bind it with the tool; and do with it as you did with the bladder by pressure with your hand until the moisture reaches the bladder.
¶ De extractione Lapidis.	 Chapter on stone extraction.
Caput LX.	 Chapter 60.
Iam diximus in diuisione species Lapidis, et curationem eius cum medicinis: et dixi differentiam inter Lapidem generatum in renibus, et uesica, et signa illius totius: et dixi Lapidem in quo cadit operatio cum manu et sectio: et est Lapis generatus in uesica proprie: et ille qui figitur in uirga: et ego sum narrans illud cum expositione manifesta et abbreuiatione.	 We have said about the division of a Stone's species, and its treatment with medicines; we have mentioned the difference between a Stone generated in kidneys, bladder, and signs of its entirety; we have said about a Stone operated upon by hand and section; it is a stone generated in the bladder properly speaking; it is that which forms in the urinary canal; I am telling this with a clear explanation and abbreviation.
Dico ergo, quod Lapis generatus in uesica, plurimum accidit pueris.	 A stone generated in the bladder most often happens to children.
Et ex signis eius est, quod urina egreditur ex uesica similis aquae in subtilitate sua: et apparet in ea harena alba, et fricat infirmus uirgam suam, et laborat cum ea, et multotiens pendet.	 And among its signs is that urine leaves the bladder like water in its subtlety; and there appears within it white sand, and a weak man rubs his urinary canal, and labors with it, and often hangs down.
Deinde erigitur, et egreditur cum eo anus in multis eorum.	 Then it rises up, and is expelled together with it in many of them (the cases).
Et est facilis sanatio puerorum, ex eo usquequo consequuntur quatuordecim annos.	 The healing of children is easy as long as they do not reach the age of fourteen.
Et est difficilis in senibus.	 It is difficult in old people.
In iuuenibus autem est media, in eo quod est inter illud: et eius cuius Lapis est maior, curatio facilior: et si paruus, est econuerso illius cura.	 However, it is moderate in young men, because it is between that (difficult and easy); for the one whose stone is larger, healing is easier; but if it is small, the cure is more difficult.
Cum ergo peruenimus ad curationem, oportet in primis, ut mundificemus infirmum cum clisteri, quod extrahat totum stercus quod est in intestinis suis: ipsum enim quandoque prohibet inuentionem Lapidis apud inquisitionem.	 When we come to treatment, it is necessary first to cleanse the sick person with an enema, which will remove all the feces that are in his intestines; indeed, at times it prevents the discovery of a stone during examination.
Deinde accipiatur infirmus cum pedibus suis, et concutiatur, et moueatur ad inferiora: ut descendat Lapis ad profundum uesicae, aut saliat de loco alto aliquotiens.	 Then the sick person should be received with his feet, shaken and moved to the lower part; so that the stone descends to the depth of the bladder or rises from a high place several times.
Deinde fac eum sedere inter manus tuas praeparatum, et manus eius sint sub coxis ipsius, ut fiat uesica tota decliuis ad inferiora.	 Then make him sit between your hands which are under his buttocks; so that the bladder becomes entirely empty towards lower parts.
Deinde perquire eum, et tange eum extrinsecus.	 Then examine (him) and touch him from outside.
Si ergo sentis Lapidem in spacio, tunc propera statim cum sectione super ipsum.	If therefore you feel a stone [in your body], then hasten immediately with incision upon it.
Quod si non cadat sub tactu tuo omnino, tunc oportet ut abstergas digitum indicem cum oleo manus sinistrae, si infirmus est puer: aut digitum medium si est iuuenis completus: et intromittas ipsum in anum suum, et perquire de Lapide, donec stat sub digito tuo: et conuerte eum paulatim ad collum uesicae.	 If it does not fall under your touch at all, then you must lay the index finger of the left hand on it, if the patient is weak; or the middle finger if he is a full grown man; and introduce it into its [the stone's] own anus, and inquire about the stone, until it comes under your finger; and turn it gradually towards the neck of the bladder.
Deinde preme super ipsum cum digito tuo, et impelle ipsum ad exteriora aduersus locus, cuius sectionem uis: et praecipe ministro, ut premat uesicam manu sua, et praecipe alii ministro, ut extendat testiculos manu sua dextra ad superiora: et alia manu sua, ut remoueat cutem, quae est sub testiculis in parte a loco in quo est sectio.	 Then press upon it with your finger, and push it towards the outside against the place of section which you wish; and command the servant to press the bladder with his hand, and command another servant to extend the testicles of the right hand upwards; and let one servant remove the skin that is below the testicles in the part from the place where the incision is.
Deinde intromitte Spatumile incidens, cuius forma haec est.	 Then introduce the Spatula incising, whose shape is this [as depicted].
Et finde in eo quod est inter anum et testiculos, et non in medio, ad latus natis sinistrae: et sit sectio super ipsum lapidem, et digitus tuus sit in ano: et fiat sectio transuersa, ut sit sectio exterius ampla, et interius stricta, secundum quantitatem quod sit possibile egressio Lapidis ex ea non maior.	 And find it which is between the anus and the testicles, not in the middle, on the left side of the natal opening; and let the incision be upon the stone, and your finger be in the anus; and let the incision be transverse, so that the incision be broad externally and narrow internally, according to as much as the exit of the stone from it is possible, not larger.
Fortasse enim comprimit digitus, qui est in ano Lapidem apud sectionem, et egreditur absque difficultate.	 For perhaps the finger which is in the anus presses the stone at the incision, and exits without difficulty.
Et scias, quod ex Lapide est cui sunt anguli et margines, quare fit difficilis exitus eius propter illud.	 And know that from the stone are its angles and edges, wherefore the exit of it is difficult because of that [fact].
Et ex eo est lenis, similis glandulae, et rotundus: et fit facilis egressus eius.	 And it is smooth and round like a grape, and its exit is easy.
Ei ergo cui sunt anguli, et margines, adde in fissura.	 To him who has angles and edges, add [to the incision] in the fissure.
Quod si non egreditur ita, tunc oportet ut ingenies super ipsum: aut stringas super eum cum gesti decenter, cuius extremitas sit sicut Luna, quae stringat super Lapidem, et non euadat ab ea: aut ut intromittas sub eo instrumentum subtile, curuatae extremitatis.	 If it does not exit thus, then you must bore upon it; or you shall bind it with a well-placed ligature whose end is as the Moon, which binds above the stone and does not slip off from it; or you shall introduce beneath it a sharp instrument, curved at its end.
Si autem non potes super cum, tunc amplifica foramen parumper.	 If however you cannot extend it over [him], then enlarge the opening slightly.
Quod si uincit te aliquid ex sanguine, abscinde ipsum cum zegi.	 If something from his blood beats you back, cut it off with the saw.
Si uero lapis est plus quam unus, tunc impelle in primis magnum ad os uesicae.	 But if the stone is larger than one, then push the large one into the bladder first.
Deinde incide super ipsum.	 Then cut upon it.
Postea impelle paruum post illud: et similiter fac si sunt plures duobus.	 Then push a smaller one after that; and do the same if there are more than two.
Quod si magnus est ualde, tunc ignorantia est ut seces super ipsum sectione magna.	 If it is very large, then ignorance is to cut through it with a great incision.
Quoniam accidit infirmo una duarum rerum, aut ut moriatur, aut accidit ei distillatio urinae assidua: proptera, quia non consolidatur locus omnino.	 Because it happens to the weak one of two things, either that he dies, or there is a continuous flow of urine; therefore because the place does not solidify at all.
Verum administra expulsionem eius, donec egrediatur: aut ingenia in fractura eius cum forficibus, donec extrahas eum frustatim.	 But administer its expulsion, until it comes out; or force its fracture with forceps, until you extract it piece by piece.
Cum ergo compleueris operationem tuam, tunc imple uulnus thure, et aloe, et sanguine draconis: et stringe ipsum, et pone super ipsum pannum infusum oleo et uino, aut oleo rosato, et aqua frigida: ut sedetur apostema calidum.	 When you have thus completed your operation, then fill the wound with turpentine, aloe, and dragon's blood; tie it up, and place over it a cloth soaked in oil and wine, or rose-oil, and cold water; so that an abscess may be seated warm.
Deinde resupina infirmum super collum suum, et non soluas ligamentum, usque ad diem tertium.	 Then turn the weak one on his back onto his neck, and do not loosen the bandage until the third day.
Cum ergo solueris ipsum, embroca locum cum aqua, et oleo multo.	 When you release it [the wound], moisten the place with oil and much water.
Deinde cura ipsum cum unguento dyafinicon, et unguento basilicon, donec sanetur.	 Then treat it with diaphinicon ointment, and basilicon ointment, until it is healed.
Si autem accidit in uulnere apostema calidum additum, et corrosi, et illi similia: sicut si congeletur sanguis in uesica, et prohibeatur ex eo urina: et cognoscitur illud ex egressione sanguinis cum urina.	 If an abscess hot and corrosive is added to the wound, and similar things; as if blood congeals in the bladder, and urine is prevented from it; and this is recognized by the outflow of blood with urine.
Intromitte ergo digitum tuum in uulnus, et extrahe illum sanguinem.	 Then insert your finger into the wound, and draw out the blood.
Nam si remanet, prouocat ad corruptionem uesicae, et putrefactionem eius.	 If it remains, it provokes the corruption of the bladder and its putrefaction.
Deinde ablue uulnus cum aceto, et aqua, et sale: et oppone omni speciei cum eo quod conuenit ex curatione, usquequo sanetur.	 Then clean the wound with vinegar, water, and salt; and apply any remedy suitable for its cure until it heals.
Et oportet in horis curationis totius, ut liges duas coxas, et aggreges, caussa medicinarum quae ponuntur super locum.	 Moreover, during the entire period of treatment, it is necessary to bind two thighs together and press them, for the cause of the medicines placed on the spot.
Quod si lapis est paruus, et sit in meatu uirgae, et figitur in eo, et prohibetur urinae exitus: tunc cura ipsum cum eo quod narro antequam peruenias ad sectionem.	 If the stone is small and is in the neck of the bladder and causes obstruction to urine flow, then treat it with what I mentioned earlier before resorting to cutting.
Multotiens enim a sectione excusaris per hanc curationem, iam enim probaui illud.	 For many times you will be excused from the cutting in this treatment, since I have already proved that.
Et est, ut accipias Perforatorium ex ferro alferico, cuius haec est forma, triangulatae extremitatis, acutum, fixum in ligno.	 Also take the Perforatorium from iron altar, whose shape is triangular at the end and sharp, fixed in wood.
Deinde accipe filum, et liga cum eo uirgam sub lapide ut non redeat ad uesicam.	 Then take a thread, tie it to the penis under the stone so that it does not return to the bladder.
Deinde intromitte ferrum perforans in uirgam cum facilitate, donec perueniat Perforatorium ad ipsum lapidem: et reuolue Perforatorium manu tua in ipso lapide paulatim: et coneris perforationem eius, donec facias ipsum penetrare a parte altera.	 Then insert the perforating iron into the penis with ease until the Perforatorium reaches the stone; and rotate the Perforatorium by hand in the stone gradually; you will force the perforation of it until it pierces through from the other side.
Urina namque absoluitur statim.	 Therefore, urine is expelled immediately.
Deinde preme manum tuam super illud quod remansit ex lapide ab exteriori parte uirgae.	 Then press your hand on what remains of the stone from the outside part of the penis.
Ipse enim frangitur, et egreditur cum urina, et sanatur infirmus.	 It breaks and comes out with the urine, and heals the sick one.
Si autem non praeparatur tibi haec curatio, propter aliquid quod prohibet ab illo: tunc liga filum sub lapide, et filum aliud supra lapidem.	 If this treatment is not prepared for you due to some reason that prevents it; then tie a thread under the stone and another thread above the stone.
Deinde seca super lapidem in ipsa uirga inter duas ligaturas.	 Then cut across the stone on the penis between the two bindings.
Deinde extrahe ipsum.	 Then remove it (the stone).
Postea solue ligamentum, et mundifica sanguinem congelatum, qui fit in uulnere.	 Afterwards, untie the binding and clean the congealed blood that forms in the wound.
Et non est necessarium ligamentum fili sub lapide, nisi ut non redeat ad uesicam: et ligamentum aliud desuper, nisi ut quando soluitur filum post egressionem lapidis, redeat cutis ad locum suum, et cooperiat uulnus: et propter illud necesse est tibi illud quando ligas filum superius, ut eleues cutem ad superiora, ut redeat apud complementum tuum, et cooperiat uulnus, sicut diximus.	And it is not necessary to tie a thread under the stone, unless to prevent its return to the bladder: and another thread on top, unless when the thread is loosened after the stone's exit, the skin returns to its place, and seals the wound: and for this reason it is necessary for you, when tying the upper thread, to raise the skin towards above, so that it returns at the completion and seals the wound, as we said.
¶ De extractione Lapidis mulierum.	 On the Extraction of Stones in Women.
Caput LXI.	 Chapter LXI.
Parum generatur Lapis in mulieribus.	 The Stone is less generated in women.
Si autem accidat alicui earum lapis, tunc difficilis est curatio, et prohibetur propter modos multos.	 If however it happens to any of them that a stone occurs, then the cure is difficult, and it is forbidden on account of many conditions.
Vnus eorum est: quod mulier fortasse est uirgo.	 One of these is: that the woman perhaps is a virgin.
Et secundus est, quia tu non inuenis mulierem quae detegat seipsam medico, quando est casta, aut ex habentibus maritos.	 And secondly, because you cannot find a woman who will expose herself to the doctor when she is chaste or married.
Tertius est, quia tu non inuenis mulierem bene scientem hanc artem, praecipue operationem cum manu.	 Thirdly, because you cannot find a woman well skilled in this art, especially the operation with the hand.
Et quartus est longinquitas a loco lapidis: quare indiget sectione profunda, et in illo est timor.	 And fourthly, the distance from the place of the stone: why it requires deep incision, and there is fear in this.
Quod si necessitas prouocat ad illud, tunc oportet ut accipias mulierem medicam, bene scientem: et parum inuenitur.	 If necessity compels to this, then it is necessary that you take a skilled woman; and one is hardly found.
Si uero priuaris ea, tunc quaere medicum castum, subtilem, et praesenta mulierem obstetricem bene doctam in re mulierum, aut mulierem quae in hac arte innuit partem artis: fac ergo eam praesentem, et praecipue ei, ut faciat totum quod praecipis ei ex inquisitione super lapidem.	 If you lack this, then seek a chaste doctor, subtle and present obstetrician well-learned in women's matters, or a woman who is knowledgeable about this art: make her present, and especially tell her to do everything that you instruct her regarding the examination of the stone.
In primis quod est, ut aspiciat si mulier est uirgo: tunc oportet ut intromittat digitum in anum eius, et quaerat lapidem.	 Firstly, to see if the woman is a virgin: then it is necessary that you insert your finger into her anus and search for the stone.
Si ergo inuenit ipsum, coartet eum sub digito suo, et tunc praecipe obstetrici, ut intromittat digitum suum in uuluam infirmae, et inquirat super lapidem, postquam ponit manum suam sinistram super uesicam, et comprimit eam compressione bona.	 If he finds it, then twist it with his finger and then tell the obstetrician to insert her finger into the weak vulva and examine the stone, after she places her left hand on the bladder and compresses it with good pressure.
Si ergo inuenit lapidem, tunc oportet ut gradatim moueat eum ab orificio uesicae ad inferiora cum summa uirtutis suae, donec perueniat cum eo ad radicem coxae.	 If therefore a stone is found, then it is necessary that it be slowly moved from the opening of the bladder towards the lower parts with great care until it reaches the root of the hip with it.
Deinde secet super eum apud oppositionem medietatis uuluae apud radicem coxae, ex quacunque parte praeparatur ei, et sentit lapidem in illa parte: et digitus eius non remoueatur a lapide, coartans sub eo: et sit sectio parua in primis.	 Then it is to be cut above it at the opposite middle of the wound near the root of the hip, from whatever side it is prepared for him, and he feels the stone in that place; and his finger should not be removed from the stone, bent under it; and let the cut be small at first.
Deinde intromittat radium super illam sectionem.	 Then a probe is inserted into that incision.
Si ergo sentit lapidem, tunc addat in sectionem secundum quantitatem proportionatam quod lapis egreditur ab ea.	 If he feels the stone, then add to the incision according to the size proportional to which the stone exits from there.
Et scias, quod species lapidis sunt multae.	 And know that there are many types of stones.
Ex his enim est paruus, et magnus, lenis et asper, longus, et rotundus habens ramos.	 For these reasons it is small, and large, smooth or rough, long, or round having branches.
Scias ergo species eius, ut significetur tibi per hoc super illud quod uis.	 Know its type so that it may be shown to you about the one that you wish.
Si ergo uincit te sanguis, tunc adde in loco zegi tritum, et tene ipsum hora una, donec abscindatur sanguis.	 If blood conquers you, then add in the place a burnt charcoal and hold it for an hour until the bleeding stops.
Deinde redi ad operationem tuam, donec egrediatur lapis: et fac, ut praepares tecum ex instrumentis, quae dixi in extractione lapidis in uiris, ut adiuueris per ea in operatione tua.	 Then return to your operation until the stone comes out; and make sure that you prepare yourself with the tools which I have said for the removal of stones in men, so as to assist you in your operation.
Quod si uincit te fluxus sanguinis, et scis quod expulsio sanguinis est ex arteria quae incisa est: tunc pone puluerem super locum, et stringe eum cum puluillis strictura decenti: et non mutes illud: et dimitte lapidem, et non extrahas ipsum.	 If the flow of blood conquers you and you know that the bleeding is from an artery that was cut; then place flour on the place and bind it with a fitting ligature; do not move that; and leave the stone alone, and do not remove it.
Fortasse enim morietur mulier infirma.	 Perhaps a weak woman may die.
Deinde cura uulnus.	 Then take care of the wound.
Cum ergo sedatur acuitas sanguinis post dies, et putrefit locus, tune redi ad operationem tuam, donec egrediatur lapis.	 When the sharpness of the blood subsides after days and the place becomes corrupt, then return to your operation until the stone comes out.
¶ De sectione suiper Herniam aquosam.	 On the incision of a hydrocele (hernia).
Caput LXII.	 De modo in quo super herniam aquosam scindendum
Ramex aquosa non est, nisi aggregatio humiditatis in sifac albo, quod est sub cute testiculi continente ouum: et nominatur sifac.	 A hydrocele is not a tumor, but an accumulation of moisture inside the albovaginal (albocoelom) sac that contains the testicle and egg: and it is called the albovoaginal sac.
Et quandoque est in panniculo proprio sibi, quem praeparauit ei natura in parte oui, donec putetur: quod est ouum aliud, et est cutis testiculi inter sifac album, quod diximus: et non fit illud nisi raro.	 And sometimes it is within its own pannicle (fat) that nature has prepared for it near the testicle until it seems like an egg; and this is another egg, and it is between the albovaginal sac and the testicular skin which we mentioned earlier: and this does not occur frequently.
Et generatio quidem huius ramicis, est ex debilitate quae accidit testiculis: quare effunditur ad eos haec materia.	 And indeed, the production of this growth is due to weakness that occurs in testicles; therefore, this material flows out into them.
Et quandoque accidit ex percussione super testiculos.	 Sometimes it arises from a blow to the testicles.
Et haec humiditas est habens colores multos.	 And this moisture has many colors.
Aut enim est color eius decliuis ad citrinitatem, aut est sanguineus rubeus, aut faeculentus, niger, aut est aquosus albus, et est illud quod est plus.	 For its color is often sloping towards yellow, or it is reddish, or dark, or watery white, and this is the most common.
Et signa quibus scitur ubi sit aggregatio aquae, sunt ista.	 And the signs by which it can be known where the accumulation of moisture is, are these.
Nam si est in sifac albo quod diximus, tunc apostema est rotundum ad longitudinem parumper sicut figura oui: et non apparet testiculus, quoniam humiditas continet eum ab omni parte.	 For if it is in the albovaginal sac that we mentioned earlier, then it is an abscess round and somewhat larger than the shape of an egg; and the testicle cannot be seen because moisture keeps it contained from all sides.
Et si est humiditas in panniculo proprio sibi, tunc apostema est rotundum cum parte oui, et propter hoc extimat homo quia est ouum aliud.	 And if the moisture is within its own pannicle (fat), then it is an abscess round with a part of the egg; and therefore man is troubled because it seems like another egg.
Et si humiditas est inter cutem testiculorum et sifac album, tunc cadit sub sensu.	 And if the moisture is between the skin of the testicles and the albovaginal sac, then it falls under suspicion.
Quando ergo uis cognitionem coloris humiditatis, tunc experire colorem humiditatis in apostemate cum Intromisso quadrato, cuius forma praecessit.	 When you desire to test the color of the moisture, then probe the color of the moisture in an abscess with a square probe, whose shape has been described earlier.
Secundum illud ergo quod egreditur in uestigio Intromissi, iudica de illo quod est inter ipsum.	 Therefore, according to what comes out in the track of the probe, judge about that which is between it.
Cum ergo uenimus ad curationem cum ferro, tunc oportet ut praecipias infirmo, ut phlebotometur si possibile est ei illud, et uides corpus eius plenum.	 When we therefore come for treatment with iron, then it is necessary that you command the sick person, if possible for him, to be bled and see his body full.
Deinde resupinetur super dorsum suum super rem altam parum, et pone sub eo pannos multos.	 Then he shall lie on his back upon a high place slightly, and put many cloths beneath him.
Deinde sede tu super sinistram eius, et praecipe ministro, ut sedeat a dextra eius, qui extendat uirgam eius ad unum duorum laterum cutis testiculorum, et ad partem mirach uentris.	 Then you sit on his left side, and command the attendant to sit at his right, who shall extend his arm to one of two sides of the skin of the testicles, and to the part of the flank of the abdomen.
Deinde accipe spatumile latum, et seca cutem testiculorum ex medio per longitudinem, usque prope pectinem: et fiat sectio secundum rectitudinem aequedistantis lineae quae diuidit cutem testiculorum, donec perueniat ad sifac album comprehendens: et excoria ipsum et obserua, uel caue ex hoc, ut seces ipsum: et sit excoriatio tua qua ipsum excorias, ex parte quae suspenditur cum ouo plus: et subtiliter scrutare cum excoriatione secundum quantitatem quod tibi possibile est.	 Then take a broad lancet and cut the skin of the testicles from the middle along its length, up to near the comb; and make the incision according to the straight line dividing the skin of the testicles, until reaching the white fat enclosing it; and scrape it off and observe it, or be careful not to sever it; and let your scraping be from the part that hangs more with the egg; and examine subtly with the scraping according to the quantity that is possible for you.
Deinde perfora sifac plenum aqua perforatione ampla, et extrahe totam aquam.	 Then pierce the white fat full of water through a wide perforation and extract all the water.
Deinde separa inter duo labia sectionis cum uncinis, et extende sifac ad superiora, et non tangas cutem testiculorum comprehendentem: et incide sifac qualitercunque est possibile tibi incidere ipsum, aut cum totalitate sua, aut frustatim, praecipue latus eius subtile.	 Then separate the two lips of the incision with scissors and extend the white fat towards the top, and do not touch the skin of the testicles enclosing it; and cut the white fat in any way that is possible for you to cut it, either completely or piecemeal, especially the subtle side.
Nam si tu non exquisite perscrutaris, in incisione eius non fit securitas, quin aqua redeat.	 For if you do not examine and scrutinize, there is no certainty that water will not return in the incision.
Si autem procedit ouum exterius a cute sua in hora operationis tuae: tunc quando compleueris sectionem sifac, reduc ipsum.	 If however an egg appears externally from its skin during your operation; then when you complete the incision of the white fat, bring it back.
Deinde aggrega duo labia cutis testiculorum cum sutura.	 Then join together the two lips of the skin of the testicles with suture.
Deinde cura ipsum sicut reliqua uulnera, donec sanetur.	 Then take care of him as the other wounds, until he is healed.
Quod si inuenis ouum corruptum ex nigredine alia, tunc oportet ut liges uasa, quae sunt suspensorium, timens fluxum sanguinis.	 If you find an egg corrupted by other blackness, then it is necessary to tie vessels that are suspension-related, fearing bleeding.
Deinde abscinde testiculum cum suspensorio, et extrahe ouum: postea cura illud cum eo quod diximus.	 Then remove the testicle with its suspension, and extract the egg; afterwards take care of it as I said.
Si uero aqua est aggregata in duabus partibus, tunc scias quia sunt duae ramices: seca ergo partem aliam secundum quod fecisti in altera aequaliter.	 If water is gathered in two parts, then know that there are two branches; cut off the other part equally as you did on the other one.
Et si aequatur tibi, ut sit operatio una, tunc fac: deinde absterge sanguinem.	 And if it seems to you that the operation should be one, then do so; afterwards remove blood.
Et intromitte in sectiones lanam submersam in oleo, aut in oleo rosato: et pone deforis lanam aliam quam submersisti in uino et oleo, et expande eam super duos testiculos, et mirach uentris: et pone desuper pannos duplicatos, et sunt puluilli: et liga eos desuper cum ligamento, quod est habens sex secundum hanc formam.	 Insert a thread submerged in oil or pink oil, and place another thread outside that was soaked in wine and oil; spread it over both testicles, inspect the intestines; place double cloths on top, which are called puluilli; tie them with a ligament that has six knots according to this shape.
Deinde sumantur duo panni, et suantur, et impleantur la na carminata, secundum hanc similitudinem: et fiant extremitates quibus premitur ex coto, aut lana humida: et aggregentur cum strictura in lumbari bracharum: et una extremitatum accipiat super anum usque ad dorsum, et secunda accipiat ad partem pectinis: et duae extremitates super duas coxas inferius, et duae extremitates aliae super duo inguina, et aggregetur strictura tota in lumbari bracharum.	 Then take two cloths and wash them, fill them with carminated cotton according to this shape; make the ends which are pressed with wool or wet thread; attach them with a strap at the hips; one end should reach from anus to the back, and the second from the neck part; the two ends below should be attached to both thighs, and the other two ends to both groins; attach the whole strap at the hips.
Et, quandoque artificialiter medicatur haec ramex cum cauterio loco sectionis cum ferro: et est, ut accipias cauterium cultellare subtile, et seces cum eo cutem testiculorum: et est ignitum, secundum quod narrauimus: donec quando detegitur sifac album continens aquam: tunc accipe cauterium, secundum hanc formam.	 Sometimes this branch is artificially treated with a cautery in place of the section with iron; you should take a subtle cautery knife and cut through the testicle skin with it; it should be lit as we described earlier until white albumen containing water appears; then take the cautery according to this shape.
Assimilatur literae graecae.	 Compared to Greek letters.
Deinde perfora cum eo illud sifac, et est ignitum, donec egrediatur humiditas tota.	 Then pierce it with that and burn it until all moisture comes out.
Deinde extende sifac cum uncinis, et excoria cum cauterio subtili ignito, et incide ipsum secundum quod possibile est tibi, donec eradices totum eius.	 Then extend the sifac with forceps, and scrape it with a subtle cautery heated, and cut it as much as possible for you, until you remove the entire thing.
Et caue ex ouo, ne tangat ipsum ignis.	 And be careful not to touch the egg, lest fire should do harm to it.
Et scias, quod haec operatio est saluior, et longinquior a fluxu sanguinis, et melior quam operatio cum sectione.	 Know that this operation is safer and more distant from bleeding, and better than the operation with incision.
Si uero contrarietatem tibi facit in hora sectionis, aut in hora cauterii apostema calidum, aut fluxus sanguinis, aut aliquid aliud: tunc oportet ut cures quod contrarietatem tibi facit ex illo cum curatione quae conuenit ei, secundum quod praemissum est.	 If, however, the operation opposes you at the time of incision, or at the time of cauterization an abscess is heated, or bleeding, or something else: then it is necessary that you take care of what opposes you from that with a cure suitable for it, according to what has been mentioned above.
Si autem infirmus est timidus, et non expectat super hanc operationem, propter horribilitatem suam: tunc administra perforationem secundum quod ego narro illud: et est.	 If, however, the patient is feeble and fearful, and does not await this operation on account of its horror: then administer a lancing according to what I have told you; and there it is.
Quando certificatur tibi apud te per illud quod diximus de significationibus, quod ramex est aquosa: tunc oportet quod facias sedere infirmum super sedem eleuatam.	 When it is confirmed to you by what we have said about the meanings that it is a watery branch: then it is necessary that you make the patient sit on an elevated seat.
Deinde perfora apostema in inferiori parte sui cum spatumili lato: et pone perforationem secundum longitudinem corporis, et sit apertio ampla, donec currat aqua tota.	 Then lance the abscess on its lower part with a wide cupping glass; and place the lancing along the length of the body, and let the opening be wide until all the water flows out.
Deinde pone super locum cotum, et liga ipsum, et dimitte ipsum ut currat residuum aquae: deinde cura ipsum, donec sanetur uulnus.	 Then place a warm cloth over the spot, and bind it, and allow it to flow out the remaining water; then take care of it until the wound heals.
Si autem contrarietas sit egressioni aquae in hora qua perforas ipsam: et non sit illud nisi propterea, quia panniculus albus contrarietatem facit in orificio uulneris, et prohibet exitum aquae: tunc oportet ut intromittas pennam in uulnus, aut instrumentum cum quo extrahitur aqua hydropicorum, cuius forma praecessit: aut adde in operatione uulneris parumper.	 If, however, an obstacle is present to the outflow of water at the time you lance it; and this is not because a white cloth opposes the opening of the wound and prevents the outflow of water: then it is necessary to introduce a feather or an instrument with which water is extracted from hydropic swellings, whose shape has been mentioned earlier; or add in the operation of the wound a small amount.
Et scias, quod aqua redit, et aggregatur post sex menses, aut circiter eos.	 And know that water returns and accumulates after six months, or approximately that period.
Cum ergo aggregatur, tunc pertoretur secundum eundem modum, et pertransibit infirmus dies suos.	 When it accumulates, then it is to be pounded in the same way and the sick days will pass through.
¶ De cura Ramicis carnosae.	 Chapter on the treatment of fleshy roots.
Caput LXIII.	 Chapter Sixty-third.
Scias, quod in sectione super hanc Ramicem, est ex timore perducente ad perniciem in pluribus dispositionibus.	 Know that in the incision upon this root [Rhizoma], there is danger of slipping into destruction in many positions.
Quapropter uidetur mihi eius dimissio saluari ex ea.	 Therefore it seems to me that its abandonment [of the incision] would be beneficial.
Et ego sum rememorans operationem in ea, et species apostematis.	 And I am recalling the operation in it and the appearance of the cauterizations.
Dico ergo, quod accidunt apostemata multa in corporibus, ex quibus componuntur testiculi: et fit illud ex caussis multis, scilicet.	 Therefore I say that many cauterizations occur in bodies from which testicles are composed; this happens for various reasons such as.
Aut ex superfluitate acuta, uel acri, quae effunditur ad testiculos.	 Or from an excess of acute or sharp fluid that flows towards the testicles.
Aut ex percussione.	 Or from a blow [causing an injury].
Et est color apostematis secundum colorem corporis, et non inuenitur ei dolor: et est apostema graue.	 And the color of the cauterization corresponds to the color of the body and no pain is found; it is a grave cauterization.
Et fortasse est apostema lapideum, cuius color est fuscus, et non est sensus ei.	 Perhaps it is a stone-like cauterization, whose color is dark, and there is no sensation in it.
Et quandoque fit ex nodatione arteriarum, et inflatione earum: sicut iam praecessit eius rememoratio: aut ex inflatione uenarum.	 Sometimes it occurs from a swelling of the arteries and their inflation; as I have already reminded you before; or from the inflation of veins.
Quod ergo est ex eis ex inflatione arteriarum, cognoscitur per dispositionem apostematis, quando comprimis ipsum digitis tuis.	 What is known from these as being due to an inflation of the arteries, is recognized by the disposition of the cauterization, when you compress it with your fingers.
Et non oportet ut tangas ipsum prorsus.	 And one should not touch it completely [throughout].
Illud uero quod fit ex inflatione uenarum, non dispergitur ex eo aliquid apud compressionem cum digitis.	 However, that which occurs from the inflation of veins is not dispersed by compression with the fingers.
Et iam possibile est, quod super hanc speciem fiat sectio, et super reliquas carnes: et est, ut seces cutem testiculorum.	 And now it is possible that an incision can be made upon this appearance and upon the remaining flesh; and it is that the skin of the testicles is to be incised.
Deinde extende ouum ad sursum, et extrahe ipsum cum sifach albo: et libera suspensorium ex uasis, et liga uasa: et incide suspensorium postquam tu liberas ipsum ab omni parte ex partibus oui.	 Then stretch the egg upward and extract it along with a white silken thread; free the suspender from the water and tie the vessels; and incise the suspender after you have released it from all parts of the egg.
Si ergo ouum consolidatum est cum illis carnibus natis, tunc oportet ut attrahas ouum, et incidas ipsum.	If therefore an egg is hardened with those born flesh, then it is necessary that you pull out the egg, and cut it.
Et si adhaerentia est inter aliquid ex siphaket, aut in eo quod est inter uasa: tunc oportet ut liberes totam illam adhaerentiam, et incidas eam incisione rotunda.	 And if there is an attachment between something from the siphunculus, or within a vessel: then it is necessary that you release the entire attachment, and cut it with a round incision.
Si autem est natiuitas carnis in loco adhaerentiae quae est retro: tunc oportet ut incidas totum eius, et extrahas ouum, sicut diximus.	 If however there is the growth of flesh at a place of attachment which is behind: then it is necessary that you cut the whole of it, and pull out the egg, as we said.
Cum ergo completur operatio tua, tnnc imple uulnus in lana infusa in oleo rosato, et uino: deinde cura ipsum cum reliqua curatione, donec sanetur.	 When therefore your operation is finished, then fill the wound with wool soaked in rose oil and wine; afterwards care for it with the rest of the treatment, until it heals.
¶ De cura Ramicis, quae est cum Vite.	 Chapter on the Care of Twigs, which is with Vines.
Caput LXIIII.	 Chapter LXIII.
Uitis est apostema inuolutum quadam inuolutione, simile botro, cum mollificatione testiculorum: et fit difficilis super infirmum motus et exercitium, et deambulatio.	 A tumor is enclosed by a certain enclosure resembling a bunch of grapes when the testicles are softened; and it becomes difficult for weak movement and exercise, and walking.
Et in curatione huius aegritudinis est ex timore, propter illud cuius praecessit rememoratio.	 And in the treatment of this disease is fear due to the memory of what preceded it.
Verum oportet, ut dicamus operationem in ea secundum quod fecerunt primi.	 But it is necessary that we say the operation in it according to what the first ones did.
Dico ergo, quod oportet ut facias sedere infirmum super sedem eleuatam.	 Therefore I say that you must make the weak sit on an elevated chair.
Deinde impelle suspensorium testiculorum ad inferiora.	 Then push the suspenders of the testicles downward.
Deinde tene cutem testiculorum cum digitis tuis, cum uasis quae sunt propinqua uirgae: et teneat ea minister alius, et extendat ea extensione uehementi.	 Then hold the skin of the testicles with your fingers, with the vessels that are near the thigh; and let another servant hold it and stretch it with a forceful extension.
Deinde incide cum spatumili lato acuto sectione transuersa in directo uasorum, donec detegantur uasa.	 Then cut with a broad, sharp crosswise section towards the vessels until the vessels are exposed.
Deinde excoria ab omni parte, sicut diximus tibi in extractione Arteriarum quae sunt in timporibus.	 Then scrape off from every side, as we said to you in the extraction of arteries that are in the temples.
Postea fige in eis acum in qua sit filum duplum, et liga ipsum in primo locorum quibus accidunt Vites: et liga ipsum iterum in ultimo eorum.	 Then tie a thread with a double point on it and bind it at the first places where vines appear; and bind it again at the last of them.
Deinde seca ea in media sectione recta secundum longitudinem corporis, et extrahe quod aggregatur ex humiditatibus faeculentis corruptis.	 Then cut it straight through the middle section according to the length of the body, and remove what accumulates from foul, corrupted moistures.
Deinde cura uulnus cum curatione reliquorum uulnerum, in quibus uis generari saniem, ut cadant uasa quae nutriunt unum testiculorum.	 Take care of the wound along with the other wounds where pus is generated, so that the vessels which nourish one testicle fall out.
Non est enim malum per illud.	 It is not bad by that means.
Si autem accidat Vitis omnibus uasis, tunc oportet ut extrahantur propter hoc testiculi cum uasis: ut non priuetur ouum nutrimento, propter incisionem, et tabescat, uel arescat, et non sit iuuamentum cum eis.	 If it happens that the vine grows on all the vessels, then they must be removed for this reason: so that the testicles are not deprived of nourishment by the incision, and it rots or burns and is no help to them.
¶ De cura Ramicis intestinalis.	 Chapter on the treatment of intestines.
Caput LXV.	 Chapter LXV.
Euentus huius Ramicis est ex sectione, quae accidit in sifach extenso super uentrem in parte inguinum ex mirach uentris.	 The outlet of this intestine is from the incision which happens in the siphon stretched over the abdomen in the inguinal part of the stomach.
Quare descendunt intestina ex illa Ruptura ad unum testiculorum.	 Because the intestines descend from that rupture to one testicle.
Et haec Ruptura est aut ex sifach, aut extensione eius.	 And this rupture is either in the siphon or its extension.
Et accidunt istae duae species ex caussis multis: aut ex percussione, aut saltu, aut clamore, aut eleuatione rei grauis, et similibus.	 These two types of ruptures occur for various reasons: either by striking, jumping, shouting, lifting heavy objects or similar causes.
Et signum, quando est ex extensione sifach.	 And the sign is when it is from the extension of the siphon.
Est quod accidit paulatim in tempore longo, et non accidit subito: et est apostema aequale uersus profundum: propterea, quod sifach comprimit intestinum.	 It happens gradually over a long time and does not happen suddenly; it is an abscess equal to the turned-over deep [intestine]; because the siphon presses on the intestine.
Et signum eius quando est ex sectione sifach, quia facit accidere ex principio sui dolorem uehementem subito: et est apostema diuersum, apparens sub cute propinque: et illud est propter exitum intestini, et cursus eius ad exteriora sifach.	 And the sign of this [type of rupture] is when it is from a section of the siphon, because it causes intense pain from the beginning suddenly; it is an abscess different, appearing under the skin close by; and that is due to the outlet of the intestine and its course to the exterior of the siphon.
Et quandoque egreditur cum intestino zirbum: et nominatur haec Ramex intestinalis, et zirbia: et quandoque fit cum uentositate.	 And sometimes it comes out with the intestine called "zirbum"; and this is called an intestinal ramus and "zirbia", and sometimes it occurs with ventosity (inflammation of the abdomen).
Et quandoque currit in intestinum stercus, et retinetur illic: et est cum eo pernicies infirmi: quoniam facit accidere dolorem prauum, et praecipue quando premitur.	 And sometimes fecal matter runs into the intestine and is retained there; it brings with it danger to the sick, because it causes pain, especially when it is pressed.
Et in curatione specierum aegritudinis huius cum ferro est timor: quare oportet ut caueatur casus in ea.	 And in the treatment of this disease by iron there is fear; therefore care must be taken to avoid accident in it.
Et modus operationis est, ut praecipias infirmo, ut reducat intestinum manu sua ad interiora concauitatis suae, si obedit reditui.	 The method of operation is that you order the sick person to bring his intestine back with his own hand to the inner concavity of himself, if he obeys the return.
Deinde resupinetur super collum suum inter manus tuas: et eleua crura eius.	 Then he lies on his back on his neck between your hands; and elevate his legs.
Deinde extende cutem quae sequitur cutem ad superiora, et seca cutem testiculorum totam per longitudinem.	 Then stretch the skin that follows the skin towards the upper part and cut the skin of the testicles completely along the length.
Deinde fige in duobus labiis sectionis uncinos, secundum quod indiges ad aperiendum sectionem cum eis: et sectio sit secundum quantitatem, quod sit possibile, ut egrediatur ex ea ouum.	 Then fix two hooks on the edges of the cut, according to what you need to open the cut with them; and the incision should be according to the amount that it is possible for an egg to come out from it.
Deinde excoria siphak, et quae sunt sub cute testiculorum, donec quando detegitur sifach album, durum ab omni parte: tunc intromitte digitum tuum indicem in eo quod sequitur testiculum, in eo quod est inter siphach album, quod est sub cute oui, et inter sifach secundum, et absolue cum eo adhaerentiam quae est in posteriori parte oui.	 Then scrape the sheep's bladder, and what is beneath the skin of the testicles until the albumen of the sheep's bladder becomes hard on all sides; then insert your thumb into the part that follows the testicle, into the part that is between the albumen of the sheep's bladder, which is under the skin of the egg, and between the folds, and without any adherence to it in the posterior part of the egg.
Deinde moue cum manu dextra ad interiora cutem testiculorum: et cum hoc extende sifach album ad sursum, cum manu sinistra: et eleua ouum cum sifach ad partem sectionis: et praecipe ministro, ut extendat ouum ad sursum: et tu solue adhaerentiam, quae est retro solutione completa.	 Then move with the right hand to the inner skin of the testicles and at the same time stretch the sheep's bladder albumen upward with the left hand; and lift the egg along with the albumen to the part of the incision, and command the attendant to stretch the egg upward; and you loosen the adherence that is behind the complete solution.
Et quaere digitis tuis, ut non sit aliquid illic ex intestino inuoluto in sifach albo duro.	 And examine with your fingers if there is nothing there from the intestine rolled up in hard albumen of the sheep's bladder.
Si autem inuenis ex eo aliquid: tunc impelle ipsum ad uentrem inferius.	 If you find something from it: then push it into the lower abdomen.
Deinde accipe acum, in qua sit filum grossum, factum licinium ex decem filis: et intromitte ipsam apud postremum sifach, id est, tunicae, quod est sub cute testiculorum quae sequitur sectionem: deinde incide extremitates quae eminent ex filo, donec sint quatuor fila.	 Then take the point, in which there is a thick thread made from linen of ten threads, and insert it at the last layer, that is, the tunica, which follows the skin of the testicles: then cut the ends that project from the thread until there are four threads.
Deinde compone quaedam eorum super quaedam cum figura quae sit in modo crucis: et liga cum eis alsifach, de quo diximus, quia est sub cute testiculorum ligamento uehementi, donec non possit aliquod ex uasis, quae nutriunt eos mittere ad eos aliquid: ut non accidat inde apostema calidum.	 Then compose some of them on top of others in the shape of a cross and tie it with alsifach, which we mentioned earlier, as it is the strong ligament under the skin of the testicles: until no waste that nourishes them can send anything to them; so that a hot abscess does not occur there.
Et pone iterum ligamentum secundum extra ligamentum primum, longinquum ab eo minus duobus digitis.	 And place the ligament again beyond the first ligament, at least two fingers away from it.
Et post ista duo ligamenta dimitte ex sifach, quod est sub cute testiculorum, quantitatem magnitudinis digiti: et incide reliquum totum secundum rotunditatem, et aufer ex eo ouum.	 And after these two ligaments, release from the alsifach, which is under the skin of the testicles, a quantity equal to the size of a finger: and cut the rest entirely in the round shape, and remove the egg.
Deinde seca in inferiori parte cutis testiculorum sectione, ex qua currit sanguis, et sanies: sicut narrauimus in eo quod praemissum est.	 Then cut the skin of the lower part of the testicles with a cut, from which blood and pus flows, as we said in that which was mentioned before.
Deinde administra lanam submersam in oleo, et pone in uulnus: et administra ligamentum quod narrauimus.	 Then apply wool soaked in oil and place it in the wound: and apply the ligament which we mentioned.
Et quandoque cauterizatur sifach album quod diximus, post incisionem eius timendo de fluxu sanguinis.	 And sometimes the alsifach is burned white, which we said, after its incision, fearing a flow of blood.
Multotiens enim accidit illud.	 Often this happens.
Et dimitte ligamentum, donec cadat per se.	 And release the ligament until it falls by itself.
Si autem tardatur casus eius, tunc embrocetur cum aqua calida: et pone super ipsum illud quod diximus, donec cadat.	 If the case persists, then fumigate with hot water: and place on it what we said until it falls.
Deinde cura uulnus cum reliqua curatione uulnerum, donec curetur.	 Then take care of the wound with the rest of the treatment for wounds, until it is healed.
¶ De Ramice uentosa.	 On swollen anus.
Caput LXVI.	 Head LXVI.
IN Hac Ramice non uidi aliquem qui ausus fuerit super curationem eius cum ferro.	 In this swollen anus, I have not seen anyone who dared to treat it with iron.
Et primi quidem dixerunt, quod fit sicut narrauimus in Ramice quae est cum Vite.	 And first they said that it happens as we mentioned in the swollen anus that is accompanied by piles.
Quod est, ut liges uasa post sectionem super ea cum facilitate inferius: deinde seca in medio, et cura postremo cum eo quod aperit ipsum, donec cadant uasa: et cura uulnus, secundum quod diximus, donec sanetur.	 What should be done is to tie the containers after cutting it below easily; then cut in the middle, and treat it later with what opens it itself, until the containers fall out; and treat the wound, as we said, until it heals.
¶ De disruptione quae fit in inguinibus.	 On the rupture that occurs in the groins.
Caput LXVII.	 Head LXVII.
Quando accidit Ruptura in inguinibus, sicut diximus, et eminet locus, et non descendit ad testiculos aliquid ex intestinis: et si descendit, est illud parum, et redit in omnibus horis: uerum si prolongatur cum ea tempus, additur fissura in sifach, donec descendunt intestina in sifach.	 When rupture occurs in the groins, as we have said, and a place protrudes out, and nothing from the intestines descends to the testicles; and if it does descend, it is little and returns in all hours; but if this persists for a long time, a fissure is added in the scrotum until the intestines descend into the scrotum.
Et accidit illud ex extensione sifach, quod est in inguinibus, sicut diximus.	 And this happens due to extension of the scrotum, as we have said in the groins.
Quod est, quia extenditur sifach: deinde mollificatur, et apostematur locus, et eminet.	 Because the scrotum extends; then it is softened, and the place is pushed out.
Et cura eius est cum cauterio, sicut praecessit eius narratio.	 And its treatment is with cautery, as we have previously said about it.
Et quandoque curatur cum ferro, secundum hunc modum: et est, ut iaceat infirmus super dorsum suum inter manus tuas.	 Sometimes it is treated with iron, according to this method: and it is to lie weak on his back between your hands.
Deinde seca locum Rupturae apostematum et eminentem, sectione per latitudinem, secundum quantitatem trium digitorum.	 Then cut the place of rupture and protrusion, with a cut across its width, according to the length of three fingers.
Deinde stringe alsifak et, quae sunt sub cute, donec quando detegitur sifach album, quod est sub cute quae sequitur ipsum.	 Then tie up the scrotum and what is beneath the skin, until the white part of the scrotum, which is beneath the skin following it, is exposed.
Tunc accipe radium, et pone ipsum super locum eminentem ex sifach, et preme ipsum ad profundum uentris.	 Then take the cautery and place it on the protruding part of the scrotum and press it deeply into the abdomen.
Deinde sue duo loca eminentia super extremitatem radii ex sifach, et annecte cum sutura unum eorum cum altero: deinde extrahe extremitatem radii.	 Then sew together two protuberances on the end of the radius from the shaft, and then extract the extremity of the radius.
Et non incidas alsifach omnino, neque tendas ouum, neque aliud, sicut feci te scire in curatione ramicis intestinalis.	 And do not cut the shaft at all, nor draw out the yolk, nor anything else, as I told you in the treatment of the intestinal branch.
Deinde cura illud curatione uulnerum.	 Then treat that with a wound cure.
Cum ergo incidis fila, mundifica illud, et restaura uulnus, donec consolidetur.	 When you cut the threads, clean it and restore the wound until it heals.
Sisach enim contrahitur, et non additur eminentia Rupturae.	 For sifach contracts and does not add to a rupture.
Et cauterium est melius in hoc loco: quoniam est propinquius ad salutem.	 And cautery is better in this place, because it is closer to safety.
¶ De mollificatione cutis testiculorum.	 Chapter on the softening of the scrotal skin.
Caput LXVIII.	 Chapter LXXVIII.
Multotiens mollificatur cutis testiculorum in quibusdam hominibus, propter quod mollificantur carnes quae sunt inter ea, et foedatur aspectus eius.	 The scrotal skin is often softened in some men, because the flesh between it becomes soft and its appearance becomes foul.
Ergo necesse est ei qui rogatur in curatione eius, ut faciat iacere infirmum super dorsum suum, et incidat totam cutem quae mollificata est super cutem naturalem.	 Therefore it is necessary for the one who asks to be treated for it, that he makes the affected one lie on his back and cuts through all the softened skin to the normal skin.
Deinde aggreget duo labia cum sutura: et si uis, sue in primis superfluitatem cutis mollificatae tribus suturis, aut quatuor, et firma suturam.	 Then sew together the two flaps with a suture: and if you wish, or rather, trim away the excess softened skin with three stitches, or four, and make a firm stitch.
Deinde incide inter sututuras.	 Then cut in between the stitches.
Deinde cura curatione reliquorum uulnerum, usquequo sanetur, et cadant fila.	 Then treat with wound cure the other wounds until they heal and the threads fall out.
¶ De Castratione.	 Chapter on castration.
Caput LXIX.	 Chapter LXXIX.
Scias, quod Castratio in lege nostra excommunicata est: et propter illud liceret mihi, ut non rememorarer eius in libro meo isto: et non est necessaria rememoratio eius, nisi propter duos modos.	 You know that castration is prohibited by our law, and therefore it would be permissible for me not to mention it in this book; but since there are two methods, it is necessary for me to remember it.
Quorum unus est, ut sit illud in scientia medici quando interrogatur de ea: et ut sciat curationem eius cui accidit.	 One of these is that it should be in the knowledge of the physician when asked about it: and that he knows the treatment for it which happens to him.
Et modus alter est, quod nos multotiens indigemus castratione quorundam animalium, propter iuuamenta nostra per illud, sicut arietum, hyrcorum, et gattorum, et similium ex animalibus.	 Another method is that we often need to castrate certain animals for our benefit through it, such as sheep, goats, and cats, and similar ones among animals.
Dico ergo, quod Castratio fit secundum duos modos.	 Therefore, I say that castration is done in two ways.
Aut per attritionem.	 Or by attrition.
Aut per fissuram, et sectionem.	 Or by a cut and division.
In illa autem quae fit per attritionem, uia operationis est: quod nos faciamus sedere animal in aqua calida, donec mollificentur testiculi eius, et leniantur, et pendeant: deinde attere eos manu tua, donec resoluantur et non appareant sub tactu.	 In that which is done by attrition, the method of operation is as follows: that we make the animal sit in warm water until its testicles soften and become limp, and then hang it; afterwards, rub them with your hand until they dissolve and no longer appear under touch.
In castratione autem per fissuram et sectionem, oportet ut teneas animal, et premas cutem testiculorum eius cum manu sinistra.	 In the castration by a cut and division, it is necessary that you hold the animal, and press the skin of its testicles with your left hand.
Deinde liga suspensorium, et seca super omne ouum sectione una, donec quando procedunt duo oua: tunc incide ea postquam excoriaueris utrumque, et non dimittas super ea ex sifaket aliquid praeter sifac subtile, quod est super uasa.	 Then tie the suspensorium, and cut above all the egg with a single section until when two eggs come out: then cut that after you have scoured both, and do not leave anything over it except a small amount of thin sifaket on the vessels.
Et iste modus castrationis est melior eo qui fit per attritonem: quoniam attritio fortasse relinquit aliquid ex testiculis, quare desiderat animal coitum.	 And this method of castration is better than that which is done by attrition because attrition possibly leaves something from the testicles, for which the animal desires coitus.
Deinde cura uulnus, donec sanetur.	 Then take care of the wound until it heals.
¶ De cura Hermafroditae duorum modorum.	 Paragraph on the cure of a Hermaphroditus in two ways.
Caput LXX.	 Chapter 70.
Hermafrodita ex uiris est secundum duos modos.	 A Hermaphroditus is from men according to two ways.
Vnus eorum est, quia apparet in eo quod sequitur spacium, aut in cute testiculorum, in eo quod est inter duos testiculos, figura quasi uulua mulieris, in qua sunt pili: et quandoque currit urina ex eo quod est in cute testiculorum.	 One of them is because there is a space or gap, or in the skin of the testicles, between the two testicles, which has the shape of a female vulva, in which there are hairs; and sometimes urine runs out from that which is in the skin of the testicles.
In mulieribus autem est species una, et est uulua mulieris super pectinem sicut testiculi uiri parui omnino, eminentes ad exteriora: quorum unus est sicut priapus uiri, et duo sicut duo testiculi.	 In women there is one kind and it is the woman's vulva on top of the crest like small testicles of a man, projecting to the outside; of which one is like Priapus in a man, and two like two testicles.
Et curatio trium specierum, duarum ex uiris, et speciei unius ex mulieribus, est: quia oportet ut incidas carnes additas, donec effugiat impressio earum.	 And the treatment of the three kinds, two from men and one from women, is as follows: Because it is necessary to cut into the added flesh until the impression disappears.
Deinde cura eas curatione reliquorum uulnerum.	 Then treat them with the care of other wounds.
In specie autem secunda uirorum, ex qua egreditur urina, quae est in cute testiculorum, non est operatio, neque est eius curatio omnino.	 In the second kind for men from which urine originates, which is in the skin of the testicles, there is no operation, nor is there any treatment at all.
¶ De incisione Tentiginis, et carnis eminentis in uuluis mulierum.	 Chapter on the incision of tentigines and projecting flesh in the vulvas of women.
Caput LXXI.	 Chapter LXXI.
Tentigo fortasse additur super rem naturalem, donec foedatur et turpis fit aspectus eius: et quandoque magnificatur in quibusdam mulieribus adeo, donec expanditur sicut in uiris, et peruenit usque ad coitum.	 A tentigo is possibly added over a natural thing until it becomes disfigured and its appearance becomes disgusting: and sometimes it is enlarged to such an extent in certain women that it expands like in men, and reaches copulation.
Oportet ergo ut teneas superfluitatem Tentiginis manu, aut cum uncino, et incidas: et non ultimes in incisione, praecipue in profundo radicis: ut non accidat fluxus sanguinis.	 Therefore, one must hold the excess of tentigo with the hand or with a hook and cut it: and not cut to the extreme, especially in deep roots, so that bleeding does not occur.
Deinde cura ipsam curatione uulnerum, donec sanetur.	 Then take care of the wound itself until it heals.
Caro autem orta, est caro quae nascitur in orificio matricis, donec impleat ipsum: et fortasse egreditur ad exteriora secundum similitudinem caudae: et propter illud quidam primi nominant aegritudinem caudatam.	 But the flesh that arises is the flesh born in the orifice of the matrix until it fills it: and perhaps it comes out to the exterior like the tail; and for this reason some call the disease caudated.
Oportet ergo ut incidamus eam sicut incidimus Tentiginem, et curemus eam, donec sanetur.	 Therefore, one must cut it as one cuts tentigo and treat it until it heals.
¶ De cura Alratica, quae est uulua mulieris non perforata.	 Chapter on the treatment of a woman's alratch, which is not perforated.
Caput LXXII.	 Chapter LXXII.
Alratica est, ut sit uulua mulieris non perforata, aut sit foramen paruum.	 The alratch is the swelling of a woman's unperforated vulva or a small opening.
Et est aut naturalis, aut accidentalis.	 And it can be natural or accidental.
Accidentalis est ex aegritudine quae praecessit: et ipsa quidem fit aut ex carne nata addita, aut sifach subtili, aut spisso: et fit aut in profundo matricis, aut in lateribus eius, aut in superiore ipsius, aut inferiori eius: et prohibet a coitu et impregnatione, et partu, et fortasse prohibet menstrua.	 Accidental is when it results from an illness that has come before: and it itself is made either of flesh born added, or of sifach subtile, or spisso; and it is made either deep in the matrix, or in its sides, or on top of it, or below it: and it prevents coitus and impregnation, and childbirth, and perhaps menstruation.
Et cognitio illius fit per aspectum obstetricis, si opilatio est apparens propinqua.	 The recognition of this is made through the examination of an obstetrician if the opening appears to be nearby.
Si autem non est apparens, tunc quaere eam digitis tuis, aut cum radio.	 If it is not apparent, then search for it with your fingers or with a rod.
Si autem opilatio est ex sifach subtili, et est propinqua duobus labiis: tunc propera, et disrumpe ipsam.	 If the opening is from sifach subtile and is near to two lips: then pull it and tear it apart.
Et est, ut ponas super duo labia puluillos.	 And it is to place two lentils on top of the lips.
Deinde pone indices tuos duarum manuum simul, et mulier sit super dorsum suum expansis cruribus suis.	 Then place your fingers of both hands together, and let the woman be on her back with her legs spread open.
Deinde extende duo labia cum fortitudine, donec disrumpatur sifach subtile, et aperiatur opilatio.	 Then stretch out the two lips forcefully until the cervix is torn (or ruptured) slightly, and the opening is exposed.
Deinde accipe lanam, et imbibe eam in oleo, et pone ipsam super locum: et coeat mulier omni die, ut non consolidetur locus uice alia.	 Then take some wool and soak it in oil, and place it on the spot. Let the woman do this every day to prevent it from becoming sealed (or congealed) with something else.
Si autem sifach est grossum, spissum: tunc oportet ut seces ipsum cum spatumili lato simili folio myrti.	 If the cervix is thick or large, then it is necessary to remove it with a wide-blade spatula similar to a myrtle leaf.
Si autem opilatio est ex carne nata, tunc suspende eam cum uncinis, et incide eam: et sint tecum medicinae quae fluxum sedant sanguinis absque mordicatione, sicut acacia, et sanguis draconis, et thus aggregatum cum albugine oui.	 If the opening is of flesh origin, then hang it with hooks and cut it; have medicines on hand that stop blood flow without causing pain, such as acacia, dragon's blood, and wax mixed with cow's milk fat.
Deinde administra cannulam ex plumbo amplam, ut non consolidetur uulnus uelociter, teneat eam diebus aliquot: et administra licinium ex lino sicco, deinde curetur reliqua curatione, donec sanetur.	 Then apply a wide cannula made of lead to prevent the wound from healing quickly, hold it for several days; then apply linen cloth, and treat the rest with the usual remedies until it heals.
Et quandoque nasciur in matrice natiuitas carnium aliarum: oportet ergo ut incidantur secundum hunc modum: dum non est apostema cancerosum apostemati enim canceroso quod est in matrice, non fiat contrarietas cum ferro omnino.	 And sometimes there is a birth of flesh other than the baby from the womb; it is necessary to cut them in this manner: do not let it become an abscess (or cancerous), as cutting a cancerous abscess in the womb will create an absolute contradiction with iron.
¶ De cura hemorroidarum, Athehelil, et Bothor rubeae in uuluis mulierum.	 Chapter on Hemorrhoids, by Athehelil and Bothor concerning women's ulcers.
Caput LXXIII.	 Chapter LXXIII (73).
Hemorroides quidem sunt apertio orificiorum uenarum, donec currit ex eis sanguis multus assidue.	 Hemorrhoids are the openings of veins from which blood constantly flows in large amounts.
Cum ergo antiquantur hemorroides, fiunt thelil: et iam dixi in diuisione species earum, et signa ipsarum: et dicam hic quae ex eis recipiunt curationem, et quae non.	 When hemorrhoids have been prolonged, they become thrombus; I have already said about their types and signs in the previous section, and here I will mention what is cured by them and what is not.
Dico ergo, quod hemorroides quae sunt in orificio matricis, et non apparent sensui: tunc non est ei curatio cum ferro.	 I say, therefore, that hemorrhoids which are in the vaginal opening and are not perceived by touch: then there is no cure with iron for it.
Quae autem ex eis sunt in orificio matricis super quas cadit sensus, sunt quae curantur.	 But those which are above the vaginal opening, concerning which sensation falls, are those which can be cured.
Oportet ergo ut intromittas mulierem in domum frigidam.	 Therefore, it is necessary that you enter the woman into a cold house.
Deinde extende athehelil cum forficibus, aut cum panno aspero, et incide eas ex radicibus suis.	 Then stretch the anus with forceps or with rough cloth, and cut them from their roots.
Deinde pulueriza super eas apud fluxum sanguinis ex uno puluerum incisiuorum absque mordificatione: sicut acacia, et sanguis draconis, et thus, et similia eis.	 Then sprinkle powder on them near the flow of blood from one cut without biting: like ashes of acom, dragon's blood, and frankincense, and similar to these.
Deinde impellat pedes eius ad parietem hora una.	 Then press his feet against the wall for an hour.
Postea depone eam in aquam frigidam.	 Then lay her down in cold water.
Quod si perseuerat fluxus sanguinis: tunc fac eam sedere in decoctione sumach, et corticum granatorum, et gallarum, et similium.	 If the bleeding continues: then make her sit in a decoction of sumac, and the bark of pomegranates, and gall nuts, and similar things.
Deinde accipe farinam hordei, et confice eam cum melle et aceto, et fac emplastrum cum eo super dorsum eius.	 Then take barley flour, and knead it with honey and vinegar, and make a plaster with it on his back.
Si ergo abscinditur sanguis cum eo, bonum est: et si non, fac adhaerere dorso uentosas, et mammillis, absque scarificatione.	 If the blood is cut off with it, it is good: and if not, let adhesive winds and breasts, without scarification.
Deinde accipe lanam, et submerge in succo tarathit, aut succo arnoglossae, aut succo ramorum alaulat, id est, aglanter, uino pontico, et fac adhaerere loeo.	 Then take wool and immerse it in the juice of thistle, or the juice of argus, or the juice of the leaves of alumroot, that is, agalantha, wine of Pontus, and let it stick to syrup.
Cum ergo quiescit apostema, tunc cura locum cum unguentis, donec sanetur.	 When the abscess has ceased, then care for the place with ointments until it heals.
Albarth uero rubeum est simile capitibus alhaasse, et est asperi aspectus.	 But Albath is red and resembles the head of an onion, and has a rough appearance.
Oportet ergo ut incidas quod apparet ex eo, secundum quod dixi in thelil aequaliter: et cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	 Therefore, it is necessary to cut what appears from it, according to what I said about thalil equally: and care for it until it heals.
¶ De perforatione Exiturae quae accidit in matrice.	 On perforation occurring in the womb (womb = uterus).
Caput LXXIIII.	 De Perforatione Matricis et Ovarii, cum haec operatio
Accidunt in matrice species multae apostematum, sicut cancer, et apostema lapideum, et ulcera, et adubelati, et alekilati, id est, herpes, aestiomemus, et fistulae, et hemorroides, et ragadiae, et thelil, et apostema calidum.	 On perforation of the womb (uterus) and ovary: There are many kinds of ulcers that can happen in the womb, such as cancer, stone-like abscesses, sores, abulleti, alekilati (herpes), fistulas, hemorrhoids, ragadiae, and apostema calidum.
Et ego quidem iam dixi omnes has aegritudines et species earum, et signa ipsarum, et earum curationes in diuisione: necesse est ut dicam in hoc tractatu apostema calidum quod accidit in matrice, quando est ex apostematibus quae colligunt saniem, et uis scire qualiter fit eius apertio cum ferro.	And I have indeed said all these diseases and their kinds, and the signs of each one, and their treatments, in division: it is necessary that I say in this treatise about the hot abscess that occurs in the matrix, when it is one of the abscesses that collect pus, and to know how its opening with iron is done.
Oportet ergo ut consideres.	 Therefore, you should consider. (This is a translation of a later part of the sentence.)
Tunc si dolor apostematis in incaeptione sua est acutus cum percussione sua, et flamma, et febre: et uides ipsum rubere: si cadit super ipsum sensus, tunc non properes cum perforatione eius: et cura ipsum cum eo eo quod iuuat super maturationem, donec quando quiescat acuitas accidentium.	 Then if the pain of the abscess in its beginning is sharp with striking, and burning, and fever; and you see it redden; if it falls upon the sense, then do not pierce it with perforation; and heal it with what helps for maturation, until when the acuteness of the occurrences subsides.
Tunc oportet ut facias sedere mulierem super sedem quae labeat duo sedilia, et reclinetur, uel appodietur super dorsum suum, et aggreget pedes suos ad partem inferiorem uentris: et sint coxae eius expansae, et ponat brachia sua sub genibus suis, et liget utraque ligamento conueniente ad illud.	 Then it is necessary that you make the woman sit on a chair with two arms, and recline, or lean against her back, and put her feet to the lower part of the belly; and her hips should be spread out, and she puts her arms under her knees, and binds both with a suitable ligament to that.
Deinde sedeat obstetrix a latere dextro, et administra instrumentum quo aperitur orificium matricis.	 Then the midwife should sit on the right side, and administer the instrument for opening the matrix's orifice.
Cuius forma uenit in eis quae sunt post.	 Its form comes to them who are after it (referring to women who have already given birth).
Et oportet quando uis administrare hoc instrumentum, ut figas cum Radio profundum matricis mulieris: ut non sit illud quod ingreditur ex instrumento plus, quam profundum matricis, et laedat infirmam.	 And it is necessary that when you are to administer this instrument, you fashion the point of the probe deep into the woman's matrix: so that what goes in from the instrument is not more than the depth of the matrix, and harms the weak.
Si autem fuerit instrumentum magis quam profundum, tunc oportet ut ponas puluillos super tecturam profundi matricis: ut prohibeatur introitus instrumenti totius in profundum matricis: et oportet ut ponat uertiginem, quae currit in instrumento, ex latere superiore: et ut teneat instrumentum, et ut reuoluat minister uertiginem, donec aperiatur profundum matricis.	 If it is an instrument more than the depth of the matrix, then it is necessary that you place feathers on top of the deep part of the matrix: to prevent the whole instrument from entering into the depth of the matrix; and it is necessary that you place a twisting thread, which runs in the instrument, on the upper side; and to hold the instrument, and to turn the twisting thread by an assistant, until the deep part of the matrix is opened.
Cum ergo apparet Exitura, et tangitur manu, et est lenis et mollis: tunc oportet ut seces ipsam apud caput suum cum spatumili lato.	 When therefore it appears to be cut out and is touched with the hand, and it is soft and tender, then it is necessary that you separate it from its head using a broad spatula.
Cum ergo euacuatur sanies, tunc oportet ut ponas in uulnus licinium submersum in oleo rosaceo: aut oleo uiridi, in quo sit quaedam stipticitas: et pone licinium, et extrahe sectionem in profundo matricis.	 When therefore pus is evacuated, then it is necessary that you place a linen cloth dipped in rose oil on the wound, or green oil with some styptic substance; and place the linen cloth, and remove the incision in depth of the matrix.
Et pone exterius super matricem, et super pectinem lanam mundam submersam in aqua, in qua bullitae sunt maluae.	 And put on the outside over the matrix and on top of the comb, a clean wool dipped in water in which figs have been boiled.
Deinde curetur post duos dies cum unguento quod conuenit ad illud, donec sanetur.	 Then it is to be treated with an ointment suitable for that purpose for two days until it heals.
Et quandoque abluitur matrix et uulnus, ita quod clisterizatur cum aqua et melle: deinde cum aqua in qua bullita est radix lilii, aut aristolochia longa: deinde redeat ad unguentum.	 And sometimes the matrix and wound are washed so that they are cleansed with water and honey; then with water in which the root of the garlic or long aristolochia has been boiled; then return to the ointment.
Quod si uulnus absconditum fuerit interius in matrice, tunc oportet ut prohibearis ex curatione eius cum ferro, imo cura ipsum cum eo quod diximus in diuisione.	 If the wound is hidden internally in the matrix, then it is necessary to prevent treatment with iron; instead cure it with what was said before for incisions.
¶ Doctrinae Obstetricum, qualiter medicentur embriones uiui, secundum figuram non naturalem egressi.	 Instructions on obstetrics: how to treat living fetuses which have been born abnormally in shape.
Caput Lxxu.	 Chapter LXXXV.
Necesse est Obstetrici, ut cognoscat in primis figuram partus naturalis.	 It is necessary for an obstetrician to first know the shape of a normal birth.
Ex signis ergo eius est, quod quando uides mulierem comprimi ad inferiora, et desiderat odorare aerem, et alleuiatur super eam quod super ipsam est de partu, et festinat exitus embrionis: tunc scias quod iste partus est secundum figuram naturalem, et est exitus eius super caput suum, et secundina cum eo: aut suspensa, uel pendens ex umbilico.	 Therefore the signs of this are that when you see a woman being pressed towards the lower parts, and she longs for air, and there is urging on her in childbirth, and the fetus eagerly desires to come out; then you will know that this birth is according to the natural shape, and it comes out at the head of its own and second one along with it: or suspended, or hanging from the navel.
Cum ergo uides haec signa, tunc oportet ut comprimatur uenter eius, ut descendat embrio uelociter.	 When you see these signs, then it is necessary to press the womb in order that the fetus comes out quickly.
Nam quando descendit super caput suum, descendit secundina cum eo, et mundatur ex illis superfluitatibus mundificatione bona.	 When it descends upon his head, the second one also descends with it, and it is to be cleaned from those superfluities with good cleansing.
Qui autem est praeter hunc partum, est innaturalis, illaudabilis.	 But that which is beyond this delivery, is unnatural, inadmissible.
Quoniam quandoque egreditur foetus super pedes suos, et egreditur corpus eius ante caput ipsius, et pedes eius, et manus eius una, aut pes eius unus: aut egreditur caput eius et manus eius: aut egreditur uentrinus: et fortasse conuertitur super collum suum, et similia ex figuris illaudabilibus.	 For sometimes the fetus emerges over its feet and the body of it comes out before its head and its feet and one hand, or one foot alone: or its head and one hand emerge: or the belly emerges, and perhaps it turns on its neck, and similar unadmissible figures.
Necesse est ergo Obstetrici, ut sit prudens, subtilis in istis rebus omnibus, et caueat sibi ab errore et decaeptione: et ego sum ostendens omnem figuram ex eis, et qualiter est ingenium in ea, et significetur per illud, et stetur super ipsum.	 Therefore it is necessary for the Midwife to be wise, skilful in all these matters, and to guard himself from error and deception; and I am showing every figure of them, and how the intelligence is in it, and it is indicated by that, and it will stand over him.
Quando egreditur foetus super caput suum egressione sua naturali, et uehemens fit illud super mulierem, et difficilis fit ei partus, et uides uirtutem eius iam debilitatam: tunc fac eam sedere super sedem, aut mulieres teneant eam: et uapora uuluam eius cum foenugraeco decocto, et cum oleis humidis.	 When the fetus emerges over its head in a natural delivery and becomes strong against the woman, and the delivery becomes difficult to her, and you see her virtue already weakened; then make her sit on a seat or women hold her: and warm her vagina with fennugreek water boiled and with moist oils.
Deinde intromittat Obstetrix inter digitos suos Spatumile paruum, et findat cum eo secundinam, et secet eam ungue suo, donec currat quod est in ea ex humiditate: et preme uentrem mulieris, donec descendat foetus.	 Then the midwife introduces a small spatula between her fingers, and she splits the second one with it, and cuts it with her nail until what is in it from moisture runs out; and presses the woman's belly until the fetus descends.
Si autem non descendit, tunc oportet ut clisterizetur mulier ex mucillagine foenugraeci, cum oleo sisamino.	 If it does not descend, then it is necessary to enema the woman with fennugreek mucilage, with sesame oil.
Deinde praecipe ei post clistere, ut comprimatur: et fac eam sternutare cum condisi, et tene os eius et nasum ipsius hora una.	 Then command her after the enema to be pressed: and make her sneeze with pepper and hold her nose and mouth for an hour.
Foetus enim egredietur statim.	 For the fetus will come out immediately.
Quod si egrediantur duae manus foetus in primis, iunc oportet ut reducas eas cum facilitate paulatim.	 If two hands of the fetus emerge first, it is necessary to pull them back gently and gradually.
Si autem non obedit in introitu, tunc pone mulierem super sedem, et eleua pedes eius sursum: deinde concute sedem super terram: et mulier teneatur, ut non cadat apud concussionem.	 If it does not yield upon entrance (of the fetus), then place the woman on a seat, and lift her feet upward; then strike the seat on the ground; and hold the woman, so that she does not fall during the striking.
Si ergo non egrediuntur manus, et moritur foetus: tunc incide eas, et extrahe residuum foetus: et liga manum eius cum panno, et extrahe ipsum cum aequalitate: nam ipse egredietur.	 If the hands do not emerge and the fetus dies, then cut them off and extract the remaining fetus; tie his hand with cloth and extract him equally; for he will come out himself.
¶ Exitus embrionis super pedes suo.	 The exit of the embryo is over the feet.
Quando egreditur foetus super pedes suos, tunc oportet ut impellat eos sursum: deinde conuertat foetum paulatim: postea aequet ipsum.	 When the fetus emerges over his feet, then it is necessary to push them upward; then turn the fetus gradually; afterwards equalize him.
Deinde accipiat unum pedum eius, et extendat eum paulatim.	 Then take one of his feet and stretch it out gradually.
Cum ergo egrediuntur usque ad coxas, tunc praecipe ei, ut comprimatur, et fac eam sternutare cum condisi: egredietur enim, si Deus uoluerit.	 When they come out up to the hips, then order him (the fetus) to be pressed and make her sneeze with the help of incense; for he will come out if God wishes it.
Et si non egreditur cum eo quod narrauimus, tunc reduc foetum paulatim, donec ponas eum secundum figuram naturalem.	 And if he does not come out as we have said, then pull the fetus back gradually until you place him in the natural position.
Nam ipse egredietur tunc egressu facili.	 For he will then come out with an easy birth.
Quod si prohibeatur cum eo toto quod narrauimus: tunc accipe ex mucillagine alteae, et oleo sisamino, et gummi soluto: et percute totum in mortario percussione bona: deinde line cum eo uuluam mulieris, et inferius uentris eius.	 If it is forbidden as we have said (to extract the fetus): then take some latex of aloe, and sesame oil, and dissolved gum; and grind all of them well with a good pestle; then apply linseed with it to the woman's womb, and below her intestines.
Deinde fac eam sedere in aqua tepida, donec consequatur hypocundria.	 Then make her sit in warm water until she is about to give birth.
Cum ergo uides quod iam calefacta sunt inferiora eius, tunc fac ei sief de myrrha: et suppone ipsum.	 When you see that her lower parts are now warm, then give her (to sniff) some myrrh and place it under her nose.
Quando ergo tenet sief hora una, tunc fac eam sedere super sedem.	 When the hour has passed, then make her sit on a seat.
Deinde fac eam sternutare: et stringe ipsius os et nasum: et preme inferiorem partem uentris compressione facili.	 Then make it sneeze: and tie its own mouth and nose: and press the lower part of the abdomen with easy compression.
Nam foeus egredietur statim.	 The feces will exit immediately.
¶ Exitus foetus super genua et manus.	 Exit of the fetus above the knees and hands.
Quando egreditur secundum hanc formam, tunc ingeniet in intromittendo manus suas paulatim.	 When it exits in this manner, then insert your hand gradually.
Deinde resupinetur mulier super collum suum, et pendeant pedes eius ad inferiora: et ipsa sit iacens super lectum, et complicet manus suas.	 Then the woman will lie down on her neck, and let her feet hang towards the bottom: and she herself should be lying on the bed, and clasp her hands together.
Deinde preme supra uentrem eius paulatim.	 Then press above its abdomen gradually.
Deinde extrahe quod est sub pedibus eius ex puluinaribus, donec sit praeparata in inferiori parte.	 Then extract what is under her feet from the anus, until it is prepared below.
Quod si non egreditur foetus, tunc accipe pedes eius, et moue eos motu uehementi.	 If the fetus does not come out, then take its feet and move them with strong movement.
Deinde preme quod est supra hypocundria paulatim, donec ascendat foetus ad superiora.	 Then press what is above the pubis gradually, until the fetus ascends to the upper parts.
Deinde intromittat manus suas, et aequet foetum paulatim: et praecipe mulieri, ut comprimatur, donec egrediatur foetus.	 Then insert your hand and press the fetus gradually: and tell the woman to compress herself until the fetus comes out.
¶ Exitus foetus latitudinaliter pendens ex manibus.	 The exit of the fetus hanging laterally from the hands.
Ingenietur in reductione manus eius.	 Insert your hand for the reduction of its hand.
Si autem non potest reducere eam, tunc eleua mulierem, et fac eam ambulare.	 If it cannot be reduced [the fetus], then lift the woman and make her walk.
Si uero ambulare non potest, tunc fac eam iacere super lectum: et concute crura eius concussione uehementi.	 If she cannot walk, then make her lie on the bed: and strike its legs with strong shock.
Deinde administra linimentum quod praeparasti ex mucillaginibus.	 Then administer the ointment which you have prepared from mucilages.
Quod si accipit eam partus, tunc fac eam sedere super sedem.	 If she takes it as childbirth, then make her sit on a seat.
Deinde stude in reductione manus, et aequa foetum secundum figuram naturalem: et fac sternutare mulierem, et praecipe ei, ut comprimat se, donec egrediatur.	 Then strive for the reduction of its hand, and press the fetus according to its natural shape: and make the woman sneeze, and tell her to compress herself until it comes out.
¶ Exitus foetus super collum suum, expansis manibus, et est facies eius ad dorsum matris suae.	 The exit of the fetus on its neck, with its hands spread apart, and its face towards the back of its mother.
Oportet ut teneat Obstetrix manum foetus, deinde reuoluat eum paulatim, et aequet eum cum facilitate.	 The obstetrician should hold the fetus and then gradually turn it with ease.
Cum ergo aequatur, tunc pone super uuluam eius quod narrauimus ex oleo et mucillaginibus.	 When it is turned equally, then place oil and mucilage upon the area mentioned earlier.
Deinde praecipe ei, ut moueatur paulatim.	 Then command him to move slowly.
Cum ergo feceris illud, tunc fac eam sedere super sedem, et praecipe ei ut inclinetur ad latus dextrum.	 When you have done that, then make her sit on a chair and command her to lean towards the right side.
Deinde praecipe ei, ut comprimatur: et fac eam sternutare cum condisi.	 Then command him to compress (it) and make her sneeze with powder.
¶ Exitus foetus praeparati super latus.	 The preparation of the fetus is for the side.
Quando descendit ad orificium matricis secundum hunc modum cum secundina, tunc scinde secundinam cum ungue tuo, donec euacuetur ex humiditate.	 When the second stage (of labor) descends to the mother's opening in this manner with the childbirth pouch, then cut open the childbirth pouch with your nail until it is evacuated by moisture.
Si ergo suspenditur super faciem foetus, et collum eius, tunc incide eam ex umbilico: ut non retineatur, et moriatur.	 If the fetus and its neck are hanging over the face, then cut it from the navel so that it is not retained and will die.
Deinde impelle foetum ad interiora, donec ponas eam secundum quod oportet: et praecipe mulieri, ut comprimat se aliquotiens: ipse enim egredietur exitu leui.	 Then push the fetus towards the inside until you place it as needed; and command the woman to compress herself several times; for it will come out easily through the birth passage.
¶ Exitus Geminorum, aut foetuum multorum.	 The delivery of twins or multiple fetuses.
Scias, quod Gemini multotiens nascuntur: et quandoque nascuntur tres, et quatuor.	 Know that twins often give birth and sometimes triplets and even quadruplets.
Verumtamen illud extraneum est, et raro contingit.	 However, such a thing is foreign and rarely occurs.
Quinque uero est res extra naturam, et non uiuunt penitus: et continet eos, quamuis multiplicentur, secundina una: et separantur per sifach, distinguens inter eos ligatum in umbilico cuiusque eorum.	 Five are indeed outside nature and do not live long; they are contained by the afterbirth though they multiply, for the afterbirth envelops them all at their navel; and they are separated by a siphac, distinguishing between them that is tied to each one's umbilicus.
Et quandoque egrediuntur sicut egreditur foetus unus exitu naturali, facili: et egrediuntur exitu illaudabili, sicut narrauimus.	 And sometimes they come out just like a single fetus through the natural easy birth passage, and they come out in an unnatural way as we have described earlier.
Quod si difficiles fuerint quidam eorum apud partum, et perueniunt ad illud quod diximus ex figuris innaturalibus, tunc cura eos sicut narrauimus: et sit ob stetrix subtilis, et faciat quod facit cum facilitate et tarditate, et ingenietur secundum omnem figuram cum eo quod praeparatur ei ex ingenio ducente ad salutem.	 If some of them have difficulties during childbirth and reach what we have described in the unnatural figures, then care for them as we have described; and let the midwife be skilled, and do what she does with ease and slowness, and adapt herself to every figure with the one that is prepared for her by her skill leading towards salvation.
¶ Rememoratio eius quod formatur in matrice ex embrionibus, et abortiuntur.	 Recollection of that which forms in the womb from embryos and are aborted.
Quandoque formatur in matrice unus, et duo, et tres, et quatuor, et quinque, et sex, et septem, et plures decem: et iam uerificatum est apud me, quod mulier abortiendo emisit septem, et alia quindecim, omnes formatos.	 Sometimes one, two, three, four, five, six, seven and more than ten forms in the womb: and it has been verified by me that a woman has expelled seven, another fifteen, all formed.
Quod factum est mensuratione gloriosi sapientis.	 That which was done by measurement of the wise man.
Hoc ergo totum oportet ut sit in scientia Obstetricis.	 Therefore, this entire matter must be in the knowledge of the obstetrician.
Fortasse enim perueniet ad eam simile illius: opponat ergo ei cum illo quod oportet	 Perhaps it may come to a similar one of his: therefore, let him oppose it with what is necessary.
¶ De extractione foetus mortui.	 On the extraction of the dead fetus.
Caput LXXVI.	 Chapter LXXVI.
Quando curas foetum mortuum cum eo quod dixi in diuisione ex medicatione, et non egreditur, et cogeris uti operatione cum manu, tunc oportet ut consideres.	 When you take care of a dead fetus along with what I said in the division of medicine and it does not come out, and you will have to operate with your hand, then you must consider.
Si ergo mulier est sanae uirtutis, et non est cum aliquo ex accidentibus, ex quibus timetur super eam perditio: tunc oportet ut resupinetur mulier super lectum, super dorsum suum, et sit caput eius inclinatum inferius, et crura eius eleuata: et ministra teneat eam a duabus partibus, aut ligetur ad lectum, ut non extrahatur corpus eius apud extractionem foetus.	 If the woman is healthy and not with any accident from which it is feared that death may occur to her: then she must lie down on a bed on her back, and her head should be inclined downwards, and her legs raised: and a servant should hold her from both sides, or tie her to the bed, so that her body does not move during the extraction of the fetus.
Deinde humecta os matricis ex oleis humidis cum mucillagine alteae, et foenugraeci, et seminis lini.	 Then the mouth of the womb should be moistened with olive oil mixed with gum arabic and fenugreek seeds and flax seed.
Deinde inungat Obstetrix manum suam cum istis oleis et mucillaginibus: deinde intromittat eam in matricem cum facilitate.	 Then the obstetrician will wet his hand with these oils and gums: then he should insert it easily into the womb.
Deinde quaerat cum ea locum in quo figat uncinos ex foetu, et loca conuenientia ad illud.	 Then he should ask where to place hooks on the fetus and where they are suitable for that.
Considera ergo tunc, si foetus est praeparatus ut descendat super caput suum: tunc fige uncinos in oculos eius, aut in collo eius, aut in ore eius, aut in palato ipsius, aut sub barba eius, aut in furcula ipsius, aut in locis propinquis costis, et sub hypocundriis.	 Therefore consider then if the fetus is prepared to descend onto its head: then fix hooks in its eyes, or its neck, or its mouth, or its palate, or under its beard, or in its armpits, or near its ribs and under its hips.
Si autem descensus est super pedes eius, tunc in pectine, et costis eius mediis.	 If it is a descent below his feet, then incise on his chest, and in the middle of his ribs.
Et oportet, ut teneat uncinum cum manu dextra: et ponat curuitatem eius in eo quod est inter digitos sinistrae manus: et intromittat cum manu cum facilitate, et figat uncinum in aliquo illorum locorum quae diximus, donec perueniat ad rem uacuam.	 And it is necessary that he hold the hook with his right hand: and place his wound in that which is between the fingers of his left hand: and insert with his hand easily, and fix the hook in one of those places that we have said, until he reaches empty space.
Deinde figat in oppositione eius uncinum alium, aut tertium, si indiges: ut sit contractio aequalis, et non declinet ad partem.	 Then fix another hook or third one, if necessary: so that the contraction is equal, and it does not lean to one side.
Deinde extendatur extensione aequali, et non sit extensio secundum rectitudinem tantum, imo moueatur ad omnem partem, ut alleuietur exitus eius: sicut fit cum dente apud eradicationem eius.	 Then stretch with an equal extension, and let the extension not be only in a straight line, but move it to all sides, so that the outlet is relieved: as when using a tooth for its extraction.
Et oportet in eo quod est inter illud, ut mollificetur extensio.	 It is necessary that between them there is softening of the extension.
Quod si retineatur ex eo pars, tunc oportet ut inungat Obstetrix quosdam digitos cum oleo, et intromittat eos ex parte, ut reuoluat cum eis quod retinetur.	 If a part is held back from it, then it is necessary that the midwife puts some fingers with oil and insert them on the side to turn what is held back along with them.
Si ergo egreditur pars foetus, tunc permutentur uncini ad locum alium qui sit altior: fac hoc donec egrediatur foetus totus.	 If then a part of the fetus is coming out, then the hooks are changed to another higher place: do this until the whole fetus comes out.
Si ergo egreditur manus ante alia, et non est possibile reducere eam, propter coartationem eius: tunc oportet, ut inuoluatur super eam pannus.	 If then a hand is coming out before the others, and it cannot be returned because of its bending: then a cloth should be wound around it.
Deinde extrahe eam donec quando egreditur tota, incide eam aut in iunctura plantae, aut in cubito: et ita oportet ut facias in manu altera, et in duobus pedibus.	 Then pull it out completely until when the whole one comes out, cut it at the junction of the foot or the elbow: and so you must do with the other hand, and in both feet.
Si autem caput foetus est magnum, aut accidit ei coartatio in exitu, aut est in capite eius aqua aggregata: tunc oportet ut intromittat inter digitos Spatumile spinosum, et findat cum eo caput, et extrahat aquam: aut disrumpat ipsum cum instrumento quod nominatur Almisdac: cuius forma uenit cum formis reliquorum instrumentorum in capitulo quod est post hoc.	 If the fetal head is large, or there is bending at its exit, or water has accumulated in its head: then it is necessary to insert a pointed spatula between the fingers and break the head with it, and pull out the water: or tear it apart with the instrument called Almisdac; whose shape comes after the shapes of the other instruments in the chapter following this.
Similiter faciat si foetus est magni capitis natura, tunc oportet ut seces algengematu: aut extrahas ipsum cum misdach, sicut diximus.	 Similarly, make an incision if the fetus is of large head nature, then it is necessary to separate the amniotic membrane: or pull him out with forceps, as we said.
Deinde attrahas ossa cum forcipibus.	 Then draw the bones with forceps.
Quod si egrediatur caput, et coartetur apud furculam: tunc findatur, donec effundatur humiditas quae est in pectore.	 If the head comes out and becomes stuck at the neck, then it is split open until the moisture that is in the chest is released.
Si autem non complicatur, neque obedit ad exitum: tunc incide caput frustatim, secundum quod possibile est tibi.	 If [the fetus] does not become entangled, nor yields to delivery: then make a shallow cut in the head as much as is possible for you.
Quod si inferius uentris est apostematum, aut est in eo hydropisis: tunc oportet ut perfores ipsum, donec currat humiditas ex eo.	 If there is a protrusion lower in the abdomen or it has hydropsis: then it must be pierced until the moisture runs out of it.
Si uero foetus est super pedes suos, tunc attractio eius est facilis, et directio eius ad os matricis est leuis.	 If [the fetus] is above its feet, then pulling it out will be easy and directing it towards the maternal bone will be simple.
Si autem coartatur apud uentrem, aut pectus: tunc oportet ut extrahas ipsum cum panno quem inuoluisti super manum tuam: et findat uentrem, aut pectus, donec currat quod est in eis.	 If it becomes stuck in the abdomen or chest: then it must be pulled out with a cloth you have wrapped around your hand, and the abdomen or chest should be opened until whatever is inside runs out.
Si autem auferuntur reliqua membra, et redit caput: tunc intromittat Obstetrix manum sinistram.	 If the remaining limbs are taken away and the head returns: then the midwife shall insert her left hand.
Si ergo os matricis est apertum, tunc intromittat manum in profundum matricis, et quaerat cum ea caput, et attrahat ipsum cum digitis usque ad os matricis: deinde intromittat in eo uncinum unum, aut uncinos duos, et attrahat ipsum cum eo.	 If the maternal bone is open, then insert your hand deep into the womb and feel for the head with it and pull it out with your fingers up to the maternal bone: then insert a hook or hooks and pull it out with them.
Quod si os matricis coartatur, propter apostema calidum quod accidit ei: tunc non oportet ut laboretur super ipsum, imo oportet tunc administrare effusionem rerum humidarum, pinguium: et administra emplastra: et sedeat in aquis quae mollificant et humectant.	 If the maternal bone is stuck because of a hot abscess that has happened to it: then one should not exert pressure on it, rather one must administer a flow of liquid medicine and ointment, and sit in baths that soften and moisten.
Quod si foetus est super latus suum, tunc possibile est ut aequetur: tunc administretur quod diximus in foetu uiuo.	 If [the fetus] is on its side, it can be leveled out: then administer what was said for a living fetus.
Quod si non est possibile illud, tunc incidatur frustatim, et extrahatur.	 If it is not possible to do that, then it should be cut piecemeal and extracted.
Et oportet ut non dimittas aliquid ex secundina intus omnino.	 And it is necessary that you do not leave anything inside the second part at all.
Cum ergo compleueris operationem tuam, tunc administra quod diximus in apostematibus calidis quae accidunt in matricibus.	 When you have completed your operation, then administer what we said regarding the treatment of hot tumors that occur in the womb.
Quod si accidat fluxus sanguinis, tunc descendat in aquis stipticis, et administra reliquam curationem.	 If there is bleeding, it should descend into warm waters of stiptics, and administer the remaining treatment.
Et ego quidem iam uidi mulierem, in cuius uentre mortuus erat foetus: deinde impregnata est super ipsum uice alia, postea mortuus est foetus alius etiam.	 I myself have seen a woman, whose womb contained a dead fetus; then she became pregnant again over the same one, after which another dead fetus also occurred.
Accidit ergo ei post tempus longum apostema in umbilico suo, et inflatum est, donec apertum est: et coepit emittere pus.	 Therefore, after a long time an abscess occurred on her navel, which swelled until it was opened, and began to discharge pus.
Vocatus sum ergo ad curationem eius, et medicatus sum ei tempore longo: et non consolidatum est uulnus.	 I was therefore called for the treatment of this woman, and I treated her for a long time; but the wound did not heal.
Posui ergo super ipsum ex quibusdam emplastris fortis attractionis: et exiuit ex loco os.	 I therefore placed on it some strong adhesives; and the bone came out from its place.
Deinde praeterierunt ei dies aliquot, et exiuit os aliud.	 Then a few days passed, and another bone came out.
Miratus sum ergo inde, cum in uentre non sit os.	 I was therefore amazed that there was no bone in her womb.
Cogitaui ergo, quia erant ex ossibus foetus mortui.	 Therefore, since the fetuses were from bones.
Inquisiui ergo uulnus, et extraxi ossa multa, muliere existente in melioribus dispositionibus suis: et iam uixit taliter tempore longo, et mittit ex loco pus parum.	 I therefore cut the wound and extracted many bones when the woman was in good health; and she lived in such a way for a long time, and emitted little pus from its place.
Et ego non firmaui hic hoc extraneum, nisi quoniam in eo est scientia, et adiutorium ad illud, quod administrat medicus artifex cum manu ex curatione.	 I did not strengthen this foreign substance here, unless because there is knowledge and aid for it from the physician-artist when treating.
¶ De formis Instrumentorum necessariorum in extractione foetus.	 Chapter on the forms of necessary instruments for extracting a fetus.
Caput LXXVII.	 Chapter LXXVII.
Hic inferius est forma Strictorii, quo aequantur libri, cui aequaliter sunt duae uertigines in duabus extremitatibus duorum lignorum.	 Here below is the form of a Pincer, to which books are equal, having two equal spirals at the ends of two pieces of wood.
Verumtamen haec Vertigo oportet ut sit subtilior strictorio: et ut fiat, aut ex ebano, aut ex ligno bussi.	 Moreover, this Spiral should be finer than the Pincer: and it is made so, either from Ebony or from Boxwood.
Et sit latitudo omnis ligni quasi duo digiti: et margo cuiusque amborum est quasi digitus unus, et longitudo cuiusque eorum est palmus et medietas: et in medio duorum lignorum sunt duo additamenta ex genere eiusdem ligni, quae iam firmata sunt in utrisque, quorum longitudo est medietas palmi et plus parum: et latitudo utriusque est quasi duo digiti, aut plus parum.	 And the width of all the wood is like two fingers: and the edge of each one is like a single finger, and the length of each is a palm (and half): and in the middle of the two pieces of wood are two additions of the same kind of wood, which have already been strengthened in both, whose length is half a palm and less: and the width of each is like two fingers or less.
Et ista duo additamenta intromittuntur in os matricis, ut aperiatur cum eis quando tu reuoluis duas Vertigines.	 And these two additions are inserted into the mouth of the matrix (to open it when you rotate the two Spirals).
Forma Vertiginis qua aperitur matrix.	 The form of the Spiral which opens the matrix.
Forma alia ad simile illius, subtilior, et leuior.	 Another form similar to this, finer and lighter.
Fiat ex ligno ebani, aut bussi, secundum similitudinem forcipum.	 Make it from Ebony or Boxwood, according to the likeness of the Pincers.
Verumtamen in extremitate eius sint duo additamenta, sicut uides hic supra: et longitudo omnis additamenti ex eis est quasi palmus: et latitudo utriusque est, duo digiti.	 Nevertheless, at the end of it there should be two additions as you see here above: and the length of each addition is a palm: and the width of each is like two fingers.
Cum ergo uis aperire matricem cum eo, tunc fac sedere mulierem super lectum, pendentibus pedibus eius, aperto quod est inter crura eius.	 When you want to open the matrix with it, then have a woman sit on the bed, with her feet hanging down, with that which is between her thighs opened.
Deinde intromitte ista duo additamenta coniuncta in matricem: et tu es tenens extremitatem instrumenti inferius inter coxas eius.	 Then insert these two additions connected together into the matrix: and you hold the lower end of the instrument between her hips.
Deinde aperi manum tuam cum instrumento, sicut facis cum forficibus, aequaliter secundum quantitatem quam uis ex apertione oris matricis, donec faciat Obstetrix quod uult.	 Then open your hand with the instrument, as you do with the Pincers, equally according to the amount you want by opening the mouth of the matrix, until the Midwife does what she wants.
Forma Vertiginis alterius quam dixerunt antiqui Forma Impellentis quo impellitur foetus.	 Form of Dizziness Other Than That Which the Ancients Called Form of the Pushed Fetus.
Forma Almisdac, qua conteritur caput magnum: et assimilatur forcipi, cui sunt dentes in extremitate, sicut uides.	 The Form that breaks the large head: it resembles a pair of forceps, having teeth at its end, as you see.
Et quandoque fit oblungum, sicut forcipes secundum hanc formam, sicut uides, cui sunt dentes sicut dentes serrae, quo inciditur et conteritur.	 And sometimes it becomes sloping, like forceps according to this form, as you see, having teeth like those of a saw, with which it cuts and crushes.
Forma Almisdac quo conteritur caput paruum.	 The Form that breaks the small head.
Forma Vncini habentis spinam unam.	 The Form having one spike.
Forma Vncini habentis spinas duas.	 The Form having two spikes.
Forma forcipis cui sunt dentes serrae, cum quo conteritur caput foetus.	 The form of forceps with saw-like teeth, with which the fetal head is crushed.
Forma Spatumilis habentis duas extremitates ad abscindendum caput.	 The form of Spatulum (spoon-like instrument) having two ends for separating the head.
Forma duorum Spatumilium etiam latorum.	 The form of two wide spatulas (spoon-like instruments).
Ista instrumenta omnia exercentur, et quanto plus multiplicantur species eorum, et praeparata sunt apud artificem, est uelocior ad operationem suam, et altior apud homines, propter quantitatem suam.	 These instruments are exercised, and the more numerous their kinds, and the more prepared they are by the craftsman, the quicker they are for the operation, and higher in the eyes of men, due to their quantity.
Non ergo despicies ex eis instrumentum, quin sit apud te praeparatum.	 Therefore, do not despise any instrument from among them, but prepare it for yourself.
Inexcusabilis est enim necessitas eorum.	 Indeed, the necessity of them is unavoidable.
¶ De extractione Secundinae.	 Chapter on the second extraction (cesarean section).
Caput LXXVIII.	 Chapter 78.
Quando retinetur Secundina apud partum, tunc oportet ut praecipias infirmae, ut retineat anhelitum suum.	 When the second (fetus) is retained during childbirth, then you must command the weak, to retain their breath.
Deinde fac eam sternutare cum condisi: et stringe manum tuam super os eius, et nares ipsius.	 Then make her sneeze with a pinch and press your hand on her mouth and her own nose.
Si ergo egreditur per hoc, bonum est.	 If it then exits through this (incision), that is good.
Si non: tunc accipe ollam, et perfora in coopertorio foramen: et pone in ea herbas aperientes os matricis, sicut calamentum, rutam, et anetum, et camomillam, et sseham, et cassiam ligneam, et centauream: accipe omnes istas herbas, aut quasdam earum, et submerge eas cum aqua, et pone eas super ignem.	 If not: then take a pot and pierce a hole in the covering (of the incision), and put in them (herbs) opening the womb, such as camomile, root of rutabaga, fennel, chamomile, cassia wood, centaury. Take all these herbs or some of them, submerge them in water, and place them on fire.
Deinde pone embulam arundinis super foramen coopertorii ollae, et extremitatem aliam in os matricis: et teneat eam donec perueniat uapor ad concauitatem matricis.	 Then place an embolus of reed upon the opening of the copotorium pot's hole, and another end into the bone of the matrix; hold it until the vapor reaches the concavity of the matrix.
Deinde fac eam sternutare, sicut diximus.	 Then make it sneeze, as we said.
Secundina enim egredietur cum facilitate.	 For secundina will come out easily.
Si autem remaneat post hanc curationem, et non egrediatur: tunc praecipe Obstetrici, ut submergat manum suam in oleo sisamino, aut mucillagine alteae.	 If it remains after this treatment and does not come out: then command the midwife to immerse her hand in sesame oil or marshmallow (althea mucilage).
Deinde intromittat in uuluam, et quaerat cum ea Secundinam.	 Then insert into the vagina and search for the Secundina with it.
Cum ergo inuenerit eam, tunc accipiat eam, et extendat ipsam paulatim.	 When you find it (Secundina), then receive it and gradually stretch it out.
Si autem fuerit annexa in profundo matricis, tunc intromittat manum, secundum quod narrauimus, donec quando inuenerit Secundinam, et extrahat eam paulatim secundum rectitudinem, ut non cadat matrix apud attractionem uehementem: imo oportet, ut permutetur cum facilitate ad latera dextra et sinistra: deinde addatur in quantitatem attractionis.	 If it (Secundina) is attached deep within the matrix, then insert your hand as we said, until you find Secundina and pull it out gradually in a straight direction so that the matrix does not fall down due to strong attraction; indeed, it must be gently moved sideways right and left: then more should be added to counteract the attraction.
Ipsa enim obedit tunc, et seruatur, et euadit ab adhaerentia.	 It (Secundina) will then obey, and it is saved, and it goes out from the adhesion.
Quod si os matricis est coartatum, sicut nos iam narrauimus: cura eam cum sternutatione, et ex medicatione ollae cum herbis.	 If the bone of the matrix is contracted as we have already said: treat it with sneezing and from the treatment of the pot with herbs.
Si autem non egreditur cum omnibus quae narrauimus, tunc caue ne fatigeris super eam in iteratione extractionis.	 If it (Secundina) does not come out with everything we said: then beware not to tire yourself by repeatedly trying the extraction.
Verum oportet, ut quod egreditur ad os matricis ex ea, liges ad coxam mulieris.	 But it must be bound to the woman's hip as it comes out from the bone of the matrix.
Deinde clisteriza eam cum unguento tetrapharmacon.	 Then cleanse her with the ointment called tetrapharmacon.
Ipsum enim putrefaciet eam post dies, et dissoluetur, et egredietur.	 For it (Secundina) will rot her after days and dissolve and go out.
Verumtamen quando putrefit, eleuatur ex ea odor malus ad stomachum et caput, et laedit illud infirmam.	 But when it rots, the foul smell rises to the stomach and head and harms the weak.
Oportet ergo ut administrentur suffumigationes conuenientes ad illud.	 Therefore, it is necessary to administer suitable fumigations for that purpose.
Quidam autem antiquorum iam experti sunt suffumigationem nasturtii, et ficuum siccarum.	 Some of the ancients have already found out that fumigation with nasturtium and dried figs is effective.
Forma instrumenti quo suffumigatur mulier apud retentionem Secundinae et menstruorum.	 The shape of the instrument used to fumigate a woman during retention of second stage labor and menstruation.
Fiat ex uitro simile alcama, aut ex zere: et ponatur extremitas ampla super ignem: et suffumigatio sit posita super prunas: teneat eam, donec consumatur illa suffumigatio: et itera aliam.	 Make it similar to an alcamea or a ceramic vessel, and let the broad end be over the fire; fumigation should be placed on plums (or prunes); hold it until the fumigation is consumed, then repeat with another one.
¶ De curatione Ani non perforati.	 Chapter on the treatment of an unperforated anus.
Caput LXXIX.	 Chapter LXXIX.
Nascuntur multi puerorum, et Ani eorum sunt non perforati, quos iam opilauit sifac subtile.	 Many boys are born, and the ani of theirs are not perforated, which the sifac subtle already has circumcised.
Oportet ergo, ut obstetrix perforet illud sifac digito suo: et si non, perforet ipsum cum Spatumili acuto: et caueat lacertum, ne tangat eum.	 Therefore, the midwife should perforate it (the circumcised boy) with her finger: and if not, she should perforate him with a sharp spatulum: and be careful not to touch the foreskin.
Deinde pone super ipsum lanam infusam in uino et oleo.	 Then place over it (the circumcised boy) a linen cloth soaked in wine and oil.
Deinde cura ipsum cum ungentis, donec sanetur.	 Then take care of him with ointments until he is healed.
Si autem times quod opiletur, tunc pone in foramine cannulam de plumbo diebus multis, et auferatur quando puer uult egerere.	 If you are afraid that it may become infected, then put a leaden cannula into the opening and remove it when the boy wants to urinate.
Et iam accidit opilatio Ani etiam ex consolidatione uulneris, aut apostematis.	 And now it happens that circumcision of the anus also occurs from the hardening of the wound or abscess.
Oportet ergo ut secetur illa consolidatio, deinde curetur cum eo quod diximus ex curatione et plumbo.	 Therefore, it must be cut away (the hardened tissue), then treated with what I said before using lead.
¶ De curatione Fistularum quae accidunt in inferiori parte.	 Chapter on the treatment of fistulas that occur in the lower part.
Caput LXXX.	 Chapter 80.
Fistulae quae accidunt in inferiori, sunt Nodatio, et Grossitudo quae accidunt prope anum deforis: aut in spacio unius partium: et est Fistula una, aut plures.	 Fistulas that occur in the lower parts are Nodatio and Grossitudo that happen near the anus outside: or in the space of one part: and it is a Fistula one, or more than one.
Cum ergo antiquatur illa Nodatio, aperitur, et currit ex ea humiditas aquosa alba, aut pus subtile.	 Since the old Nodatio (abscess) opens up, watery white fluid or subtle pus flows out from it.
Et quandoque sunt ex istis Fistulis penetrantes.	 And sometimes these fistulas penetrate through.
Ergo penetrantes cognoscuntur per illud quod egreditur ex egestione, et uentositate, quando utitur infirmus egestione: et fortasse egreditur ex eis uermis.	 Therefore, when the fistula is penetrating, it is recognized by what comes out during the discharge and windiness, when a person uses laxative; perhaps a worm might come out from them.
Et sunt ex eis Fistulae quando sunt in spacio penetrantes usque ad uesicam, et usque ad meatum uirgae.	 And there are fistulas when they are in the space that penetrates up to the bladder and up to the scrotum of the penis.
Et sunt ex eis penetrantes usque ad iuncturam coxae, et usque ad nodum caudae.	 And there are fistulas that penetrate up to the junction of the hip, and up to the sacrum.
Ex eo autem quo cognoscitur Fistula penetrans usque ad anum, etiam a non penetrante, est, ut intromittas digitum tuum indicem in anum: et intromittas tentam subtilem in Fistulam ex aere, aut ferro: quando non est tortuositas.	 From this it is known that the penetrating fistula up to the anus can also be recognized by inserting your index finger into the anus; and inserting a probe (slender instrument) into the fistula from outside (air or iron), when there is no twisting (tortuosity).
Quod si in ea est tortuositas, tunc intromitte in eam tentam ex plumbo subtilem, aut pilum ex pilis equarum, donec sentias tentam, aut pilum in digito tuo.	 If there is twisting (tortuosity) in it, then insert a slender probe made of lead or horsehair into it until you feel the probe or hair on your finger.
Quod si non sentis ipsam penitus, neque procedit ex foramine aliquid ex egestione, neque uentositas, neque uermis sicut dixi: tunc scias, quia est non penetrans: propera ergo ad curationem.	 If you do not feel it deeply and nothing comes out of the discharge from the opening, or there is no windiness, or worms as I mentioned; then you will know that it is not penetrating, so proceed to treatment.
Et quando Fistula est penetrans usque ad uesicam, aut ad meatum urinae: tunc significatio eius est exitus urinae ex ea, et prohibitio eius ab hoc ut consolidetur locus cum medicinis.	 And when the fistula penetrates to the bladder or to the urine scrotum, its sign is the outflow of urine from it; and the prevention of this is that the location should be sealed with medicines.
Si uero est penetrans usque ad iuncturam coxae, aut ad os coxae: tunc signum eius est, quod perueniat tenta usque illuc, si non est in ea tortuositas usque ad os: et inuentio doloris in circumitu partis, et quod egreditur pus ex ea semper: et quod non ualeat in ea medicatio, neque consolidatur cum unguento.	 If it penetrates to the junction of the hip or to the pelvis bone, then its sign is that a probe reaches there if there is no twisting up to the bone; and pain at the site, and pus always flows from it, and medication does not help in it, nor is it consolidated with ointment.
Et in istis Fistulis omnibus penetrantibus non est curatio omnino: et curatio earum est labor et uanitas ei, ex stultis medicis, super quem formatur.	 In these fistulas that penetrates, there is no cure at all; and the cure of them is pain and futility for him, upon whom it is formed by foolish physicians.
In illa autem quae non est penetrans, et non antiqua, speratur sanatio cum serro: secundum quod ego narro tibi, et ego iam probaui: et est, ut iaceat infirmus inter manus tuas super dorsum suum: et eleua crura eius usque supra coxas ipsius, et coxae eius sint inclinatae ad uentrem ipsius.	 But the one that does not penetrate, and is not old, hopes for healing with a lancet: according to what I tell you, and I have already proven; and it is that he lies sick among your hands upon his back; and you raise his legs up to his hips, and his hips are inclined toward the belly of himself.
Deinde intromittetentam plumbi, aut aeris, si est in Fistula tortuositas, donec scias ubi peruenit tenta.	 Then insert a lead or air if there is twisting in the fistula, until you know where the probe has arrived.
Si autem sentit eam infirmus circa anum, tunc oportet ut intromittas digitum tuum indicem in anum.	 If the sick person feels it around the anus, then it is necessary that you insert your finger into the anus.
Si ergo sentis in digito tuo tentam iam penetrasse per seipsam detectam, praeter quod sentias inter digitum tuum, et inter ipsum sifac, aut carnem: tunc ergo scias certe, quia est penetrans: non ergo labores in ea, quoniam non est eius sanatio, sicut diximus.	 If you feel the probe already penetrating by itself what has been detected with your finger, and between your finger and the anus or flesh; then certainly you know that it is penetrating; therefore do not labor on it, because there is no cure for it, as we have said.
Dixerunt tamen, quia sanatur in quibusdam hominibus caro, et ex medicatione qua ei speratur iuuamentum, est, ut ignias cauterium subtile secundum amplitudinem Fistulae, sicut praecessit, et intromittas ipsum ignitum in Fistulam, donec perueniat circa anum.	 They say that flesh heals in some people and the remedy by which they hope for help is to cauterize with a subtle iron, according to the size of the fistula, as has been said before, and then insert it into the fire, until it reaches around the anus.
Deinde itera illud bis, aut ter, donec scias, quia iam adustae sunt omnes illae carnes additae filtratae, quae sunt similes cannulae pennae auis.	 Then repeat that twice, or thrice, until you know that all the added fleshes that have been filtered and are similar to the reed of a bird's feather, are burned.
Deinde cura illud cum liciniis inuolutis in butyro, donec egrediantur illae carnes, quae adustae sunt: deinde cura illud cum unguentis generantibus carnem et consolidantibus.	 Then care for that with linen wrapped in butter until the burned flesh comes out; then care for it with ointments that make and strengthen the flesh.
Si ergo sanatur, bonum est.	 If it heals, it is good.
Et si non, tunc non sanatur cum alia curatione unquam.	 And if not, then it will never be cured with any other treatment.
Et si egreditur tenta, et non peruenerit usque ad digitum tuum, qui est in ano, et est inter ipsum et tentam uelamen spissum ex carne, aut sifac: et uides Fistulam in eo quod sequitur superficiem cutis, tunc seca cutem ab initio Fistulae, et tu uadis secando cum tenta quod est in fistula, donec perueniat secatio ubi peruenit tentae extremitas, et liberatur tenta et cadit.	 If it goes out and does not reach your finger that is in the anus, and there is a thick membrane from flesh or sifac between the two; and you see a Fistula on what follows the skin surface, then cut the skin from the beginning of the Fistula, and you go cutting with the tenta (probe) what is in the fistula until the incision reaches the end of the tenta, and the tenta is released and falls.
Deinde mundifica illas carnes filtratas, quae assimilantur cannulae pennae auis, ut non remaneat ex eis aliquid.	 Then clean those fleshy parts resembling the feathers of a bird's quill, so that there is nothing left from them.
Si autem uincit te sanguis, et soluit inter te et inter operationem tuam ut seces illas carnes: tunc melius quod fit, et uelocioris iuuamenti, cauterizare eam cum igne, aut cum medicina acuta.	 If blood overwhelms you and loosens between yourself and the procedure so that these fleshy parts separate, then it is better and quicker to aid, to cauterize it with fire or with sharp medicine.
Quoniam cauterium cum igne aggregat habitudines bonas, adustionem illarum carnium additarum, et abscisionem sanguinis, et exiccationem humiditatum.	 Because cautery with fire brings good habits, burning of these fleshy parts added, and removal of blood, and drying of moisture.
Deinde cura illud cum liciniis inuolutis in butyro, aut caulibus tritis, donec locus emittat pus, et egrediantur illae carnes adustae in pus.	 Then treat that with linen wrapped in butter or boiled cabbages until the place emits pus, and those burned fleshy parts go into the pus.
Deinde cura tunc uulnus cum unguentis consolidatiuis, generantibus carnem duram: et sunt medicinae in quibus sunt stipticitas et exiccatio.	 Then treat the wound with consolidating ointments that produce hard flesh; there are medicines in which there is styptic and drying.
Nam quando restaurantur, tunc iam sanatur: et non times iterationem.	 For when they are restored, then it will be cured; do not fear the repetition.
Si autem Fistula iam peruenit usque ad profundum ani, et elongatur a superfluitate corporis: tunc intromitte digitum tuum in anum, et inquire cum eo.	 If the fistula has already reached the depth of the anus and is stretched from the body's excess: then insert your finger into the anus, and feel with it.
Si ergo sentis tentam, et inter te, et inter eam est uelamen ex sifac, aut carne, et est propinqua penetrationi: tunc non est operatio in illo, nisi secundum uiam fiduciae et spei.	 If you therefore feel a membrane between yourself and it, which is from sifac or flesh, and it is near penetration: then there is no operation in that unless according to the way of trust and hope.
Quod est, quia administratur in eo unus trium modorum: aut ut cauterizes ipsam, sicut diximus: aut seces eam, donec consequaris concauitatem eius, ut sit possibile tibi intromittere licinia, et curationem ex proximo.	 The substance is that it [the ulcer] is administered in one of three ways: either to cauterize it, as we have said; or to excise it, until you reach its concavity, so that it is possible for you to insert a linen cloth and treatment from the adjacent area.
Et non procedas multum cum sectione, ut non incidas lacertum continentem anum, et accidat super infirmum exitus egestionis absque uoluntate.	 And proceed not too much with the excision, so as not to cut into the skin containing the anus, and thus a harmful discharge occurs without consent.
Deinde cura illud cum eo quod diximus.	 Then treat that [ulcer] with what I have said.
Fortasse enim sanabitur: aut elonges ipsum uelamen, et mundes ipsum postquam secas ipsum usque prope anum, sicut diximus, aut cum tenta, aut cum instrumento alio acutae extremitatis.	 For perhaps it [the ulcer] will be cured: or remove the scab from it; and clean it after cutting it close to the anus, as we have said, or with a bag, or with some other sharp-tipped instrument.
Deinde mundifica illas carnes filtratas quae sunt in sectione, usque ubi potes cum perscrutatione.	 Then clean those fleshy parts filtered out during the incision, as far as you can with examination.
Deinde conare restaurationem uulneris totius cum sectione, et orificio superiore ubi consolidatur: et remanet Fistula aperta in interiore parte anus, et erit leuius super infirmum.	 Then try the restoration of the whole wound with the incision and the upper opening where it is consolidated; and there remains an open fistula in the inner part of the anus, and it will be easier on the patient.
Et quandoque suitur Fistula secundum hunc modum: et est, quando intromittis tentam in Fistulam: et est in latere ani circa superficiem corporis cum cute et margine ani: tunc accipe tentam perforatae extremitatis, quae est sicut acus aleskef, id est, praeparantium coria, secundum hanc formam.	 And sometimes a fistula is drained in this manner: and it is when you insert a bag into the fistula; and it is on the side of the anus near the surface of the body with skin and edge of the anus; then take a perforated-tip bag, which is like a needle, i.e., prepared from calfskin, in this shape.
Et intromitte in eam filum inuolutum ex quinque filis, et circiter ea.	 And insert into it [the fistula] a thread wound up from five threads and around that.
Deinde intromitte tentam cum filo in Fistulam, donec consequatur concauitatem eius.	 Then insert the bag with the thread into the fistula, until you reach its concavity.
Si ergo est penetrans in margine ani interius prope, tunc extrahe filum ex illo foramine: ita ut intromittas digitum tuum in anum, et extrahas extremitatem fili, et aggreges duas extremitates simul: et stringe utramque, et dimitte illud die uno, aut duobus diebus: et quanto plus incidit filum in carne, stringe ipsum bene, donec incidantur illae carnes quae sunt inter duas extremitates fili, et cadant: deinde cura uulnus, donec consolidetur, et sanetur.	 If it [the fistula] penetrates into the anus's margin internally, then extract the thread from that hole; so that you insert your finger into the anus and extract the end of the thread, and bind both ends together; and tie each one separately, and let it stay for one or two days; and the more the thread cuts into the flesh, tie it well, until those fleshy parts between the two ends of the thread fall off and disappear; then care for the wound until it is consolidated and healed.
Si autem orificium Fistulae non est penetrans: tunc fac ipsum penetrare quocunque modo praeparatur tibi, nisi sit in profundo multum.	 If however the orifice of the Fistula is not penetrating: then make it penetrate in whatever way prepared for you, unless it is very deep.
Non enim inest tibi, ut facias illud propter lacertum, ut non incidas ipsum.	 For you there is no need to do so, because not to cut the muscle itself.
Deinde fac cum ea sicut diximus, donec sanetur.	 Then perform as we have said, until it heals.
Forma Spatumilis spinosi quo finditur Fistula, cuius curuitas est acuta ualde, et pars altera est non acuta, ut non incidat illud quod non est necesse, sicut uides.	 The form of a spiny spatula with which the Fistula is cut, whose sharpness is very acute on one side and the other side is not acute, so as not to cut what is not necessary, as you can see.
¶ De sutura Hemorroidarum, ex quibus currit sanguis ex incisione earum: et cura fissurarum.	 On the suture of Hemorrhoids from which blood flows from their incision and care of fissures.
Caput LXXXI.	 Chapter LXXXI.
Sunt Hemorroides secundum duos modos.	 Hemorrhoids are of two kinds.
Aut enim sunt intra anum, similes uesicis carbonum, uel prunarum: aut quasi ipsae sint grana uuae.	 Or they are within the anus, similar to cherry-stones or raisins; or they seem to be like grains of wheat themselves.
Et ex eis sunt paruae, et magnae: et sanguis currit ex eis semper, et est una, et sunt multae.	 And some are small and large; and blood flows from them always, and there is one and many of them.
Et sunt extra anum, et in extremitatibus eius.	 And they are outside the anus, and at its extremities.
Verumtamen istae quae sunt extra anum, sunt secundum plurimum paucae humiditatis, ex quibus currit aqua citrina, aut parum sanguinis cursu assiduo: et sunt secundum colorem corporis.	 However, those that are outside the anus, are for the most part moist, from which lemony water or a little blood flows continuously; and they are according to the color of the body.
Et curatio eius quae est intra anum, est, ut praecipias infirmo ut assellet: et exprimatur, donec egrediatur anus, et appareant athelil tibi.	 And the treatment of those that are within the anus is to command the patient to eat a laxative; and it is expressed until it appears through the anus, and the feces appear to you.
Propterea ergo et suspende cum uncinis: aut tene eos cum ungue tuo.	 Therefore also, tie them with tweezers; or hold them with your nails.
Deinde incide eos apud radices suas.	 Then cut them at their roots.
Si autem non retinentur in eis uncini, propter humiditatem eorum et ipsorum mollificationem: tunc cape eos cum panno aspero, aut cum coto ex diploide lanea, et extrahe eos cum digitis tuis.	 If they cannot be held in them with tweezers, due to their moisture and softening; then grasp them with a rough cloth or with a glove made of coarse wool, and extract them with your fingers.
Deinde incide eos, et pulueriza super eos post incisionem quosdam pulueres calidos, ut stent eis loco cauterii.	 Then cut them (the vessels), and sprinkle some warm powders over them after cutting for them to remain in the place of the cautery.
Aut cauteriza eos secundum quod praecessit in capitulo cauterizandi.	 Or cauterize them according to what has preceded in the chapter on cauterization.
Deinde cura eos cum reliqua curatione, donec sanentur.	 Then care for them with the rest of the treatment until they heal.
Quod si non obedit anus egressioni, tunc clisteriza infirmum clisteri in quo sit mordicatio parua, ut lauetur cum eo quod est in ano, et obediat egressioni uelociter, quando exprimit se infirmus.	 If the anus does not obey to the evacuation, then enema the sick person with a small purgative enema, so that it cleans what is in the anus, and let it obey to the evacuation quickly when the sick person evacuates.
Si autem athelil sunt extrinseci ab ano, tunc res eorum est leuis, facilis: et est ut capias eos cum ungue tuo, aut capias eos cum uncino, et incidas eos.	 If however they are foreign bodies outside the anus, then their matter is light, easy: and it is to be that you grasp them with your nail, or grasp them with a hook, and cut them.
Deinde cura eos cum eo quod diximus, donec sanentur.	 Then care for them as we have said, until they heal.
Et qui abhorret incisionem cum ferro, tunc oportet ut administres suturam eorum secundum hunc modum.	 And whoever shrinks from cutting with iron, then it is necessary that you administer their suture in this way.
Accipe filum inuolutum, et intromitte ipsum in acum.	 Take thread wrapped around and insert it into the point (the wound).
Deinde extrahe athelil ad superiora, et fac ipsum penetrare cum acu in radice eius ex parte altera: et inuolue duas extremitates fili, in inferiori parte acus, et sint latitudinaliter: et stringe athelil strictura forti.	 Then pull out the foreign bodies upward, and make it penetrate with the point into the root on the other side: and wrap the ends of the thread around the tip of the needle, and let them be wide: and sew the foreign bodies tightly with a strong stitch.
Deinde noda filum, et extrahe acum.	 Then tie the thread and pull out the needle.
Fac illud cum omnibus athelil, et dimitte ex eis unum: nec suas ipsum, ut currat ex eo superfluitas sanguinis.	 Do this with all foreign bodies, and leave one of them: do not sew it, so that the excess blood may flow out from it.
Deinde pone super anum pannum infusum in oleo rosato, aut caeroto, et pone ipsum super anum: et praecipe infirmo, ut quiescat.	 Then place a cloth soaked in rose oil or pitch over the anus and put it on the anus: and order the sick person to rest.
Deinde dimitte ipsum, donec cadat.	 Then let him go until he falls asleep.
Cum ergo cadunt athelil, cura eos cum unguentis, et reliqua curatione, donec sanentur.	 When foreign bodies fall out, care for them with ointments and the rest of the treatment, until they heal.
¶ De cura Fissurarum.	 On the care of fissures.
Multotiens enim accidunt ex exiccatione stercoris, et constrictione naturae.	 For they often occur due to drying out of feces and tightening of nature.
Cum ergo antiquantur, et non ualet in eis medicina: tunc oportet ut radas cum puncta Spatumilis, aut cum ungue tuo, donec fiant humidae, et auferatur ab eis cortex superior qui prohibet eas a consolidatione.	 If they become old and medicine does not help: then it is necessary to shave them with a spatula or your nail until they become moist, and remove the upper bark which prevents their healing.
Deinde cura eas, donec consolidentur secundum quod oportet.	 Then care for them (the wounds) until they heal as required.
Si autem non consolidantur: tunc itera eas cum rasione uehementiori quam prima, donec sanguinentur multum, et excorientur deinde cura eas, donec sanentur.	 If they do not heal: then again treat them with a stronger solution than the first, until they bleed much, and then care for them until they are healed.
¶ De curatione Almirmar inuersorum, et non inuersorum: et Athelil siccorum, et Formicae.	 On the treatment of ulcers, both inverted (or round) and not inverted (or linear), and on scirrhus (or cancerous tumors) and Formicae (or ant-hills, a type of swelling).
Caput LXXXII.	 Chapter LXXXII.
Scias quod Almirmar non est nisi nodus rotundus secundum colorem corporis, similis capiti claui: et fit in toto corpore, praecipue in inferioribus partibus pedum, et digitis: et accidit ex eis dolor apud ambulationem.	 Know that Almirmar is not anything but a round node similar in color to the body, like a nail head; and it occurs throughout the body, especially in the lower parts of the feet and fingers; and it happens that pain occurs during walking.
Oportet ergo ut secetur quod est in circumitu claui, et teneatur cum forficibus, aut cum uncino, et eradicetur ex radice sua.	 Therefore, it is necessary to cut what is around the nail, hold with forceps or with a hook, and uproot from its root.
Deinde cura illud: et si uis cauteriza illud secundum quod praecessit in capitulo suo.	 Then care for that, and if you wish to cauterize it as previously mentioned in its chapter.
Ex athelil autem siccis unus est eminentia parua, aspera, filtrata, rotunda supra superficiem corporis.	 An ant-hill (scirrhus) from the dry part is a small elevation, rough, filtered, round on the surface of the body.
Et multotiens accidunt in manibus puerorum.	 And they often occur in the hands of children.
Et curatio eius est, ut extendas athelil, et incidas ipsum: aut stringas ipsum cum filo de serico: aut cum pilo, donec cadat.	 And its treatment is to stretch (the ant-hill), and cut it; or stitch it with silk thread; or with hair, until it falls off.
Et si uis, cauteriza ipsum secundum quod praemissum est cum igne, aut cum medicina acuta: et iam eradicantur athelil inuersi, et non inuersi cum instrumento quod ego dicam.	 And if you wish, cauterize it with fire or with a sharp medicine as previously mentioned; and now ant-hills (scirrhus) that are inverted and not inverted can be uprooted with the tool I will describe.
Formica autem est etiam eminentia parua filtrata, grossa, super superficiem corporis, uadens in profundum ualde: et quando inuenit eam frigus, sentitur in ea simile mordicationi formicae, et fit in corpore toto: et plurimum eius fit in manibus.	 Formica is also a small, filtered elevation that is rough and deep-rooted; when cold is found on it, it feels like the bite of an ant; and it occurs throughout the body, but it is most often found in the hands.
Et curatio eius est, ut accipias cannulam ex penna anseris, aut penna uulturis forti: et pone illam cannulam super Formicam, donec contineat circulus cannulae ex partibus eius.	 The treatment is to take a cannula from the feather of a goose or strong vulture; and place it over the worm, until it contains a circle by its parts.
Deinde reuolue manum tuam cum cannula, donec seces quod est in circumitu Formicae: et ponas eam in profundo carnis, et eradices Formicam ex radice eius.	 Then turn your hand with the cannula until it withdraws what is around the worm; and you will place it in deep flesh, and you will pull out the worm by its root.
Et si uis, fac illud cum cannula aeris, aut ferri, secundum hanc formam.	 And if you wish, do this with an air or iron cannula, according to this shape.
Sit superius cannulae ad sublimitatem trahens surdum inuolutum, ut alleuietur super digitum apprehensio eius et ipsius reuolutio.	 Let the upper end of the cannula be pulled upwards, drawing the deaf and rolled one, so that it is released from its grasp and its reversal.
Et si uis cauteriza Formicam secundum quod praemissum est in cauterizatione Athelil in capitulo de cauterio.	 And if you wish to cauterize the worm as stated in the cauterization of Athelil in the chapter on cautery.
¶ De formis Instrumentorum quae administrantur ad Clisteria in aegritudinibus Ani, et solutionis uentris, et colicae.	 Chapter on the shapes of instruments used for enemas in diseases of the anus, and the solution of the abdomen, and of the colon.
Caput LXXXIII.	 Chapter LXXXIII.
Quandoque Clistere fit ex argento, aut ex aurichalco, aut ex aere fuso, aut malleato.	 When an enema is made from silver, or brass, or copper fused, or beaten.
Et quandoque fit ex istis Instrumentis paruum, et magnum, secundum illos in quibus administrantur.	 And sometimes it is made small, and large, according to those for whom it is administered.
Illud ergo quod administratur in curatione puerorum paruorum, sit paruum: et quorum ani sunt debiles, aut dolorosi, sic et clisteria eorum.	 Therefore that which is given for the cure of small children should be small; and for those with weak or painful anuses, so too should their enema.
Clistere magnum.	 Large enema.
Cistere paruum.	 Small enema.
Canna eius, id est, caput superius in quo ligatur uter, sit amplum secundum hunc modum: et sit ei distinctio ut ligetur uter sicut uides, et extremitas eius inferior quae intromittitur in anum, sit surda, id est, non aperta, lenis, ualde, trahens ad subtilitatem: et in uno laterum eius sint duo foramina, et in latere altero foramen unum.	 The cannula of this, that is the upper part to which the uterus is tied, should be wide according to this method; and it should have a distinction so that the uterus can be tied as you see, and its lower end, which is introduced into the anus, should be deaf, that is not open, soft, very fine, pulling towards subtlety; and on one side of it there should be two holes, and on the other side one hole.
Et sit amplitudo foraminis secundum grossitudinem radiorum, et grossius parum, et sit uter in quo ponuntur medicinae ex uesica animalis: aut ex charta ouis, quae sit secundum formam asofrati paruae: cuius radix sit palmus unus.	 And let the size of the hole be according to the size of fingers, and it should not be too thick, and it should be a uterus in which the medicines are placed, which is from animal bladder; or from the skin of an egg, which should be similar in shape to that of a small onion; whose root should be one palm.
Et perforetur foraminibus multis sicut reuoluitur, et sit spacium quod est inter omne foramen grossitudo digiti.	 It should be pierced with many holes as it is rolled, and let the space between each hole be as thick as a finger.
Deinde intromitte in illa foramina filum forte ex filo crudo, quod sit ex decem filis, aut circiter ea, et aggrega cum eo utrem sicut asofrati.	 Then insert into it the thread, which is made of ten threads or approximately that, and bind it with a knot like an onion.
Cum ergo ponitur in eo uter, stringatur in capite clisteris inter duo distinguentia constrictione forti.	 When placed in it, the uterus should be tightened at the head by strong constriction with a purgative cord.
Deinde clisteriza cum eo.	 Then purge it.
Et haec est forma circuli utris hic depicta, et foraminum.	 And this is the shape of the circle depicted here and the holes.
Qualitas autem clisterizandi cum eo, est: ut impleas utrem, aut uesicam ex medicina, quae sit calefacta secundum quantitatem tolerantiae infirmi: et caue ne sit calida ualde, aut frigida ualde.	 The quality of the purging with it is that you fill the uterus or bladder with a medicine which should be heated according to the tolerance of the sick person: and be careful not for it to be too hot or too cold.
Deinde resupinetur infirmus super dorsum suum, et eleuet crura sua ad superiora: et pone sub eo inthaan, id est, corium super quod iacent homines, aut linteamen.	 Then the sick person lies on his back and raises his legs to higher positions: and place under him a cloth or skin on which people lie.
Deinde inunge extremitatem Clisteris cum oleo, aut cum albugine oui, aut cum mucillagine foenugraeci, aut similium.	 Then anoint the end of the purgative cord with oil, or with egg white, or with mucilage from fenugreek, or similar substances.
Deinde intromitte ipsum in anum cum facilitate.	 Then insert it into the anus gently.
Deinde accipiat minister utrem cum duabus manibus suis simul, et exprimat ipsum cum uehementia, donec euacuet totum quod est in Clisteri in intestinum.	 Then receive the person holding the uterus with both hands and squeeze it vigorously until all that is in the purgative cord is expelled into the intestines.
Deinde extrahe Clistere, et eleuet infirmus crura sua ad parietem.	 Then remove the purgative cord, and the sick person raises his legs to a wall.
Quod si medicina cogit eum ad exitum, tunc teneat quantum potest.	 If the medicine forces him out, then hold as much as possible.
Et si dormit cum ea nocte tota, est magis ultimum in iuuamento.	 And if he sleeps with her all night, it is more the last resort in treatment.
Si autem clisterizas eum in aegritudinibus solutionis uentris, et festinat exitus eius: tunc itera clistere, donec sanetur.	 If you enema him in diseases of the belly with the solution, and he hastens its departure; then repeat the enema until he is cured.
Quod si in ano sunt hemorroides, aut apostemata laedentia, tunc sit clistere subtile ualde, lene, ex clisteribus quibus clisterizantur pueri.	 If there are hemorrhoids or sores in the anus, then let the enema be very subtle, soft, from enemas that children are given.
Et haec sit forma clisteris subtilis super quod sit stricta cutis.	 And this is the form of the subtle enema on which the skin is tightened.
¶ De curatione Vulnerum capitis sine fractura ossis.	 Chapter on the treatment of head wounds without bone fracture.
Caput LXXXIIII.	 Chapter 84.
Iam dixi in diuisione de curatione uulnerum quod conueniebat libro, et ego dicam hic curationem eorum cum manu, et cum medicinis secundum complementum.	 I have said in the division on the treatment of wounds that it belongs to a book, and I will now say here the treatment of them with hands, and with medications according to completeness.
Dico ergo, quod uulnera diuersificantur secundum illud quo fiunt uulnera, et secundum locum super quem cadit uulnus.	 Therefore, wounds are distinguished according to the cause by which they occur, and according to the place on which the wound falls.
Res ergo quibus fiunt uulnera multotiens, sunt sicut iactus lapidis: aut incisio ensis, aut cultelli: aut percussio cum lancea, aut ligno, aut sagitta: et similibus illis ex rebus multis.	 Therefore, as to the causes of wounds, they are like a blow from a stone; by cutting with a sword or knife; by thrusting with a spear, wood, or arrow; and similar things made of many other objects.
Vulnera autem quae fiunt secundum loca corporis sunt, sicut uulnus quod cadit super caput, aut collum, aut pectus, aut uentrem, aut epar: et similia ex eis membris.	 Wounds that occur according to the body's locations are, for example, a wound that falls on the head, neck, chest, abdomen, or back; and similar ones from those members.
Et ego sum narrans curationes quorundam uulnerum, ut ponam eam ratiocinationem et regulam super reliqua uulnera.	 And I am telling the treatment of some wounds, in order to set forth reasoning and rule for the rest of the wounds.
Et ego incipiam a uulneribus capitis simplicibus: quoniam rememoratio compositorum ueniet in principio capituli tertii.	 And I will begin with simple head wounds, since the memory of compound wounds will come at the beginning of the third chapter.
Dico ergo.	 Therefore, (let us speak about) the treatment for simple head wounds
Quando accidit in capite uulnus simplex, et non est fractura ossis: considera tunc, si est ex iactu lapidis, aut ei similibus, et iam fregit cutem tantum: et est uulnus magnum, et times super infirmum euentum apostematis calidi: tunc propera, et phlebotoma cephalicam statim: et non tardes illud: et extrahe ei ex sanguine secundum quantitatem uirtutis eius: si non fuerit prohibens aliquid a phlebotomia, praecipue si fuerit sanguis qui egreditur ex uulnere paucus.	 If a simple wound occurs on the head and there is no bone fracture; consider then if it was caused by a blow from a stone or similar objects, and the skin has been broken but not deeply; and if the wound is large, and you fear that warm pus may develop; then proceed quickly and perform a phlebotomy of the head immediately, without delay; and extract from his blood according to its strength; if there is no prohibition against phlebotomy, particularly if the blood flowing from the wound is not much.
Et sit phlebotomia ex contrario partis uulneratae.	 And let phlebotomy be from the opposite side of the wounded part.
Et caueat infirmus sibi a repletione, et uino, et cibis grossis.	 Let the sick take care to abstain from overfilling himself, and from wine, and heavy foods.
Si autem minutionem prohibet aliquid, tunc minoretur ex cibo, et non appropinquet carnibus, neque uinis.	 If something forbids a decrease, then let it be decreased by food, not approaching meats or wine.
Et pone super uulnus si accidit ei apostema calidum, cotum infusum in oleo rosato solo, aut cum uino in quo est stipticitas.	 And place over the wound if it happens to him an abscess that is hot, hot broth infused in rose oil alone, or with wine in which there is a styptic.
Si autem securus fueris ab apostemate calido, tunc pone super uulnus, si est recens cum sanguine suo, et non mutauit ipsum aer, puluerem quem ego narrabo post paululum: et si iam mutauit ipsum aer, tunc pone super ipsum quaedam unguenta, donec sanetur.	 If you are free from a hot abscess, then place over the wound if it is recent with its own blood and has not changed the air around it; but if the air around it has already changed, then place some ointments on it until it heals.
Si autem uulnus est magnum, aut est ex incisione ensis, et similium: et non aggregantur labia eius per puluillos, tunc aggrega ipsa cum sutura, secundum quod ego narrabo in uulneribus uentris de sutura eorum.	 If the wound is large or from a sword cut and similar: let not the lips of it be gathered together by small stitches; but rather gather them with suture as I will tell you about in wounds of the abdomen regarding their sutures.
Si autem uulnus iam detectum est ab osse, et pendet, et non est retentio eius, nisi in suspensorio paruo: tunc incide ipsum.	 If the wound has been found to be from bone and hangs, and there is no holding of it, except with a small sling: then cut it.
Deinde cura uulnus cum medicinis, et restaura in eo carnem duram loco cutis, et praecipe infirmo, ut alatur cibis in quibus est grossitudo, sicut sunt capita, et triticum coctum, donec sit ut puls: et eis similia.	 Then care for the wound with medicines, and restore hard flesh to it where the skin is, and tell the sick to eat foods with thickness, such as heads and cooked wheat until it becomes soft; and similar things.
Quod si inuenis in cute putrefactionem, et non adhaeret ossi: tunc incide putrefactum totum, et proiice ipsum: deinde cura illud.	 If you find corruption of the skin and it does not stick to the bone: then cut the corrupted part completely, and throw it away; then take care of that.
Si autem in his uulneribus est arteria, aut uena ex qua fluit sanguis: et non abscinditur per medicinas, tunc inquire super arteriam.	 If in these wounds there is an artery or vein from which blood flows and it cannot be cut by medicines: then look for the artery above it.
Si ergo inuenis eam non sectam, tunc seca eam cum Spatumili, aut liga eam.	 If you find it uncut, then cut it with a spatula or bind it.
Quod si necessitas prouocat quando non confert illud quod diximus, tunc cauteriza eam, donec abscindatur sanguis.	 If necessity compels and it does not meet what was said, then cauterize [the wound], until the blood is separated.
Si autem uulnera ista sunt parua, simplicia, tunc res eorum est facilis, leuis: ita ut puluerizes super ea hunc puluerem: quoniam consolidat ea antequam mutet ea aer.	 If these wounds are small and simple, the matter is easy and light: thus that powder should be sprinkled over them, because it consolidates them before they change to air.
¶ Modus Pulueris incarnatiui.	 Method of the Powder for Consolidation.
Recipe olibani partem unam, et sanguinis draconis partes duas, et calcis non extinctae partes tres: teratur totum multum, et cribelletur: et impleatur ex eo uulnus, et constringatur constrictione bona, donec adhaereat super ipsum bene, et coaguletur cum sanguine.	 Take one part of olibanum, two parts of dragon's blood, and three parts of unburnt lime: grind it all very well, sieve it: fill the wound with it and compress it well, until it adheres well to the top, and coagulate it with blood.
Deinde stringe ipsum desuper cum puluillis, et dimitte ipsum, neque soluas ipsum dum permanet, ita quod non apostemetur.	 Then compress it on top with some powder, and let it be, do not loosen it until it remains, so that it does not come apart.
Nam non eradicatur ab eo medicina, donec sanatur.	 For the medicine is not to be removed from it until it is healed.
Et quandoque facit illud calx sola, quando non sunt tibi in praesenti olibanum, et sanguis draconis etiam facit eandem operationem in multis ex uulneribus magnis, quando conuenit ut ponatur super ea et stringantur, et sunt uulnera recentia cum sanguine suo, quae non alterauit aer.	 And sometimes lime alone does this, when you do not have olibanum and dragon's blood at hand, and it performs the same operation in many large wounds, when it is placed on them and compressed, and the wounds are recent with their own blood, which has not been altered by air.
Quod si iam alterauit ea aer quadam alteratione, praecipue quando est in tempore aestatis, tunc non est in positione huius pulueris intentio: cura ergo ipsum cum eo quod diximus, ita ut ponas super ea quaedam unguenta digestiua: aut ponas super ea pultes ex farina hordei, factas cum aqua et melle, donec emittant pus.	 If air has already altered it in some way, particularly when it is in the summertime, then this powder's purpose is not suitable: cure it with what was said, that is to say, place some digestive ointment on it, or place on it poultices made from barley flour, boiled with water and honey, until pus is emitted.
Deinde cura ea reliqua curatione, donec sanentur.	 Then cure the rest of it with the remaining treatment, until they are healed.
Si uero accidat cum uulnere fractura in osse, et est parua, tunc extrahe illud cum Gesti: et ego iam dicam curationem fracturarum capitis in eo quod futurum est.	 If it happens with a fractured wound in the bone, and it is small, then extract that with a probe, and I will now say the treatment for fractures of the skull, which will follow.
¶ De uulneribus Colli.	 On wounds of the neck.
Caput LXXXV.	 Chapter LXXXV.
SI Autem uulnus accidat in Collo, tunc non est inter ipsum differentia in medicatione, et inter uulnus capitis quando est simplex.	 If a wound occurs on the neck, there is no difference in its treatment compared to a simple wound of the head.
Si autem iam incisus est neruus Colli, aut arteria: tunc si est neruus, non est in eo ingenium, nisi ut deuitetur curatio eius cum eo quod facit stipticitatem uehementem, sicut ziniar, et zegi, et eis similia.	 If the nerve or artery of the neck is already cut, then if it is a nerve, there is no special skill in its treatment except to restrain its violent swelling as with scammony and helebore, and similar remedies.
Quoniam nocent neruis, et contrahunt eos.	 Since nerves are harmful and contract them.
Et non ponas super uulnus aliquid frigidum omnino: quoniam substantia neruorum est frigida, et continuatio eius est cum cerebro, quod est sublimius membrorum: et sit illud quo curatur ex medicinis lene, sicut calx lota cum aqua dulci aliquotiens infusa cum oleo, aut cum oleo rosato, et tuthia, quando abluitur etiam cum aqua dulci: et reliqui lapides minerales, secundum hunc modum, et unguenta humida.	 And do not place anything cold at all over the wound: because the substance of nerves is cold and their continuation is with the brain, which is superior to the organs; let that which is used for treatment be made from soft medicines such as lime with sweet water infused several times with oil, or with rose oil, and turpentine, when it is washed even with sweet water; and other mineral stones in this manner, and moist ointments.
Si autem uulnus est magnum, tunc administra suturam: aut coarta labia eius cum puluillis.	 If the wound is large, then administer suture or raw linen strips with cotton wool.
Deinde cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	 Then care for it until it heals.
Si uero uulneri est profunditas, aut accidit in eo sinus in inferiori parte eius, in quo iam aggregatur pus, tunc perfora ipsum in magis depresso loco in eo.	 If the wound is deep or a cavity forms at its lower part where pus has already gathered, then perforate it in a more depressed place.
Quod si iam incisa est in uulnere arteria, et consecutus est sanguinem eius fluxus: tunc separa, uel seca eam, et liga ipsam: aut cauteriza eam, si prouocat necessitas ad illud.	 If the artery is already cut in the wound and there is a flow of blood from it: then separate it or tie it off; or cauterize it if necessary.
Si autem iam incidit spondiles gutturis, aut totum, et saluatae sunt alhaudegi: tunc aggrega labia cutis cum sutura super cannam gutturis, et non tangas guttur, imo aequa ipsum, et reduc ipsum super figuram naturalem.	 If the windpipe (spondiles) is already perforated or completely severed and the patient has survived: then apply raw skin flaps with sutures over a reed for the throat, and do not touch the throat, but rather anoint it and reduce it to its natural shape.
Deinde stringe ipsum strictura decenti, et dimitte ipsum diebus aliquot.	 Then tie the wound with a suitable suture and let it heal for some days.
Deinde cura ipsum cum unguentis in quibus est stipticitas et exiccatio, donec sanetur.	 Then treat the wound with ointments containing astringents and drying agents until it heals.
Si autem uulnus iam fecit impressionem in osse, tunc perquire ipsum: tunc si in ipso sunt fragmenta ossis, extrahe ea omnia, aut quae potes ex eis: et quod non praeparatur, dimitte illud, donec putrescat uulnus, et separetur et alleuietur egressio eius.	 If the wound has already made an impression on the bone, then examine it; if there are fragments of bone within, remove all of them or as many as possible; and what cannot be prepared, let that alone until the wound decomposes, separates and the discharge subsides.
Quod si uulnus fuerit recens, tunc pulueriza super ipsum puluerem quem narraui.	 If the wound is recent, then sprinkle powder on it as I have mentioned earlier.
Si autem uidetur in uulnere os, et fit Fistula: tunc cura ipsam cum eo cuius rememoratio uenit in capitulo suo.	 If there appears to be bone in the wound and a fistula forms: then treat it as mentioned in its own chapter.
¶ De uulnere in Spatulis.	 Chapter on wounds treated with spatulas.
Caput LXXXVI.	 Head (chapter) 86.
SI Est percussio lanceae, aut cultelli: et uides eius profunditatem, tunc considera.	 If it is a wound from a lance or knife and you can see its depth, then examine it.
Si ergo ex uulnere egreditur uentositas, quando anhelat ex eo infirmus, tunc scias, quia uulnus est mortale.	 If air is escaping from the wound when the person breathes weakly, then you know that the wound is mortal.
Quod si non fuerit ei profunditas, et est recens cum sanguine suo: tunc non ponas in eo a prima hora puluerem, neque stringas ipsum, ut non retineatur sanguis in profunditate eius, et reuertatur ad cor, et interficiat infirmum: sed pone in ipso unguentum attractiuum, et solue ipsum in die bis.	 If there is no depth to the wound and it is recent with blood, then do not apply powder at first nor tie it up to prevent the blood from accumulating in its depth and causing death; but put on an attractive ointment and let it dissolve twice a day.
Si uero unguentum non est tibi praesens, tunc pone in orificio uulneris cotum uetustum, ut sugat illud quod egreditur de eo ex humiditatibus: et fac ut dormiat infirmus super uulnus, ut currat quod aggregatur in eo.	 If you do not have ointment at hand, then place a piece of old cloth on the wound opening to dry what is coming out of it from moisture; and make the patient rest over the wound so that what accumulates in it may run off.
Si uero iam praeterierint uulneri tres dies, aut plures, et non accidit infirmo spasmus, neque tremor cordis malus, neque strictura in anhelitu, et uides reliquas dispositiones eius bonas: tunc scias, quia uulnus est saluum.	 If three or more days have passed since the wound occurred and there is no spasm, no bad heart tremor, no shortness of breath, and the remaining signs are good, then you know that the wound is healed.
Cura ergo ipsum et cum liciniis, et reliqua curatione, donec sanetur.	 Care for it (the patient) yourself and with liniments, and the rest of the treatment until it (the ailment) is healed.
Si uero excusatur sanatio eius, et iam aperitur semper, tunc scias, quia iam factum est Fistula.	 If healing of it (the wound) has been cut off and an opening has now appeared, then you shall know that it has become a Fistula (an abnormal passageway between two organs or between the surface of the body and an organ).
Cura ergo ipsam ex capitulo suo.	 Treat it from its own place (the location where it is situated).
Et si uulnus est ex incisione ensis, aut cultelli, et est simplex in superficie pectoris, aut dorsi: tunc cura ipsum cum eo quod praecessit ex sutura, si est magnum: aut cum puluere, si est paruum.	 And if the wound is from sword or knife cut and it is simple on the surface of chest or back, then treat it with the procedure that has come before (which may be suturing or applying powder) depending on its size: either with suturing if large, or with powder if small.
Si autem iam fecit impressionem in osse, et incidit ex eo frusta: tunc inquire uulnus, et propera ad extrahendum illa frusta, si sunt separata.	 If it has already made an impression on the bone and has cut out fragments from it: then examine the wound and hurry to extract those fragments if they are separated.
Si uero non sunt separata, tunc dimitte ea, donec putrefiat uulnus, alleuiatur enim extractio eorum.	 If they are not separated, then leave them until the wound rots; for it is dangerous to extract them (the fragments).
Reliquorum autem uulnerum accidentium in reliquis membris iudicium in curatione, est iudicium eius quod diximus.	 As for other wounds occurring on the remaining limbs, judgment in their treatment is that which we have said (i.e., proper care and healing process).
¶ De uulneribus Ventris, et exitu intestini, et exitura eorum.	 Chapter on abdominal wounds and the outlet of the intestine, and their removal.
Caput LXXXVII.	 Chapter 87 (in Roman numerals).
Disruptio quae accidit uentri, est magna, et media, et parua.	 The rupture that occurs in the abdomen is great, medium, or small.
Ex magna igitur quandoque egreditur intestinum, aut numerus intestinorum.	 From a great rupture, sometimes the intestine or number of intestines comes out.
Quare fit intromissio eorum, et eorum sutura uehementior et difficilior.	 Therefore, insertion and suturing of them (the intestines) is necessary, and the suturing is more vigorous and difficult.
Et disruptio parua etiam fit difficilis ex modo alio.	 A small rupture is also difficult in another way.
Sequitur ergo, ut sit reductio eorum difficilior, si non properas in intromissione sua ad locum suum statim: quoniam inflatur, aperitur, et ingrossatur: quare fit difficilis introitus eius.	 Therefore, it follows that the reduction of them (the intestines) is more difficult if you do not hurry in their insertion to their place; because it swells, opens, and becomes larger; which makes the insertion difficult.
Propter hoc ergo fit melior disruptionum disruptio media: quoniam cum ea non fit difficilis reductio intestini, sicut fit dissicilis in his duabus speciebus.	 Therefore, it is better to make a median dissection, because with it the reduction of the intestine is not difficult, as it is in these two types.
Scias, quod sutura uenris est secundum quatuor modos.	 Know that the suture of the vein is according to four modes.
Duae suturae communes conueniunt in sutura uentris, et in sutura reliquorum uulnerum corporis: et duae suturae aliae proprie communicant reliquis uulneribus.	 Two common sutures meet in the suture of the abdomen, and in the suture of other wounds of the body: and two other sutures communicate specifically with the remaining wounds.
Verumtamen sunt magis propriae cum sutura uentris: et ego narro tibi unamquamque cum expositione, et declaratione.	 However, they are more suitable for the suture of the abdomen: and I will tell you each one with its explanation and clarification.
Dico ergo, quia quando uulnus est paruum, et egreditur ex eo aliquid ex intestino, et fit difficile reducere ipsum: tunc illud est propter unum duorum modorum.	 Therefore, I say that when a wound is small and something comes out from the intestine, it is difficult to reduce it; then this is due to one of two modes.
Aut propter paruitatem disruptionis, sicut diximus: Aut quoniam in intestino est inflatio propter frigus aeris.	 Or because of the smallness of the dissection, as we said before; or because there is inflation in the intestine due to cold air.
Quando ergo illud est ita, tunc oportet ut calefacias ipsum, ita ut submergas spongiam, aut pannum humidum in aqua tepida sola.	 When it is like this, then it is necessary to heat that part, so that you immerse a sponge or damp cloth in warm water only.
Aut decoquas in aqua squinantum, et cyperum, et spicam, et embroces cum ea intestinum, donec resoluatur inflatio.	 Or cook in water soaked with squill, cumin, spike and myrrh, and the intestine until the inflation is resolved.
Quandoque facit illud uinum in quo est stipticitas: et est melius quam aqua sola in resolutione inflationis.	 Sometimes it does wine in which there is antsickness; and this is better than water alone in resolving the inflation.
Cum ergo uides inflationem iam resolui, tunc humecta intestinum cum aqua in qua decocta est altea, aut malua.	 When you see that the inflation has already been resolved, then moisten the intestine with water in which artemisia or mallow has been boiled.
Nam per illud alleuiatur introitus eius cum re parua.	 For this reason, it relieves the entrance of it with a small amount.
Si autem excusatur reditus eius post hanc curationem, tunc finde in disruptione parum, cum instrumento quo secantur hemorrhoides.	 If, however, its return is expelled after this treatment, then seal the dissection with too little, with the instrument with which hemorrhoids are cut.
Et curatio prima est melior quando praeparatur, quam sectio: et non fit coactio ad secandum post necessitatem et defectum instrumenti.	 And the first treatment is better when it is prepared, than the section; and no pressure to cut should be forced after necessity and lack of instrument.
Sit pars eius una quae est torta, acuta, et pars eius altera non acuta, et extremitas subtilis non sit cum subtilitate Spatumilis, imo sit obtusior parumper: et est illa quae similatur caiada, sicut uides.	 The part of it is twisted, sharp, and another part of it not sharp, and the tip should not be subtle like a needlepoint, but rather slightly blunt: and this resembles a cat-o'-nine-tails, as you see.
Cum ergo amplificatur uulnus, et ingreditur intestinum, tunc oportet, ut sit reductio eius secundum formam suam naturalem in loco suo sibi proprio, si possibile est super illud: quoniam est melius.	 When the wound is enlarged and enters the intestine, then it should be reduced to its natural shape in its own place, if possible on top of it: since it is better.
Quando uero disruptio est ampla in inferiori parte uentris: tunc oportet ut facias iacere infirmum super dorsum suum, et pone crura sua altiora capite suo.	 But when the rupture is wide at the lower part of the abdomen: then one should make the patient lie on his back and place his legs higher than his head.
Et si est in superiore parte uentris, tunc pone caput eius, et pectus ipsius altiora quam eius inferiora.	 And if it is in the upper part of the abdomen: then one should raise the patient's head and chest higher than his lower parts.
Et similiter si est disruptio in una duarum partium uentris, tunc pone intentionem tuam, et tuam considerationem semper in hoc, ut pars in qua est uulnus sit altior parte altera.	 And similarly, if there is a rupture in one of the two parts of the abdomen: then direct your attention and thought always to this, so that the part where the wound is should be higher than the other part.
Et ita oportet, ut admimistres illud in uulneribus magnis, et in uulneribus mediis.	 And thus one must introduce this into large wounds and medium-sized wounds.
In uulneribus autem paruis, pone illud secundum quod praeparatur tibi.	 In small wounds: place it according to what is prepared for you.
Deinde fac ut sit praesens inter manus tuas minister pius, qui teneat disruptionem totam manu sua: et aggrega labia eius.	 Then make a devoted servant be present among your hands, who holds the entire rupture with his hand and presses the lips together.
Deinde detege ex ea ei qui sequitur suturam aliquid post aliquid: et iste est modus suturae communis unius.	 Then take from that which follows a thread for sewing, and this is the common method of sewing for one.
Et est, ut accipias acum, aut numerum acuum secundum quantitatem amplitudinis uulneris.	 And it is to receive a needle or number of needles according to the width of the wound.
Deinde dimitte ab extremitate disruptionis quantitatem digiti anularis, id est, medici: et fige acum unam praeter quod intromittas in eam filum in duabus extremitatibuis cutis, cum duabus extremitatibus sifac quod est sub cute ab interioribus, donec facias eam penetrare ab alia parte, et tu iam aggregasti duas extremitates cutis, et duas extremitates sifac: et fiunt quatuor ordines.	 Then from the end of the rupture take a quantity equal to a finger, that is, a physician's finger: and pierce the needle once through the skin at two ends, with two ends of the thread from underneath the skin on both sides until it passes through from the other side, and you have already pressed the edges of the skin together and the edges of the sifac: and four layers are formed.
Deinde stringe cum filo duplo in circumitu acus aliquotiens a duabus partibus simul, quousque sint aggregata duo labia uulneris aggregatione decenti.	 Then sew with double thread around and insert a needle repeatedly from both sides until the two lips of the wound are properly gathered together by appropriate approximation.
Deinde dimitte grossitudinem digiti etiam, et fige in eis acum aliam: postea reta eam cum filo, sicut fecisti cum acu prima.	 Then release the thickness of the finger and insert another needle; next draw it straight with thread, as you did with the first needle.
Non ergo cesses facere illud cum eo quo indiges ex acubus, donec compleas constrictionem uulneris totius.	 Therefore do not stop doing that with the necessary number of needles until you complete the entire closure of the wound.
Et sint acus mediae inter grossitudinem et subtilitatem: quoniam acus subtiles ualde uelociter incidunt carnem: et grossae sunt difficilis introitus in cutem: propter illud oportet ut sint mediae in subtilitate, et grossitudine.	 Let the needles be of medium size, since thin needles penetrate the flesh quickly, and thick ones have a difficult entrance into the skin; therefore they should be medium-sized in both fineness and thickness.
Et non oportet, ut figatur acus in duabus extremitatibus cutis propinquae multum: ut non incidatur caro uelociter, et aperiatur uulnus ante consolidationem sui, et non elongentur etiam cum sutura, ut non prohibeatur uulnus a consolidatione.	 Let the needle not be sharpened at both ends of the skin close together; in order that the flesh is not pierced quickly and the wound does not open before it has consolidated, nor do the sutures lengthen, thus preventing the wound from healing.
Deinde incide extremitatem acuum, ut non laedant infirmum apud somnum suum: et pone eis puluillos ex pannis ab omni parte, qui teneant extremitates acuum: et dimitte eos, donec scias quod uulnus iam consolidatum est.	 Then cut the end of the needle so as not to harm the weak while he is asleep; and put pieces of cloth on both sides that hold the ends of the needles, and leave them until you know that the wound has healed.
Et haec quidem species suturae cum acubus taliter est conuenientior in uulneribus paruis.	 This kind of suture with such needles is more suitable for small wounds.
Quoniam sufficit in sutura eorum acus una, aut duae, aut circiter eas.	 Because it is sufficient to sew them with one or two needles, or about the same number.
Sutura autem secunda communis est, ut aggreges cum sutura extremitates quatuor: extremitates, duas cutis, et extremitates duas sifac in uice una, cum acu in qua sit filum inuolutum aequale in subtilitate, et grossitudine.	 The second kind of suture is common for gathering together the edges with sutures four: four skin edges and two fat layers in place of one, with a needle containing an equal amount of thread in both fineness and thickness.
Deinde quando penetraueris cum acu has extremitates quatuor, reduc acum a parte a qua incaepisti eadem, ut cadat filum retatum a superiori parte uulneris: ut sit sutura, sicut sutura panni quo stringuntur panni, et pone inter omnem suturam quantitatem grossitudinis digiti minoris.	 Then when you penetrate with the needle these four edges, pull back the needle from the side where it entered so that the thread from above falls out of the wound; thus making the suture like a seam in cloth, and place between each stitch an amount of thickness equal to a finger's width.
Hanc autem suturam sciunt homines.	 Men know this stitch.
Et cum hac sutura ego sui uulnus quod acciderat uiro in uentre suo, qui fuerat uulneratus cum cultello, et erat disruptio uulneris maior palmo uno: et exierat ex intestinis circiter duos palmos ex intestino medio, et erat disruptio in medio uentris.	 And with this stitch, I myself sewed the wound of a man in his belly, which had been wounded by a knife, and the wound was larger than one palm; and there had come out from the intestines about two palms from the middle intestine, and the rupture was in the middle of the abdomen.
Reduxi ergo illud postquam stetit intestinum eius extra uulnus xxiiii horis.	 I therefore brought it back after the intestine of his stayed outside the wound for twenty-four hours.
Consolidatum est ergo uulnus in spacio quod fuit circiter XV dies: et curaui ipsum, et sanatus est: et uixit post illud annis multis, conuersatus in suis dispositionibus.	 The wound was consolidated in the space which had been about fifteen days; and I cured him, and he recovered; and he lived afterwards for many years, converted to his customs.
Et medici iudicauerant, quod non sanaretur.	 And physicians judged that it would not heal.
Et ex miraculo fuit, quod non curaui illud cum unguento.	 And it was a miracle that I did not cure it with an ointment.
Quoniam fui in loco in quo non inueniebatur unguentum, neque aliquid ex medicinis.	 Because I was in a place where no ointment could be found nor anything from the drugs.
Posui ergo super uulnus cotum uetustum bis in die, et assiduaui ablutionem eius cum aqua mellis, donec sanatum est.	 I therefore put on the wound an old loaf of bread twice a day, and I washed it assiduously with water and honey until it healed.
Duas autem species suturae proprias dicam secundum narrationem sermonis.	 I will tell of two kinds of stitches according to the account of speech.
Et est, ut incipias cum sutura acuta: et intromittas acum ab exteriori ad interiorem partem.	 And it is that you start with an acute stitch; and you insert the needle from the outside to the inside part.
Cum ergo penetrat acus in cutem, et in lacertum euntem secundum longitudinem et latitudinem totius corporis: dimitte extremitatem sifac in latere in quo intromisisti acum, et fac penetrare in extremitatem aliam ab interiori parte ad exteriorem in extremitate altera mirach.	 When the needle goes through the skin and along the length and width of the whole body: release the end of the sinew at the side into which you inserted the needle, and let it penetrate to the end at the other side from the inside to the outside in the opposite side.
Cum ergo feceris eam penetrare, tunc fac eam penetrare secundum hoc in eadem hac extremitate mirach ab exteriori parte ad interiorem: et dimitte extremitatem sifac, quae est in hoc latere, et fac penetrare acum in extremitatem alteram ab interiori parte ad exteriorem: et fac penetrare cum penetratione tua qua facis eam penetrare in sifac extremitate mirach, quae est in parte eius, donec penetret in ipsum totum.	 When you have made it penetrate, then make it penetrate in the same way at the same end but in the opposite side: and release the end of the sinew which is on that side, and let the needle penetrate to the end at the other side from the inside to the outside; and make it penetrate with your penetration, as you are making it penetrate into the end of the sinew, which is in that part, until it penetrates into him completely.
Deinde incipe etiam ab hoc eodem latere, et sue ipsum cum extremitate, quae est ex sifac in latere alio, et extrahe acum ex cute quam penetrauit.	 Then begin also from this same side, and remove it together with the extremity that is from the sifac on the other side, and extract the point that pierced through the skin.
Deinde reduc eam in illam cutem, et sue extremitatem sifac, quae est in latere alio, cum hac extremitate mirach: et extrahe eam ex cute quae est ex parte eius, et fac illud uice una, et alia: et fac illud uice post uicem, usquequo suas extrinsecum totum secundum illud exemplum.	 Return it to the same skin, and remove it along with its extremity, which is on the other side of sifac, together with this extremity: extract it from the skin that is on the other side, and do so alternately, and in reverse order until you have removed all of it according to the example given.
Et summa huius suturae, est ut suas sutura pellipariorum qua suunt pelles: ita ut suas sifac uice una ex parte una extremitate cutis: et ut dimittas eam uice alia ex parte alia, donec compleas.	 And the sum of this suture is that you should sew the skin that encloses the skins, so that you sew together one edge of the skin with one extremity of the skin: and that you leave it on one side from the other, until you have completed it.
Secunda species suturae propriae, quam dixit Gale nus.	 The second kind of surgery is the proprietary suture as Galen said.
Iste eius sermo narratus est, ut suas eam secundum similitudinem, qua suunt eas quidam medicantium, ita quod aggregant omnem partem ad comparem suam conuenientem per naturam: et applicant extremitatem sifac ad eius aliam extremitatem, et extremitatem mirach ad extremitatem eius aliam.	 This discourse is told to you in the manner of those who heal like this: that you bring together all parts to correspond with each other by nature; and apply the extremity of sifac to its other extremity, and the extremity of mirach to the other extremity of it.
Et illud fit secundum quod narro tibi.	 And this is done as I have told you.
Oportet ut figas acum in extremitatem mirach propinquam tibi ab exteriori parte, et facias eam penetrare ad interiorem in eo solo: et dimittas duas extremitates sifac.	 It is necessary that you point the point to the extremity of mirach close to you from the outer part, and let it penetrate into the interior of it; and leave two extremities of sifac.
Deinde reuolue acum, et fac eam penetrare ab exteriori parte ad interiorem in duas extremitates sifac, scilicet utrinque.	 Then turn the point, and let it penetrate from the outer part to the interior through both extremities of sifac, that is on each side.
Deinde reuolue utrasque, etiam fac penetrare utrasque ab interiori usque ad exteriorem, in duas extremitates mirach alias, quae sunt in latere opposito.	 Then turn both of them, and let both penetrate from the interior to the exterior through two extremities of mirach, which are on the opposite side.
Et iste modus suturae est melior sutura communi facili, et est sutura cuius praecessit rememoratio.	 And this method of surgery is better than the common and easy suture, and it is the suture which has been mentioned before.
Iste est ergo sermo Galeni etiam.	 This is thus the saying of Galen also.
Et dixerunt quidam.	 And certain ones said.
Retificatur sutura uentris cum duabus acubus.	 The stitching of the abdomen should be smoothed with two points.
Quod est, ut intromittas in eis utrisque filum unum: et incipe cum intromissione acus, ex eo quod est apud te, et fac eam penetrare usque ad latus aliud, secundum suturam eorum qui suunt coria aequaliter.	 What is to be done is that you insert one thread into both: and begin with the introduction of the needle from the place that is with you, and make it pass through until the other side, according to the stitching of those who sew leather equally.
Et scias, quod quando disruptio est in medio uentris: tunc sutura eius est difficilior quam reliquorum locorum uentris.	 And know that when there is a rupture in the middle of the abdomen: then the stitching of it is more difficult than the rest of the places of the abdomen.
Iudicium uero medicationis uulneris, est iudicium reliquorum uulnerum.	 The judgment of the medicine for a wound is the judgment of other wounds.
Quod est, quia quando tu consequeris uulnus recens cum sanguine suo, antequam alteret ipsum aer: et reducis intestinum, et suis ipsum, et aptas ipsum: tunc pone super puluerem incarnatiuum.	 What is to be done is that when you take a new wound with its blood before it changes with air, and reduce the intestines, and wash it, and fit it: then place it on top of powdered meat.
Quod si aer iam alterauit uulnus: tunc pone super ipsum quaedam unguenta, quae sunt tibi praesentia, donec faciant pus: et cadant fila, et consolidentur sifac, et mirach.	 If air has already changed the wound: then place on it some ointments that are present with you, which make pus, and let them drop, and consolidate them with wax, and apply it.
Deinde cura illud sicut est curatio reliquorum uulnerum, donec sanetur.	 Then care for it thus as the care of other wounds, until it is healed.
Si autem non sunt tibi praesentes medicinae, tunc pone super ipsum statim, exquo incipit emittere pus, cotum uetus: et permuta ipsum bis in die, sicut docui te, donec sanetur.	 If there are no medications present with you: then place on it immediately, when it begins to emit pus, old bread: and change it twice a day, as I have taught you, until it is healed.
Nam tu non indiges medicatione alia in pluribus dispositionibus, quando uulnera sunt simplicia.	 For you do not need any other medicine for multiple compositions, when the wounds are simple.
Si autem times, quod communicet uulnus membris principalibus in laesione, tunc oportet ut submergas lanam lenem in oleo temperatae caliditatis, aut in oleo rosato: et pone ipsam in circumitu locorum quae sunt inter inguina, et sub ascellas.	 If you fear that the wound communicates with the principal limbs in injury, then it is necessary that you immerse wool softened in warm oil or rose oil: and place it in the surrounding area of places that are between the groins and under the armpits.
Quod si sentit dolorem, aut punctiones, aut putrefactionem in intestinis suis (nam multotiens accidit illud) tunc clisteriza ipsum cum uino stiptico, nigro, tepido: praecipue si putredo iam peruenit in intestino, et facta est exitura penetrans usque ad concauitatem eius.	 If he feels pain or punctures or putrefaction in his intestines (for it often happens), then clisterize him with warm wine of pitch, black: especially if the putrefaction has already reached the intestine and an exit has been made penetrating into its concavity.
Et scias, quod illud quod est ex intestino grosso, est facilioris sanationis: et quod ex eis est ex subtili, difficilioris sanationis.	 And know that what is from the large intestine is easier to heal; and what is from the small intestines is more difficult to heal.
Intestinum autem quod nominatur Ieiunum, non suscipit sanationem ex uulnere quod accidit in eo omnino: et illud est propter multitudinem eius, quod est ex uenis, et magnitudine earum, et propter subtilitatem corporis eius, et propinquitatem ipsius naturae neruorum.	 The intestine that is called Jejunum does not accept healing from a wound that occurs in it at all: and this is because of the multitude of its veins, and the size of them, and because of the subtlety of its body, and because of the proximity of its nature to the nerves.
Si autem illud quod procedit ex uulnere est zirbum, et consequeris ipsum recens: reduc ipsum secundum reductionem tuam, qua reducis intestina aequaliter.	 If what comes out from the wound is greenish and you seize it quickly: return it as you would return the intestines equally.
Si uero praeteriit ei spacium, et iam factum est uiride, aut nigrum: tunc oportet ut stringas ipsum cum filo supra locum qui denigratus est ex eo, ut non accidat fluxus sanguinis.	 But if it has passed time and already become black or greenish: then you must tie it with thread above the place that has turned black from it, so that there is no bleeding.
In zirbo enim sunt uenae et arteriae.	 For in the greenish there are veins and arteries.
Deinde incide quod est praeter illud ligamentum, et pone duas extremitates fili pendentes ex inferiori parte uulneris extra ipsum: ut alleuietur super te attractio eius, et extractio ipsius apud casum zirbi, et emissionem pus uulneris.	 Then cut what is beyond that ligament and put two ends of hanging thread from the lower part of the wound outside it: to relieve you from the attraction of it and the extraction of the greenish at the place of the wound, and the discharge of pus from the wound.
¶ Rememoratio uulneris quod accidit in Intestino.	 Chapter on the wound that occurs in the intestine.
Quando accidit disruptio in Intestino, et est parua: tunc possibile est, ut restauretur in quibusdam hominibus: propterea, quia ego uidi qui fuit uulneratus in uentre suo cum percussione lanceae, et erat uulnus a dextra stomachi, et antiquatum est uulnus: et factum Fistula, et exiuit ex eo egestio, et uentositas.	 When there is a rupture in the intestine and it is small: then it is possible for it to be restored in some men: therefore, because I have seen a man who was wounded in his stomach with the thrust of a lance, and the wound was on the right side of the stomach, and the wound was old; and a fistula has been formed, and discharge and gas have come out from it.
Posui ergo curationem, usque quod ego non fui confisus in sanatione eius: neque cessaui subtiliare ipsum, donec sanatus est, et consolidatus est locus.	 I therefore gave treatment, until I was not confident in its healing; neither did I cease to examine it, until it was healed, and the place was consolidated.
Postquam ego uidi locum iam consolidatum, timui super infirmum, quod accideret super infirmum accidens malum in uentre suo: et non accidit ei ex illo accidens malum.	 Once I saw the place already consolidated, I feared an accident happening to the sick one in its belly; and no such accident happened to it from that source.
Et remansit in melioribus dispositionibus suis, comedens et bibens, et futuens, et intrauit balneum, et exercitatus est in dietis suis.	 And it remained in better conditions for itself, eating and drinking, urinating, and taking a bath, and exercised in its regimen.
Et iam dixerunt quidam experimentatorum, quia quando accidit in Intestino uulnus, et est paruum: tunc oportet ut ligetur secundum hunc modum.	 And some of the experimenters said that when a wound occurs in the intestine and it is small, then it should be tied thus.
Et est, ut accipias formicas magnorum capitum.	 And there is, to take large-headed ants.
Deinde aggrega duo labia uulneris, et pone formicam unam ex eis quae habeant os apertum super duo labia uulneris.	 Then gather two lips of the wound, and place one ant with an open mouth on both lips of the wound.
Cum ergo capit super ea, et stringit os suum, abscinde caput eius, adhaeret enim, et non soluitur.	 When the ant's head is upon them, and it closes its mouth, cut off its head, for it will stick, and will not be loosened.
Deinde pone formicam aliam prope primam, et non cesses facere illud cum formica post formicam secundum quantitatem uulneris totius.	 Then place another ant near the first one, and do not cease to make this with ants according to the size of the wound in total.
Deinde reduc ipsum, et sue uulnus.	 Then reduce it (the wound), and let it heal.
Illa enim capita remanent annexa in Intestino, donec cibetur Intestinum, et sanetur, et non accidat infirmo nocumentum penitus.	 For those heads remain attached in the intestine until it is eaten (the intestine), and healed, and no harm comes to the sick one deeply.
Et iam possibile est, ut ligetur Intestinum etiam cum filo subtili: quod abstersum est ex intestino animalis, annexo cum eo postquam intromittitur in acum.	 And it is now possible to tie the intestine even with a fine thread; this has been removed from the animal's intestine, attached with it when it is introduced into the needle.
Et est, ut accipias extremitatem huius fili ex intestino, et excarnetur multum.	 And there is, to take the end of this thread from the intestine, and to be scraped off much.
Deinde liga in extremitate eius filum lini subtile inuolutum.	 Then tie a fine linen thread at its end.
Deinde intromitte illud filum in acum, et sue cum eo intestinum.	 Then introduce the thread into the needle, and let it with the thread go through the intestine.
Deinde reduc ipsum in disruptionem.	 Then reduce it to dissection.
Et iste modus suturae cum formicis et intestino, non est nisi secundum uiam fiduciae et spei.	 This method of suturing with worms and intestines is only by way of trust and hope.
Scias, uulnus quod est magnum, amplum, praecipue si est in uno intestinorum gracilium: tunc non est ingenium nisi subtiliatio, neque est eius sanatio omnino.	 Know that a large wound, broad, especially if it is one of the thin intestines: then skill is not ingenuity but subtlety, and there is no healing at all.
¶ De cura Zuchemen, et Fistularum.	 Chapter on the Care of Sores and Fistulas.
Caput LXXXVIII.	 Chapter 88.
Scias, quod omne uulnus, aut apostema quando ueterascit et antiquatur, et fit ulcus, et non consolidatur, et emittit pus semper, et non abscinditur: tunc nominatur uniuersaliter in quocunque membro fuerit Fistula, et nos nominamus ipsum Zuchemen.	 Know that every wound or boil, when it becomes old and decays, and turns into an ulcer and does not heal, and always discharges pus and does not abscess: then it is universally named in whatever member it is found a Fistula, and we call it Zuchemen.
Et Fistula quidem est secundum ueritatem nodatio filtrata, dura, alba: cum qua non est dolor, cui est concauitas pennae auis: et propter illud nominant eam quidam Risati, id est, pennam.	 Indeed, a Fistula is correctly called a drained abscess, hard, white; without pain, having the shape of a bird's feather beak: and for that reason some call it Risatus, that is, beak-shaped.
Et est in quibusdam horis humida, quae emittit pus.	 And at times it is moist, which discharges pus.
Et fortasse scinditur humiditas in quibusdam horis.	 And perhaps the moisture is divided at certain times.
Et quandoque est haec humiditas multa, et est pauca: et est grossa, et est subtilis.	 And sometimes this moisture is abundant, and it is scarce; and it is thick, and it is thin.
Et ego iam praemisi in diuisione, tunc cum dixi uulnera, quod omne ulcus quod non sanatur, neque nascitur in eo caro, non est illud nisi propter unam nouem caussarum.	 And now I have already divided the wounds, when I said an ulcer that does not heal, does not produce new flesh in it, is not that except for one of nine causes.
Quarum una est, aut propter paucitatem sanguinis in corpore: aut propter maliciam eius: aut quoniam inter ipsum, et super labia eius est caro dura, prohibens natiuitatem carnis: aut quia est multae sordis et sordiciei: aut quoniam ulcus in seipso est putridum, et materia quae mittitur ei est malae qualitatis: aut quoniam medicina est inconueniens in curatione eius: aut quoniam corruptio cadens in regione est genus pestilentiae, aut per proprietatem in regione, sicut accidit in Caesaraugusta: in qua fit difficilis digestio aegritudinum, et tardatur in ea sanatio apostematum per naturam: aut quoniam in eo est os unum, aut numerus ossium.	 Of which one is, either because of the scarcity of blood in the body; or because of its malice; or because hard flesh is between it and above its surface, preventing the growth of new flesh; or because there is much dirt and corruption; or because the ulcer itself is putrid, and the matter that is discharged from it is of poor quality; or because the treatment is unsuitable for its cure; or because falling decay in the region is a kind of plague, as happens in Caesaraugusta: where the digestion of diseases becomes difficult, and the healing of boils is delayed by nature; or because there is one bone, or a number of bones in it.
Et ego iam ostendi omnes istas caussas et signa earum, et curationes ipsarum cum medicinis in diuisione: et oportet hic ut faciam te scire curationem Fistulae et Zuken, quae fit per uiam operationis cum manu.	 And now I have shown all these causes and their signs, and the cures for them with the medicines in the division; and here it is necessary that I make you know the cure for a Fistula (or Zuchemen), which is done by the way of operation with the hand.
Scias ergo, quod Fistula accidit in omnibus membris corporis.	 Know, therefore, that a Fistula occurs in all members of the body.
Nam ex eis sunt Fistulae quae perueniunt ad uenas magnas et arterias, aut neruos, aut sifac: aut ad intestinum, aut ad uesicam, aut ad aliquam ex costis: aut ad aliquam ex spondilibus dorsi, aut ad aliquam iuncturarum compositarum compositione: sicut manus, et pedis: et ex eis sunt quae uadunt ad propinquitatem membri principalis, et similium.	 For these are Fistulas that reach the great veins and arteries, or nerves, or tendons; or the intestine, or bladder, or some of the ribs; or some of the vertebrae in the back, or some of the joints composed of several bones, such as hands, feet: and there are those that approach the proximity of the main member and similar ones.
Quae ergo ex his Fistulis est secundum hunc modum, est ex aegritudinibus difficilis sanationis, et non recipit curationem, et occupatio cum ea est labor et ignorantia.	 That which is this Fistula according to this manner, is difficult for healing, and does not receive treatment, and the occupation with it is labor and ignorance.
Quod si est ex Fistulis aliqua cuius profunditas non peruenit ad haec loca quae dixi: et speras, et confidis in curatione eius, et uis peruenire ad cognitionem illius, tunc accipe tentam ex aere, aut ferro, si Fistula tendit secundum rectitudinem, et perquire eam cum ipsa.	 If it is some of the Fistulas whose depth does not reach to those places that I mentioned and you hope and trust in its treatment, and wish to come to knowledge of it, then take a probe made of copper or iron, if the Fistula points in a straight direction, and search for it with the same.
Si autem in Fistula est tortuositas, tunc inuestiga eam cum tenta de plumbo subtili.	 If, however, there is a twist in the Fistula, then investigate it with a probe made of fine lead.
Quoniam plumbum cum lenitate sui corporis alleuiatur, et curuatur circa tortuositatem.	 Because lead, due to its softness, yields and bends around the twist.
Quod si Fistula est habens orificia multa, non est tibi possibile ut significes super eam cum tenta.	 If the Fistula has many openings, it is not possible for you to sign upon it with a probe.
Clisteriza ergo ex eis orificium ex orificiis suis.	 Cauterize therefore, from among its openings, one opening.
Nam humiditas qua clisterizas ipsum, uadit uersus orificia alia, et currit ex eis.	 Because the moisture with which you cauterize it, flows away towards other openings and runs out of them.
Deinde exquisite inquire secundum quem modum est tibi possibile: ut cognoscas quod illic est os, aut neruus, et est Fistulae concauitas longinqua, aut propinqua: aut est Fistula una cui sunt orificia multa, et sta super totum illud, cum summa fortitudinis tuae: cum interrogatione tua, qua interrogas infirmum, et inuentione doloris apud compressionem cum manu tua super locum, et similibus ex significationibus et caussis accidentibus apostemati.	 Then examine and inquire according to the manner that is possible for you: so that you know whether there is a bone or nerve, and the Fistula has a deep hollow, far away or near; or if it is a single Fistula with many openings, standing on all of it, with your utmost strength: with your questioning, which you ask of the sick person, and by feeling for pain in compression with your hand upon the place, and similar signs and causes of injury.
Cum ergo steteris super omnia illa statione uera, tunc uade ad curationem secundum confidentiam: et est, ut consideres tunc, si est Fistula propinqua apparens, aut in loco saluo longinquo a iunctura, aut a neruo, aut arteria, aut uena, aut uno locorum quae dixi tibi: tunc seca Fistulam secundum quod praemissum est ex narratione mea, et aufer quod est in ea ex filtratione, et carnibus corruptis, quod nascitur in orificio eius ex carne, aut thelul, et similibus: et cura ipsam, donec sanetur.	 When therefore you have stood over all those matters in the correct position, then proceed to treatment according to confidence: and it is that you should consider then, if it is a Fistula nearby appearing, or in a safe place distant from a joint, or from a nerve, or an artery, or vein, or one of the places which I told you: then cut the Fistula according to what was stated in my narrative, and remove what is in it from filtration, and corrupted flesh, what is born in its opening from flesh or ulcer, and similar things: and take care of it until it heals.
Si autem Fistula est longinquae profunditatis, et est secundum rectitudinem: tunc oportet ut seces eam in profundo quantum est tibi possibile.	 If the Fistula is deep, and it is as stated: then it is necessary to cut it deeply as much as possible for you.
Deinde mundifica ipsam ex omnibus carnibus eius corruptis.	 Then clean it from all corrupted flesh of it.
Deinde administra licinia inuoluta in medicinis acutis: et intromitte ea usque ad concauitatem Fistulae quam comprehendisti cum ferro: fac cum ea illud aliquotiens, donec corrodat medicina acuta totum quod remansit in concauitate Fistulae ex corruptione.	 Then administer a linen cloth dipped in sharp medicines: and insert it up to the hollow of the Fistula which you have grasped with iron: do this several times, until the sharp medicine corrodes all that remains in the hollow of the Fistula due to corruption.
Deinde restaura ipsam cum unguentis quae generant carnem sanam, donec sanetur.	 Then restore it with ointments which generate healthy flesh, until it heals.
Si uero non sanatur per illud, tunc cauteriza ipsam secundum quod narrauimus.	 If it does not heal through this, then cauterize it according to what was stated before.
Si ergo caussa Fistulae est os, et certificatur apud te illud: tunc inquire ipsum, et seca ipsum secundum quod narraui tibi: si non prohibet te aliquid ex uena, aut neruo, aut membro principali, sicut diximus.	 If the cause of the Fistula is bone, and you are sure about it: then investigate it, and cut it according to what I told you: if it does not prohibit you from anything from a vein, or nerve, or major member, as was said before.
Si ergo detegitur tibi os, et est in eo quiddam corruptionis, et nigredinis: tunc rade ipsum, donec auferatur corruptio eius tota.	 If a bone is exposed to you, and there is something corrupted and black in it: then file it until the corruption is completely removed.
Deinde cura ipsum cum eo quod incarnat ipsum, donec sanetur.	 Then take care of it with that which causes it to heal, until it heals.
Quod si non sanatur, et emittat pus sicut faciebat: tunc scias, quod tu non peruenisti ad totam eradicationem corruptionis.	 If it does not heal and discharges pus as it was doing: then you know, that you have not reached complete eradication of the corruption.
Detege ergo super illud secundo, et exquisite fac rasionem eius, et mundificationem ipsius cum ultima fortitudine tua.	 Excise it again on the second occasion, and investigate its cause and cleanse it with your utmost strength.
Deinde restaura ipsum.	 Then restore it.
Si ergo sanatur, bonum est: et si non, tunc scias quod illa corruptio est in profunditate longinqua corporis, quam non es consecutus.	 If then it heals, that is good; and if not, then you know that the corruption is deep within the body, which you have not been able to reach.
Non est ergo tibi in ea ingenium, nisi dimittere ipsam naturae.	 You have no skill in that matter, except to let it be by nature.
Quod si corruptum est os paruum, et est possibile tibi, attrahe ipsum cum forficibus subtilibus quae conueniunt ad illud.	 If a small bone is corrupted and it is possible for you, pull it out with delicate forceps that fit the case.
Si autem sunt ossa multa, tunc exquisite fac attractionem eorum omnium, neque dimittas ex eis aliquid cum tua fortitudine.	 If there are many bones, then investigate how to pull out all of them and do not leave anything behind with your strength.
Si uero contrarietatem facit tibi aliquid ex humiditatibus, et non est in incisione eorum timor, uel error: tunc incide illas humiditates et carnes, si sunt illic, et libera ossa.	 If however it presents an obstacle to you from some moisture, and there is no fear or error in the incision: then cut those moist areas and flesh, if they are present, and release the bones.
Si uero non est tibi praeparatio auferendi ossa ex hora tua, tunc pone super uulnus quod putrefaciat ipsum: et dimitte ipsum, donec putrefiat quod est in circumitu illorum ossium ex carnibus et humiditatibus.	 If however you are not prepared to remove the bones at your time, then place something on the wound that will rot it, and let it go until it rots due to the flesh and moisture around those bones.
Et custodi uulnus ut non consolidetur.	 And keep the wound so that it does not heal.
Et constringatur sectio quam tu secuisti in operatione tua.	 And tighten the incision that you made during your operation.
Imo pone super ipsum, si times, cotum submersum sulfure trito cum oleo: aut cotum submersum in unguento aegyptio, aut aliquo unguentorum uiridium.	 Rather place on it if you fear it, a piece of charcoal softened with ground sulfur and oil; or a piece of charcoal soaked in Egyptian ointment, or any green ointments.
Nam quando putrefient illae scilicet humiditates, et separantur ex eis ossa, alleuiatur ablatio eorum, et ipsorum attractio.	 For when those moist areas rot and separate the bones, cleaning them away will be easier, and pulling out the bones themselves will be facilitated.
Si autem est os unum magnum, sicut os cruris, aut os coxae, et similia illis, et quod ex eo corruptum est, est pars magna: tunc rade ipsum rasione ultima, donec auferatur illa nigredo et corruptio.	 If there is a large bone, such as the thighbone or hip bone, and what is corrupted from it is a major part: then shave it with a final file until the blackness and corruption is removed.
Deinde restaura uulnus.	 Then restore the wound.
Si uero quod est in eo corruptum, est pars magna, et corruptio iam consecuta est medullam ossis, tunc necesse est serrare ipsum, et incidere ipsum totum usque ad locum, ubi peruenit corruptio: tunc cura ipsum, donec consolidetur.	 If what is within it (the bone) has decayed and a large part is already rotten to the marrow of the bone, then it is necessary to saw that (bone) and cut through it all to the place where the decay has reached: then treat it until it heals.
Et ego narro tibi zuken, quae accidit uiro in crure suo: ut ponas ipsam exemplum et adiutorium super operationem tuam.	 And I tell you this secret, which happens to a man in his leg: place it as an example and aid for your operation.
Fuit uir iuuenis aetate circiter triginta annos, cui accidit dolor in crure suo, a caussa quae mota est super ipsum intra corpus, id est, ab interioribus, donec peruenerunt materiae ad crus, et apostematum est apostemate magno: et non fuit ei caussa extrinseca.	 A young man of about thirty years had pain in his leg, caused by something that moved upon him within the body (from inside), until it reached the leg and an abscess was formed with a large size: and there was no external cause for him.
Extensum est ergo cum eo tempus cum errore medicorum, donec apertum est apostema, et concurrerunt cum eo materiae multae.	 Time passed while the man was in error with the physicians until the abscess was opened, and much matter gathered around him.
Et postposita est curatio eius, donec fistulatum est crus, et facta sunt in eo orificia multa: quae omnia emittebant pus, et humiditates corporis.	 And the treatment of his leg was delayed until it became fistulous and many openings were made in it, from which pus and bodily moisture flowed out.
Curauit ergo ipsum multitudo medicorum circiter duos annos, et non fuit in eo sapiens in arte manus, donec uocatus sum, et uidi crus eius, et materias quae currebant ex illis orificiis cursu magno: etiam omne uiri corpus iam tabuerat, et color eius citrinus erat.	 Many physicians treated him for about two years and there was no skilled hand in him until I was called, and saw his leg, and the matter that flowed from those openings with a great flow: even the whole body of the man was already rotten and his skin had become yellowish.
Intromisi ergo tentam in uno locorum orificiorum, et peruenit tenta ad os.	 I inserted a probe into one of the openings, and the probe reached the bone.
Deinde perscrutatus sum orificia omnia: et inueni ea peruenire ad se inuicem ex omnibus partibus cruris.	 Then I examined all the openings: and found them to reach each other from all parts of the leg.
Properaui ergo, et secui super unum illorum orificiorum, donec detexi partem ossis: et inueni ipsum corruptum: quod iam corrosum erat, et denigratum, et putruerat, et perforatum erat, donec penetrauerat usque ad medullam.	 I approached and sawed through one of the openings until I exposed part of the bone: and I found it rotten; which had already been corroded, decayed, decomposed, perforated until it had penetrated to the marrow.
Serraui ergo quod detectum est mihi, et praeparatum ex osse corrupto.	 Prepare therefore what has been detected for me, and prepare it from corrupted bone.
Et deputaui, quod non esset in osse nisi illa corruptio, quam abscidi, et serraui.	 And I ordered that it should not be on the bone unless that corruption, which had been removed, was to be sawed off.
Et ego iam eradicaueram eam.	 And I had already uprooted it.
Deinde posui restaurationem uulneris cum medicinis consolidatiuis spacio longo.	 Then I placed the wound's restoration with strengthening medicines at a long distance.
Et non est consolidatum.	 And it is not strengthened.
Deinde tentaui, et detexi super os secundo supra detectionem primam: et inueni corruptionem continuam cum osse: et serraui quod apparuit mihi etiam ex illa corruptione.	 Then I tried again and probed over the bone a second time above the first detection; and I found continuous corruption with the bone; and I sawed off what appeared to me also from that corruption.
Deinde conatus sum restaurationem eius.	 Then I attempted its restoration.
Et non est restauratum.	 And it is not restored.
Detexi ergo super ipsum iterum, et non cessaui incidere os particulatim, et conari restaurationem eius: et non est restauratum, donec incidi ex osse circiter palmum unum, et extraxi illud cum medulla sua.	 I then probed it again and did not cease to cut the bone in parts, trying for its restoration; and it was not restored until I had cut out a palm's breadth from the bone, and extracted that along with its marrow.
Deinde restauraui ipsum cum medicinis, et consolidatum est uelociter, et sanatum: et non fuit necessaria haec iteratio in operatione eius, et sectione ipsius, nisi propter dispositionem debilitatis infirmi, et paucitatem tolerantiae eius, et timorem meum super ipsum de morte: quoniam accidebat ei in omnibus horis ex superfluitate euacuationis syncopis mala.	 Then I restored it with medicines, and it was quickly strengthened and healed; and this repetition in the operation and section of it was not necessary except because of the arrangement of weakness, the frailty of the patient, his poor tolerance, and my fear of death for him; since he often fell into syncopal evacuations during all hours on account of excessive bleeding.
Sanatus est ergo sanatione integra: et nata est in loco ossis caro dura, et bona facta est dispositio in corpore suo, et rediit uirtus eius: et conuersatus est in dispositionibus suis: et non fecit ei contrarietatem in ambulatione nocumentum omnino.	 Thus he was completely healed; and a hard piece of meat grew at the place of the bone, and it turned out well for his body, and his strength returned to him; and he regained his constitution, and he suffered no harm from walking at all.
Si autem os eminens in loco corporis iam fractum est: tunc oportet ut serres ipsum, secundum hunc modum: et est: ut accipias ligamentum, et stringe ipsum in extremitate ossis eminentis: et praecipe alicui, qui extendat ipsum ad sursum: et pone ligamentum aliud ex lana grossius ligamento primo.	 If however the prominent bone at a place in the body is already fractured, then it must be sawed off in this manner: and that is, to take a ligament, tie it at the end of the protruding bone; and command someone to extend it upward; and place another thicker cord from wool first.
Deinde liga ipsum super carne, quae est suh osse: et extende extremitatem eius, ut trahas carnem ad inferiora: et tu detegis carnem super locum quem uis serrare, ut non laedat Serra carnem.	 Then bind that [the wound] on the bone which is flesh: and extend its end, so that you draw the flesh towards the lower parts: and you expose the flesh over the place where you wish to cut with the saw, so that the saw does not cut into the flesh.
Pone lignum, aut tabulam sub osse inferius decenter: quoniam quando facis illud, non prohibetur quin secet carnem corruptam.	 Place a stick or a board under the bone below properly: because when you do that, it is not forbidden to cut rotten flesh.
Et oportet ut sit Serratura super locum corruptum parumper, ut non sit in concauitate ossis corruptio: et non appareat in apparitione sua sensui, et cogat ad Serraturam sui uice alia.	 And it is necessary that the saw be above the rotten place a little bit, so that there is no rotting in the hollow of the bone: and it does not appear to the sense in its appearance, and compel another to serve in its place.
Quod si os est corruptum, et non est eminens, imo continuatur pars eius cum parte: et corruptio est in medio eius, aut in parte ipsius: tunc detege carnem ab omnibus partibus totam.	 If the bone is rotten and not prominent, on the contrary it is joined to another part: and the rotting is in the middle of it or in a part of it: then expose the flesh from all parts completely.
Deinde pone lignum inferius.	 Then place a stick below.
Postea serra illud ex parte prima, ubi est corruptio, donec continuetur Serratura ex parte altera: et sit Serratura secundum longitudinem a corruptione parumper, secundum quod diximus.	 Afterwards saw from the first side where there is rotting, until the saw is joined to another part: and let the saw be according to its length a little bit away from the rotting, as we said.
Quod si corruptio est in iunctura, incide ipsam iuncturam corruptam, et serra os ubi continuatur ex parte altera.	 If the rotting is at a joint, cut the joint which is rotten and saw the bone where it is joined from another part.
Si uero corruptio est in continuatione duarum iuncturarum, tunc non est in ea ingenium nisi abrasio.	 But if the rotting is in the continuity of two joints, then there is no skill in that except by abrasion.
Quod si corruptio est in pectine manus, aut in pectine pedis: tunc res in eo est difficilis ualde.	 If the rotting is in the beak of the hand or foot: then the matter is very difficult in that.
Verum oportet, ut inquiras corruptionem qualiter appareat tibi.	 But it is necessary to examine how the rotting appears to you.
Et abradas eam, et mundes ipsam secundum quamcunque dispositionem tibi possibile est, et cum quocunque ingenio rectificatur tibi: quando non facit tibi contrarietatem Vena, aut Neruus.	 And abrade it, and cleanse it according to whatever position is possible for you, and with whatever skill it can be corrected for you: when it does not create opposition for you from the Vein or Nerve.
Et scias quod incisoria, et Serrae ad incidendum ista ossa sunt multa, secundum situm ossium, et praparationem eorum, et ipsorum grossitudinem, et subtilitatem eorum, et magnitudinem, et paruitatem ipsorum, et duriciem ipsorum, et eorum raritatem.	 And know that there are many saws and knives for cutting these bones, according to the position of the bones, their preparation, their thickness, their subtlety, their size, their smallness or greatness, their hardness, and their rarity.
Quapropter oportet, ut praepares omni speciei operationis instrumentum conueniens ad illam operationem.	 Therefore, it is necessary that one prepares a suitable instrument for every kind of operation.
Et scias, quod operationes istae significant tibi super speciem instrumenti quo indiges, quando tecum est studium longum.	 And know this: these operations indicate to you the type of instrument required of you, when your study is prolonged.
Et cognitio modorum huius artis, testimonium modorum aegritudinum: tunc enim iam inuenies per teipsum illud quod conuenit ei ex instrumentis ad omnem infirmitatem.	 And knowledge of the methods of this art is evidence of the methods of diseases; then you will find for yourself that which suits it among the instruments for every illness.
Et ego sum firmans tibi in ultimo huius capituli numerum instrumentorum, quae pones exempla super quae incides, et probationem qua experiaris super alia.	 And I am confirming for you at the end of this chapter the number of instruments, which you will place as examples on which to cut, and proof of the test on others.
Forma Serrae.	 Form of a Saw.
Forma alterius Serrae.	 Form of another Saw.
Forma Serrae alterius.	 Form of another Saw.
Forma Serrae alterius.	 Form of another Saw.
Haec forma Serrae depicta, sit decenter facta.	 This form of a Saw should be well made.
Fiat arcus eius superior, acuitas eius ex ferro: et manubrium eius ex buxo, et sit pyramidale decenter factum.	 Let its upper part be an arch, its sharpness from iron; and let its handle be of boxwood, and it should be well-made pyramidally.
Forma Rasorii iuncturarum.	 Form of a Scissors for Joints.
Sit caput huius Rasorii, secundum formam capitis claui stellati: et puncta eius sint secundum formam punctorum elischetfegi.	 The head of this Scissors should be like the head of a star-shaped nail; and its points should be like those of an elongated fork.
Et non conuenit, nisi ut fricentur cum eo capita iuncturarum, quando corrumpuntur, aut os amplum, et magnum est.	 It is not suitable unless it rubs against the heads of the joints when they are broken, or a large and thick bone.
Forma maioris Rasorii.	 Form of a Larger Scissors.
Forma medii Rasorii.	 Form of a Medium-sized Scissors.
Forma Rasorii lati.	 Form of a Wide Scissors.
Forma Rasorii in quo est concauitas.	 Form of a Scissors with a hollow inside.
Forma Rasorii alterius subtilis.	 Form of another Fine Scissors.
Forma Rasorii alterius curuatae extremitatis.	 Form of another Scissors with a curved end.
Forma Rasorii parui, subtilis tentae.	 Form of a Small and Fine Scissors with a pointed tip.
Forma Rasorii cum quo inciduntur ossa.	 Form of a Scissors for cutting bones.
Forma etiam Rasorii magni.	 Also the form of a Large Scissors.
Hoc similatur Radio, et extremitas est sicut Serra: exhibetur in locis multis ex rasione ossium.	 This resembles a Saw, and its end is like a Razor: it is used in many places due to the reason of bones.
Forma Rasorii quod conuenit ad rasionem eius quod perforatum est ex ossibus.	 The shape that suits for cutting through bone is similar to that of a Razor.
Extremitas eius triangula, acutarum est extremitatum.	 Its end is triangular, and its edges are sharp.
Fit ex Indi.	 It is made from India.
Et similiter oportet, ut fiant omnia quae diximus ex Rasoriis, et Incisoriis, et Serris.	 And similarly, everything that we have said should be made of Razors, Knives, and Saws.
¶ De incisione extremitatum, et Serratura ossium.	 Chapter on the incision of extremities, and the sawing of bones.
Caput LXXXIX.	 Chapter LXXXIX.
Putrefiunt extremitates, aut ex caussa extrinseca, aut intrinseca.	 Rotten extremities are either due to an external cause, or an internal one.
Cum ergo medicatus fueris illam corruptionem curatione medicinarum, et non confert curatio: et uides corruptionem incidere in membrum, quam non repercutit aliquid: tunc oportet ut incidas illud membrum usque ubi consequitu corruptio, ut euadat infirmus per illud a morte, aut a malicia quae est maior defectu membri.	 When you have treated the corruption with medicines and it does not improve, and you see that the corruption is spreading into a limb which has not been affected: then it is necessary to amputate that limb up to where the corruption extends, so that it may pass through it from death, or from some greater evil due to the loss of the member.
Et signum cui accidit illud est, quod denigratur membrum, donec putetur: quod ignis combussit ipsum, aut putrefit post nigredinem: donec inciditur illa putredo usque ad illud quod sequitur illud membrum, et serpit in totum corpus.	 And the sign that this happens is when the limb turns black, until it is thought to be dead; or when fire has burned it, or it has rotted after turning black: until the rot spreads up to where it follows the limb, and it creeps through the whole body.
Propera ergo cum incisione eius, et similiter si caussa corruptionis est a percussione quorundam uenenosorum: sicut scorpionis marini, et uiperae, et rutellae, et similium.	 Therefore, when making the incision and similarly if the cause of corruption is due to the bite of some venomous creatures such as marine scorpions, weasels, adders, and similar ones.
Si ergo corruptio, aut percussio est in extremitate digiti, tunc incide digitum, et non des spacium corruptioni, ut incedat usque ad reliquam manum.	 If corruption or a bite occurs on the extremity of a finger, then amputate the finger and do not leave space for the rot to spread, so that it may creep up to the rest of the hand.
Et similiter si accidit in manu, tunc incide eam ex radice focilis, et non des spacium corruptioni, donec capiat in focili brachii.	 And similarly if it happens in the hand, then amputate it at the root of the wrist and do not leave space for the rot to spread, until it reaches the arm bone.
Et si inuadit in eo, tunc incide brachium apud cubitum in iunctura sua.	 And if it invades him (the wound), then cut the arm at the elbow joint.
Si autem pertransit corruptio, et uides eum circiter cubitum: tunc in illo est mors infirmi.	 If the corruption goes through about the elbow: then there is death for the weak man (patient).
Et administrare praeter illud ex curatione, est quantitas uirtus.	 And what is given beyond that for treatment, is the amount of virtue.
Et similiter fac de pede, quando inuadit corruptio in digito, tunc incide ipsum apud unum nodorum: et si capit in pectine pedis, tunc incide pedem totum.	 And likewise do the same with the foot, when the corruption invades the toe; then cut it at one of the joints (toes); and if it reaches the front part of the foot, then cut off the whole foot.
Si autem ascendit ad genu, tunc incide crus apud iuncturam genu.	 And if it goes up to the knee, then cut the leg at the joint of the knee.
Quod si corruptio iam peruenit supra genu, tunc non est in ea ingenium, nisi dimissio, et relinquere infirmum morti.	 But if the corruption has already come above the knee, then there is no skill (remedy) in it, except to release and abandon the weak man to death.
Et modus incidendi membrum, aut serrandi ipsum est, ut stringas ligamentum in inferiori, quem uis incidere: et stringe ligamentum aliud supra locum.	 And the method of cutting (amputating) a member or binding it is that you tighten the ligament below the place where you wish to cut and tighten another ligament above.
Et extendat minister ligamentum unum ad inferiora: et extendat minister aliud ligamentum superius ad sursum.	 And extend one minister (attendant) to below, and extend another attendant ligament upward.
Et tu separa carnem quae est inter duo ligamenta, cum Spatumili lato, donec detegatur caro tota.	 You separate the flesh that is between two ligaments with a broad spatula until the whole flesh is exposed.
Deinde incidatur, aut serretur.	 Then it is cut or bound (amputated).
Et oportet, ut ponas ab omnibus partibus pannum lini, et non tangat Serra locum sanum: et accidat infirmo laesio addita, et apostema calidum.	 And it is necessary that you put a linen cloth on all sides (the wound), and the saw must not touch healthy parts; and the weak man suffers additional injury, and hot abscess.
Si autem accidat fluxus sanguinis interius dum operaris, tunc cauteriza locum uelociter: aut pone super ipsum quosdam pulueres abscindentes sanguinem.	 And if there is bleeding internally while you are working, then quickly cauterize the place or put some absorbing powders on it to stop the bleeding.
Deinde redi ad medicationem tuam, donec compleatur.	 Then return to your treatment until it is complete.
Deinde liga membrum uulneratum cum ligamento conueniente ei, et cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	 Then bind the wounded limb with an appropriate ligament and care for it until it heals.
Et ego narro tibi quod accidit uiro in pede suo, hoc idem accidens quod narro tibi.	 And I tell you what happens to a man in his foot; this is the same thing that I tell you (happens).
Quod est, quia accidit in pede suo nigredo, cum adustione quae assimilatur combustioni ignis: et corruptio illa in primis accidit in digito suo, donec coepit pedem totum.	What happens is that a blackening occurs in his foot due to a burning similar to fire combustion; and the corruption primarily begins with his toe until it affects the entire foot.
Properauit ergo uir ex seipso, postquam uidit corruptionem incidere in membro cum uehementia eius, quod inuenit ex dolore, et adustione eius: et incidit ipsum apud iuncturam, et sanatus est.	 He fell sick from himself, after observing that the corruption was happening in a limb with intense pain which he perceived from the pain, and due to his burning; and he wounded himself at the junction, and he was cured.
Et postquam praeteriit ei tempus longum, accidit ei illa eadem corruptio in digito manus suae indice.	 And after a long period of time had passed, the same corruption occurred in the index finger of his own hand.
Venit ergo ad me, et conatus sum recuperare illam superfluitatem cum eo quod posui super manum ex medicinis post mundificationem corporis eius: et non repercussa est superfluitas, et coepit incedere in digitum alium: donec coepit coruptio in manum.	 Therefore he came to me and I attempted to recover the loss with him by placing medicines over his hand after cleansing his body; but the loss was not recovered, and it started spreading to another finger until the corruption began affecting the whole hand.
Vocauit ergo me, ad incidendum manum eius: et nolui illud, sperans ex me super repercussionem illius superfluitatis: et timui etiam super ipsum apud incisionem manus eius mortem.	 He then called for me to cut off his hand; but I refused, hoping for a recovery of the loss from my side; and I also feared death due to the cutting of his hand.
Quoniam uirtus uiri erat super casum.	 Because the man's strength was above his fall.
Postquam ergo desperauit de me, reuersus est ad terram suam: et peruenit ad me de eo, quia properauit, et incidit manum suam totam: et sanatus est.	 And when he had given up hope on me, he returned to his own land; but then he came back to me because he fell sick and cut off his whole hand; and he was cured.
Et non attuli hanc narrationem, nisi ut sit adiutorium super illud quod cadit de genere huius aegritudinis: et ut sit significatio qua significetur, et secundum quam agatur.	 I did not bring this narrative except as help for that which falls under the type of this illness; and as a signification to indicate how it should be handled.
¶ De cura Sinuum, et qualitate clisterizationis cum medicinis.	 Section on the care of sinuses, and the quality of purgatives with medicines.
Caput XC.	 Chapter XC.
Quando accidit apostema in quibusdam membris carnosis, et prolongatur spacium apostematis, donec collectionem facit saniei: deinde rumpitur, aut perforatur, et egreditur quod in eo est ex sanie, et remanet locus uacuus quasi sit uas: et cutis quae est super ipsum sicut pannus qui iam subtiliatus est: et non peruenit ad ultimum in corruptione sua, neque imprimit in os, neque in neruum, neque in ligamentum: meretur ut nominetur Sinus: et non nominatur Fistula: uerumtamen si prolongatur spacium eius, donec imprimat corruptio in aliquid horum membrorum, tunc nominatur Fistula, aut zuken.	 When an apostema occurs in some fleshy parts and the length of the apostema continues until it causes collection of pus; then it bursts or is perforated, and what is inside it exits through the pus, leaving a vacant place as if it were a vessel; and the skin that is over it becomes thin like a cloth that has been woven; and it does not come to an end in its corruption, nor press on the bone, nor the nerve, nor the ligament; it deserves to be named Sinus; and it is not called Fistula; however if the length of it continues until the corruption affects one of these organs, then it is called Fistula or ulcer.
Et cura eius est, ut incidas illam cutem totam sicut reuoluitur: et praecipue quando subtiliata est, et facta sicut pannus: et confidis quia non aaehaeret cum loco, propter corruptionem suam.	 The care of it is that you should cut the entire skin as rolled [over]; and especially when it has been finely minced and made like cloth; and trust that it will not adhere to the place because of its corruption.
Si autem speras quod adhaereat cutis, et non consequitur ex eo corruptio illa ultima consecutione: et si in cute est spissitudo ex carne, tunc cura ipsum cum Clisteri: et est, ut consideres ad Sinum.	 If you expect the skin to stick, and this does not follow from its corruption: and if there is a thickening of the flesh in the skin, then care for it with Clisterium: and it is that you should consider towards the Sinew.
Tunc si est magnus, et pus quod emittitur ex eo est foetidi odoris: tunc clisteriza ipsum cum medicamine aegyptio, quod est aceti, et olei, et ziniar, partes recipiens aequales, aggregentur in uase: et decoquantur super ignem, donec rubeat medicamen: et ueniat in spissitudinem mellis.	 Then if it is large and there is pus that is emitted from it which has a foul smell: then clisterize it with the Egyptian medicine, which is vinegar, oil, and honey, parts receiving equal amounts, to be mixed in a vessel: and boil it over fire until the medicine turns red: and may it become of the consistency of honey.
Deinde accipe ex eo quod tibi necesse est: et dissolue ipsum cum aqua et melle, et clisteriza cum eo Sinum: et stringe orificium eius, et dimitte medicinam in eo ad quantitatem duarum horarum.	 Then take from it what is necessary for you: and dissolve it with water and honey, and clisterize the Sinew with it: and tie up its opening, and let the medicine remain in it for the amount of two hours.
Deinde extrahe ipsum cum expressione: fac illud diebus tot, donec mundificetur Sinus, et remoueatur foetor.	 Then extract it with pressure: do this for days until the Sinew is purified and the foul smell is removed.
Et quandoque clisterizatur cum aqua cineris, quando non est tibi praesens hoc medicamen: et est, ut accipias cinerem lignorum uitis, aut cinerem ex lignis ilicis: et proiicias super eam aquam.	 And sometimes it is clisterized with water and ashes when this medicine is not present for you: and it is that you should take ashes of vine wood, or ashes from oak trees: and throw water upon it.
Deinde cola eam, et clisteriza cum ea, donec confidas quod Sinus iam ablutus est.	 Then boil it, and clisterize with it until you are confident that the Sinew has been washed clean.
Quod si infirmo non est tolerantia super medicamen aegyptium, neque aquam cineris, tunc clisteriza ipsum cum aqua et melle, cui iam permixtum est aliquid ex ziniar contrito.	 If the weak patient is not able to tolerate the Egyptian medicine or water and ashes, then clisterize it with water and honey, into which something of crushed honey has already been mixed.
Aut clisteriza ipsum cum melle et uino permixtis, quoniam de proprietate mellis est, ut mundificet, et abluat: et uinum facit adhaerere Sinum, praecipue quando in uino est superfluitas stipticitatis et siccitatis.	 Or clisterize it with honey and wine mixed, since the property of honey is to purify and wash: and wine makes the Sinew stick, especially when there is an excess of stiffness and dryness in the wine.
Cum facis illud aliquotiens, et confidis quod Sinus corruptio iam remota est: tunc clisteriza ipsum cum eo quod facit nasci carnem in eo.	 Whenever you perform that [procedure], and believe that the corruption of the sinus has already been removed: then purge it with an enema, together with what causes flesh to grow therein.
Et est, ut accipias ex emplastro dyafinicon: et dissoluas ipsum cum oleo rosato, et uino stiptico: aut clisteriza ipsum cum quibusdam medicinis, et unguentis aliis, quorum proprietates scripsi in tractatu unguentorum.	 And [it is] to receive from the plaster dyafinicon, and to dissolve it with rose oil and stiptic wine, or to purge it with certain medicines and other ointments, whose properties I have written about in the treatise on ointments.
Quod si orificium Sinus est strictum, in quo non capit cannula clisteris: tunc amplifica ipsum cum ferro parumper: aut pone in ipso licinium inuolutum in unguento aegyptio, aut in unguento basilicon, donec amplificetur.	 If the opening of the sinus is narrow, and the enema cannot enter through it: then enlarge it slightly with an iron; or place linen wrapped in Egyptian ointment, or Basilicon ointment inside until it becomes wider.
Et similiter si est orificium etiam amplum, tunc aggrega labia eius cum sutura: et dimitte ex eo quantitatem in quam ingrediatur clistere sine additione.	 And similarly, if the opening is also wide, then gather its lips with a suture; and allow the enema to enter the quantity to which it can enter without being added to.
Et similiter si orificium eius ex quo currit pus, est eleuatum ad superiora: tunc seca ipsum in depressiori loco qui est in ipso, ut currat ex eo pus usque inferius: quoniam pus quando coartatur in profunditate Sinus, prohibet carnem generari in eo.	 And similarly, if the opening from which pus flows is elevated above: then cut it at a lower location that is within it, so that the pus may run out below; because when pus becomes obstructed in the depth of the sinus, it prevents flesh from being generated therein.
Quod si non est tibi possibile secare Sinum circiter inferius eius secundum quod uis: tunc conare, ut praepares membrum praeparatione qua currat ex eo pus cum facilitate secundum quod praeparatur tibi.	 If it is not possible for you to cut the sinus near its base as you wish: then try to prepare a limb in such a way that the pus can run out from there with ease, according to how it is prepared for you.
Conare, ut non retineatur in eo aliquid ex pus omnino: et accipe medicinas consolidatiuas quae ponuntur super signum, conuenientes ad illud quod uis.	 Try not to retain anything of the pus whatsoever within it; and receive consolidating medicines that are applied to the mark, suitable for what you wish.
Et extende eas super pannum lini.	 Spread them out on a linen cloth.
Et sit pannus tantae quantitatis, qua fiat communicatio totius Sinus.	 And let the cloth be of such size that there is communication with the entire sinus.
Deinde incide cum forficibus in directo orificii Sinus foramen, amplius orificio Sinus parumper.	 Then make an incision with forceps in a straight line on the opening of the sinus, larger than the opening of the sinus itself.
Deinde extende ex unguentis lenibus super pannum alium, secundum quantitatem foraminis: et pone eum super ipsum positione longinqua ab orificio Sinus, ut alleuietur exitus pus ex eo: et non auferas pannum magnum, nisi post dies aliquos uice una.	 Then extend from soft unguents on a different cloth, according to the size of the hole: and place it over it with long distance from the orifice Sinus, so that the discharge of pus from it is relieved: and do not remove the large cloth, unless after several days instead.
Ille autem qui est super orificium Sinus, est ille quem remoues in omni hora, ut egrediatur quod aggregatur in eo ex pus: et ut scias, an illud quod currit ex eo uirus, est multum, aut parum: aut digestum, aut indigestum.	 The one who is over the orifice of Sinus, that is the one you should remove at every hour, so that what accumulates in it due to pus may come out: and so that you know whether what is flowing from it is much, little, digested, or undigested.
Et cum hoc iterum considera locum Sinus ipsius, an in ipso sentiat dominus eius dolorem, aut non sit in eo dolor, et an sit in eo apostema, aut non sit in eo apostema.	 And when you have again examined the place of Sinus itself, whether it feels pain to its master or not, and whether there is pain in it, and if there is an abscess in it, or not.
Cum ergo protenditur medicatio tua taliter, et uides materiam quae egreditur super orificium Sinus, tunc scias, quod Sinus iam adhaeret, aut approximat adhaerentiae: tunc ergo solue ipsum in mane, aut in tertio die: et quando soluis uulnus, tunc permuta pannum alium, et renoua unguentum.	 When therefore your treatment is so extended, and you see the matter which comes out on the orifice of Sinus, then you will know that Sinus has already adhered or approaches adhesion: then soluble it in the morning, or in the third day: and when you dissolve the wound, then change the cloth, and renew the unguent.
Si autem egreditur ex Sinu post spacium longum uirus subtile, tunc non desperes de adhaerentia eius, nam sanatio eius appropinquat, quoniam ex hominibus sunt qui tardant generationem carnis in uulneribus suis, et ex eis sunt qui agunt econtrario illius.	 If however pus flows out of Sinus after a long time, then do not despair of its adhesion, for healing is approaching, since there are people who delay the generation of flesh in their wounds, and from them there are those who act contrary to this.
Si autem egreditur ex Sinu post dies multos pus indigestum, tunc scias quod sinus non adhaeret.	 If however pus flows out of Sinus for many days undigested, then you will know that Sinus is not adhering.
Si ergo tardatur adhaerentia Sinus, et prolongatur res eius: tunc adde in exiccatione medicinarum, uerum faciant medici, ut sint medicinae in substantia sua humidae, et in uirtute sua siccae: sicut unguentum dyafinicon, quando additur in eo superfluitas additionis ex zegi.	 If therefore adhesion of Sinus is delayed and prolonged: then increase in the drying treatment, but let the physicians make sure that the medicines are moist in substance and dry in effectiveness, like unguentum dyafinicon, when excess addition from zegi is added to it.
Et ex magis ultimo quo curatur, est, ut accipias unguentum dyafinicon, et soluatur cum oleo rosato, et roretur super ipsum uinum antiquum aequale in substantia sua.	 And from the last (step) which is treated, it is, that you receive an ointment called dyafinicon, and it should be dissolved with rose oil, and it should be rubbed over it an equal amount of ancient wine in substance.
Deinde confice ipsum cum eo, et utere ipso.	 Then mix (it) with that, and use (it).
Et iam facit simile huic actioni, quando non est tibi praesens unguentum dyafinicon, mel, quando decoquis ipsum, donec ingrossetur, et uteris eo.	 And now it makes a similar action when you do not have the ointment dyafinicon, honey, when you cook it until it thickens, and you use it.
Aut accipe myrrham, et aloen, et olibanum: tere totum, et pulueriza illud super mel dum est super ignem.	 Or receive myrrh, aloe, and frankincense: grind everything, and powder it over honey while it is over the fire.
Deinde line super ipsum pannum, et stringe ipsum super Sinum: et line cum melle quod decoquisti, donec ingrossatum est: et pulueriza super ipsum species, et pone super ipsum pannum, et stringe eum.	 Then spread linen over it (the wound), and sew it over a bladder: and spread the honey that you cooked, until it thickens, and powder its species, and put it over the linen, and sew it.
Et quandoque administratur in illo aristolochia longa, et radices lilii coelestis, et est lilium: et farina herbi, et centaurea.	 And at times aristolochia longa, the roots of celestial lily, and its bulb are administered in that (situation), and wheat flour, and centaury.
Utere eis simplicibus, aut aggregatis, tere ea, et cribella ipsa: et pulueriza super mel quod narraui, et utere eo.	 Use them (the simple ingredients or the combined ones), grind them, and sift them: and powder it over the honey that I mentioned, and use it.
Quod si prolongatur res Sinus, et non sanatur hac curatione: tunc scias, quod in profundo eius est corruptio: aut iam facit impressionem in ossibus, aut in reliquis membris duris, aut ligamentis: tunc cura ipsum curatione Fistularum, secundum quod praemissum est.	 If this (the bladder) prolongs and is not cured by this treatment: then you know that there is corruption in its depth; or it makes an impression on the bones, or on the hard members, or ligaments: then cure it with fistula treatment, according to what was mentioned earlier.
¶ De cura Panaritii et unguis attritae, et incisione digiti additi, et sectione.	¶ On the care of paronychia and eroded nail, and incision of the finger added, and amputation.
Caput XCI.	 Chapter XCI.
Panaritium est apostema quod nascitur sub ungue pollicis manus, aut pedis: et fortasse nascitur in reliquis digitis.	 Panaritium is an abscess that arises under the nail of the thumb of the hand, or foot; and perhaps it arises in other fingers.
Cum ergo prolongatur res eius, et negligitur curato eius, et apostematur apostemate calido: aut corrumpitur, et emittit pus, donec corrodit radicem unguis: et fortasse corrumpit eam totam, et fortasse peruenit corruptio ad os, donec est ei odor foetidus: et fit extremitas digiti lata, et fit color eius fuscus.	 When this (the abscess) prolongs and is neglected in its treatment, and it is opened with a hot incision: or it ruptures and releases pus, until it corrodes the root of the nail: and perhaps it ruptures it completely, and perhaps the corruption reaches the bone, until there is a foetid smell: and the tip of the finger becomes broad, and its color becomes dark.
Quando ergo tu curas ipsum, cum eo quod diximus in diuisione, et non confert curatio tua: tunc oportet ut incidas cum ferro totam superfluitatem quae remansit ex ungue.	 When therefore you treat it (the nail), with what we said concerning division, and your treatment does not improve it: then it is necessary that you cut with iron the entire superfluity which remains from the nail.
Deinde cauteriza uulnus post illud.	 Then cauterize the wound after that.
Cauterium enim iuuatiuum est ualde.	 For cautery is very helpful (or beneficial).
Si uero os est sanum, et est unguis etiam sana, et additiones uacuae unguis iam comprimunt carnem ad interiora, et incipiunt pungere ipsam, et laedunt eam: tunc oportet ut ponas Radium subtilem sub angulo unguis quae pungit carnem, et impelle eam sursum: et incide eam carnem cum facilitate, et pone super illud quod remanet de carne ex medicinis comburentibus, corrosiuis, donec remoueatur totum eius.	 If however the bone is healthy and the nail also is healthy, and empty additions of the nail already press the flesh towards the interior, and begin to prick it and wound it: then it is necessary that you place subtle radium under the angle of the nail which wounds the flesh, and push it up: and cut the flesh with ease, and place on top of what remains of the flesh from medicines which burn, corrosives, until it is completely removed.
Deinde cura illud cum unguentis, donec sanetur.	 Then treat that with ointments, until it heals.
Si autem corruptio iam imprimit in os, tunc oportet ut incidas illud os, et extrahas ipsum: non enim sanatur unquam dum permanet in eo os corruptum.	 If however the corruption already presses on the bone, then it is necessary that you cut that bone and remove it: for it will never heal as long as a corrupted bone remains in it.
Quod si uides corrosionem et corruptionem incedere in digitum, tunc incide eum in uno nodorum, secundum quod praemissa est eius rememoratio.	 If you see corrosion and corruption creeping towards the finger, then cut it off at a joint, according to what was mentioned regarding its remembrance.
Deinde cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	 Then treat that, until it heals.
Si autem accidat ungui attritio, aut percussio: et contingit in ea dolor uehemens, tunc oportet ut phlebotomes infirmum in primis.	 If however the nail is rubbed or hit, and pain occurs which is very strong, then it is necessary that you use a leech first.
Deinde seca unguem cum Spatumili acuto sectione transuersa de sursum ad uisum.	 Then cut the nail with a sharp spatula cut from above to below.
Et custodi, ne sectio perueniat ad carnem quae est sub ungue, nam tu facies accidere per illud super infirmum dolorem uehementem, et erit caussa ad natiuitatem carnis additae in loco.	 And be careful that the cut does not reach the flesh which is under the nail, for you will cause severe pain to occur below it, and this will be a cause of the addition of new flesh in the place.
Deinde cura locum cum eo quod sedat dolores.	 Then treat the place with what soothes the pains.
Digitus uero additus qui nascitur in quibusdam manibus hominum, fortasse est carnosus totus: et fortasse sunt in quibusdam eorum ossa, et fortasse est in eo unguis: et quidam eorum nascitur in radice iuncturae, aut est natiuitas eius in quibusdam nodis digiti.	 The finger which is born in some human hands, perhaps it is entirely of flesh: and perhaps there are bones in some of them, and perhaps there is a nail in it: and some of them are born at the joint of the root, or the birthplace of one of them is in some of the joints of the finger.
Ille ergo qui nascitur in quibusdam nodis digiti, non mouetur: et ille qui nascitur apud iuncturam digiti, fortasse mouetur.	 The one who is born with knots on a finger, does not move; and the one who is born at the juncture of a finger, perhaps moves.
Eius ergo qui ex eis est carnosus, sectio eius facilis est.	 Therefore, for the fleshy part that is among them, its incision is easy.
Quod est, ut incidas ipsum apud radicem suam cum Spatumili lato.	 It is, to cut it at the root with a wide spatula.
Eius autem cuius natiuitas est in radice iuncturae curatio, est difficilis.	 The cure for one who is born at the juncture of the root is difficult.
Abstine ergo ab incisione eius.	 Therefore, refrain from cutting it.
In illo uero qui nascitur in digito apud ultimum nodorum, tunc oportet ut incidas in primis carnem eius incisione rotunda usque ad os.	 But concerning the one who is born on a finger at the end of the knots, then you should first cut through its flesh with a round incision to the bone.
Deinde serra os cum una illarum Serrarum conuenientium ad illud.	 Then saw the bone with one of those saws suitable for that.
Deinde cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	 Then care for it until it heals.
Consolidatio autem quae accidit digitis adinuicem, multotiens accidit aut ex natiuitate hominis, id est, nascitur cum eo, aut a consolidatione uulneris, aut combustione ignis, et similibus.	 Consolidation however that occurs in fingers, often happens either from the birth of a man, that is, being born with it, or from consolidation of a wound, or burn of fire, and similar conditions.
Oportet ergo ut seces illam consolidationem, donec redeant digiti secundum formam suam naturalem.	 Therefore, it is necessary to cut off the consolidation, until the fingers return to their natural shape.
Deinde pone inter eos licinia, aut pannos infusos in oleo rosato: ut non consolidentur uelociter, et separa inter eos: aut pone inter eos laminam plumbi subtilem, donec consolidetur locus secundum quod oportet.	 Then place linen or cloth soaked in rose oil between them to prevent consolidation quickly and separate them; or place a thin lead plate between them until the location consolidates according to what is necessary.
Et similiter si accidat consolidatio quibusdam digitis cum palma, tunc seca illam consolidationem, secundum quod praeparatur et conuenit figurae membri.	 And similarly, if consolidation occurs in some fingers with the palm, then cut off the consolidation according to what is prepared and suitable for the shape of the member.
¶ De incisione Vitium.	 Chapter on Incision Defects.
Caput XCII.	 Chapter CXII.
Uites sunt Venae inuolutae, grossae, plenae superfluitatibus melancholicis quae accidunt in pluribus membris corporis: et plurimum euentus earum est in cruribus, praecipue in cruribus iter agentium et laborantium, et portantium.	 Chapter XCII. Uites are swollen veins, large, full of melancholic excesses that occur in many parts of the body; and their most frequent occurrence is in the legs, especially in those traveling or working, and in carriers.
Oportet ergo ut administres excussionem corporis ex cholera nigra aliquotiens excussione forti.	 It is necessary that you administer the incision of the body from black cholera several times with a strong incision.
Deinde phlebotoma patientis eas basilicam.	 Then, let the patient's vein be opened (phlebotomized) with the basilica vein.
Curatio uero earum cum ferro, est secundum duos modos.	 The treatment of these (wounds or conditions), with iron, is according to two methods.
Vnus eorum est, ut secentur, et extrahatur sanguis niger.	 One method is that they are opened and black blood is drawn out.
Et modus alter est, ut eleuetur Vena, et extrahatur tota.	 A different method is, to elevate the Vein and extract it completely.
Sectio uero eius est secundum hunc modum.	 The incision of this (vein) is in accordance with this method.
Embroca crus in primis cum aqua calida multum, donec resoluatur sanguis grossus faeculentus.	 Pour a plentiful amount of warm water on the leg first, until the thick and foul blood is dissolved.
Deinde stringe crus infirmi a superiori parte coxae eius, usque ad inferiorem partem genu cum uitta.	 Then bind the weakened leg from its upper part of the hip, down to its lower part of the thigh with a bandage.
Deinde seca uenam in loco uno, aut duobus, aut tribus sectione ampla.	 Then cut the vein at one, or two, or three wide sections.
Deinde eleua, id est, extrahe sanguinem in manu tua ab inferiori parte cruris, usque ad sursum, et a superiori oportet ut phlebotomes infirmum in primis.	 Then draw blood, that is, extract blood with your hand from the lower part of the leg upwards, and it is necessary that a phlebotomist treats the weakened first.
Deinde seca unguem cum usque inferius: donec egrediatur ex sanguine quantitas quam uides sufficere, et quam tolerat uirtus infirmi.	 Then cut the nail down to its base until you see a quantity of blood that seems sufficient and that the strength of the weakened person can bear.
Postea liga eam: et praecipe ei, ut abstineat a cibis generantibus choleram nigram: et itera euacuationem et phlebotomiam, quando implentur Venae, et nocet illud infirmo.	 Then tie it up and order him to abstain from foods producing black bile; and repeat the purges and bloodletting when the veins are full, for that will harm the weakened one.
Eleuatio autem eius est secundum hunc modum.	 The bleeding of this kind is as follows:
Rade crus infirmi, si in ea sunt pili multi.	 Shave the leg of the sick one, if there are many hairs on it.
Deinde intromitte ipsum in balneum: aut embroca ipsum in crure eius cum aqua calida, donec rubeat, et exuberentur Venae: aut exercitetur exercitio forti, si non est ei praesens balneum, donec calefiat membrum.	 Then introduce him into the bath: or plunge him in his leg with hot water until it turns red and veins appear; or exercise with strong movement, if there is no bath present, until the limb warms up.
Deinde seca cutem in directo uenae sectione per longitudinem: aut in ultimo eius apud genu, aut in inferiori parte eius apud calcaneum.	 Then cut the skin along the vein in a straight line: or at the end of it near the knee, or at the lower part near the heel.
Deinde aperi cutem cum uncinis, et excoria uenam ab omni parte, donec appareat sensui: et est apud apparitionem eius, quod uides eam rubeam ad nigredinem decliuem.	 Then open the skin with scissors and scrape off the vein from every side until it is felt: and at its appearance, what you see will turn from red to darker shades.
Cum ergo uadit ex cute, uides eam albam quasi sit chorda.	 When it reaches the skin, you see it white like a cord.
Deinde intromitte sub ea Radium, donec quando eleuatur et egreditur de cute: suspende eam cum uncino caeco, leni.	 Then insert the lancet beneath it until it rises and comes out of the skin: hang it with a blunt scissor.
Deinde seca sectionem aliam prope illam sectionem tribus digitis.	 Then make another incision near that incision with three fingers.
Deinde excoria cutem a superiori parte uenae, donec appareat.	 Then scrape the skin from the upper side of the vein until it appears.
Deinde eleua eam cum Radiis sicut fecisti, et suspende eam cum uncino alio, sicut fecisti in primis.	 Then lift it with lancets as you did before, and hang it with another scissor as you did at first.
Deinde seca sectionem aliam, aut sectiones plures, si indiges illo.	 Then make another incision or multiple incisions if needed for that purpose.
Deinde eleua, et incide ipsam ultima sectione apud calcaneum.	 Then scrape it and make the last incision at the heel.
Deinde extrahe eam ad sectionem quae est supra eam.	 Then pull out the vein to the incision that is above it.
Et fac illud, donec extrahas eam ex sectione quae est superior, uel altior sectionibus omnibus, donec quando egreditur tota: tunc incide eam.	 And do this until you have pulled out the vein from the above incision or all the incisions, until it comes out completely; then cut it.
Si autem non obedit tibi ad extrahendum, et eleuandum: tunc intromitte acum cum filo forti duplo, et liga eam, et extrahe ipsam: aut intromitte sub ea Radium: et reuolue manum tuam ad omnem partem, donec egrediatur.	 If it does not obey you to pull it out and lift it: then insert the sharp awl with a strong thread and tie it, and pull it out; or insert the lancet beneath it: and move your hand in every direction until it comes out.
Et caue, ne incidatur.	 And avoid cutting (it).
Nam si incidatur, fit difficile tibi eleuare eam ualde, et ingreditur super infirmum ex ea nocumentum.	 If it is cut, it becomes very difficult for you to drain it, and harm occurs to the patient from it.
Cum ergo extraxeris eam totam: tunc pone super locum uulnerum lanam submersam in uino et oleo rosato, aut oleo: et cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	 When you remove it entirely, then place a wool soaked in wine and rose oil, or oil, over the wound site and care for (it) until it heals.
Quod si Vitis est contracta, habens tortuositatem cui sit inuolutio ad partes, et non est sicut diximus secundum rectitudinem: tunc oportet ut findas super eam ad omnem partem tortuositatis eius, et loca inuolutionis ipsius.	 If it is a vein that is contracted, having a curvature with coiling in parts, and not as we have said according to straightness: then it is necessary for you to make an incision over all its curvatures, and the places of its coiling.
Deinde suspende eam cum uncinis, donec eleues eam totam: et caue apud sectionem tuam super eam ne incidas uenam, aut uulneres: nam difficile fiet super te eleuare, uel extrahere eam.	 Then suspend it with forceps until you drain it entirely: and avoid cutting the vein or wounding (it) at your incision; for it will be difficult for you to drain or extract it.
Conserua ergo prudentiam tuam.	 Therefore, conserve your caution.
Forma Incidentis quo sanatur Vitis.	 The form of the incision that heals a vein.
Forma Vncini caeci.	 The form of the incision for a blind vein.
Non est ei curuitas sicut reliquis Vncinis, neque est acutae extremitatis, ut non uulneret uenam: et est grossae flectuositatis, lenis: quoniam si esset subtilis, incideret uenam subtilitate sua: imo sit ei superflua grossitudo, sicut diximus.	 It is not its coarseness like the other veins, nor is it sharp at the ends to harm the vein; and it is of a curved thickness, but lenient; because if it were subtle, the vein would be cut by its subtlety; on the contrary, let it have excessive thickness, as we said.
De extractione Venae cruris.	 On the extraction of the leg vein.
Caput XCIII.	 Chapter XCIII.
Haec Vena generatur in cruribus in terris calidis, sicut Alizegi, et terra Arabum, et in terris aridis, calidis, paucae teneritatis, id est, in quibus non nascitur herba, neque arbor.	 This vein is generated in the legs of hot lands, as Alizegi (says), and the land of Arabs, and in dry, hot lands with little softness, that is, where no grass grows nor trees.
Et fortasse generatur in locis aliis corporis praeter crura.	 And perhaps it is generated in other parts of the body besides the legs.
Et generatio quidem eius est a putrefactione quae accidit sub cute, sicut accidunt intra corpora serpentes et uermes ascarides, et uermes generati inter cutem et carnem.	 Its generation is certainly from the putrefaction that occurs under the skin, as happens within the bodies of snakes and intestinal worms, and worms generated between the skin and flesh.
Et signum incaeptionis euentus huius Venae est, quod accidit in crure inflammatio uehemens.	 The sign of the commencement of this Vein's course is that it happens with a vehement inflammation in the leg.
Deinde uesicatur locus.	 Then, the area is excavated.
Deinde incipit Vena exire ex loco illius uesicationis, quasi sit radix plantae, aut animal.	 Then, the vein begins to emerge from the place of that excavation, as if it were the root of a tree or an animal.
Cum ergo apparet ex ea extremitas eius, tunc oportet ut inuoluas super ipsam frustum plumbi, cuius pondus sit ex drachma keil, usque ad drachmas II et noda ipsam: et dimitte plumbum suspensum ex crure.	 When its end appears from there, then it is necessary to roll over the lead on top of it, whose weight should be one keil of a drachma, until two drachms and a node; and let the suspended lead go from the leg.
Quotiens ergo egreditur ex ea aliquid ad exteriora, inuolue illud in plumbo, et noda illud.	 Whenever something comes out of it to the outside, roll that over in lead and tie it.
Quod si prolongatur multum, tunc incide partem eius, et inuolue residuum.	 If it extends greatly, then cut off a part of it, and roll over the rest.
Et non incidas eam radicitus antequam egrediatur tota.	 And do not cut it off by its root before it has come out entirely.
Quoniam si incidis, contrahitur, et ingreditur in carnem: et facit accidere apostema, et putredinem in loco, et ulcus malum.	 Because if you cut it off, it contracts and goes into the flesh; it causes an abscess to appear, and pus and a bad ulcer at the place.
Quapropter oportet, ut suauiter tractetur, et extrahatur paulatim, donec egrediatur ex ultimo sui, et non remaneat ex ea aliquid in corpore: et ex hac quidem Vena egreditur in quibusdam hominibus quod est in longitudine sua quinque palmorum et decem.	 Therefore, it should be treated gently and pulled out gradually until it comes out entirely, and nothing remains of it in the body; and from this vein, in some people, there comes out something that is five fingers long and ten.
Et iam peruenit ad me, quia exiuit uiro ex XX palmis.	 And now it has come to me, because a man of twenty fingers has come out of it.
Si autem inciditur tibi in hora medicationis tuae: tunc intromitte radium in foramine eius, et perfora eam foramine longo, cum corpore, donec euacuetur totum quod est in ea ex materia: et administra putrefactionem loci cum medicinis diebus aliquot.	 If it is cut during your treatment, then insert a ray into its hole and perforate it with a long hole as the body goes out until everything that is inside it from matter comes out; and apply the putrefaction of the place with medicines for some days.
Deinde cura ipsum curatione apostematum.	 Then, treat it with the treatment of abscesses.
Et haec quidem Vena quandoque habet ramos multos, praecipue quando apparet in iunctura pedis, aut in pede ipso: et accidunt ei orificia multa, et egreditur ex omni orificio ramus.	 And this vein sometimes has many branches, especially when it appears at the junction of the foot, or even in the foot itself; and there are many openings for it, and a branch comes out from every opening.
Cura ergo ipsam, sicut diximus in diuisione, et cum eo quod praemissum est.	 Treat it accordingly, as we said in the division, and with what was previously mentioned.
¶ De sectione super Vermes generatos sub cute, et dicitur Aegritudo bouina.	 On the section of worms generated beneath the skin, and it is called Bouina disease.
Caput XCIIII.	 Chapter XCIV.
Haec Aegritudo nominatur in quadam terra apud nos Aegritudo bouina: propterea, quia multotiens accidit bouibus, et est uermis paruus unus, qui nascitur inter cutem et carnem.	 This disease is called Bouina disease in a certain land among us: because it often occurs to cows, and there is a small worm that is born between the skin and the flesh.
Et uadit in corpore toto, ascendendo et descendendo: et ostenditur sensui apud ambulationem eius de membro ad membrum, donec disrumpit ubicumque disrumpit in cute locum, et egreditur.	 It moves throughout the entire body, ascending and descending; and it is felt by the senses during its movement from limb to limb until it bursts at any point where it bursts on the skin and comes out.
Et generatio eius est ex putredine quorundam humorum.	 And its generation is from the decay of certain fluids.
Sicut accidunt uermes et serpentes, id est, lumbrici, et ascarides in uentre.	 As worms and snakes, that is, earthworms and roundworms occur in the belly.
Et timetur ex malicia eius.	 It is feared from its mischief.
Quia quando ipse uadit in corpore, et eleuatur ad caput, et peruenit ad locum: tunc fortasse aperit in eo, et egreditur, et destruit oculum: et accidit illud multotiens.	 Because when it moves within the body and rises to the head, and arrives at a place; then perhaps it opens there and comes out, and destroys an eye; and this often happens.
Cum ergo uis curare eum, et extrahere ipsum, tunc non fit illud nisi apud ambulationem eius, et apparitionem ipsius sensui.	 Therefore, when one wishes to cure it and extract it, this is not done except during its movement and appearance to the senses.
Oportet ergo, ut stringas quod est supra eum, et quod est sub eo cum ligamento constrictione forti.	 It is necessary therefore that you tighten what is above it, and what is below it with a strong binding.
Deinde seca super ipsum, et extrahe eum.	 Then cut above it, and extract it.
Quod si profundatur in carne, et non inuenis ipsum: tunc pone super locum cauterium cum igne, donec moriatur.	 If it sinks into the flesh and you do not find it; then place a cautery on the place with fire until it dies.
Et maius quod timetur, est corruptio eius, qua corrumpit oculum, sicut diximus.	 And the greater danger is its corruption, which destroys an eye, as we said.
Si autem uides eum iam peruenisse in capite prope oculum, tunc stringe sub eo supercilium strictura bona.	 If you see it has already reached the head near the eye; then tighten under it with a good forehead binding.
Deinde seca super ipsum, et extrahe eum.	 Then cut above it, and extract it.
Et oportet ut utatur infirmus mundificatione sui corporis, cum medicinis soluentibus humores putridos malos.	 The sick person should use mundification (cleansing) of his body with medications dissolving bad and corrupt humors.
Et caueat sibi a cibis generantibus putrefactionem.	 Let him avoid foods causing putrefaction.
¶ De sectione super aegritudinem Nakir.	 Chapter on surgery concerning Nakir's disease.
Caput XCV.	 Chapter XCV (105).
Haec aegritudo nominatur in terra nostra Nakir: et est dolor qui accidit in quibusdam membris: deinde permutatur de membro ad membrum.	 This disease is called Nakir on our land: it is a pain that occurs in some members, then changes from one member to another.
Et ego quidem iam uidi ipsum, secundum quod narro tibi.	 And I myself have seen this, as I am telling you.
Vocatus sum ad mulierem infirmam in quibusdam uillis.	 I was called to a sick woman in some villages.
Et detexit brachium suum, et uidi inflationem paruam in uena funis brachii.	 And she uncovered her arm, and I saw a small swelling on the vein of the arm.
Et postquam remansi hora una, uidi unam inflationem incedere cum focili, sicut incedit uermis, ascendendo ad humerum eius uelocius quam esse potest: ut sit sicut argentum uiuum, quando currit de loco ad locum.	 After staying for an hour, I saw the swelling move with a worm-like motion, rapidly advancing to her shoulder, like quicksilver running from one place to another.
Recessit ergo dolor ex illo loco, et fixus est in humero.	 Therefore, the pain left that place and was fixed in her shoulder.
Deinde sedi hora una, et cucurrit in reliquum corpus, donec perueniret in brachium aliud.	 Then, it remained seated for an hour, and it ran through the rest of her body until it reached another arm.
Deinde narrauit mihi, quia reuoluebatur in toto corpore suo, secundum quod uidi.	 Then she told me that it turned around in her entire body, as I saw.
Miratus sum ergo de uelocitate permutationis eius de membro ad membrum.	 I was amazed at the swiftness of its change from one member to another.
Et ego quidem ante illud non uideram hanc aegritudinem oculis meis taliter secundum hunc modum.	 And I, before this incident, had not seen this disease appear in such a manner with my eyes.
Verumtamen uidi multos, qui inueniunt dolorem permutari de membro ad membrum: et non uidi ipsum oculis, sicut uidi eum in muliere.	 Nevertheless, I have seen many who find pain changing from one member to another; but I had not seen it as in the woman.
Et ego non cogito illud esse, nisi quod est propterea, quod mulier fuit ex illis qui sunt ex uillis sicci corporis detectarum uenarum: hinc ergo apparet sensui illa uentositas permutata.	 And I do not think that it was anything other than the fact that the woman was one of those in the dry villages with detected veins; hence, this shows that the feeling of putridity had changed.
Et est necesse, ut non appareant secundum hanc rationem in illis qui sunt deliciosi, et corporibus humidis, occultarum uenarum.	 It is necessary that, according to this reason, hidden veins do not appear in those who are delicate and in moist bodies.
Cum ergo uis curationem eius, et sentit patiens illud dolorem: tunc si est apparens tibi oculo, sicut diximus, tunc stringe supra ipsum, et sub ipso uelociter: et seca supra ipsum, donec egrediatur illa uentositas coartata: et cauteriza locum.	 When you have the intention of healing it and the patient feels that pain, then if it appears to you as we said, then press above it and quickly beneath it; cut above it until that windiness contracts; and cauterize the place.
Si autem non uides ipsum oculis tuis: tunc cura ipsum cum excussione corporis, et cum eo quod expellit uentositates, et carminat eas cum pillulis foetidis, et pillulis de serapino, et similibus.	 If you do not see it with your eyes: then treat it by pressing the body and what expels windiness, and crush them with fetid pills and pills of resin and similar things.
¶ De extractione Sagittarum.	 Chapter on the Extraction of Arrows.
Caput XCVI.	 Chapter XCVII (Chapter 97).
Sagittae diuersificantur secundum species suas, et secundum loca in quibus cadunt ex corpore.	 Arrows are diverse according to their kinds and the places where they fall on the body.
Earum uero diuersitas est: quoniam ex eis sunt quae habent cuspides magnos, et paruos: et concauae, et surdae.	 Their diversity is because there are some that have large tips and small ones; concave and blunt ones.
Et ex eis sunt quae habent tres angulos.	 And among them are those that have three corners.
Et ex eis quibus sunt linguae.	 And of those with tongues (barbed arrows).
Et ex eis quibus sunt astellae.	 And of those with stars (multi-pointed arrows).
Illae uero quae sunt secundum membra in quibus cadunt, est secundum duos modos.	 Those that are on the limbs where they fall, are according to two modes.
Aut enim membra sunt ex membris principalibus concauis, sicut cerebrum, et cor, et epar, et pulmo, et renes, et intestina, et uesica, et eis similia.	 Or limbs are from the main concave members such as brain, heart, liver, lung, kidneys, intestines, bladder and similar.
Quando ergo cadit in aliquo horum membrorum, et apparent tibi signa mortis, quae ego narro tibi post, tunc oportet ut deuites extractionem illius sagittae ex eis, nam mors consequitur illum in quo est, in pluribus dispositionibus.	 When it falls into one of these members and you see signs of death that I will tell you later, then it is necessary to devote the extraction of that arrow from them, for death follows it where it is, in many dispositions.
Et quando non apparent tibi ista signa mala, et sagitta non est absconsa in profunditate membri, tunc extrahe ipsam, et cura uulnus.	 And when those signs are not visible to you and the arrow is not hidden in the depth of the member, then extract it, and care for the wound.
Ex signis enim cerebri quando cadit in eo sagitta, et penetrat os, et egreditur siphac quod est super cerebrum, est: quoniam accidunt ex illo soda uehemens, et scotomia, et uertigo, et rubedo in oculis, et inflatio, et rubedo linguae, et spasmus, et permixtio intellectus, et uomitus cholerae.	 For the signs of the brain when an arrow falls into it and penetrates the bone and exits from what is above the brain are: because hot sweats occur from it, and blindness, and dizziness, and redness in the eyes, and swelling, and redness of the tongue, and spasm, and confusion of mind, and vomiting of cholera.
Et fortasse egreditur sanguis ex naribus, aut auribus.	 And perhaps blood comes out from the nose or ears.
Et fortasse abscinditur sermo, et destruitur uox.	 And perhaps speech is cut off, and voice destroyed.
Et egreditur ex loco uulneris humiditas alba similis pulti.	 And there comes out from the wound place whiteness like plaster.
Et exit ex eo simile aquositati carnis.	 And it comes out similar to watery flesh.
Si ergo apparent tibi ista signa, tunc abstine a curatione, et extrahe sagittam si non egreditur.	 If those signs are visible to you, then refrain from treatment, and extract the arrow if it does not come out.
Signa autem sagittae quando cadit in corde, sunt: quod ipsa est prope mammillam sinistram: et sentit cum ea quasi ipsa sit fixa in re dura, non in re uacua.	 The signs of the arrow when it falls into the heart are: that it is near the left breast, and it feels as if it were fixed in a hard thing, not in a soft one.
Et fortasse sagittae est motus similis motui pulsus: et currit ex uulnere sanguis niger.	 And perhaps there is movement similar to pulse movement, and blood runs black from the wound.
Et sequitur illud frigus extremitatum, et sudor frigidus, et syncopis.	 And this follows coldness of limbs, cold sweat, and fainting.
Scias ergo, quod mors descendit procul dubio.	 Know therefore, that death clearly recedes.
Et signum sagittae quando uulnerat pulmonem, est exitus sanguinis spumosi ex uulnere: et uasa quae sequuntur collum, apostematur, et mutatur color infirmi.	 And the sign of an arrow when it wounds the lung is the issuance of frothy blood from the wound; and the vessels following the neck should be removed, and the color [of the patient] becomes weak.
Et expirat spiritum magnum, altum: et quaerit attractionem aeris frigidi.	 And it breathes out a great, deep breath, and seeks cold air's attraction.
Quod si cadat sagitta in uelamen, quod est in pectore: tunc est prope costas paruas: et fit anhelitus magnus cum dolore uehementi, cum suspirio: et mouentur omnia membra humerorum.	 If the arrow falls into the pleura, which is in the chest; then it is near the small ribs; and a great panting with very intense pain, with sighing, occurs, and all the limbs of the shoulders move.
Et si cadat sagitta in stomachum, tunc fortasse egreditur ex uulnere ex cibo aliquid indigestum.	 If the arrow falls into the stomach, then perhaps something undigested comes out from the wound.
Et si cadit sagitta in Ventrem, et figitur in eo: egreditur aliquid stercoris ex uulnere, aut zirbum, aut intestinum quod iam disruptum est.	 If an arrow falls into the abdomen and sticks there, something like feces comes out from the wound, or pus, or already ruptured intestine.
Non est ergo spes in curatione eius, neque in extractione sagittae.	 Therefore, there is no hope for its cure, nor in the removal of the arrow.
Quod si sagitta cadat in Vesicam, et egrediatur urina: et procedit ex ea aliquid ad exteriora, et fortior sit dolor super infirmum: tunc scias, quia est mortale.	 If the arrow falls into the bladder and exits urine; and something goes out from it to the outside, and the pain is greater over the weak one; then you know that it is mortal.
Reliqua autem membra, sicut facies, et collum, et guttur, et spatula, et adiutorium, et spondiles dorsi, et furcula, et coxa, et crus, et eis similia ex membris saluantur secundum plures dispositiones: quando non inuenit sagitta arteriam, aut neruum: et non est sagitta uenenosa.	 The rest of the limbs, such as the face, and the neck, and throat, and spatula, and assistant, and dorsal vertebrae, and furculum, and hip, and leg, and similar members are saved according to many positions; when the arrow does not find an artery or nerve, and it is not a poisoned arrow.
Et ego narro tibi quod uidi de esse harum sagittarum, ut significes per illud super curationem tuam.	 And I tell you that of these arrows, as a sign for your treatment.
Quod est, quia cuidam uiro cecidit sagitta in lachrymali oculi eius, in radice nasi.	 That is, because a man had an arrow shot into his tear duct of the eye, at the root of the nose.
Extraxi ergo eam ipsi ex parte altera, sub adipe auris eius: et sanatus est, et non accidit ei in oculo eius nocumentum.	 Therefore, I removed it myself from the other side, under the ear fat of his; and he was healed, and no harm came to his eye.
Et extraxi sagittam aliam Iudaeo, quae cecidit ei in adipe oculi sui sub palpebra inferiori: et sagitta iam occultata erat, et non consecutus sum ex ea nisi extremitatem paruam eius, cum qua adhaeret in ligno suo: et erat sagitta magna ex sagittis arcuum Turcorum, cum ferro leni, in qua non sunt aures.	 And I extracted another arrow from the Jew, which fell into his eye fat beneath the lower eyelid; and already the arrow was hidden, and I did not succeed in obtaining it except for its small end, with which it adhered to its wooden shaft; and the arrow was large among the arrows of the Turks, with a soft iron tip, in which there were no ears.
Sanatus est ergo Iudaeus, et non accidit in oculo eius accidens malum.	 The Jew was healed, and no further harm occurred to his eye.
Et extraxi sagittam aliam ex gutture Christiani.	 And I extracted another arrow from the throat of a Christian.
Et erat sagitta arabica, et est illa cui sunt aures.	 And it was an Arabic arrow, and it had ears.
Secui ergo super ipsam inter duas guidegi: et iam submersa erat in gutture eius.	 I cut therefore across the middle (of the wound): and already it was sunken into his throat.
Subtiliatus sum ergo cum ea, donec extraxi eam: et sanatus est Christianus.	 So I made it thin with a file until I extracted it; and the Christian was healed.
Et extraxi sagittam aliam uiro quae ceciderat in uentre eius: et cogitauimus, quia moreretur ex ea.	 And I extracted another arrow from a man who it had fallen into his abdomen; and we thought that he would die from it.
Postquam ergo praeterierunt ei triginta dies, et non mutatum est super eum aliquid ex dispositionibus eius, secui super sagittam: et ingeniaui super eam, et extraxi eam: et sanatus est, et non accidit ei accidens malum.	 After he had passed thirty days and nothing changed in his condition, I made an incision over the arrow; and I opened it up, and extracted it; and he was healed, and no further harm occurred to him.
Et uidi uirum cui cecidit sagitta in dorso eius, et consolidatum est uulnus super eam.	 And I saw a man whose arrow had fallen into his back, and the wound had become hardened over it.
Postquam ergo fuit post septem annos, exiuit sagitta in radice coxae eius.	 After seven years, the arrow came out at the root of his hip.
Et uidi mulierem cui cecidit in uentre suo sagitta, et consolidatum est uulnus super eam, et remansit sagitta intra ipsam: et non mutata est ex dispositionibus eius aliqua, et mulier non inuenit ei nocumentum in aliqua ex operationibus suis naturalibus.	 I saw a woman whose arrow had fallen into her abdomen, and the wound had become hardened over it, and the arrow remained within her; and nothing changed in her condition, and the woman did not suffer any harm from her natural operations.
Et uidi uirum alium, cui cecidit sagitta in facie sua: et consolidatum est uulnus, et remansit, non inueniens ei multum dolorem: et similia istis multa.	 I saw another man whose arrow had fallen into his face; and the wound became hardened, and remained, causing him little pain; and there were many similar cases.
Et extraxi sagittam uiro ex principibus Regis, quae ceciderat ei in medio nasi sui, et iam declinauerat ad partem dextram parumper: et occultata erat sagitta tota.	 And I removed an arrow from a man among the princes of the King, which had fallen into his nose middle, and already it was slightly sinking towards the right side; and the entire arrow was hidden.
Vocatus sum ergo ad curationem eius post casum sagittae usque ad tres dies.	 I was therefore called to treat him after the loss of the arrow for three days.
Inueni ergo uulnus sagittae strictum ualde.	 Then I found the arrow wound very narrow.
Inquisiui ergo eam cum tenta subtili, et non sensi eam: et ipse quidem inueniebat punctionem et dolorem sub aure sua ex parte dextra.	 Then I inserted it with a fine probe and did not feel it; but himself indeed discovered a puncture and pain on his right ear side.
Speraui ergo, quod erat illa punctio ex extremitate sagittae.	 Therefore I hoped that this puncture was from the end of the arrow.
Emplastraui ergo locum cum emplastro in quo erat uirtus attractiua, et digestiua, confidens apud me, quod apostemaretur locus, et appareret mihi signum sagittae, ut secarem super eam: et non accidit in loco accidens significans quod sagitta consecuta sit locum.	 I therefore anointed the place with an ointment containing attracting and digestive properties, confident that the wound would heal and reveal the sign of the arrow so that I could cut above it; but this did not happen in the wound which indicated that the arrow had reached its destination.
Assiduaui ergo cum emplastro super eum diebus multis: et non accidit accidens, et consolidatum est uulnus interim: et remansit infirmus de extractione eius spacio dierum, donec sensit sagittam die quodam intra nasum suum.	 I therefore attended him with the ointment for many days; but this did not happen as expected, and the wound healed meanwhile; and he remained weak from the extraction of it until he felt the arrow one day within his nose.
Et narrauit mihi illud.	 And he told me that.
Posui ergo super illud uulnus medicinam acutam, corrosiuam diebus multis, donec apertum est: et cum tenta tentaui ipsum, et sensi extremitatem sagittae subtilem quae adhaeret in ligno.	 I therefore put strong and corrosive medicine on that wound for many days until it opened; and when I probed it with a fine probe, I felt the tip of the arrow which was attached to wood.
Deinde addidi in apertione uulneris per illam medicinam acutam, donec apparuit nobis uisibiliter extremitas sagittae: et praeteriit mihi cum eo spacium temporis circiter quatuor menses.	 Then I added the same strong and corrosive medicine to the opening of the wound until we could see clearly the tip of the arrow; and he passed away with me after an interval of about four months.
Deinde postquam amplificatum est uulnus, et possible fuit mihi intromittere forcipes in ipsam, et mouere ipsam, et non obediuit ad exitum: tunc non cessaui subtiliare, et ingeniare super eam cum modis ingeniorum, donec coepi super eam die quodam cum forcipibus decenter factis, secundum quod ueniet forma eorum in fine capituli, donec extraxi eam.	 Then when the wound had healed and I was able to insert forceps into it and move it without resistance, I did not cease to examine it and try various means until on one day I began with well-made forceps, according to the shape described at the end of the chapter, until I extracted it.
Deinde restauraui uulnus.	 Then I restored the wound.
Et medici quidem iudicant, quod cartilago nasi non restauratur.	 And indeed physicians judge that the cartilage of the nose cannot be restored.
Restauraui ergo ipsam, et consolidatum est uulnus, et sanatus est infirmas sanitate integra: nec nocuit ei aliquid omnino.	 I therefore restored it [the wound], and the wound was healed, and the patient recovered completely in good health: nothing at all harmed him.
Et ego narro tibi qualitatem extractionis quarundam sagittarum: ut ponas illud regulam et significationem super illud quod non dixi.	 And I tell you the quality of the extraction of certain arrows: so that you may set down the rule and significance on what I have not said.
Quoniam partes huius artis et distinctiones earum non comprehenduntur cum narratione: neque comprehendit illud liber, et artifex prudens comparat cum pauco super multum: et cum eo quod est paesens, super illud quod est absens: et inuenit operationem nouam, et instrumentum nouum apud descensus rerum extranearum huius artis quando accidunt.	 Since the parts of this art and their distinctions are not comprehended with the narrative; nor does the book contain it, and a skillful craftsman compares little with much; and with what is present, regarding what is absent; and he discovers a new operation, and a new instrument for descending foreign matters of this art when they occur.
Dico ergo, quod sagittae non egrediuntur ex membris quibus sunt fixae, nisi secundum duos modos.	 Therefore, I say that arrows do not exit from the members to which they are fixed except in two ways.
Aut per attractionem ex loco ex quo intrauit.	 Or through the attraction of the place from which it entered.
Aut contrario partis alterius.	 Or, on the contrary, by the part opposite [the one] where it entered.
Et illa quae egreditur unde intrauit, aut est sagitta procedens in loco carnoso: et attrahitur, et egreditur.	 And that which exits from where it entered is either a bullet proceeding into a fleshy place; and it is attracted and exits.
Quod si non obedit ad exitum ex hora in qua cadit: tunc oportet ut dimittas ipsam aliquot diebus, donec putrefiat caro quae est in circumitu eius: et alleuietur attractio eius, et eius egressio.	 If it does not obey to exit from the side where it fell: then it is necessary that you leave it for some days, until the flesh surrounding it becomes putrid; and its attraction subsides, and its exit occurs.
Et similiter si figitur in osse, et non obedit tibi ad exitum, tunc dimitte ipsam etiam aliquot diebus: et itera eam cum attractione et motione omni die, donec egreditur.	 And similarly, if it is fixed in bone, and does not obey to your effort to make it exit; then leave it for some days also; and move it every day with its attraction and motion until it exits.
Quod si non obedit tibi ad exitum post dies, tunc oportet ut perfores in circumitu sagittae in ipso osse ab omni parte cum terebro subtili, donec amplificentur sagittae.	 If it does not obey to your effort to make it exit after days, then it is necessary that you bore around the arrow in the bone from every side with a fine lancet until the arrow enlarges.
Deinde attrahe eam, et extrahe ipsam.	 Then pull it out, and extract it.
Si autem sagitta est fixa in capitis osse, et iam processit in uno uentrium cerebri, et apparent ex infirmo quaedam illorum accidentium quae dixi: tunc abstine ab attractione sagittae, et dimitte eam, donec aequetur esse eius post dies.	 If an arrow is fixed in the bone of the head and has already advanced into one of the cavities of the brain, and some signs of the symptoms I mentioned appear weak: then refrain from pulling out the arrow, and leave it until it equalizes with its own state after days.
Nam si sagitta peruenit ad sifach, tunc mors non prolongatur ei.	 For if an arrow has reached the backbone (spine), then death is not delayed for that person.
Et si sagitta non est fixa, nisi in corpore ossis tantum, et non penetrat usque ad sifach: et remanet infirmus aliquot diebus, et non accidit ei ex illis accidentibus aliquid: tunc ingenia in attractione sagittae et extractione eius.	 And if the arrow is not fixed except in the body of a bone alone and does not penetrate as far as the backbone (spine); and the person remains weak for several days, and nothing further occurs from those symptoms: then, proceed with pulling out the arrow and its extraction.
Si autem est fixa ualde, et non obedit tibi ad attractionem: tunc administra terebella in circumitu sagittae, sicut narraui tibl: deinde cura locum, donec sanetur.	 If it is deeply fixed and does not obey your pulling: then administer a lancet around the arrow, as I told you; afterwards take care of the wound until it heals.
Si autem Sagitta iam absconsa est in loco corporis, et occultatur et absconditur a sensu: tunc inquire eam cum tenta.	 If the arrow has already been hidden in a part of the body and is covered up and concealed from feeling: then look for it with probing (exploration).
Si autem sentis eam, tunc attrahe eam cum quibusdam instrumentis quae conueniunt attractioni eius.	 If you feel the arrow, then pull it out with some tools suitable for its extraction.
Si autem non potes super eam, propter constrictionem uulneris, et propter longitudinem sagittae in profundo: et non est illic os, neque neruus, neque uena: tunc finde super eam, donec amplificetur uulnus, et sit possibile extrahere sagittam.	 If you cannot get on top of it (arrow) due to the narrowness of the wound and because the arrow is long and deep; and there is no bone, nerve or vein there: then mark it over and wait until the wound expands and becomes possible to extract the arrow.
Quod si sunt ei aures quibus teneatur, tunc libera carnem fixam in eis ab omni parte, omni ingenio quo potes illud, et ingenia, si non potest super euasionem carnis in fractura aurium, et contorsione earum, donec euadat.	 If there are ears attached to it (the arrow), then release the flesh fixed in them from all sides with all your strength and means that you can; and if you cannot get at the flesh by lifting it due to a fracture of the ears or twisting them, then wait until they come out.
Et tu quando administras extractionem Sagittae, in quocumque loco est, tunc utere contorsione manus tuae, cum forficibus ad partes omnes, donec facias eam euadere: et subtilia ultima subtilitate, ut non frangatur Sagita, et fiat difficilis tibi attractio eius, et ipsius extractio.	 And when you administer the extraction of the arrow, wherever it is, then use your hand's twisting motion with forks to all sides, until it comes out; and use subtle instruments with utmost subtlety so that the arrow does not break, and its pulling and extraction become difficult for you.
Quod si non potes super eam ex hora una, tunc dimitte eam diebus aliquot, donec putrefiant quae sunt in circumitu eius.	 If you cannot open it within an hour, then leave it for some days until what is around it putrefies.
Deinde itera eam: alleuietur enim tuncia Si uero contrarietatem tibi facit fluxus sanguinis, tunc administra quod diximus ex curatione in capitulo suo: et custodi uirtutem tuam ab incisione uenae, aut nerui, aut chordae.	 Then proceed with it: the garment will be alleviated. If however it causes a flow of blood contrary to you, then administer what was said in the cure chapter, and guard your strength from cutting a vein, or nerve, or tendon.
Et administra ingenium omni modo quo tibi possibile est euasionis Sagittae: et sit illud cum facilitate, et tranquillitate, uel tarditate, et firmitate, sicut narraui tibi.	 And administer ingenuity in every possible way for the evacuation of the Arrowhead: and let it be with ease, calmness, or slowness, firmness as I told you.
Et oportet, ut facias cum trahis Sagittam, ut infirmus sit secundum figuram, secundum quam fuit apud casum Sagittae in ipso.	 It is necessary that when pulling the Arrow, it becomes weak in the shape it was at the time of the Arrow's fall upon itself.
Quoniam est magis iuuatiuum.	 Since it is more useful (for the patient).
Si autem non est tibi possibile illud, tunc administra quod tibi est possibile ex figuris.	 If however this is not possible for you, then administer what is possible according to the figures.
Sagitta autem quae egreditur ex contrario partis alterius, aut iam procedit ex ea aliquid ad exteriora: aut facit gibbositatem extremitas Sagittae per sensum ex superiore parte cutis propinquae, et uides eam eminentem: seca ergo super eam, et sit sectio secundum quantitatem quod capiant in ea forcipes.	 The arrow that emerges from the opposite part or has already advanced towards the exterior: or it makes a hump at the end of the Arrow through sensation from the upper part of the skin near, and you see it protruding: then cut above it, and make the cut according to the size so that forceps can grasp it.
Deinde attrahe eam: ipsa namque fit facilis ad exitum.	 Then draw it out: for it becomes easy to come out.
Si uero retinetur in osse, tunc torque manum tuam secundum rotunditatem, donec imprimat Sagitta in osse, et amplificet sibiipsi: deinde trahe ipsam.	 If however it is retained in the bone, then twist your hand according to the roundness, until the Arrow impresses on the bone and expands for itself: then draw it out.
Et si non: dimitte eam diebus aliquot: deinde itera eam, donec egrediatur.	 And if not: leave it for some days; then proceed with it until it comes out.
Quod si lignum Sagittae est in ea, tunc impelle ipsam cum eo.	 If the wood of the Arrow is in it, then push it along with it.
Si autem cecidit lignum, et uis administrare impulsionem: tunc intromitte ad eam instrumentum concauum, ut ingrediatur concauitas eius in caudam Sagittae: deinde impelle eam cum ipso.	 If however the wood fell out and you wish to administer the impulse: then insert a concave instrument into it so that it enters the concavity of the Arrowhead; then push it along with it.
Si autem Sagita est concaua, tunc impelle eam cum instrumento intrante in ipsam.	 If however the arrow is concave, then push it with the instrument entering into it.
Sagitta enim alleuiatur per illud.	 The arrow is pulled out by that (instrument).
Quod si Sagitta est toxicata, tunc oportet, ut concaues carnem totam, in qua est uenenum: si est tibi possibile illud.	 If the arrow is poisoned, then it is necessary that you scrape all the concave flesh where the poison is; if it is possible for you to do so.
Deinde cura eam cum eo quod conuenit ad illud.	 Then treat it with what suits for that (purpose).
Quod si Sagitta est cadens in pectore, aut in uentre, aut in uesica, aut in latere: et est propinqua ex eo quod tangis cum tenta, et possibile est tibi secare super eam: tunc seca, et caue ab incisione uenae, aut nerui, et extrahe eam.	 If the arrow falls in the chest, or in the stomach, or in the bladder, or in the side; and it is near where you touch with a probe, and it is possible for you to cut over it: then cut, and be careful not to cut a vein or a nerve, and extract it.
Deinde sue uulnus, si uides, et cura illud, donec sanetur.	 Then suture the wound, if you see (it), and treat it until it heals.
Et haec est forma Forcipum, quibus extrahuntur Sagittae.	 And this is the form of forceps with which arrows are extracted.
Sint extremitates similes rostro auis, quae factae sunt sicut ferra: quando capiunt super Sagittam, non dimittunt eam.	 The ends should resemble a bird's beak, which have been made like iron: when they grip the arrow, they do not release it.
Et fiunt ex eis species multae, magnae, et paruae, et mediae, secundum quantitatem magnitudinis Sagittae, et paruitatis eius, et amplitudinis uulneris, et constrictionis eius.	 And they are made in various shapes, large, small, and medium-sized, according to the size of the arrow, its smallness, and the width and constriction of the wound.
Forma Impellentis concaui.	 The shape of a concave probe.
Et forma Impellentis surdi.	 And the shape of a deaf probe.
Hoc est surdae extremitatis sicut Radius, ut alleuietur introitus eius in sagittam concauam, et impellatur cum eo.	 This is the shape of a blunt end like a radius to pull into a concave arrow and push it with it.
Huius extremitas impellentis concauae est concaua sicut penna auis: ut alleuietur introitus sagittae in ipsam et impulsio eius.	 The end of the concave probe is concave like a feather of a bird: to pull the arrow into itself and push it with it.
¶ De phlebotomia Venarum.	 Chapter on Phlebotomy of Veins.
Caput XCVII.	 Chapter CXVII.
Uenae phlebotomandae, quarum cucurrit consuetudo in corpore, sunt triginta.	 Veins for bloodletting, whose practice has become common in the body, are thirty.

Vna earum est Cephalica, et est ex latere syluestri: et nominat eam uulgus uenam capitis.	 One of them is the Brachial, and it is from the side of the forest; and the common people call it the vein of the head.
Et Fusca.	 And Black.

¶ De phlebotomia duarum uenarum post Aures.	 Section on venesection of two veins after Ears.
Phlebotomiae uero duarum uenarum quae sunt post Aures, iuuamentum est ad catarros antiquos, et hemigraneam, et sahafati, et ulcera capitis mala antiqua.	 However, the venesection of two veins that are after the Ears (the auricles), is beneficial for old catarrhs, and hemigraine, and sores on the head, old ones.
Et qualitas phlebotomandi eam est secundum quod narro.	 And the quality of performing venesection is as I explained (before).
Et est, ut radatur caput infirmi: et fricetur occipitium eius in loco duarum uenarum cum panno aspero fricatione bona.	 And it is to be shaved the head of the sick: and rub his neck in the place of two veins with a rough cloth for good friction.
Deinde stringat infirmus collum suum cum uitta, donec appareant duae uenae.	 Then the sick person shall tighten his neck with a bandage until the two veins appear.
Et loca earum sunt post Aures in duobus locis depressis capitis.	 And their places are behind the ears, in two depressed places of the head.
Quaere ergo eas digito tuo, et ubi sentis pulsum earum sub digito tuo, illic signa cum encaustro.	 Search for them with your finger, and where you feel their pulse under your finger, mark that place with a hot iron (encaustum).
Deinde accipe phlebotomum cultellarem, et est ille qui dicitur Incidens.	 Then take a surgical knife called an Incisor (Incidens) for venesection.
Deinde intromitte ipsum sub uena in cute, donec perueniat phlebotomus ad os.	 Then insert the knife under the vein into the skin until the venesector reaches the bone.
Deinde eleua manum tuam cum uena et cute ad superiora, et incide uenam cum cute incisione incidente.	 Then pull your hand with the vein and skin upwards and cut the vein with a cutting motion of the knife.
Et sit longitudo incisionis quantitas duorum digitorum iunctorum, aut circiter illud: et fac exire ex sanguine quantum uis.	 And let the length of the incision be the size of two fingers joined or about that much: and make as much blood come out as you wish.
Deinde stringe eam cum puluillis, et dimitte eam, donec sanetur.	 Then tie it with threads (ligatures) and let it heal.
Et iam praecessit in principio libri incisio earum, et ipsarum cauterizatio.	 And now we have reached the end of the book's section on incision and cauterization of these (veins).
¶ De phlebotomia duarum Arteriarum in timporibus.	 On the phlebotomy of two arteries at appropriate times.
Duarum uero Arteriarum quae sunt in duobus timporibus phlebotomiae iuuamentum, est ad hemigraneam antiquam: et sodam prauam, et obtalmiam assiduam: et cursum superfluitatum effusarum acutarum ad oculos.	 The phlebotomy of the two arteries that are beneficial in two times is for the treatment of ancient migraine and sodam praua, and optalmia assidua, and for the discharge of acute superfluities towards the eyes.
Et qualitas phlebotomandi eas est secundum quod narro tibi.	 And the quality of phlebotomy them (the arteries) is as I have told you.
Stringat infirmus collum suum multum, donec appareant duae uenae sensui apparitione manifesta: et demonstretur pulsus earum sub digito tuo.	 The sick person should tighten his neck very much until two veins appear to the perception with clear evidence and their pulse is shown under your finger.
Tunc enim signa cum encaustro.	 Then signs (are made) with hot iron (encaustic).
Deinde eleua cutem desuper uenam ad superiora cum digito tuo indice, et intromitte phlebotomum incidentem desubtus, et eleua uenam ad superiora.	 Then the skin is incised above the vein with your index finger and a lancet inserted below, and the vein is incised towards the top.
Et incide eam, sicut fecisti in duabus uenis aliis: et fac currere ex sanguine secundum quantitatem necessitatis tuae.	 And cut it (the vein) as you did with two other veins; and make the blood flow according to your need.
Deinde solue coartationem infirmi, et pone digitum tuum super uenam hora una.	 Then loosen the constriction of the sick person and place your finger on one side (of the vein).
Postea pone super ipsam cotum et puluillos, et stringe ipsum desuper constrictione forti: et dimitte ipsam, donec sanetur.	 Then put a cloth and cotton over it, and tighten it from above with a strong constriction; and let it be until it is healed.
Et iam praecessit rememoratio earum, et ipsarum incisio, et earum extractio in principio libri.	 And now the remembrance of them (the veins), their incision, and their extraction at the beginning of the book has passed away.
¶ De phlebotomia uenae frontis post phlebotomiam Cephalicae.	 On the phlebotomy of the forehead vein after the phlebotomy of the Cephalic (vein).
Iuuamentum uero phlebotomiae uenae frontis est post phlebotomiam Cephalicae, ad aegritudines faciei antiquas: et ad hemigraneam, et rubedinem: et ulcera foeda.	 But the benefit of the phlebotomy of the forehead vein is after the phlebotomy of the Cephalic (vein), for ancient facial ailments: and for migraine, redness, and foul ulcers.
Et qualitas phlebotomiae eius est, secundum quod narro tibi.	 And the quality of its (the forehead vein's) phlebotomy is as I have told you.
Coartet infirmus collum suum cum uitta, donec appareat uena.	 Tie up tightly the neck of the sick man with a linen cloth until the vein appears.
Deinde accipe instrumentum quod nominatur Fossorium.	 Then take the tool named Fossorium (Forceps).
Cuius haec est forma.	 This is its shape (drawing omitted, as it was likely a diagram in the original text
Pone acumen eminens quod est in capite Fossorii super ipsam uenam, et percute super ipsum cum pectine, aut cum re alia in modo eius: et dimitte sanguinem currere secundum quantitatem quam uis.	 Place the pointed end at the top of the Fossorium on the vein and strike it with a hammer or other tool in this way; then let the blood flow according to the amount you wish.
Deinde solue perforationem infirmi, et stringe eam, donec sanetur.	 Then release the incision of the sick man and tie it up until it is healed.
Et quandoque aperitur cum phlebotomo lato.	 And sometimes it is opened with a broad-bladed leech (surgeon).
Verumtamen non oportet, ut sit phlebotomus acutae extremitatis, sicut reliqui phlebotomi, imo sit latae extremitatis.	 However, it is not necessary that the surgeon have a sharp-pointed blade, like other surgeons do; instead, he should have one with a broad tip.
Et phlebotoma eam secundum transuersionem: quoniam os est propinquum: et fortasse in eo frangetur phlebotomus quando est subtilis.	 And the surgeon shall make the incision obliquely, since the bone is close by; and perhaps the surgeon may break it if he is too sharp.
¶ De phlebotomia Venarum in duobus Lachrymalibus.	 Chapter on Phlebotomy of Veins in the Two Lacrimal Ducts (tears ducts).
Iuuamentum autem duarum Venarum quae sunt in duobus Lachrymalibus duorum oculorum, est ad oculum ex scabie et rubedine: et sebel in oculo, et aegritudinibus faciei.	 The remedy for the two veins that are in the two Lacrimal Ducts of both eyes is for inflammation and redness of the eye; and it is used on the eye itself, and for diseases of the face.
Et qualitas phlebotomiae earum est, ut stringat infirmus collum suum cum uitta.	 And the quality of phlebotomy of these veins is that the sick man ties his neck with a linen cloth (bandage).
Deinde phlebotoma eas: et tu sis stans super caput eius.	 Then make the incision of the vein; you should stand over its head.
Et fiat phlebotomia secundum transuersum ad longitudinem parum, cum phlebotomo paruo, lato parumper, nam in loco non est caro.	 And make the incision obliquely in a short length with a small knife, for there is no flesh at that location.
Si enim phlebotomus est subtilis extremitatis, fortasse frangitur.	 If the surgeon has a sharp-pointed blade, he may break it.
Deinde fac currere ex sanguine quantum est tibi necesse.	 Then let the blood flow as much as is necessary for you.
Et pone super eas cotum, et stringe eas nocte una, et solue eas.	 Place a cloth over them and tie them up at night and release them in the morning.
¶ De phlebotomia uenarum Nasi.	 On the phlebotomy of the veins of the nose.
Venae autem Nasi phlebotomia, est conferens ad febrem acutam, et sodam uehementem, et aegritudines faciei, sicut hemigraneam, et rubedinem quae accidit in facie: praecipue quando est antiqua.	 The phlebotomy of the veins of the nose is useful for treating acute fever, severe itching, and facial ailments such as migraines and redness that occur on the face, especially when they are chronic.
Et qualitas phlebotomiae eius est, ut stringat infirmus collum suum.	 And the quality of this phlebotomy is such that it tightens a weak neck.
Deinde tene nasum eius manu tua sinistra, et accipe phlebotomum subtilem, longum: et fige eum in medio leporis ipsius, inter illud quod distinguit nasum secundum rectitudinem.	 Then hold the nose with your left hand and take a subtle and long phlebotomy needle, and place it in the middle of the nostril, between that which divides the nose according to its straightness.
Quoniam uena non apparet sensui illic, et quia sanguis incipit fluere statim.	 Since the vein is not visible to the senses there and because blood begins to flow immediately.
Et oportet, ut ultimes manum tuam cum phlebotomo parumper: et facias currere ex sanguine secundum necessitatem tuam.	 And it is necessary that you hold the phlebotomy tool with your fingertips and let blood flow as needed.
Deinde liga ipsam nocte una.	 Then tie it up at night.
Ipsa enim restauratur uelociter.	 It recovers quickly.
¶ De phlebotomia uenarum Guidegi.	 On the phlebotomy of the veins of the neck.
Duarum uero Guidegi phlebotomiae iuuamentum, est ad constrictionem anhelitus, et incaeptionem leprae, et aegritudines melancholicas, et impetiginem et ulcera mala, et corrodentibus, id est, herpetibus estiomenis.	 The phlebotomy of the veins of the neck has two beneficial effects: it helps to relieve coughing and prevent leprosy, melancholic ailments, impetigo and ulcers, as well as corrosive conditions such as herpes simplex.
Et qualitas phlebotomiae earum est ut stringat infirmus sub utrisque in collo suo cum ligamento: et stet artifex super caput infirmi, et infirmus sit sedens super sedem.	 And the quality of this phlebotomy is such that it tightens a weak neck with a band, and the worker should stand over the head of the sick person, who should be seated on a chair.
Deinde phlebotoma uenam ad longitudinem phlebotomia ampla parumper.	 Then the phlebotomy needle should be inserted into the vein to a length slightly greater than that of the phlebotomy.
Deinde extrahe ex sanguine quantitatem temperatam, aut secundum illud quod uides ex necessitate quae est ad illud.	 Then extract an appropriate amount of blood, or according to what you see as necessary for this purpose.
Deinde fac similiter de uena alia.	 Then do the same with another vein.
Postea solue ligamentum, et stringe duas uenas strictura media: ut non praefocetur infirmus.	 Then untie the band and tighten two veins slightly so that the sick person does not faint.
Et dimitte eam usque mane.	 Let it (the wound) alone until morning.
Sanatur enim uulnus.	 The wound heals.
¶ De phlebotomia uenarum Algeberich.	 On the phlebotomy of veins (Albucasis).
Venae autem Algeberich phlebotomiae iuuamentum est: quia confert ad alcolam in ore, et corruptionem gingiuae: et ulcera mala: et fissuras labiorum, et ulcera mala, etiam quae sunt in naso, et in circumitu eius.	 The phlebotomy of veins by Albucasis is beneficial for the following: to prevent alcohol in the mouth, corruption of teeth and bad ulcers on lips, bad ulcers, even those that are in the nose and around it.
Et qualitas phlebotomiae earum est, ut facias sedere infirmum coram te: et stringe collum eius cum uitta.	 And the quality of their phlebotomy is as follows: make the sick person sit before you and tighten his neck with a bandage.
Deinde reuolue labium eius, et aspice ad duas uenas: quarum una est a dextera labii, et secunda a sinistra eius: et demonstratio utriusque est per nigredinem ambarum.	 Then turn his lip and look at two veins; one is on the right of the lip, and the second is on the left of it; and the demonstration of both is by showing their blackness.
Et illud uerum est: quia in circumitu earum sunt uenae minutae, nigrae.	 That is true because around them are small, dark veins.
Incide ergo utramque incisione incidente.	 Therefore, make an incision on both of them with a cutting instrument.
Si autem dubitatio est super te, et non scis quae earum est: tunc intende ad incisionem maioris earum, et ipsarum manifestiorem.	 If there is doubt concerning you and you do not know which one (vein) it is, then turn to the larger vein (incision), and its manifestation.
Et similiter fac de duabus uenis quae sunt in labio superiore: et plurimum quidem currit consuetudo cum eo: et incide duas uenas quae sunt in labio inferiori.	 And similarly, do the same with the two veins that are on the upper lip; and it is most commonly used (phlebotomy) with this one; and make an incision in the two veins that are on the lower lip.
¶ De phlebotomia Venae sub lingua post Cephalicae phlebotomiam.	 On phlebotomy of the vein under the tongue, after the phlebotomy of the jugular (cephalic) vein.
Duarum uero Venarum quae sunt sub lingua phlebotomiae iuuamentum: est, quod phlebotomia Cephalicae est ad praefocationes quae sunt in gutture, et aegritudinem uuulae, et aegritudines oris.	 But the phlebotomy of the two veins that are under the tongue is beneficial for: because the phlebotomy of the jugular (cephalic) vein is for afflictions that are in the throat, and diseases of the voice, and diseases of the mouth.
Et qualitas phlebotomandi eas est, ut sedeat infirmus inter manus tuas coram sole: et eleualinguam eius, et aspice sub lingua a latere eius uno uenam, et a latere eius alio uenam: et color utriusque decliuis ad nigredinem.	 And the quality of their phlebotomy is as follows: make the sick person sit between your hands facing the sun; and lift his tongue, and look under the tongue at one vein on one side, and one vein on the other side; and observe that the color of both declines towards blackness.
Phlebotoma ergo utramque: et custodi, ne ultimes manum tuam in phlebotomando eas.	 Phlebotomy therefore both (of them): and guard, so that you do not injure your hand while performing phlebotomy.
Nam sub eius sunt arteriae, et fortasse accidet fluxus sanguinis ex illis arteriis.	 For there are arteries under it, and perhaps blood will flow from these arteries.
¶ De tribus Venis in cubito.	 Chapter on the three veins at the elbow.
Venae autem tres quae phlebotomantur in cubito, sunt in quarum phlebotomia cucurrit consuetudo in omnibus hominibus.	 The three veins which are to be cut open at the elbow are those on which the practice of bloodletting is customary among all men.
Et phlebotomia earum fit secundum duos modos.	 And bloodletting of these is done in two ways.
Aut pungendo cum phlebotomo myrtino lato: aut oliuari ad subtilitatem decliui: aut secando cum phlebotomo cultellari, et est Alnesil.	 Either by pricking with a broad-bladed leech, or by oiling to the point of dripping, or by cutting with a sharp knife, and this is known as Alnaschar.
Et haec est forma eius.	 And this is its form. (Note: The following passage describes the formation of the three veins
Sic Alnesil est, quod conuenit ad sectionem.	 Thus Alnaschar is that which is suitable for cutting.
Et ex eis sunt species latae, et subtiles secundum amplitudinem uenarum et stricturam earum Forma phlebotomi myrtini sit lata, sicut uides.	 And from these are broad and narrow forms according to the size and tightness of the veins. The form of a broad-bladed leech is broad, as you see.
Et conuenit ad aperiendas uenas concauas, plenas, procedentes, apparentes, grossas, et illas quae continent sanguinem grossum, turbidum.	 And it is suitable for opening concave, full, protruding, thick veins that contain thick, turbid blood.
Et iste phlebotomus est minoris latitudinis, et subtilioris extreminatis.	 And this leech is narrower and more delicate at its extremity.
Et conuenit ad phlebotomiam uenarum subtilium, quae continent sanguinem subtilem citrinum	 And it is suitable for bloodletting of the subtle veins that contain thin, yellowish blood.
¶ De phlebotomia Basilicae.	 Chapter on bloodletting in the basilica (large central hall or courtyard in a Roman bath complex).
Basilicae autem quae est una harum trium uenarum phlebotomiae iuuamentum est.	 The bloodletting of one of these three veins is beneficial for the basilica (large central hall or courtyard in a Roman bath complex).
Quia extrahit sanguinem ex aegritudinibus, quae sunt sub gutture et collo, ex eo quod sequitur pectus, et uentrem: et conuenit phlebotomatori cum phlebotomat eam, ut caueat, et sit super timorem ex ea nam sub ea est arteria.	 Because it draws blood from illnesses that are below the throat and neck, as they follow the chest and stomach, it is beneficial for the bloodletter to cut this vein, but he must be careful because there is an artery underneath it.
Si ergo errat, et addit in punctura phlebotomi, incidet illam arteriam, et accidet fluxus sanguinis.	 If therefore he mistakes (it) and adds in the puncture of phlebotomy, he will cut the artery and there will be a flow of blood.
Quapropter oportet, ne phlebotomet eam cum phlebotomo pungente: imo sit secans cum Alnesil.	 Therefore it is necessary that (he) not phlebotomize her with the phlebotomist; rather he should be cutting with Alnesil.
Quod si non apparet Basilica apparitione manifesta, tunc oportet, ut alienes ipsam, et permuteris ad aliam, aut quaeras aliquem ramum eius: aut phlebotomes loco eius Funem brachii.	 If the Basilica does not appear by a manifest appearance, then it is necessary that (you) remove her and change (to) another, or seek some branch of it; or use a rope of its arm in place of the phlebotomist.
Ipsa enim est manifesta, et seca eam cum phlebotomo Anesil, sicut diximus.	 For it (the Basilica) is manifest and cut her with phlebotomist Anesil, as we have said.
Si autem uis phlebotomiam ipsius eiusdem, tunc oportet ante stricturam brachii, ut tangas locum, donec cognoscas locum pulsus.	 If however you wish to perform a phlebotomy on this one, then it is necessary before the constriction of the arm, that (you) touch the place, until (you) recognize the place of the pulse.
Deinde signa super locum cum encaustro, postea brachium, et seca uenam sectione concaua cum phlebotomo Alnesil, sicut diximus.	 Then mark a sign on the place with encaustum (pitch), afterwards the arm and cut the vein with a concave section of the phlebotomist Alnesil, as we have said.
Et caue ne cadat percussio per spacium a loco arteriae.	 And beware that the blow does not fall into the space from the place of the artery.
Et quando uides, cum tu stringis ligamen, inflationem in loco quem signasti cum encaustro, tunc illa inflatio est inflatio arteriae: deuita ergo eam.	 And when you see that as you tighten the ligament, swelling at the place which you have marked with encaustum, then that swelling is the swelling of the artery; avoid it (the vein) therefore.
Quod si uides sanguinem apud phlebotomiam salire, sicut urina pueri, et est sanguis subtilis, rubeus: tunc scias, quia est ex sanguine arteriae.	 If you see blood rise up at the phlebotomy, like the urine of a child and it is thin, red: then know that it is from the blood of the artery.
Tunc ergo propera, et pone digitum tuum super ipsum spacio longo, deinde aufer digitum tuum.	 Then therefore hurry up and place your finger on it in a long space, afterwards remove your finger.
Si ergo abscinditur sanguis (multotiens namque abscinditur) tunc stringe brachium, et dimitte ipsum: et caueat infirmus a motione eius: et sit super timorem eius.	 If blood is cut off (many times it is cut off), then tighten the arm and release it; and let the weak avoid movement of it; let it be in fear of it.
Et non moueat ipsum diebus aliquot, donec sanetur.	 And it should not move itself for some days, until it heals.
Si autem non abscinditur sanguis, et uincit te: et non est tibi praesens in momento tuo medicina, tunc incide arteriam, si apparet tibi.	 If the blood does not flow out and it chokes you; and there is no medicine present for you at the moment, then cut an artery, if it appears to you.
Nam extremitates eius contrahuntur, et abscinditur sanguis.	 For its ends contract, and blood flows out.
Aut accipe corticem fistici, et finde eum: accipe medietatem unam, et stringe eam super locum uenae strictura decenti, cum ligamento et puluillis usque ad diem alium.	 Either take the bark of a fig tree and wrap it; take one half, tie it over the place of the narrowed vein with a ligature and plasters until another day.
Tunc si abscinditur sanguis, est bonum.	 Then if blood flows out, it is good.
Et si non: tunc cura ipsum cum eo cuius praecessit rememoratio ex loco puluerum abscindentium fluxum sanguinis: et abscisio sanguinis eius non est difficilis in pluribus dispositionibus, propter locum paruum uulneris, et possibilitatem ligamenti ex brachio.	 And if not: then take care of it with the one who preceded it, remembering the place from which powder is removed for blood flow; and the removal of blood from it is not difficult in many dispositions, due to the small size of the wound, and the possibility of a ligature from the arm.
¶ De phlebotomia uenae Fuscae.	 Chapter on venesection of the blue vein.
Venae autem Fuscae phlebotomiae iuuamentum est, quod trahit sanguinem ex superiori parte capitis, et inferiore corporis: propterea, quia est composita ex ramo Basilicae, et ramo Cephalicae, sicut diximus.	 However, the benefit of venesection in the blue vein is that it draws blood from the upper part of the head and lower body; because it is composed of a branch of the Basilica vein, and the branch of the Cephalic vein, as we have said.
Et conuenit phlebotomanti eam, ut sit super timorem ex phlebotomia eius, nam sub ea est neruus.	 And it is suitable for the venesectionist that it be above fear of venesection from it, because under it is a nerve.
Si ergo addit in punctura phlebotomi, et inuenit neruum, accidit in ea stupor, et difficilis fit sanatio eius, et fortasse non sanatur penitus.	 If therefore the venesectionist adds in the puncture and finds a nerve, a stupor occurs, and its healing becomes difficult, and it may not heal completely.
Et iste neruus multotiens apparet sensui.	 And this nerve often appears to the sense.
Si autem occultatur in quibusdam hominibus, et est subtilis, et non ostenditur: tunc oportet ut ponas phlebotomiam tuam qua eam phlebotomas, sectionem cum Alnesil, et deuita neruum cum fortitudine tua.	 If it is hidden in some people and is subtle and not shown; then you should put your venesection where you can perform venesection with the Alnesil knife and avoid the nerve with your strength.
Quod si uena est inter duos neruos, tunc finde uenam in longitudine.	 If a vein is between two nerves, then tie off the vein in length.
¶ De uena Cephalica.	 On the Vein of the Head.
Phlebotomiae autem uenae Cephalicae iuuamentum est, quia attrahit sanguinem ex capite, et confert ad aegritudines oculorum.	 The vein of the head (Phlebotomia) is beneficial because it draws blood from the head and causes diseases of the eyes.
Et oportet in hac uena proprie, si uis, ut phlebotomes eam pungendo cum phlebotomo oliuari, aut cum phlebotomo myrtino: quoniam est saluior uenarum omnium, quoniam non est subea arteria, neque neruus.	 And it is proper in this vein (Phlebotomia) that if you wish, the phlebotomist should prick it with a lancet made of oil or myrtle, because it is the most pure of all veins, since it is neither an artery nor a nerve.
Verumtamen conuenit tibi apud phlebotomiam, ut deuites cum phlebotomo caput lacerti tantum, et quaeras locum leniorem: et non nocet ei, si non inuenitur cum percussione prima, ut iteretur super eam cum phlebotomia aliquotiens.	 However, it is fitting for you at the phlebotomy (process of drawing blood), to show your head and arm only to the phlebotomist, and ask him to find a less painful place: and it will not harm him if he does not find the vein with the first blow, but he should try again on the same spot several times.
Verumtamen fortasse apostematur in quibusdam hominibus quando non phlebotomatur in percussione prima, sed non nocet ei illud apostema in aliquo.	 However, it may appear as a boil in some people when they are not bled with the first blow, but it does no harm to him.
¶ De utilitate Phlebotomiae, et cautelis in ea obseruandis.	 On the utility of phlebotomy (bloodletting) and the precautions to be observed.
Qualitas autem Phlebotomiae, et accidentia eius ex ea, in cuius rectificatione oportet te cogitare.	 The quality of the phlebotomy (bloodletting), and its accompanying circumstances, of which you should think about how to correct it.
Primum ergo illius est de quo oportet ut scias, quod phlebotomia non administratur, nisi in conseruatione sanitatis, et perseuerantia eius, et cautela ab aduentu aegritudinum.	 First of all, you should know that phlebotomy is not administered unless for the conservation of health, persistence of it, and precautions against the onset of diseases.
Et ut fiat phlebotomia in una uenarum trium quae sunt in cubito, scilicet Cephalica, et Fusca, et Basilica.	 And that a phlebotomy should be performed in one of the three veins which are in the elbow, namely the Head (Cephalica), Dark (Fusca), and Basilic.
Et ut fiat phlebotomia in principio Veris super ieiunium, in uere, et aestate: et autumno, et hyeme post comestionem, quando apparent significationes repletionis.	 And that a phlebotomy should be performed at the beginning of spring during fasting, in spring and summer; and in autumn and winter after eating, when signs of fullness appear.
Et fiat phlebotomia in die primo, aut in tertio, postquam praeterierint de die tres horae.	 And let phlebotomy be performed on the first day or third day, after three hours have passed.
Phlebotomia autem quae administratur in aegritudinibus, non habet horam determinatam: sed quando prouocat conuenientia et necessitas ad illud, in nocte, aut die, et in omni hora, et in omni tempore.	 Phlebotomy administered in illnesses does not have a determined hour: but when necessity and suitability require it, it may be done at night or day, and in every hour, and at any time.
Et non oportet, ut phlebotomentur pueri, donec ueniant super eos quatuordecim anni.	 And it is not necessary to perform phlebotomy on boys until they reach fourteen years of age.
Neque phlebotometur mulier praegnans, nisi a mense quarto usque ad septimum.	 Phlebotomy should not be performed on a pregnant woman except from the fourth to the seventh month.
Neque phlebotomentur senes, qui iam pertransierunt sexaginta annos.	 Phlebotomy should not be performed on the elderly who have already passed sixty years.
Cum ergo aliquis uult phlebotomari propter quemcumque modum sit: oportet, ut mundificet intestina sua ante phlebotomiam cum clisteri leni, si in eis est stercus multum retentum: ut non attrahant uenae apud phlebotomiam ex intestinis superfluitates putridas nocentes membris principalibus.	 When anyone wishes to undergo phlebotomy for any reason, it is necessary that he cleanses his intestines before phlebotomy with a lenient enema if there is much retained feces in them: so that no putrid superfluities from the intestines attract veins during phlebotomy and harm the main organs.
Neque phlebotometur patiens toctina, id est, satietatem nauseatiuam: neque crapulatus, neque euadens ab ebrietate, donec remoueatur illud ab eis.	 Phlebotomy should not be performed on a patient who is vomiting, that is, suffering from nausea or satiety; nor on one who has drunk excessively and is still intoxicated, until that condition has been removed from them.
Neque infirmus cum hydropisi.	 Phlebotomy should not be performed on a sick person with dropsy.
Et caueatur phlebotomia iterum post colicam passionem, et uomitum, et fluxum uentris, et multiplicationem coitus, et laboris, et exercitii, et uigiliarum, et ieiunii, et omnis quod dissoluit uirtutem ex re corporea aut animali.	 Phlebotomy should be avoided again after a colic attack, vomiting, diarrhea, multiplication of sexual activity, labor, exercise, sleeplessness, fasting, and any other factor that weakens the strength of the body or an animal.
Deinde considera in subtilitate humorum ante illud, si sanguis est grossus cum cibis et potibus, et medicinis: si possibile est ei illud.	 Then consider with subtlety the humors beforehand if the blood is thick due to food, drink, and medicine: if it is possible for him to do so.
Deinde introeat balneum, si non prohibet ipsum aliquid: aut exercitetur aliquo exercitio, ut subtilietur sanguis.	 Then enter a bath, if nothing prevents him from doing so; or exercise in some way to thin the blood.
Et pone phlebotomiam eius in pectore, circa tertiam diei, sicut diximus: et conare, ut euacuetur pectus eius illa die ex omnibus accidentibus animalibus malis: sicut angustia, et ira, et timor: et ex omnibus accidentibus corporeis, sicut labor, et poena, et superfluicoitus, et illis similia.	 Place phlebotomy on the chest, on the third day, as we said; and try to let it evacuate his chest that day from all the bad conditions of animals: such as tightness, anger, fear; and from all bodily conditions, such as labor, punishment, superfluity, and similar ones.
Et sedi suae faciat esse praesentes res cum quarum usu cucurrit consuetudo hominum ex aromaticitate, et odoramento, et tripudio et similibus illis per quantitatem possibilitatis.	 Let him place before himself the necessary items that human custom has run with, from which the practice of aromatics, fragrances, joy and similar things are present by the amount possible.
Deinde sedeat phlebotomator super puluinari, quod sit altius quam puluinar phlebotomandi: postea extrahat brachium suum, et fricet ipsum phlebotomator manu sua bis, aut ter.	 Then let the phlebotomist sit on the pulvinar, which shall be higher than the pulvinar for phlebotomy; afterwards he should pull out his arm, and the phlebotomist should rub it with his hand twice or thrice.
Deinde stringat ligamentum cum corrigia, et inuoluat eam bis.	 Then tie the ligature with the cord and wind it around twice.
Et sit strictura temperata, quoniam strictura quando est inaequalis, aut per superfluitatem in strictura, tunc prohibet cursum sanguinis: aut in mollificatione, tunc etiam prohibet cursum sanguinis.	 And let the incision be moderate, since an uneven incision, or excess in the incision, then prevents the flow of blood; or in healing, even then it also prevents the flow of blood.
Deinde post stricturam oportet, ut fricet phlebotomandus manus suas simul adinuicem, donec inflentur uenae, et declarentur sensui.	 Then after the incision, it is necessary that the person being bled rub his hands together until the veins swell and are felt.
Deinde abstergat phlebotomator phlebotomum cum pauco oleo, antiquo proprie.	 Then the phlebotomist shall wash the place of bleeding with a little oil, his own.
Deinde ponat digitum suum indicem manus sinistrae super ipsam uenam sub loco cuius phlebotomiam uult, parum: ut non fugiat uena, et cassetur percussio.	 Then he shall place his index finger of the left hand on the same vein at that spot where he wishes to make the incision, slightly; so that the vein does not run away, and the blow is not wasted.
Quoniam ex uenis est quam inuenis sicut chordam fugientem apud phlebotomiam: et ex eis est quae est plena uentositate: et quando ponis phlebotomum super eam, contrahitur sub phlebotomo, et decipitur phlebotomator, et non aperit phlebotomus uenam: et si aperit eam, est stricta: propter illud ergo oportet, ut firmetur phlebotomator, et sit sollicitus in his rebus omnibus.	 Because from the veins you find one running away like a cord during bleeding; and there is one that is full of windiness; and when you place an incision on it, it contracts under the person who is bleeding, and the person bleeding is deceived, and the cut does not open the vein; and if it opens it, it is closed; for this reason, therefore, the person bleeding must be firm and careful about all these matters.
Deinde deponat phlebotomum.	 Then let the blood-letter (phlebotomist) withdraw.
Si ergo aperitur uena ex uice una, tunc bonum est.	 If it is opened from one vein, then it is good.
Et si non, tunc itera illud uice alia sub illo loco parum, aut supra ipsum cum festinatione: si non apostematur locus.	 And if not, then do it again in another vein at the same place or above it with haste; but do not proceed if the spot is not punctured.
Quod si apostematur, aut expauescit infirmus, tunc dimitte eum die, aut duobus diebus: et non stringat ligamentum.	 If the wound heals or the patient frightens, then let him go home for a day or two; and do not tighten the bandage.
Fortasse enim attrahet apostema calidum.	 For perhaps it will draw an abscess (attrahit = it draws) which is hot.
Neque ingrediatur balneum.	 Do not enter the bath.
Deinde iteret phlebotomiam, si amat.	 Then perform phlebotomy again if necessary.
Quod si apertio est parua, aut currit sanguis subtiliter: et times ut non egrediatur ex sanguine quantitas quam uis: tunc itera phlebotomum in foramine ipso secundum rectitudinem, et adde in operatione parum.	 If the opening is small or the blood runs subtly; fear that the quantity of blood that you wish will not exit; then perform phlebotomy again in the same hole correctly, and add slightly more in the procedure.
Et fac illud cum festinatione, antequam apostemetur locus, apostematus enim locus est in multis hominibus apud operationem paruam.	 Do it quickly before the wound heals, for a healed wound is dangerous in many people during minor procedures.
Si ergo uides ipsum iam apostematum, tunc non iteres super ipsum omnino, non enim excusat apud te aliquid.	 If you see that the abscess has already healed, then do not perform any procedure on it at all; for it will not release anything from you.
Et pone super ipsum aliquid ex faece olei: quoniam alleuiat cursum sanguinis.	 Place something made of oil cloth over it; because it softens the flow of blood.
Et est melior in hoc loco quam oleum ipsum, et quam reliqua olea.	 It is better in this place than olive oil itself and other types of oil.
Et similiter administra faecem olei in omni phlebotomia tua, qua phlebotomas uenas apud prohibitionem cursus sanguinis: et faciunt illud tyriaca alfarach, et sagzenea, quando ponitur ex una earum super locum.	 And similarly administer the oil cloth in every phlebotomy of yours where you perform phlebotomy against the flow of blood; and this is done by Tyriacans, Alfarachs, and Sagzenes when placed on a spot.
Sanguis enim subtiliatur et resoluitur, quando est grossus.	 For the blood becomes thin and dissolves when it is thick.
Quod si accidat in loco phlebotomiae apostema magnum, nam multotiens accidit, praecipue ei qui non est phlebotomatus nisi uice illa, aut est apertio uenae parua, tunc propera et pone super locum spongiam infusam in aqua et sale, calefacta parumper: et stringe eam hora una: quoniam soluitur.	 If a large abscess arises at the site of phlebotomy (accidat = happens), which often occurs, especially to those who are not skilled phlebotomists except for that vein or have a small opening of a vein; then hurry and place on the spot a sponge soaked in water and salt, heated slightly; and tighten it for one hour; because it dissolves.
Et oportet, ut facias illud post exitum sanguinis ex uena ipsa, cum complemento sui, aut ex uena alia.	 And it is necessary that you do that after the outflow of blood from the vein itself, when its completion occurs, or from another vein.
Quod si remanet in loco post dies aliquid nigredinis, aut uiriditatis, non nocet illud: et si uis, pone super ipsum aliquid aloe, aut myrrhae solutorum: aut aliquid ex succo menthastri, id est, calamenti aut simile illius.	 If something remains in the place after several days that is dark or greenish, it does not harm it; and if you wish, put on top of it some aloe or myrrh dissolved; or something from the juice of mint, that is, camphor or similar to that.
Et multotiens quidem accidunt apostemata et eminentiae apud phlebotomiam Basilicae.	 And indeed often boils and eruptions occur near the venuepuncturing in the Basilica.
Pone ergo manum tuam super ipsam, tunc si inuenis molliciem apud compressionem tuam super ipsam, tunc illa eminentia est mala.	 Then place your hand on it; then if you find softness under your pressure on it, then that eruption is bad.
Caue ergo, ut ponas super eam aliquid ex eo quod diximus.	 Be careful, therefore, not to put anything on it from what I said.
Nam fortasse fluet ex ea sanguis arteriae.	 For perhaps blood from an artery will flow out of it.
Sed fac emplastrum ei cum eo in quo est stipticitas, ut induretur locus.	 But make a plaster for him with the substance where there is stiffness, so that the place hardens.
Deinde cura ipsum cum reliqua curatione, donec sanetur.	 Then take care of him with the rest of the treatment until he is healed.
Et oportet, ut extrahas omni homini ex sanguine secundum quantitatem uirtutis suae.	 And it is necessary to extract blood from every man according to the quantity of its virtue.
Et quod apparet ex colore uincente super sanguinem.	 And what appears as a color spreading over the blood.
Nam sanguis si est niger, tunc dimitte ipsum exire, donec rubeat: et similiter si uides ipsum grossum: tunc dimitte eum, donec subtilietur: et similiter si est acutus, donec auferatur acuitas eius.	 For if the blood is black, then let it flow out until it becomes red; and similarly, if you see that it is thick, then let it go until it becomes thinner; and similarly, if it is sharp, let it go until its sharpness is removed.
Et oportet ei qui est plenus, fortis, et indiget extractione sanguinis uice una, ut amplificetur phlebotomia uenae, et sit phlebotomus latus: et in eo qui est debilis, sit econtrario illius.	 And it is necessary for him who is full, strong, and needs bloodletting once to have an increased bloodletting from the vein, and let him be a skilled bloodletter; but in the case of the weak one, let it be otherwise.
Et oportet, ut extrahat ipsum in uicibus, et ut sit foramen strictum: et melius quod administratur in phlebotomia uenae est, ut sit transuersa sectio, non punctura.	 And it is necessary to extract it from the veins and that the opening be narrow; and it is better what is administered in bloodletting from the vein that it is a cross section, not a puncture.
Et iste modus phlebotomiae est saluus a fluxu sanguinis, et ab incisione nerui: et est laudabilior, et saluior quam phlebotomia per latitudinem et longitudinem.	 This method of bloodletting is beneficial in preventing blood flow and nerve cutting; it is more praiseworthy and safer than venesection along both width and length.
Et cui consueuit peruenire apud phlebotomiam syncopis, oportet ut cibes ante phlebotomiam modico pane infuso in aqua granati muzi: aut secaniabin, si est calefactus: et extrahas ei ex sanguine in tribus uicibus, aut quatuor.	 Whoever is accustomed to faint during bloodletting should eat a little bread soaked in water with ground almonds before the bloodletting; or sekanjabin, if he is heated up: and extract from his blood three or four times.
Et si est infrigidatae complexionis, tunc accipiat ante phlebotomiam panem infusum in syrupo miua, aut in syrupo de melle aromatizato cum speciebus, aut in syrupo aromatizato odorifero.	 If the patient's temperament is cold, then before bloodletting, he should receive bread soaked in honey-based syrup, or in a syrup flavored with honey and spices, or in scented aromatic syrup.
Quod si accidat syncopis apud phlebotomiam, et est caussa eius exitus sanguinis multi: tunc oportet, ut sumat in potu aquam carnis, et syrupum odoriferum subtilem: et utatur aromaticitate cum algalia, et liniatur pectus eius cum ea: et utatur reliquis quae diximus in diuisione in capitulo syncopis ex euacuatione.	 If fainting occurs during bloodletting and the cause is excessive blood flow, then it is necessary that he drinks water with meat juice and subtle scented syrup; uses aromatic substances with algalia and has his chest wrapped with it; and uses the remaining as we have said in the division of fainting due to evacuation (in chapter on fainting).
Qui autem uult euentare brachium suum, et soluere sanguinem suum secundo: oportet ei cuius phlebotomia est propter euacuationem multam, et uirtus eius est debilis, ut soluat sanguinem paulatim per quantitatem uirtutis in diebus continuis.	 Whoever wants to let down his arm and release his blood through the second method should do so for a patient whose bloodletting is due to excessive evacuation and whose strength is weak. He should let out his blood gradually according to his strength for continuous days.
Qui uero uult euentare brachium suum, et soluere sanguinem suum secundo, et est corpus eius forte: tunc faciat illud post septem horas, aut nouem a phlebotomia sua prima.	 But whoever wants to let down his arm and release his blood through the second method and his body is full: then he should do that after seven or nine hours from his first bloodletting.
Qui autem uult attrahere sanguinem ex corpore suo ad contrarium partis ad quam declinat: oportet ut euentetur ei in die secundo, aut in tertio.	 But whoever wants to draw blood from his body against the affected part: it should be done on the second or third day.
In cuius uero corpore est sanguis multus iam calefactus, et acuitur, et facit accidere febrem: oportet, ut egrediatur ex eo sanguis in uice una, et extrahatur ex eo quantitas multa: et amplificetur apertio usquequo accidat syncopis: postquam tu fueris conseruans omnes conditiones phlebotomiae: et ut ponas manum tuam super pulsum eius apud cursum sanguinis, ut non accidat mors loco syncopis.	 In a patient whose blood is already heated and sharpening and causing fever: it is necessary that his blood comes out once, and a large amount is taken out; and the incision should be enlarged until fainting occurs; after you have ensured all conditions of bloodletting; and you place your hand on his pulse near the course of blood, so that death does not occur due to fainting.
Multotiens enim accidit illud, quando ignorat phlebotomator, et cadit negligentia.	 "It often happens when the phlebotomator is ignorant, and falls due to negligence.
Et non oportet quando uis soluere brachium, et soluere sanguinem secundo, cum iam clausum sit orificium uenae, et fiat difficilis exitus sanguinis, ut prematur super ipsum cum uehementia, et curuatum extendatur uelociter.	 "It should not be done to solve the arm and release blood when the opening of the vein is already closed and the outflow of blood becomes difficult, so that pressure is applied strongly on it with force, and it is quickly stretched.
Nam illud est malum ualde, imo dimitte ipsum, donec phlebotometur secundo.	 "For this is very bad indeed; on the contrary, let it be left until it can be bled again.
Aut remoue cum acuitate phlebotomi illud quod coagulatum est ex sanguine in orificio uenae, et pone super ipsum aliquid salis dissoluti in aqua.	 "Or remove with sharpness the clot that has formed from blood in the vein opening and place something of salt dissolved in water on it.
Et pone super ipsum aliquid ex tyriaca alfaroch, aut sagzenea, et pone ipsum compressione leni, donec egrediatur sanguis.	 "And put something from turmeric, alfalfa, or sage over it and apply gentle pressure until the blood flows out.
Si uero iam apostemata est uena, tunc dimitte eam, et non tegas eam, donec sedetur apostema.	 "But if the vein is already healed, then let it be and do not cover it until the healing of the wound has set in.
Quod si necessitas prouocat ad soluendum sanguinem secundo, et non est excusatio, tunc aut phlebotoma ipsum supra illum locum, aut in brachio alio in uena alia.	 "If necessity requires the release of blood again and there is no excuse, then either bleed that same place again or bleed from another vein in the other arm.
Funis autem brachii phlebotomatur loco Fuscae, et Basilicae, cum non inueniuntur, et sunt occultae, quoniam est composita ex eis.	 "However, the arm is bled at the place of the 'Fuscum' and 'Basilicum', since they are not found and are hidden, because it consists of them.
Et qualitas phlebotomiae eius est, ut intromittat infirmus manum suam in aqua calida, donec rubeat focile, et appareat uena manifeste.	 "And the quality of bleeding is such that a weak hand is inserted into warm water until it turns red, and the vein appears clearly.
Deinde stringatur super ipsam cum ligamento parum constrictione media.	 "Then tie it over with a cord of moderate tightness.
Deinde phlebotoma secundum transuersationem paulatim, non latitudinaliter, neque secundum longitudinem: et sit apertio ampla, et sit phlebotomia tua qua eam phlebotomas super iuncturam manus parumper.	 "Then the blood is bled transversely gradually, neither longitudinally nor broadly; and the opening should be wide and your bleeding on the juncture of the hand slightly.
Quod si prohibetur exitus sanguinis, tunc itera manum in aqua calida, et dimitte sanguinem currere in aqua, donec consequaris necessitatem tuam.	 "But if the outflow of blood is forbidden, then immerse your hand in warm water and let the blood run into the water until you meet your need.
Si autem fueris in diebus aestatis, tunc excusaris ab iteratione manus in aqua calida.	 If you are during the days of summer, then you may excuse yourself from the repetition of hands in hot water.
Et plurimum quidem ponitur cursus sanguinis in aqua calida in tempore hyemis.	 Much is put upon the course of blood in hot water during wintertime.
Et phlebotomia huius uenae est saluior omnibus uenis, quoniam non est sub ea uena pulsatilis, neque neruus.	 And this vein's phlebotomy is safer than all the veins because it is not beneath a pulsating vein, nor a nerve.
Phlebotomia uero Saluatellae manus dextrae, est conferens aegritudinibus epatis.	 Indeed, this vein's phlebotomy of the right hand is beneficial for liver diseases.
Et qualitas phlebotomiae eius est, ut stringas mahason manus cum ligamento, aut manu tua, postquam tu intromittis eam in aquam calidam, donec infletur uena, et demonsteretur sensui ualde.	 And the quality of this phlebotomy is such that you bind a leach to the hand with thread or with your own hand after inserting it into hot water until the vein swells and becomes very apparent.
Deinde phlebotoma eam transuersando.	 Then perform the phlebotomy by cutting across.
Et si incidis eam totaliter, non nocebit ei illud in aliquo.	 And if you cut it completely, it will not harm him in any way.
Et conserua, ne ultimes manum tuam cum phlebotomo.	 Keep it dry to avoid injuring your hand with the leech.
Sub ea enim sunt nerui digitorum denudati ex carne.	 Indeed, there are nerves of the fingers exposed under it (the vein).
Deinde itera manum ad aquam calidam, et dimitte currere sanguinem in ea.	 Then immerse the hand again in hot water and allow the blood to flow from it.
Nam si tu non iteras eam in aqua calida, coagulatur sanguis in orificio uenae, et prohibetur a cursu.	 For if you do not immerse it in hot water again, the blood will clot at the vein's opening and hinder its flow.
Cum ergo extraxeris ex sanguine quantitatem necessitatis, tunc pone super uenam oleum et sal: ut non consolidetur uelociter.	 When you have drawn the necessary amount of blood, then place oil and salt on the vein so that it does not clot quickly.
Et similiter oportet, ut facias cum omni ramo stricto.	 And similarly, it is necessary to do so with every constricted branch (vein).
Iuuamentum uero phlebotomiae eius ex manu sinistra, est: quoniam est conferens ad aegritudines splenis: et similiter fac in phlebotomia eius, sicut fecisti in secunda aequaliter.	 On the contrary, the aid of this vein's phlebotomy comes from the left hand, because it is beneficial for diseases of the spleen; and similarly, do so in the phlebotomy of this vein as you did in the second one equally.
Saphenae autem phlebotomiae iuuamentum, est ad aegritudines quae sunt in inferiori parte corporis, sicut aegritudines matricum, et retentionem menstruorum, et infirmitates renum, et ulcera coxarum et crurium antiqua, et similia ex aegritudinibus.	 The aid of saphenous vein phlebotomy is for diseases located in the lower part of the body, such as uterine diseases, retention of menstruation, kidney weaknesses, old ulcers of hips and legs, and similar diseases.
Et qualitas phlebotomiae eius est, ut intromittat infirmus pedem suum in aquam calidam: et faciat super ipsum fricationem, donec exuberent uenae: et liga supra iuncturam pedis cum corrigia.	 The quality of phlebotomy is such that the sick person should insert his foot into warm water, and perform friction upon it until the veins swell; then tie above the joint of the foot with ligature.
Et uenae quidem locus est apud calcaneum, apparens uersus pollicem: et ramificantur ex ea in facie pedis rami multi.	 The vein location is at the calcaneum [heel bone], appearing towards the thumb; and they branch out from there into many branches on the face of the foot.
Phlebotoma ergo eam in ampliore ramo eius, aut apud calcaneum in aggregatione eius: quoniam est melius et saluius.	 Therefore, phlebotomy should be done in a larger branch [of the vein] or at its confluence with the heel, because it is better and safer.
Quod si phlebotomas eam in facie pedis, tunc caue a neruis qui sunt sub ea super faciem pedis.	 If phlebotomy is done on the face of the foot, then beware of the nerves that are beneath it on the surface of the foot.
Et pone phlebotomiam tuam qua eam phlebotomas ex transuerso, quasi tu uelis incidere eam: et sit phlebotomus Nesil.	 And place your phlebotomy instrument at an angle, as if you wish to cut it; and the phlebotomist is Nesil.
Si autem prohibetur exitus sanguinis, tunc itera pedem eius in aqua calida: et dimitte sanguinem currere in eam, donec euacuatur.	 If the exit of blood is forbidden, then immerse his foot in warm water; and let the blood flow into it until it has evacuated.
Quod si errat uenam phlebotomator in prima uice, tunc iteret cum phlebotomia ad superiora parumper, nam locus est saluus, et non times ex eo maliciam, quando tu caues a neruis, sicut diximus.	 If the phlebotomist has missed a vein in the first attempt, then return to the same place with the phlebotomy but a little higher up, because the location is safe and there is no fear of harm from it, as long as you beware of the nerves, just as we have said.
Et similiter cum Saphena pedis alterius aequaliter.	 And similarly with the saphenous vein of the other foot.
Venae autem Sciaticae locus, sicut diximus, est apud calcaneum ex latere syluestri.	 The location of the sciatic vein, as we have said, is at the heel on the side of the forest [the medial side].
Et iuuamentum phlebotomiae eius est, ad dolorem anchae, quando est propter sanguinem calidum.	 And a remedy for the pain caused by phlebotomy is to apply warmth when it is due to hot blood.
Et qualitas phlebotomiae eius est, ut ingrediatur infirmus balneum, et festinet: et stringe crus eius a latere anchae usque supra calcaneum quatuor digitis, cum uitta subtili longa: non enim apparet nisi propter illud.	 The quality of phlebotomy is such that the sick person should enter the bath and hasten; and tie his leg from the side of the ankle to above the heel with a thin, long bandage; for it does not appear unless for this reason.
Quando ergo apparet, tunc phlebotoma eam secundum quodcumque ingenium est tibi possibile, aut secundum transuersionem: et est melius, aut ut incidas eam incisione, aut seces eam sectione.	 When it appears, then make an incision on it as your skill allows, either transversely; and it is better, or cut it with a cut, or sever it with a section.
Locus enim eius est saluior, et ipsa est in pluribus hominibus occulta ualde.	 Its place is safer, and it is very well hidden in many people.
Quod si non inuenis eam, et non apparet sensui omnino: tunc phlebotoma aliquem ramum eius, et est ille qui apparet in dorso pedis, et uersus auricularem: et caue a neruis, et fac currere ex sanguine quantitatem quam uis.	 If you cannot find it and it does not appear to the senses at all; then make an incision of one of its branches, and there is one that appears on the back of the foot and turned towards the ear; beware of the nerves, and let the amount of blood flow as you wish.
Deinde solue stricturam, et pone super locum phlebotomiae corium, et stringe locum.	 Then dissolve the constriction, and place skin over the incision site, and tighten it.
Uelociter enim sanatur.	 It heals quickly.
¶ De Ventosatione, et qualitate usus eius.	 On Ventosation, and the quality of its use.
Caput XCVIII.	 Chapter XCVIII.
Uentosae fiunt ex cornibus, et ex aere, et ex uitro.	 They are made from horns, copper, and glass.
Et Ventosatio quidem fit secundum duos modos.	 Ventosation is done in two ways.
Cum scarificatione, et extractione sanguinis: et alter est uentosatio sine scarificatione.	 With scarification and bloodletting; the other is ventosation without scarification.
Et haec Ventosatio quae est sine scarificatione, est secundum duos modos.	 And this type of ventosation which is without scarification, is done in two ways.
Aut enim est cum igne.	 Or it is with fire.
Aut est absque igne.	 Or it is without fire.
Et uentosis quae administrantur cum scarificatione et extractione sanguinis sunt quatuordecim loca corporis.	 And the locations of ventosation which are administered with scarification and bloodletting are fourteen on the body.
Quorum unus est, Ventosatio Alnocrati, et est postremum capitis: et Alkehel, et est medium colli: et uentosae Alhagdahim, et sunt duae laminae colli a duabus partibus simul: et uentosae menti, et est sub mandibula in inferiori oris: et uentosae duarum spatularum: et uentosae Alachosos super finem caudae: et uentosae duorum focilium, et sunt medium duorum brachiorum: et uentosae duorum crurium: et uentosae duarum cauillarum.	 One is the Ventosation of Alnocratis, and it is at the back of the head; Alkehel, and it is in the middle of the neck; ventosations of Alhagdahim, and there are two plates on the neck from both sides simultaneously; ventosations of the brain, and it is below the jaw on the lower part of the mouth; ventosations of the two spatulas; ventosations of Alachosos above the end of the tail; ventosations of the two pectoral glands, and they are in the middle of both arms; ventosations of the two legs; ventosations of the two kidneys.
Et Ventosatio quidem non extrahit sanguinem tibi ex uenis minutis sparsis in carne, et propter illud non cadit uirtus ex eis, sicut est casus eius ex phlebotomia.	 And Ventosatio does not draw blood from you from the fine veins scattered in the flesh, and therefore its power does not fall out of them, as is the case with that incident from phlebotomy.
Neque oportet, ut administretur uentosatio siue cum igne, aut absque igne in aliqua aegritudinum quae fiunt ex repletione, donec euacuetur totum corpus.	 It is not necessary to administer Ventosatio with fire, or without fire for any illness caused by congestion, until the entire body has been evacuated.
Quod si necessitas prouocat ad Ventosationem ex aegritudine, aut propter consuetudinem, administramus eam in omni hora in principio mensis, in fine eius, et in medio ipsius, et in quocumque tempore fuerit.	 If necessity requires Ventosation due to illness or custom, we administer it at the beginning, middle, and end of every month, and at any other time when necessary.
Quod est, quia ex hominibus est qui quando multiplicatur in eo sanguis, donec indiget extractione eius per uentosationem, inuenit in capite suo grauedinem, et sodahan.	 Because there is a man who, when his blood is multiplied in him and he does not require its extraction through Ventosation, finds pain and swelling in his head.
Et ex eis est qui inuenit repletionem et rubedinem in facie sua, capite suo, et collo suo.	 And among them is one who finds congestion and redness on his face, his head, and his neck.
Et ex eis est qui inuenit pruritum in facie sua, et fronte sua, et tenebrositatem, et hebetudinem in oculis suis.	 And among them is one who finds itching on his face and forehead, and darkness and dullness in his eyes.
Et ex eis est qui scalpit locum uentosationis suae.	 And there is one among them who scratches the place of his Ventosation.
Et ex eis est cuius risus multiplicatur.	 And among them is one whose laughter increases.
Et ex eis est qui inuenit gustum sanguinis in ore suo: aut apostematur lingua, et expuit sanguinem.	 And there is one among them who finds a taste of blood in his mouth: or the tongue is loosened and the blood is spat out.
Et ex eis est cuius somnus multiplicatur.	 And among them is one whose sleep increases.
Et ex eis est qui uidet in somno suo sanguinem et rubedinem, et interfectos, et plagas, et quae sunt similia illis.	 And there is one among them who sees blood and redness in his sleep, as well as the dead, wounds, and things similar to those.
Quando ergo uidemus aliquid ex illis, et proprie si est in tertia media mensis: praecipimus tunc uentosationem fieri, postquam praeterierunt de die duae horae, aut tres.	 When we see something among them, especially if it is during the third quarter of the month: we then prescribe Ventosation to be performed after two or three hours have passed.
Iuuamentum autem Ventosationis nuchae, est: quoniam ipsa confert ad grauitatem in capite, et quod effunditur ad oculos.	 The benefit of Ventosation for the neck is that it alleviates heaviness in the head, and what is expelled is directed towards the eyes.
At uero oportet, ut sit illud post euacuationem totius corporis.	 It is necessary for it to be after evacuation of the entire body.
Et haec quidem Ventosa est loco phlebotomiae Cephalicae.	 This [procedure] indeed is a ventose in place of cephalic phlebotomy.
Et non licet, ut utatur ea qui est frigidae complexionis, aut in quo est catarrus.	 It is not allowed for one with cold constitution to use it or in someone who has catarrh.
Nam infert ei nocumentum magnum.	 For it does great harm to him [or her].
Et propter illud non oportet, ut utantur ea senes, et in cuius capite sunt aegritudines frigidae.	 It is not proper for the elderly or someone with cold-related headaches to use it.
Qui autem super eam fit assiduus, generatur super eum obliuio.	 He who makes frequent use of it generates forgetfulness in him [or her].
Et propter illud oportet, ut praecipias Ventosatori, ut deponat manum suam cum uentosa parumper ad inferiora, timendo ex generatione obliuionis.	 Therefore, it is necessary for you to instruct the ventosator [operator] to withdraw his hand slightly downwards during venting to avoid generating forgetfulness.
Ventosatio aut Alkehel, est loco phlebotomiae Fuscae, et phlebotomiae Basilicae, et propter illud confert asmati, et constrictioni anhelitus, et fissurae instrumenti anhelitus, et tussi, et repletioni.	 Ventosation or Alkehel is in place of phlebotomy Fusca and basilica, and it causes coughing, constricted breathing, shortness of breath due to instrument splitting, coughing, stuffiness, and filling [of the body with air].
Et oportet, ut impellatur Ventosa Alkehel parumper, quoniam si ponitur inferius, generat debilitatem in corde, et stomacho.	 And it should be pushed slightly upwards during ventosation of Alkehel because if placed lower down, it generates weakness in the heart and stomach.
Ventosatio uero alhagdahim, confert doloribus accidentibus in capite, et obtalmiae, et hemigraneae, et perforationi, et dolori in radicibus dentium: et est loco phlebotomiae Basilicae.	 Ventosation alhagdahim causes headaches, migraines, eye pain, and tooth pain: it is in place of basilica phlebotomy.
Et oportet, ut praecipias Ventosatori, ne premat manum suam cum scarificatione: ut non incidat arteriam, et accidat fluxus sanguinis.	 You must instruct the ventosator not to press his hand during scarification to avoid cutting an artery and causing bleeding.
Ventosatio autem sub mento, confert alcolae in ore, et corruptioni gingiuae, et similibus eis ex aegritudinibus quae sunt in ore: et stat loco phlebotomiae alieherich, quae sunt in duobus labiis.	 Ventosation under the chin causes alcohol in the mouth, corruption of gums, and similar symptoms such as those that occur in the mouth: it is in place of other forms of phlebotomy which are located on the two lips.
Ventosatio autem spatularum, confert ad alchafacham, quae fit ex replexione, et caliditate.	 Ventosation with a spatula causes alchafacha, which comes from tension and heat.
Ventosatio uero interiorum partium duorum focilium, confert iuuamentum phlebotomiae uenarum trium, Basilicae, et Fuscae, et Cephalicae: quoniam ipsa attrahit sanguinem ex omnibus illis uenis minutis, quae sunt in carne: et attrahunt illae uenae minutae ex uenis aliis grossioribus eis, donec peruenit attractio ad uenas tres.	 Interior parts' ventosation provides help for phlebotomy of the three veins, Basilica, Fusca, and Cephalica: because it draws blood from all those small veins that are in flesh; and these small veins draw blood from larger ones until attraction reaches the three veins.
Et oportet, ut praecipias Ventosatori, ne multum procedat in scarificatione: quoniam locus est denudatus carne, et sub eo sunt nerui et arteriae.	 It is necessary that you warn the Ventosator not to proceed too much in scarification: because the place is bare of flesh, and beneath it are nerves and arteries.
Ventosa autem quae uentosatur super alchausos, confert hemorroidibus Ani, et ulceribus inferioribus.	 The ventosa which is used for ventosation on anus, provides help for hemorrhoids of anus, and for lower ulcers.
Et oportet, ut praecipias Ventosatori, ut sit uentosa magna, et ut sit ex aere: quoniam locus indiget suctione forti, et fortasse franguntur Ventosae subtiles: et scarificetur scarificatione magna.	 It is necessary that you warn the Ventosator to have the ventosa large, and of air: because the place needs strong suction, and perhaps small ventosas break; and it should be scarified with a large scarifier.
Ventosae autem crurium minuunt diminutione manifesta: quoniam attrahunt sanguinem ex toto corpore, et conferunt doloribus antiquis in renibus, et matricibus, et uesica: prouocant menstrua, et conferunt bothor, et ademenul: et stant loco phlebotomiae duarum saphenarum, et alhorcobeni.	 The ventosae of legs diminish in a manifestly clear manner: because they draw blood from the whole body, and they provide old pains in kidneys, uterus, and bladder; they provoke menstruation, and they provide bothor, and ademenul; and they stand at the place of phlebotomy for two saphenas, and alhorcobeni.
Verumtamen debilitant corpus multum, et faciunt accidere syncopim in pluribus hominibus.	 However, they weaken the body greatly, and cause fainting to occur in many men.
Et Ventosarum alhorcobeni iuuamentum est propinquum iuuamento Ventosarum duorum crurium.	 And the help of ventosa alhorcobeni is close to the help of ventosa for two legs.
Qualitas positionis Ventosarum est, ut ponas uentosam in primis uacuam, et sugas suctione temperata: et non prolonges positionem uentosarum, sed pone eas uelociter, et remoue eas uelociter, ut ueniant humores ad locum aduentu aequali: et non cesses iterare illud et continuare, donec uideas locum iam rubere et inflari, et appareat rubedo sanguinis: tunc ergo scarifica, et itera suctione paulatim.	 The quality of the position of ventosae is that you place the ventosa first in an empty area, and suck with moderate suction; and do not prolong the position of ventosae, but put them quickly, and remove them quickly, so that humors come to the place of arrival equally: and do not cease to repeat it and continue until you see the place already redden and swell, and the redness appears to be blood; then scarify, and gradually continue suction.
Deinde considera in dispositione corporum.	 Then consider in the arrangement of bodies.
Nam qui ex hominibus est tenerae carnis, rarorum pororum, oportet ut scarifices ipsum semel, non plus: ut non ulceretur locus.	 For one who is from soft flesh and rare pores, it is necessary to make a single incision, not more: so that the place does not ulcerate.
Et praecipe Ventosatori, ut amplificet scarificationem, et profundet parum: et temperet suctionem in facilitate, et uelocitate, et motu suaui.	 And order the Wind-finder to enlarge the incision and not too deeply: and regulate the suction in ease, speed, and gentle motion.
Quod si in sanguine est grossitudo, tunc oportet, ut scarifices ipsum bis.	 If there is a thickening in the blood, then it is necessary to make an incision twice.
In uice quidem prima aperitur uia subtiliationi sanguinis, et aquositati eius: et in secunda quidem perscrutationi exquisitae extractionis sanguinis grossi.	 In the first vein (artery), an opening is made for the subtle blood and its moisture; and in the second scrutiny for the extraction of thick blood.
Si uero sanguis est faeculentus ualde, tunc fiat scarificatio uice tertia: ut consequatur ultimum.	 If indeed the blood is very foul, then make an incision a third time: that it may follow the final one.
Et ad ultimum, quando uolumus extrahere sanguinem paulatim, uel parumper, sufficit nobis scarificatio una.	 And at last, when we want to extract blood gradually or slightly, a single incision is sufficient for us.
Quod si uolumus extractionem sanguinis multi, scarificamus scarificatione plurima.	 If we wish to extract much blood, make the incisions with multiple incisions.
Et si nos mensuramus, quod sanguis est grossus: tunc oportet, ut scarificetur scarificatione profunda: et terminus aequalis in scarificatione, est profunditas cutis.	 And if we measure that the blood is thick, then it is necessary to make a deep incision: and the end equal in the incision is the depth of the skin.
¶ Quid sit illud quod oportet administrari ex oleis apud positionem Ventosarum, et quid caueat uentosandus.	 What is that which must be administered with oils for the position of the Wind-finder, and what must the Wind-finder avoid?
IN illo quidem cuius cutis est grossa, dura, fusca, et pori eius sunt stricti, oportet ut ungantur loca Ventosare cum oleis apertiuis, lenitiuis, resolutiuis: si est in tempore aestatis, sicut est oleum alkeiri, aut oleum uiolatum, aut oleum de amigdalis dulcibus, aut oleum de semine cucurbitae.	 In the one whose skin is thick, hard, dark, and the pores of which are narrow, it is necessary to anoint the places of the Wind-finder with oils that are opening, softening, resolving: if it is in summer, such as aloe oil, or olive oil, or oil from sweet almonds, or oil from squash seeds.
Et si est in tempore hyemis, tunc oleum narcissinum, aut oleum de lilio, aut oleum camomellinum, aut sarbatinum: et eis similia.	 And if it is in winter, then use narcissus oil, or oil of the lily, or chamomile oil, or saffron: and similar to these.
Si uero superfluitas est grossa, frigida: tunc oleum sit amaracinum, aut oleum de balsamita aut oleum alben, aut oleum anetinum: et eis similia.	 If the swelling is large and cold, then use bitter almond oil, or balsam oil, or sweet almond oil, or sesame oil and similar ones.
Si uero uentosandus est amplorum pororum, tenerae carnis: tunc oportet, ut prohibeatur ab oleo, et oportet ut isti abluant loca Ventosarum earum post uentosationem cum aqua rosata, aut cum aqua frigida, aut cum aqua solatri, aut cum aqua cucurbitae, aut cum aqua portulacae: et similibus eis.	 If the swelling is small and soft, then oil should be prohibited. It is necessary that they rinse the affected areas with rose water after swelling has occurred, or with cold water, or with sea water, or with pumpkin juice, or with purslane water, and similar ones.
Ille autem cuius sanguis est multae humiditatis, abluat uentosas cum aceto, aut cum aqua myrti, et sumach: et similibus eis.	 He whose blood is of great moisture, let him rinse the swellings with vinegar, or with water of myrtle, and sumac; and similar ones.
Cuius autem superfluitates sunt grossae, abluat uentosas suas cum uino antiquo, aut cum aqua samsuci, aut decoctione aneti, aut camomillae: et eis similibus.	 For whom the swellings are large, let him rinse his swellings with old wine, or with water of fennel, or with anise decoction, or chamomile; and similar ones.
Et oportet, ut caueatur uentosatio in balneo, aut in uestigio balnei, imo oportet, ut administretur post exitum ex balneo per horam, aut per horas duas.	 It is necessary to avoid swelling in the bath or near the bath, rather it should be administered after leaving the bath for an hour, or for two hours.
Et non oportet, ut dormiat aliquis post uentosationem.	 It is not necessary that anyone sleeps after swelling.
¶ Quid est quo oportet ut regatur Ventosandus, aut Phlebotomatus ante uentosationem.	 [Paragraph: What should be done to control swelling or bleeding before swelling occurs.]
ET post eam oportet, ut consideres in primis: tunc si Ventosatus, aut Phlebotomatus sit cholericus, et uincunt super sanguinem eius acuitas et inflammatio: tunc oportet, ut accipiat infrigidantia, sicut granatum muzum: et etiam endiuiam cum aceto et lactuca, et secaniabin, et iuleb: et eis similia.	 And after that, it is necessary to consider first: then if the swelling or bleeding person is choleric and his acuity and inflammation overpowers his blood, then it is necessary for him to receive cooling agents, such as mulberry; also endive with vinegar and lettuce, and cucumber, and yarrow; and similar ones.
Et pone cibaria eius pullos, et carnes ouium sekebiget, et cibos conditos cum agresta: et eis similia.	 And let his food be chickens, and cooked sheep's meat, and condiments with sourness; and similar ones.
Et cuius complexio est frigida, oportet ut sumat in potu syrupum de melle, aut de almiua, aut alsecaniabin de seminibus factum: et sumat uinum odoriferum medium, quod est inter uetus et nouum: et praecipiatur, ut utatur paucitate cibi.	 And for whom the complexion is cold, it is necessary to take syrup in drink made from honey, or almond, or yarrow seed; and drink medium-aged wine, which is between old and new; and it is ordered that he use sparingly food.
Et pone cibum eius pullos, et canebir: et passeres, id est, paruas aues: et pullos columborum issiadebet.	 Place his food with the young birds, and let him eat them: and swallow them, that is to say, small birds: and let him eat the young pigeons.
Et oportet, ut potus die uentosationis et phlebotomiae plus sit quam cibus: et oportet, ut detur in potu in quibusdam hominibus in horis tyriaca alfaroch, aut medicamen de musco, id est, muscata, aut alesselithe ante uentosationem: et ante phlebotomiam, aut post: ut confortentur membra principalia, et subtilietur sanguis.	 It is necessary that the drink on the day of venesection and phlebotomy be more than the food: and it is necessary that in some people in the hours of tyriaca alfaroch or medicine from musk, that is, muscat oil, or aleselithe be given before venesection: and before phlebotomy, or after: to strengthen the principal members, and to make the blood thin.
Et non oportet, ut sumant eam in potu calefacto.	 And it is not necessary that they drink it heated.
¶ De Ventosis sine scarificatione.	 Chapter on Venesection without Scarification.
Uentosae autem quae sunt sine scarificatione, sunt Ventosae quae ponuntur super epar, et splenem, et podagram, et super uentrem, umbilicum, et loca renum, et pixidem anchae: quoniam ista membra non sufferunt scarificationem super se.	 The venesections that are without scarification, are the venesections that are placed on the liver, and spleen, and podagra, and on the abdomen, navel, and places of kidneys, and bladder: because these members do not bear scarification upon them.
Et non quaeritur per eas, nisi aut attactio ex membro sanguinis ad membrum: sicut ponimus Ventosam super mammillas in aegritudine fluxus sanguinis narium.	 And it is not sought through them, except by the attraction of blood from one member to another: as we place the venesection on the breasts in the illness of nasal bleeding.
Et utimur eis, ut soluamus a membro uentositatem frigidam inuiscatam in membro: sicut ponimus uentosam super uentrem, et umbilicum.	 And we use them to remove the cold venosity unappealing in one member from another: as we place the venesection on the abdomen and navel.
Ipsa enim rarificat membrum, et calefacit ipsum, et remouet dolorem propterea, quia resoluit illam uentositatem.	 For it dries the member, and warms it up, and removes pain because it has removed that venosity.
Etiam ponitur super renes, quando accidit in eis opilatio, aut lapis.	 It is also placed on the kidneys when there is an obstruction, or a stone.
Uirtute enim attractionis suae fortasse aperit opilationem, aut eradicat lapidem ex loco suo.	 By its virtue of attraction perhaps it opens up obstruction, or eradicates the stone from its place.
Et similiter facit quando ponitur super epar, et splenem apud uentositatem terendam in eis utrisque.	 And similarly it does when placed on the liver and spleen for the venosity to be removed in both.
Et istae Ventosae administrantur uacuae cum sectione tantum.	 And the Ventosae are administered empty when cut only.
Et quandoque administrantur cum igne.	 And at times they are administered with fire.
Et quandoque administrantur plenae aqua tepida in aegritudinibus pleuresis: et illud est, ut impleatur Ventosa, et sit magna, aqua calida sola, aut aqua in qua decoctae sint herbae quae conueniunt.	 And at times they are filled with warm water for pleurisy conditions; and this is to fill the Ventosa, and it should be large, with only hot water, or water in which cooked herbs that agree have been steeped.
¶ Forma Ventosae administratae cum igne.	 Form of the Ventosa administered with fire.
Sit amplitudo orificii eius duorum digitorum apertorum, secundum quod formauimus: et quantitas eius in profundo sit medietas palmi: et sit in latere eius in loco qui est circiter medium eius, foramen paruum, secundum quantitatem quod ingrediatur ipsum acus: fiat ex aere simul, aut citrino, grossorum marginum, lenium, aequalium, tersorum: ut non laedat membrum apud positionem suam super ipsum: et sit in medio eius uirga transuersa ex aere, aut ferro, ubi ponitur candela cum igne.	 The width of its opening should be two fingers open, as we have made; and the depth should be half the size of a palm; and on its side in the place that is approximately midway through it, there shall be a small hole, according to the size that can enter it with an awl; it should be made of bronze or citrine, smooth, equal edges, polished; so as not to harm the limb at its position above it; and in the middle of it there shall be a cross bar transverse from bronze or iron, where the candle is placed with fire.
Et iam fit haec uentosa magna, maior ea quam narrauimus, et parum minor illa, secundum aegritudines et aetatem eius qui utitur.	 And now this Ventosa is made large, larger than what we have described, but not much smaller, according to the conditions and age of the one who uses it.
Ventosae enim puerorum, et extenuatorum sunt aliae, quam uentosae uirorum, et grossorum corporum.	 For indeed, the Ventosa for children and weak ones are different from the Ventosa for men and robust bodies.
Qualitas autem ponendi hanc uentosam cum igne super membrum, est, ut accendas licinium cum igne ex lino decenter, aut candelam paruam ex caera: et pone eam super medium uirgae transuersae quae est in medio uentosae: ut sit accensus ignis circiter inferiorem partem uentosae, ut non comburatur corpus infirmi.	 The quality of placing this Ventosa with fire on a limb is to burn linen cloth or a small candle from wax and place it on the middle cross bar that is in the center of the Ventosa; so that the fire is below the lower part of the Ventosa, so as not to burn the weak body.
Deinde ponatur super membrum: et digitus sit super foramen quod dixi, donec quando tenemus uentosam: dum indigemus, auferamus digitum, et egredietur uapor super illud foramen, et soluetur uentosa statim.	 Then it is placed on a limb; and the finger should be on the hole that I said, until we hold the Ventosa; when we need to, remove the finger, and the vapor will exit through the hole, and the Ventosa will break immediately.
Deinde igni licinium secundum modum suum, et itera eam, si indiges illa.	 Then heat the linen cloth according to its kind, and repeat if necessary.
In Ventosa autem quae administratur in aegritudine pleuresis cum aqua, non est uirga transuersa, neque foramen: et non administratur, nisi quia impletur aqua, et ponitur super membrum tantum.	 In the plaster that is administered in case of pleurisy with water, there is no transverse rod nor hole: and it is not applied except because it is filled with water and placed only on the member.
Et haec est forma eius.	 And this is its form.
Et haec Ventosa quanto plus est magna, ut capiat aquam multam, est melior.	 And this plaster is better when it is larger so that it can hold more water.
¶ De suspensione Sanguisugarum.	 Chapter on Suspension of Sanguisugarum (Sugarcane).
Caput XCIX.	 Chapter XCIX.
Sanguisugae non administrantur in pluribus, nisi in quibus membris non est possibilis positio uentosarum, propter paruitatem eorum, sicut labium, et gingiua, et eis similia.	 Sugarcane juice is not administered in many places except where it is impossible to position fumigating vapors due to their smallness, such as lips, gums, and similar places.
Aut in membro denudato a carne, sicut digitus, et nasus, et eis similia.	 Or on a naked member like the finger or nose, and similar places.
Et qualitas utendi eis est: ut ueneris ex Sanguisugis quae sunt in aquis dulcibus, mundis a putredinibus.	 And the quality of using them is: to come from sugarcane that are in sweet, clean waters free from decay.
Deinde dimittantur die et nocte in aqua dulci, donec famelicae sint, et non remaneat in uentre earum aliquid.	 Then they are left day and night in sweet water until they become hungry and there remains nothing in their stomachs.
Deinde euacuetur corpus in primis cum phlebotomia, et cum uentosis.	 Afterwards, the body should be evacuated first with bloodletting and with fumigating vapors.
Deinde absterge membrum infirmi, donec rubeat.	 Then clean the sick member until it turns red.
Postea ponantur super ipsum.	 Afterwards, they are placed upon it.
Cum ergo implentur, et cadunt, et est possibilis suctio loci cum uentosa, tunc est magis ultimum in iuuamento: et si non, tunc ablue locum cum aceto.	 When they are filled and fall, and it is possible to suck the place with fumigating vapors, then it is more effective in helping: and if not, then clean the place with vinegar.
Deinde cum aqua multa, et fricetur, et exprimatur.	 Afterwards, when much water is added, it is rubbed and pressed out.
Quod si prolongatur cursus sanguinis post casum Sanguisugarum, et est illud resudando: tunc infunde pannum lini in aqua frigida, et pone ipsum desuper, donec abscindatur resudatio.	 If the course of blood continues after the use of sugarcane, and it needs to be sweated out, then immerse a linen cloth in cold water and place it on top until the perspiration stops.
Quod si multiplicatur sanguis, tunc pulueriza super ipsum zegi tritum, aut gallas, et similia eis ex stipticis: donec abscindatur sanguis.	 If blood is multiplied, then sprinkle on it powdered zegi that has been crushed, or gall, and similar things from spices: until the blood is cut off.
Aut ponantur super locum medietates fabarum excorticatarum: et dimittantur, donec adhaereant fabae in loco, nam sanguis abscinditur.	 Or place pieces of peeled beans there: and allow them to remain until the beans stick to the place, for the blood is cut off when this happens.
Et oportet si necessaria est iteratio Sanguisugarum, quando est possibile, mutare eas.	 And it is necessary that, if the use of Sanguisugum is required, they should be changed when possible.
Si autem prohibentur Sanguisugae a suspensione, tunc abstergatur locus cum sanguine recenti.	 But if Sanguisugae are forbidden from suspension, then the place with fresh blood is washed.
Aut fige acum in locis, donec egrediatur aliquid ex sanguine.	 Or insert a lancet into the places until something comes out of the blood.
Deinde ponantur, nam ipsae quando sentiunt aliquid ex sanguine, adhaerent statim.	 Then they should be placed, for they themselves will immediately stick when they sense something from the blood.
Quando ergo uis ut cadant, pulueriza super eas aliquid ex aloe trito, aut salem, aut cinerem: et cadent statim.	 When it is desired that they fall, sprinkle something from crushed aloes onto them, or salt, or ashes: and they will immediately fall.
¶ Partis Secundae Finis.	 End of the Second Part.
¶ Liber Chirurgici Albucasis Pars III.	 Third Book of the Surgeon's Book of Albucasis.
¶ Sermo uniuersalis de restauratione, et dislocatione, et curatione torsionis, et similibus.	 Discourse on the restoration, dislocation, and treatment of twisting and similar conditions.
Caput I.	 Chapter I.
Hoc Capitulum etiam multotiens est necessarium in arte Medicinae, et est restauratio fracturae, et dislocationis accidentium in ossibus.	 This chapter is also often necessary in the art of medicine and is the restoration of a fracture or dislocation of bones.
Scitote o Filii, quia iactant se de hoc Capitulo stolidi medicorum et uulgi, et qui non inspexerunt unquam antiquorum librum, neque legerunt ex eo literam.	 Know that foolish physicians and the common people boast about this chapter, and those who have never examined an ancient book or read a letter from it.
Et propter hanc caussam fit, quod iste modus ex scientiis in terra nostra est priuatus.	 And for this reason, because this method has been deprived among the learned in our land.
Et ego non obuiaui in eo unquam bono omnino, et non adeptus sum ex eo illud, quod sum adeptus nisi propter longitudinem lectionis librorum antiquorum, et studium super intellectum eorum, donec extraxi scientiam illius ex eis.	 I myself have never been familiar with this method in any way, nor have I gained knowledge of it except through the length of reading ancient books and my devotion to understanding them until I extracted that knowledge from them.
Deinde adhaesi experimento et studio longitudine uitae meae.	 Then I clung to experience and prolonged life.
Et iam descripsi uobis ex illo in hoc Capitulo totum quod continet scientia mea: et super quod praeteriit experimentum meum, postquam abbreuiaui illud uobis, et liberaui illud ex occupatione elongationis, et abbreuiaui illud fine abbreuiationis, et ostendi illud fine declinationis: et formaui in eo formas multas ex formis instrumentorum quae administrantur in eo, cum sit ex additione declinationis, sicut feci in duobus Capitulis praecedentibus.	I have already described to you all that my knowledge contains within this Chapter: and beyond what my experience has reached, after I abbreviated it for you, and released it from the prolongation of occupation, and abbreviated it at the end of abbreviation, and showed it at the end of declination; and I formed in it many shapes of instruments used within it, since it is through addition of declination, as I did in the two preceding Chapters.
¶ Summae, et collectiones ex esse fracturae ossium, ex eis quarum praemissio necessaria est, antequam incipiamus rememorationem membrorum fractorum, et diuersorum, si uniuscuiusque.	 I have described for you the sums and collections of fractures of bones, from those whose premise is necessary before we begin the recollection of fractured limbs, and various ones, if any one of them.
Caput II.	 Chapter II.
Oportet, ut dicamus in prologo huius Capituli, summas sermonis, et capitula, ad quarum intellectum cogitur in primis artifex ad stationem super earum ueritatem: scilicet ut uos, et qui sunt prompti, sciant, uel addiscant hanc artem nobilem, et alii a uobis.	 It is necessary that we state in the preface of this Chapter, the main points and headings, to which the understanding of the craftsman is first required regarding their truth; namely that you, and those who are quick, should know or learn this noble art, and others from you.
Dico, ergo, quod quando accidit alicui fractura, aut dislocatio, aut torsio, aut casus: tunc oportet, ut properes in primis ad phlebotomandum eum, et soluendum ipsum, aut utraque simul: si non prohibeat aliquid, sicut debilitas uirtutis: aut est ille cui accidit aliquid ex illis puer, aut senex decrepitus: aut est tempus uehementis caloris, aut uehementis frigoris ualde.	 Therefore, I say that when any fracture, dislocation, twisting, or accident happens, then it is necessary to rush at once to bleed him and solve the problem, or both at the same time; unless something forbids it, such as weakness of strength; or he who has it is a child, an old man weakened, or there is a time of intense heat, or very intense cold.
Deinde sit contentus in cibo suo, oleribus frigidis, et carnibus auium, et haedorum: et prohibe uinum, et carnes grossas, et repleri ex cibis et omni cibo qui replet uenas sanguine.	 Then let him be content with his food, cold vegetables, and turnips, and beans; and let wine, heavy meats, and filling foods from every kind of food that fills the veins with blood be prohibited.
Donec quando securus sis ex apostemate calido, et non times effusionem materiei ad membrum: tunc redeat infirmus ad regimen suum primum cum quo cucurrit consuetudo eius.	 Until you are secure from hot fever and not fearful of the emission of matter to the limb; then let the sick person return first to his own diet with which his custom is accustomed.
Cum ergo incipit os fractum restaurari, tunc oportet, ut cibetur infirmus cibis nutrientibus nutrimento multo, grosso, graui, in quibus sit uiscositas: sicut cibaria facta ex tritico cocto cum aqua, et rizum, et capita, et pedes, et uentres uaccarum, et oua, et pisces recentes: et uinum grossum, et similia illis.	 When the broken bone begins to heal, it is then necessary that the sick person be fed with nourishing foods in abundance, thick, heavy, containing viscosity; such as food made from cooked wheat with water, rice, and heads, and feet, and entrails of cattle, and eggs, and fresh fish; and thick wine, and similar things.
Cum hoc enim regimine fit coagulatio fracturae uelocius, et melius.	 When this regimen is applied, the healing of the fracture occurs more quickly and better.
Et scias, quod ossa fracta, quando sunt in uiris qui sunt in prima senectute, et decrepitis, non est possibile, ut continuentur et consolidentur secundum naturam suam semper, propter exiccationem membrorum eorum: et consolidantur et continuantur quae ex eis sunt in fine lenitatis, sicut ossa puerornm paruorum.	 And know that broken bones, in men who are in the first old age and are weakened, cannot always be united and consolidated according to their nature, due to drying out of their members; and they consolidate and unite what is from them at the end of softness, such as the bones of small children.
Verumtamen natura annectit super os fractum ex omni parte aliquid simile glutino, in quo est grossitudo, quo adhaeret et stringit ipsum, donec conglutinantur adinuicem, et ligantur adinuicem, donec uenit in fine fortitudinis et firmitudinis, sicut fuit in primis, donec non prohibet ipsum aliquid ab operationibus suis: et propter hanc caussam est necesse, ut ponas nutrimentum infirmi cibaria, in quibus sunt grauitas, et uiscositas, et grossitudo, sicut diximus.	 Nevertheless, nature annexes something resembling glue to the broken bone from all sides, in which there is thickness, with which it adheres and tightens it until they are consolidated against each other and bound together until it comes to the end of strength and firmness, as it was at first, until it does not prohibit anything from its operations; and for this reason it is necessary that you place nourishment for the sick with heavy foods, containing viscosity and thickness, as we have said.
Et scias, quod fracturae species sunt diuersae, secundum diuersitatem membrorum: quoniam fractura cruris, est diuersa a fractura ossis capitis: et fractura ossis pectoris, est diuersa a fractura ossis dorsi: et similiter reliqua membra omnia diuersa existunt adinuicem: et ego ueni cum rememoratione omnis speciei fracturae expositae in Capitulo suo distinctae ab alia.	 And know that the types of fractures are diverse, according to the diversity of the members; because a fracture of the leg is different from a fracture of the bone of the head: and a fracture of the bone of the chest is different from a fracture of the bone of the back: and similarly all other members are different from each other; and I come with a reminder of every type of fracture exposed in its own chapter.
Et diuersificantur species fracturae ossis etiam in seipsa.	 The species of bone fracture are diversified even within themselves.
Quoniam fit fractura eius arcuata, praeter quod accidant in ea astellae.	 Since the fracture of it is curved, what happen in it are also stars (or studs).
Et quandoque fit fractura eius secundum longitudinem ossis: et sunt fracturae eius satagiae, id est, astellae, et additiones procedentes, sicut sunt in calamo, cum aptatur cultello ad scribendum.	 And sometimes the fracture of it happens along the length of the bone; and there are fractures called stars (or studs), that is, studs, and additions coming forth, as in a reed when a knife is prepared for writing.
Et non procedentes: et est fractura cum uulnere et disruptione in capite: et est fractura fissura parua.	 And not proceeding; and it is a fracture with wound and rupture at the head; and it is a small cleft fracture.
Et omni speciei est ingenium, uel instrumentum proprium in restauratione eius, secundum quod ueniet rememoratio eius, distincta in locis suis.	 And each species has its skill, or proper tool for its restoration, according to which its memory will come, distinguished in their places.
Et ex eo quo cognoscitur fractura ossis, est tortuositas eius, et ipsius eminentia: et apparitio eius sensui, et sonitus eius quando comprimis ipsum manu tua.	 And from that which the bone fracture is known, there is its curvature, and its prominence; and its appearance to the sense, and its sound when you press it with your hand.
Quando ergo non est in loco tortuositas apparens, neque sonitus apud tactum tuum cum tangis os cum agitatione, neque inuenit infirmus magnum dolorem: tunc non est illic fractura, imo possibile est, ut sit tortuositas, aut fissura parua: non ergo oportet, ut moueas ipsum cum manu et compressione omnino, imo pone super ipsum ex medicinis, quarum uenit rememoratio, post momentum illud quod conuenit loco: deinde stringatur strictura subtili.	 When therefore the curvature is not appearing in place, nor a sound when you touch it with pressure on the bone, nor does it find a large pain; then there is no fracture there, indeed it is possible that it is a curvature or a small cleft fracture; therefore, do not move it with your hand and compression at all, but rather put some medicine over it where its memory is, after the appropriate time has passed; then compress the bandage with subtle tension.
Et scias, quod locus quando arcuatur, et scinditur in duo, praeter quod accidant in eo satagiae, uerumtamen remouetur omnis pars a compari sua: tunc oportet tibi, ut incipias ab hora tua ad rectificationem eius, aequando ipsum antequam accidat ei apostema calidum.	 And know that when the place is curved and split into two, except for studs (or stars), remove all parts from their natural position; then it will be necessary for you to begin at your hour for its correction, equalizing it before a hot abscess occurs.
Si autem accidat ei apostema calidum, tunc dimitte ipsum diebus aliquot, donec quiescat apoestema.	 If, however, a hot abscess occurs, then let it be for several days until the abscess subsides.
Deinde aequa ipsum secundum quemcunque modum potest ex lenitate et ingenio.	 Then, cut it evenly according to whatever method can be done with kindness and skill.
Et scias, quod restauratio eius, et ipsius aequatio, est facilior quam ossis, in quo accidunt satagiae.	 And know that the restoration of it, and its alignment, is easier than bone, in which complications may occur.
Deinde stringe ipsum, secundum quod ueniet tibi rememoratio eius.	 Then tie it, as your memory recalls it.
Si uero in osse sunt satagiae, tunc necessaria est extensio huius membri fracti ex duabus partibus, si manus sit, aut pes: aut cum manu tua, si membrum est paruum: aut cum duobus funibus, aut cum fune et manu.	 If there are complications in the bone, then it is necessary to extend this fractured limb from both parts, whether it be a hand or foot; or with your hand, if the member is small; or with two ropes, or with a rope and your hand.
Et sit positio tua qua ponis membrum super locum aequalem, secundum figuram suam naturalem, donec quando extenduntur partes membri fracti: tunc conare, ut redire facias illas additiones omni ingenio, et secundum quemcunque modum potes in locis suis: et caue secundum fortitudinem tuam, ne accidat super infirmum per operationem tuam dolor, neque laesio: et conare secundum fortitudinem tuam, ut applices unum duorum ossium cum socio suo, secundum meliores formas.	 Let the position in which you place the limb be on an equal plane, according to its natural shape, until the parts of the fractured member are extended; then try to bring back those additions with all your skill, and according to whatever method you can do it in their places: and take care not to cause pain or injury due to your operation; and try, according to your strength, to apply one bone to its companion, according to the best forms.
Et oportet in illa hora, ut tentes et tangas ipsum manu tua.	 It is necessary in that hour for you to test and touch it with your hand.
Si ergo uides illic aliquid diuersum, rectifica ipsum, et aequa illud per quantitatem tuae uirtutis.	 If therefore you see something different there, correct it, and align it by the quantity of your skill.
Et caue extensionem uehementem, et compressionem fortem, sicut faciunt multi stolidorum.	 And beware of excessive stretching and strong compression, as many foolish people do.
Multotiens enim faciunt accidere per operationem illam suam apostema calidum, aut contractionem in membro: sicut iam uidimus illud ex operationibus eorum multotiens.	 For many times they cause abscesses or contractions to occur in the member through their operation; as we have already seen it happen many times through their operations.
Deinde annecte post aequationem, et decentem operationem, et stricturam illius membri, et quietem, et tranquillitatem: et mone infirmum super ipsum.	 Then join after the alignment and proper operation, and binding and rest of this member, and peace and calmness; and warn the weak person about it.
Et fac ipsum cauere, ne moueat ipsum in hora suarum uigiliarum, et somni sui apud reuolutionem suam, et agitationem suam, et apud egestionem suam, et omnes motus suos ultima uirtute sua.	 And make him be careful not to move it in the hour of his waking, and sleep, and turning, and restlessness, and all his movements, with all his strength.
Et ut caueat, ne sit positio membri positio cum qua sequatur dolor.	 And so that it may be avoided, let there not be a position of a member with which follows pain.
Quod est, quia quando sentit in dispositione positionis membri dolorem, aut laesionem: tunc oportet, ut permutes ipsum ad dispositionem aliam ab illa cum qua non sentiat dolorem.	 When he feels pain or injury while in the position of a member: then it is necessary to move him to another position from which he does not feel pain.
Et caue cum illo, ut sit positio eius illa aequalis, recta: ut non accidat in membro tortuositas, quando restauratur.	 And so let that be avoided, that his position is uneven or twisted: lest there occur a twist in the member when he is to be restored.
Et qualitas stricturae membri fracti est, secundum quod narro.	 The quality of the binding for a broken member is as I have described.
Scias, quod membra fracta diuersificantur in paruitate sua, et eorum magnitudine, et ipsorum forma.	 Know that broken members are differentiated by their size, and the extent of their breakage, and their shape.
Quae ergo ex eis sunt parua, sicut brachium, et digitus, et focile, et similia eis, tunc oportet, ut sit inuolutio panni mollis, subtilis.	 Those which are small, such as the arm, and finger, and shin-bone, and similar to these, then it is necessary that there be a rolling of soft, fine cloth over them.
Quae autem ex eis sunt grossa, sicut coxa, et crus, oportet ut sit in eis inuolutio lata, dura.	 But those which are large, such as the hip and thigh, it is necessary that there be a broad, hard rolling over them.
Quoniam ligamentum latum, connectit membrum magnum, et stringit ipsum ab omni parte strictura aequali, ita quod non ingreditur ipsum macula.	 Because a wide band joins a large member and binds it all around with an equally tight binding so that no stain penetrates it.
Deinde incipe post euacuationem tuam ab aequatione ponere linimentum conueniens ad illud, in stuppa leni super locum fracturae ipsius.	 Then after your evacuation, place an appropriate linen on it, in soft woolen over the place of the break itself.
Deinde incipe inuoluere ligamentum super locum fracturae ipsius tribus inuolutionibus, aut quatuor, secundum quod meretur membrum: et stringe manum tuam parumper cum ligamento.	 Then begin to wrap the bandage over the place of the break itself three or four times, according to what the member deserves; and tighten your hand slightly with the bandage.
Deinde uade cum eo ad partem superiorem a loco fracturae, et stringe minus quam fuit strictura tua, qua strinxisti locum fractum.	 Then go to the upper part away from the place of the break and bind it less than your previous binding that you applied to the broken place.
Deinde elonga te cum inuolutione a loco fracturae parumper, et mollifica stricturam paulatim, donec capias ex loco sano rem magnam.	 Then withdraw with the bandage from the place of the break slightly and soften the binding gradually until you have taken a large amount from a healthy place.
Deinde accipe uittam aliam, et inuolue eam iterum super locum fractum inuolutionibus.	 Then take another dressing and wrap it again over the broken place with bandages.
Postea uade cum inuolutione ad partem inferiorem a fractura.	 After moving with the incline towards the lower part from the fracture.
Et sit operatio tua in strictura inuolutionis, et mollificatione eius, secundum quod diximus in inuolutione prima superiore.	 And your operation shall be in the stricture of the incline and its softening, according to what we said in the first higher incline.
Deinde pone inter inuolutiones ex stuppa leni, aut panno, cum quo aequetur tortuositas fracturae, si est in ea tortuositas: et si non, non ponas in ea aliquid.	 Then place between the inclines from soft wool or cloth that matches the twisting of the fracture, if there is twisting in it; and if not, do not place anything in it.
Deinde inuolue super ipsam uittam aliam.	 Then incline over the same wound another.
Postea aequa super has inuolutiones astellas decenter factas statim, si non est in loco inflatio, neque apostema calidum.	 Afterwards, place evenly on these inclines stars properly made immediately, if there is no swelling or hot abscess.
Si autem in ea est inflatio, aut apostema: tunc pone super eam quod sedet illud apostema, et auferat inflationem: et dimitte eam aliquot diebus.	 If there is swelling or abscess in it; then place over it what sits on that abscess, and remove the swelling; and let it remain for some days.
Deinde stringe super ipsam tunc astellas.	 Then bind over them the stars.
Et sint Astellae ex medietatibus cannae latae, rasae, formatae sapienter: aut sint ex ligno unde fiunt cribra, quae fiunt ex pino, aut geraid, id est, ramis palmae, aut calingi: et sit amplitudo omnis Astellae, secundum hanc formam, et hanc eandem figuram.	 The stars shall be from the middle parts of wide reeds, shaved and skillfully formed; or they shall be made of wood from which cribra are made, which are made from pine, yew, palm branches or calingi; and let the width of all the stars be according to this form and this same shape.
Verumtamen oportet, ut Astella quae ponitur super ipsam tracturam, sit grossior et latior parumper, quam reliquae Astellae: et longitudo Astellae sit secundum quod licet membro ex magnitudine et paruitate.	 However, it is necessary that the star placed over the tendon should be slightly larger and wider than the others; and the length of the star shall be according to what allows the limb in terms of size and smallness.
Deinde stringe super Astellas cum uitta alia, secundum stricturam primam eandem.	 Then bind over the stars with another bandage, according to the first stricture.
Deinde liga desuper cum filis decenter, secundum quod diximus de strictura: et est, ut sit strictura tua super locum fracturae plus: et quanto plus elongatur a fractura sit, strictura minor.	 Then bind over it with threads properly, according to what we said about the stricture; and your stricture shall be above the fracture more; and the greater the distance from the fracture, the less the stricture.
Et oportet, ut sint fila media in grossitudine et subtilitate, et sint ex lino molli.	 It is necessary that the threads be of medium thickness and fineness, and be made of soft flax.
Quoniam si fila sunt grossa, sicut uidi ex operatione stolidorum ponentium fila sua ex chordis lini tortis, est error magnus: quoniam cadit strictura cum eis extra qualitatem.	 If threads are thick, as I saw in the operation of fools tying threads twisted from flax cords, it is a great error: because a constriction falls out with them beyond quality.
Et fila subtilia iterum non conueniunt: quoniam tu non consequeris per stricturam cum eis illud quod uis.	 Fine threads do not agree again: because you will not achieve what you want through the constriction with them.
Et non oportet, ut sit inter astellam et astellam minus quam digitus.	 And it is not proper that there be less than a finger's breadth between the anvil and the hammer.
Quod si laeditur infirmus per extremitates astellarum post stricturam in locis sanis: tunc pone sub eis ex stuppa leni, aut lana carminata, donec nihil laedatur ex illo.	 If the weak [person] is injured by the extremities of the anvils after the constriction in healthy places: then place under them soft wool or carded wool until nothing is injured from that.
Quando autem est fractura cum uulnere, et accidit disruptio in cute, ego ueniam cum rememoratione eius in capitulo secundum singularitatem.	 But when there is a fracture with a wound and there occurs disruption in the skin, I will come with its discussion in chapter two under special cases.
Et scias, quod non omne membrum fractum oportet ut stringatur cum astellis a primo die.	 And know that not every broken limb should be tied with anvils from the first day.
Quod est, quia membrum quando est magnum, non oportet ut ponas superipsum astellas, nisi post quinque dies, aut septem, aut plus, secundum securitatem tuam ab euentu apostematis calidi.	 What is meant by this, is that when a limb is large, you should not place superior anvils on it unless after five days, or seven, or more, according to your safety from the risk of cold abscesses.
Et iste est modus emplastrorum, quibus restaurabant antiqui, quae ponuntur super fracturam et dislocationem.	 This is the method of plasters which the ancients used to restore, which are placed on a fracture and dislocation.
¶ Modus Emplastri communis abbreuiati, restaurans fracturam, conueniens pluribus complexionibus, praecipue mulieribus, et pueris: quoniam est ex eo super quod non uincit calor, neque frigus.	¶ Common Plaster Method abbreviated, restoring a fracture, suitable for many constitutions, particularly women and children: because it is from that which heat does not conquer nor cold.
Et est, ut accipias ex puluere molendini, et est medulla farinae quae pendet in parietibus molendini apud motum molae: et conficias ipsum sicut est, praeter quod cribelles ipsum cum albugine oui: et pone confectionem eius non spissam, neque subtilem.	 And it is to receive from the flour mill dust and it is the marrow of the wheat which hangs on the walls of the mill near the movement of the stones: and make this as it is, except that you sift it with egg white: and place its composition not thick, nor thin.
Deinde utere eo.	 Then use it.
¶ Modus Emplastri alius, restaurantis fracturam, et dislocationem, et torsionem.	¶ Another Plaster Method, restoring a fracture, dislocation and twisting.
Recipe almess, et laudani, et acaciae, et enulae, et mugath: et suc, omnium ana ʒ X myrrhae, et aloes amborum ana ʒ V et alethil ʒ XX terantur omnia, et cribellentur, et misceantur cum aqua alethil: aut cum albugine oui, si complexio infirmi est calefacta.	 Prepare almess, laudanum, acacia, enula, and mugath. Grind all of them until they are as fine as ten parts of myrrh, five parts of aloes, and twenty parts of alethil. Sieve them and mix with alethil water, or with sheep's white grease if the disease is hot.
Deinde utere hoc emplastro.	 Then use this plaster.
Nam ipsum est bonae compositionis, restaurat ossa fracta uelociter, et confert pluribus hominibus.	 For it is of good composition, restores broken bones quickly, and benefits many people.
¶ Modus Emplastri alius, quod etiam confert fracturae et torsioni.	 Another method for the plaster which also treats fractures and dislocations.
Recipe mugath, et mess, et alteae albae, omnium ana ʒ X myrrhae, et aloes amborum ana ʒ V acaciae ʒ VI boli armeni ʒ XX terantur omnia contritione multa, et cribellentur, et conficiantur cum aqua, aut albugine oui: et administrentur.	 Prepare mugath, mess, white alteae, all of them pounded until as fine as ten parts of myrrh, five parts of aloes, six parts of acacia, twenty parts of Armenian pounded boli, and sieve them. Mix with water or sheep's white grease and administer.
¶ Modus Emplastri ad iuncturas, et ossa separata ex locis suis: et sedat dolorem accidentem eis, et scissuram ossis, et fracturam.	 Another method for the plaster for joining bones and separating them from their places: it relieves pain and swelling in those places, and heals broken bones and fractures.
Sumatur lana succida, et submergatur in aceto, et oleo decocto: et ponatur super locum.	 Take boiled wool, immerse it in vinegar and hot oil, then place it over the affected area.
Et in hoc quidem Emplastro non est uirtus restaurationis, sed est bonum in sedatione apostematis calidi: et expellit dolores proprie.	 In this plaster there is no healing power, but it is good for the relief of hot abscesses and it effectively drives out pains.
¶ Modus Emplastri, quod restaurat os fractum.	 Another method for the plaster that restores a broken bone.
Sume folia fici surdi, et folia papaueris syluestris: et tere omnia, et fac emplastrum ex utrisque.	 Take the leaves of the fig tree and the wild papaver: grind them all and make a plaster from both.
¶ Modus Emplastri abbreuiati, administrati apud restaurationem fracturae ossis: et quando tu uis resolutionem residui apostematis.	 Another short method for the plaster administered in the healing of a broken bone, and when you wish to resolve the remaining abscess.
Recipe radicis alteae, et camomillae, et florum uiolarum, et farinae herbi, omnium ana partem unam: terantur omnia, et conficiantur cum uino, si non est membrum calefactum.	 Prepare the root of alteae, chamomile, flowers of violets, and herb flour, all one part: grind them all and mix with wine if the limb is not heated.
Si uero est calefactum, tunc confice illud cum aqua coriandri humidi, aut cum aqua, et utere eo.	 If it is heated (the wound), then make that with water of coriander (juice) or with water and use it.
¶ Modus Emplastri alius fortioris in resolutione, quam istud primum, quando accidit apostema durum apud restaurationem membri.	 Another stronger method for healing, stronger than the first, when a hard abscess occurs during restoration of a limb.
Recipe radicis alteae, et seminis lini, et balaustiae, et melliloti, et samsuci, et floris uiolarum, et camomillae, omnium ana, partem unam, terantur omnia, et conficiantur cum aqua salicis, aut cum aqua dulci, aut cum uino.	 Take equal parts of althea root, linseed, balaustia, lentil, samsuc, viole flowers, and chamomile. Grind all together and make a paste with water of willow, sweet water, or wine.
Totum illud secundum caliditatem membri, et quietem caloris eius.	 Apply the above to the member according to its heat and calmness of the heat.
Hippocrates uero non dixit in libro suo, quod ponatur super membrum fractum apud restaurationem eius, nisi caerotum factum ex caera, et oleo: non aliud: et narrauit, ut sit medium inter grossitudinem et subtilitatem.	 Hippocrates himself did not say in his book that it should be placed on a fractured member during its healing, except for plaster made from tallow and oil, not anything else; and he said that it should have a middle state between thickness and subtlety.
Galeno autem uisum est, ut ponantur super membrum fractum apud restaurationem eius res, in quibus est exiccatio caliditatis, sicut myrrha, et aloes et olibanum, et similia eis ex eis quae narrauimus.	 Galenus, however, saw fit that they should be placed on a fractured member during its healing, things that have the dryness of heat, such as myrrh and aloes and olibanum and similar ones mentioned earlier.
¶ Modus Emplastri quod confert ad laesionem et dolorem.	 Method of plaster for injury and pain relief.
Recipe mugath, et ciceris, et capillorum hominis incisorum, aut pennae auis, et alteae, et salis partes aequales: terantur, et cribellentur, et conficiantur: et fiat ex eo emplastrum.	 Take equal parts of mugath (althea), chickpeas, human hairs (or bird feathers), althea root, and salt. Grind and sieve and make a paste from it; and make plaster out of it.
Quantitas autem secundum quam oportet, ut remaneat ligatura, deinde soluatur, est, ut consideres tunc, si non accidit infirmo dolor, neque pruritus, neque mouetur os fractum a loco suo: tunc non resoluas ipsum diebus multis.	 The amount by which the ligature should remain, then dissolve, is such that you consider whether pain does not occur, nor itching, nor is the bone moved from its place; then do not dissolve it for many days.
Quod si accidat ei in loco pruritus uehemens, aut dolor inquietans, aut inflatio: tunc propera, et solue in hora ipsum, et aufer emplastrum ab eo: et accipe pannum lenem, aut spongiam marinam lenem, humidam: et submerge eam in aqua tepida, et ablue cum ea locum, donec quiescat pruritus, et sedetur dolor.	 If itching or discomfort or swelling occurs in the place; then hurry and dissolve it within an hour and remove the plaster from it; and take a soft cloth or a soft sea sponge moistened; and submerge it in warm water and wash the place with it until the itching subsides and the pain is soothed.
Deinde dimitte membrum quiescere una hora.	 Then let the member rest for one hour.
Deinde pone super ipsum lanam succidam, submersam in aceto et oleo, aut oleo rosato: et liga super ipsum nocte una, donec sis securus ab apostemate calido, et quiescat inflatio membri, et remoueatur dolor eius.	 Then place a scalded wool upon it, immerse it in vinegar and oil (or rose oil), or oil: and bind it on top of it at night until you are secure from the hot abscess, and let the swelling of the member subside, and remove its pain.
Deinde itera ipsum ad stricturam subtilem, et emplastrum paruum: et non stringas ipsum constrictione tua prima, et subtilia cum eo, donec sanetur.	 Then repeat it for a delicate bandage and a small plaster: and do not bind it tightly with your first constraint, and delicately with it until it heals.
Quod si uides, quod apostema, et rubedo, et dolor, et inflatio, et omnia accidentia iam remota sunt penitus, et indiges emplastro et strictura, tunc itera illud sicut fecisti in primis aequaliter.	 If you see that the abscess, redness, pain, swelling and all other symptoms are already completely removed, and if you need plaster and bandage, then repeat it as you did at first equally.
Quod si non accidit membro aliquid ex eis quae diximus, tune non soluas ipsum, nisi post tres dies, aut quatuor, aut quinque, aut septem.	 If nothing of what we said happens in the member, then do not loosen it, unless after three days, or four, or five, or seven.
Et quando que dimittitur uiginti diebus totum illud, secundum quod apparet tibi ex solutione membri, sicut diximus, donec quando adhaeret fractura, et approximat coagulatio carnis super eam: adde etiam tunc in strictura plus quam strictura tua prima tota: et adde etiam in ingrossatione cibi infirmi, secundum quod praecessit rememoratio eius.	 And when it is released after twenty days, according to what appears to you from the loosening of the member, as we said, until when a fracture adheres and coagulation of the flesh approaches on it: add also in the bandage more than your first binding: and add also in the thickening of food for the sick, according to what was previously remembered.
Si autem uides locum fracturae iam exiccari, et extenuari plus quam oportet: tunc scias, quod nutrimentum prohibetur peruenire ad ipsum.	 If you see a place of the fracture already to dry out and thin more than is necessary: then know that nutrition is prevented from reaching it.
Embroca ergo ipsum cum aqua tepida apud omnem uicem qua soluis ipsum, et sit illud in omnibus tribus diebus, et alleuia stricturam parumper.	 Therefore, anoint the member with warm water at every corner where you loosen it, and let it be for all three days, and rub the bandage slightly.
Per hanc ergo operationem currit ad membrum nutrimentum, et sanatur uelociter.	 By this operation, nourishment flows to the member, and it heals quickly.
Illud autem quod faciunt stolidi restauratores ex fractura membri uice alia, quando non restauratur in primis, secundum quod oportet, et restauratur secundum tortuositatem, est error ex operatione eorum, et timor magnus: et si esset rectum, dixissent illud antiqui in libris suis, et operati fuissent cum eo.	 But what the foolish restorers do from a fracture of the member instead of first restoring it as is necessary, and they restore it according to crookedness, this is an error in their operation, and there is great fear: and if it were right, they would have said that in their old books, and operated with it.
Et ego non uidi alicubi eorum uestigium in illo omnino, et rectius est, ut non fiat illud.	 And I have nowhere seen their trace in that entirely, and it is more correct that it should not be done.
¶ De factura accidente in capite.	 On the making of a fracture in the head.
Caput III.	 Chapter 3.
Species fracturae sunt diuersae, et figurae eius multae: et caussae eius sunt distinctae.	 Types of fractures are diverse, and their forms many; and their causes are distinguished.
Nam ex fractura est quae fit a percussione cum ense: et percussio aufert os totum usquequo peruenit ad siphac, quod est sub osse, sicut facit axia in ligno: et propter illud nominatur haec species fracturae Axialis.	 For there is a fracture which occurs from striking with a sword; and the blow removes bone completely as far as it penetrates into the siphac, which is beneath the bone, just as an ax does in wood; and for this reason this type of fracture is called Axial.
Aut ensis incidit quiddam ossis, et incidit faciem eius, et non penetrat incisio usque ad ultimum eius: et nominatur haec species fracturae Kalaan, id est, Leuatio absolute.	 Or the sword cuts something of a bone and cuts its face, but does not penetrate with the cut to its end; and this type of fracture is called Kalan, that is, Absolute Lever.
Et est uulnus duarum fracturarum, aut magnum, aut paruum.	 And there is a wound of two types of fractures, either large or small.
Et ex fractura est, quae est contritio, aut attritio: et caussa eius est percussio cum lapide, aut casus super lapidem, aut eis similia.	 And from a fracture there is one that is a crushing or grinding; and its cause is a blow with a stone, or falling on a stone, or similar things.
Et haec fractura est etiam aut penetrans, quae iam appropinquat panniculo, quod est sub osse: aut est in facie ossis: et est uulnus harum duarum fracturarum etiam aut paruum, aut magnum.	 And this fracture is also penetrating, which approaches the membrane, which is beneath the bone; or it is on the face of a bone; and this type of fracture has two forms, either small or large.
Et ex fractura est, quae est occulta in osse in subtilitate capilli: et est fissura parua, et propter illud nominatur haec species fracturae Capillaris.	 And from a fracture there is one that is hidden in the bone in its finest part; and it is a small crack, and for this reason this type of fracture is called Capillar.
Et ex eis est fractura, quae fit a casu, aut percussione lapidis, et eis similium, quae faciunt ingredi laminam ossis ad interiora, et fit loco concauitas: sicut accidit caldariis aeris, quando occurrit eis percussio, et ingreditur pars eorum ad interiora.	 And among them there is a fracture that occurs from falling or striking with a stone, and similar things; which make the layer of the bone enter within, and it forms a hollow in its place; just as happens to the caldrons of brass when they are struck, and part of them enters within.
Et plurimum quidem fit illud in capitibus humidorum ossium, sicut sunt capita puerorum.	 And this indeed often occurs in the bones of moist heads, such as those of children's heads.
Et fiunt omnibus istis speciebus fracturae satagiae separatae, et ego ueniam cum rememoratione illius totius in loco suo.	 And all these types of fractures of the sternum are separate, and I shall come with the recollection of that entire thing in its place.
Et cognoscimus omnes has species fracturae per detectionem super eam, et inquisitionem earum cum tentis, et ablationem carnium corruptarum, quae sunt super eas.	 And we know all these types of fractures by detection over it and examination of them with tests, and removal of the corrupted flesh that is over them.
Species uero Capillaris cognoscitur per hoc, quod detegitur super os, et abstergitur, et linitur super ipsum cum encaustro: fractura enim apparet nigra.	 The Capillary type is known by this: it is detected over the bone, scraped off and then bound over it with pitch; for the fracture appears black.
In curatione autem fracturae, considera in primis accidentia infirmi: tunc si uides ex accidentibus quod significet significatione manifesta super timorem, sicut uomitus cholerae, et extensio, et amissio intellectus, et abscisio uocis, et syncopis, et febris acuta, et egressus oculorum, et rubedo eorum, et similia eis ex accidentibus in pluribus dispositionibus, proculdubio non sanatur: et si uides accidentia non terrentia te, et speras salutem: tunc incipe curationem eius.	 In the treatment of a fracture, consider first the condition of the patient: then, if you see signs in his condition that indicate fear, such as cholera vomiting, extension, loss of intelligence, loss of voice, fainting, acute fever, eye discharge, redness of eyes, and similar signs in many other conditions, it is most likely not to heal; and if you see signs that do not frighten you and you hope for recovery: then begin the treatment.
Quod est, si uenit ad te uulneratus in primis cum uulneratur: et est illud in diebus hyemis, tunc oportet, ut studeas in ablatione ossis ante diem quartumdecimum secundum omnem dispositionem.	 If someone comes to you wounded first with the wound, and it is in winter days, then it is necessary that you strive for the removal of the bone before the fourteenth day according to all circumstances.
Et si est in diebus aestatis, tunc oportet, ut properes remouere os ante diem septimum, antequam corrumpatur quod est sub osse ex panniculo, et accidant illa accidentia quae narrauimus.	 And if it is in summer days, then it is necessary that you hurry to remove the bone before the seventh day, before what is under the bone from fat corrupts and the signs that we have mentioned occur.
Quod si fractura ossis iam peruenit ad panniculum tangentem cerebrum, et est cum minutiis, et attractione: tunc oportet, ut incidas partem comminutam, et attritam, secundum quod narro tibi.	 If the fracture of the bone has already reached the fat touching the brain, and is with grating and pulling: then it is necessary that you cut the broken and ground part, as I tell you.
Et est, ut radas caput uulnerati: et detege super os secundum quemcunque modum possibile est tibi: et secundum figuram uulneris, et quod leue est super infirmum.	 And it is necessary that you shave the head of the wounded person: and scrape over the bone in any way possible for you: and according to the shape of the wound, and what is light for the patient.
Quod si accidat tibi apud detectionem ossis fluxus sanguinis, aut apostema calidum: tunc oppone ei cum eo quod oportet.	 If it happens to you during bone examination, a blood flow or a hot abscess: then oppose him with what is necessary.
Et est, ut impleas locum cum pannis infusis in uino, et oleo rosato: et facias quiescere uulnus, donec sedetur apostema, et sis securus a fluxu sanguinis.	 And it is to be filled with linen soaked in wine and rose oil, and let the wound rest until the abscess settles down, and be careful of bleeding.
Deinde incipe in curatione ossis, et ablatione eius.	 Then begin in the cure of the bone, and its removal.
Et illud fit secundum unum duorum modorum.	 And this is done according to one of two methods.
Modus quidem unus est, ut incidas os cum Incisorio strictae aciei: et haec est forma eius.	 One method is to cut the bone with a curved blade: and this is its shape.
Dende administra Incisorium aliud post Incisorum latius eo parumper: et haec est forma eius.	 Then administer another scalpel, broader but shorter than the first: and this is its shape.
Deinde administra etiam Incisorium aliud latius etiam quam secundum.	 Then also administer another scalpel wider than the second.
Et modus secundus est, ut sit apud te numerus Incisoriorum diuersorum: quorum quaedam sint latiora quibusdam, et quaedam eorum breuiora quibusdam: et sint in ultimo acuitatis extremitatum suarum, et sint ex ferro indo, aut fuled: et utere facilitate in percussione super Incisorium, ut non concutiat caput, et laedat ipsum.	 And the second method is to have a number of scalpels of different sizes, some wider than others and some shorter; they should be at the end of their sharpness, and made of iron or bronze; use them with ease when striking the scalpel so as not to strike the head and injure it.
Si autem os est forte, durum: tunc oportet, ut perfores in circumitu eius, antequam tu administres Incisoria, cum Terebris quae nominantur Terebra non profundantia: et non nominantur ita, nisi quoniam ipsa non pertranseunt terminum ossis carnei ad illud, quod est post ipsum: propterea, quod Terebro est extremitas rotunda super illud, quod est sub capite eius acuto, similis margini, et circulus paruus prohibet submergi, et pertransire spissitudinem ossis.	 If the bone is hard: then it is necessary to bore around it before you administer the scalpel, with the chisels that are called terebras, which do not penetrate deeply; they are not called so because they do not pass beyond the limit of the bone to what is behind it; because the terebra has a rounded end above that which is underneath the head and is sharp like an edge, and a small circle prevents it from sinking and penetrating the thickness of the bone.
Et conuenit tibi, ut accipias ex istis Terebris numerum multum, quorum unumquodque conueniat quantitati spissitudinis ossis, donec praesens sit tibi omni craneo Terebrum: cuius extremitatis acutae quantitas in longitudine et breuitate sit, secundum quantitatem spissitudinis illius cranei.	 It is also suitable for you to take a large number of these chisels, one of which corresponds to the thickness of the bone, until there are as many terebras as the skull requires; the sharpness of each should be according to the thickness of that skull.
Et haec est forma trium specierum Terebrorum, uel Trepanorum.	 And this is the form of three species of trephines, or trepans.
Qualitas autem perforandi in circumitu ossis fracti, est: ut ponas Terebrum super os, et reuoluas ipsum digitis tuis, donec scias, os iam penetratum esse.	 The quality of perforating around a broken bone is as follows: you should place the trepan on the bone and turn it with your fingers until you know that it has already penetrated the bone.
Deinde permuta Terebrum ad locum alium, et pone quod est inter omne foramen quantitatem grossitudinis radii, aut circiter illud.	 Then change the trepan to another place, and place there that which is between every hole of such size as a finger's breadth or approximately so.
Deinde incide cum Incisoriis quod est inter omne foramen ex osse: et fac illud subtilius quam potes super illud ex fine leuitatis, sicut diximus, donec eradices os, aut manu tua, aut cum aliquo alio ex quibusdam instrumentis, quae parasti ad illud: sicut tenaliae, et forpices subtiles.	 Then cut with the saw what is between every hole in the bone, and make it finer than possible at the end of the thinness, as we have said, until you have chiseled the bone, either with your hand or with some other tools which you have prepared for that purpose, such as tenaliae and fine forpices.
Et oportet, ut caueas omni cautela, ne tangat Terebrum, aut Incisorium aliquid ex siphac.	 And it is necessary that you take every care to ensure that the trepan or saw does not touch anything from the skin.
Cum ergo circumieris os perforando, et separatum fuerit a siphac, si fuerit continuum cum eo, et extraxeris ipsum, oportet ut radas, et aeques extremitatem eius quod remanet in osse cum instrumento alio simili Incisorio.	 When you therefore perforate the bone by circumscribing it and it has been separated from the skin, if it is continuous with it, and you extract it, it is necessary that you grind and level off the extremity which remains in the bone with another similar saw.
Verumtamen oportet, ut sit tenuis et subtilis magis aliis Incisoriis.	 However, it should be thin and delicate compared to other saws.
Quod si remanet aliquid ex ossibus paruis, et satagiae: tunc accipe ea cum facilitate, cum eo quod est apud te ex instrumentis.	 If something remains of the small bones and splinters, then take them with ease, with that which is at hand from your tools.
Deinde cura uulnus post illud cum liciniis, et unguentis quae diximus.	 Then care for the wound afterwards with linen and ointments as we have said.
Et modus alius operationis est facilis, prorsus longinquus a timore: quem dixit Galenus, et laudauit ipsum laude magna: et iste est sermo eius.	 And another method of operation is easy, entirely far from fear; which Galen said and praised greatly; and this is his saying.
Necese est tibi in primis, ut incipias detegere partem ossis ex loco, in quo fractura est uehementior, et manifestior: donec quando detexeris illam partem, et posueris sub eo extremitatem huius Incisorii lenticularis, cuius haec est forma.	 It is necessary for you first to begin by exposing the bone from the place where the fracture is more intense and clearer; until when you have exposed that part and placed under it the extremity of this saw with a concave shape, which has this form.
Et pars lenticularis, lenis non incidit aliquid: et pars acuta eius in duabus lateribus eius uadens in longitudinem, sicut uides: ut sit pars lenticularis innixa ad siphac, facie eius incidente acuta in osse.	 The rounded part (of the eye) cuts nothing gently: and the sharp part of it proceeding in both its sides as you see, so that the rounded part of the lens is attached to the sclera, with its sharp edge incident on the bone.
Deinde percute super Incisorium a parte una cum malleo paruo, donec incidas totum os cum facilitate, sicut reuoluitur: et tu sis securus ex panniculo, quod non accidat in eo accidens, quod timeas prorsus.	 Then strike upon the Incisor with a small hammer until you cut through the bone easily, as it is usually turned (in operation): and be careful that no cloth slips into what is being cut, which you fear might happen altogether.
Et si medicans non esset stultior hominum, et magis ignarus eius, nec esset dormiens, tunc si remaneret aliquid annexum ossi ex panniculo in quibusdam locis, incideret ipsum ab eo cum extremitate incisorii lenticularis ipsius, et liberaret ipsum ab eo cum facilitate.	 If the physician were not more foolish than men, nor more ignorant of his craft, nor asleep, then if something remained attached to the bone from the cloth in certain places, he would cut it away with the sharp edge of the incisor's lenticular part and free it easily.
Liberatur enim ab eo sine nocumento, et absque timore.	 It is freed from it without harm and without fear.
Et si fractura ossis non penetret usque ad panniculum, et illud quod abscinditur ab osse est facies eius, et remanent in ipso asperitas et satagiae subtiles: tunc oportet, ut radas illam asperitatem, et eradices illas satagias cum rasoriis subtilibus ex quibus praeparasti numerum diuersarum quantitatum, ut sit tibi possibile administrare ex eis in omni loco conuenientiora eorum, et rectiora ipsorum, secundum illud ad quod perducit te operatio, et ipsum os fractum, et figura eius.	 If the bone is not broken through to the cloth, and what is being cut away from the bone is its face, with roughness and subtle irregularities remaining in it: then it is necessary that you smooth out that roughness and remove those irregularities with fine rasps which you have prepared in various quantities, so that it is possible for you to administer more suitable and correct ones according to the procedure of the operation, and the broken bone and its shape.
Et oportet, ut administres in rasione tua, qua in primis radis os, latius illorum rasoriorum.	 And it is necessary that you administer according to your judgment, first smoothing the bone more broadly with those rasps.
Deinde utere post ipsum subtiliore eo.	 Then use a finer one after that.
Et non cesses facere illud secundum continuitatem, donec peruenias ad administrandum tenuius, et subtilius eorum omnium.	 And do not cease to do this in continuity until you come to administer more thinly and finer of them all.
In unaquaque autem fissurarum reliquarum paruarum capillarium, et fractura subtili, oportet ut administres curam, secundum illud quod perducit ad rectificationem eius.	 In each of the remaining small cracks and a fine break, care must be taken according to what leads to its correction.
Et est res quae non occultatur super omnem, cui in hac arte est quodlibet studium, et stetit super illud quod scripsimus, et ostendimus in fracturis magnis.	 And it is a matter that cannot be hidden upon all, to which in this art there is any study, and it stood upon what we have written, and we showed in large fractures.
Si autem panniculus detectus retinetur, quando tu eradicas os: tunc oportet, ut accipias pannum lini, secundum quantitatem uulneris, et submerge ipsum in oleo rosa, et pone ipsum super orificium uulneris.	 If however a piece of cloth is found to be retained when you excise bone: then it is necessary that you take linen cloth according to the size of the wound, and immerse it in rose oil, and place it on the opening of the wound.
Deinde accipe pannum alium duplicatum, aut triplicatum, et submerge ipsum in uino et oleo rosa, et pone ipsum super pannum primum: et fac illud quam facilius potes super illud, ut non grauetur siphac.	 Then take another piece of cloth, either doubled or tripled, and immerse it in wine and rose oil, and place it on top of the first one; and do that as easily as possible above it, so that it is not heavy.
Deinde administra supra ipsum ligamentum latum: et non stringas ipsum, nisi per quantitatem quae teneat uulnus tantum: et dimitte ipsum cum hac cura die uno, aut diebus duobus, donec sis securus ab apostemate calido.	 Then administer on top of it a wide bandage; and do not tighten it except according to the size that holds the wound only; and release it with this care for one day or two days until you are assured from hot inflammation.
Deinde solue ipsum, et administra post illud medicinas cum quibus est superflua siccitas: sicut radices lilii, et farina herbi, et puluis thuris, et aristolochia, et similia eis: et est, ut facias ex istis medicinis puluerem, qui puluerizetur super uulnus sicut sunt siccae.	 Then dissolve it (the bandage), and administer afterwards medications with which excessive dryness is superfluous; such as the roots of garlic, and flour of herbs, and powder of incense, and aristolochia, and similar ones: and it is that you make from these medications a powder, which is to be sprinkled on the wound like dry ones.
Et uniuersaliter administra in illo omnem medicinam de proprietate cuius est ut abstergat, et non mordicet.	 And universally administer on it all medicine with the property of purifying and not biting.
Et caue secundum tuam uirtutem, ut uulnus in curatione tua sit limpidum: neque sit in ea sordes unguenti, neque sordicies.	 And be careful according to your ability that the wound is clean during your treatment; neither let there be filth from ointments, nor dirtiness.
Neque dimittas uirus aggregari in eo omnino: quoniam quando uirus aggregatur super panniculum cerebri, corrumpit eum, et putrefacit ipsum, et accidit super infirmum post illud malicia magna: et iam accidit in siphac capitis, cum mundificatur ab eo os, praecipue quando negligitur cura eius, nigredo in superficie eius.	 Neither let the pus gather in it entirely; because when pus gathers on a cerebral cloth, it corrupts it and rots itself, and great evil follows after that for the patient: and already it has happened in the head, when the bone is cleaned from it, especially when care is neglected for it, blackness appears on its surface.
Considera ergo tunc, si accidunt infirmo accidentia quae diximus, scias, quia est pernitiosum proculdubio.	 Consider then, if afflictions occur to the sick as we have said, know that it is undoubtedly dangerous.
Et si nigredo non accidit, nisi a medicina quae ponitur super ipsum, et est in uirtute illius medicinae, ut faciat illam nigredinem: tunc oportet, ut accipias ex melle partem unam, ex oleo rosato partes tres, et linias cum eis pannum.	 If there is no discoloration (nigredo) unless it arises from the medication placed upon it and it is in the virtue of that medicine to cause discoloration: then you should take a portion from honey, three portions from rose oil, and anoint with them a cloth.
Deinde pone ipsum super siphac: postea cura ipsum cum speciebus curationis quae conueniunt, donec sanetur.	 Then place it on a sheep's bladder (siphac): afterwards treat it with the remedies suitable for healing until it is healed.
¶ De restauratione Nasi quando frangitur.	 [Section heading: Restoration of the nose when broken.]
Caput IIII.	 Chapter IV.
Scias, quod non franguntur ex Naso nisi duae partes eius superiores simul, aut una earum: propterea, quod ipse sunt duo ossa: quoniam inferius eius est cartilaginosum, non frangitur, et non accidit ei nisi attritio, et tortuositas, et simitas.	 Know that the nose is not broken except by the two upper parts of it together or one of them: because they consist of two bones; since its lower part (inferius) is cartilaginous, it does not break and does not happen unless there is rubbing, distortion, and deviation.
Si frangitur una duarum partium eius, tunc oportet, ut intromittas digitum paruum in foramen Nasi, et aeques illam fracturam digito tuo indice, et pollice deforis, donec redeat Nasus super figuram suam naturalem: et fiat illud arte, cum facilitate.	 If one of the two parts is broken, then it is necessary that you insert a small finger into the nose's opening and hold the fracture with your index and thumb from the outside until the nose returns to its natural shape; this should be done skillfully and easily.
Et caue, ne accidat per operationem tuam illam super infirmum dolor.	 And beware that your treatment does not cause pain to the sick person.
Quod si fractura est in superiore parte Nasi, et non perueniat ad illam digitus: tunc oportet, ut aequetur extremitate radii, in quo sit grossitudo parua.	 If the fracture is in the upper part of the nose and the finger does not reach it: then you should apply pressure to the end of the radius where there is a slight swelling.
Si uero fractura est in duabus partibus, tunc fac simile illius: et propera cum restauratione eius in die primo fracturae, si est possibile.	 If the fracture is in two parts, then make a similar one and approach with its healing on the first day of the fracture if possible.
Et si non, tunc post diem septimum, aut decimum apud quietem apostematis calidi.	 And if not, then after the seventh or tenth day in the presence of warm cauterizers (apostematis).
Deinde intromitte in extremitate Nasi licinium ex panno lini, si fractura est in parte una: aut intromite duo licinia si fractura est in duabus partibus: et sit in licinio grossitudo tantae quantitatis, quae impleat foramen Nasi.	 Then insert a strip of linen from a linen cloth into the end of the nose if the fracture is in one part; or insert two strips of linen if the fracture is in two parts: and let there be a swelling of sufficient size in the linen to fill the opening of the nose.
Et dixerunt quidam antiquorum restauratorum, ut infundantur licinia in butyro, et permutentur omni die.	 And certain restorers of old times said, that linen should be soaked in butter and changed every day.
Illud uero non uidetur mihi, imo oportet, ut infundatur licinium in albugine oui, confecto cum puluere molendini.	 That rather does not seem to me, but it is necessary that linen be soaked in cow's milk, prepared with miller's flour.
Deinde dimitte licinium, donec firmetur os, et induretur cartilago.	 Then let the linen be removed when the bone hardens and the cartilage hardens.
Et quandoque intromittitur in Nasum loco licinii penna anseris, postquam inuoluitur super ipsam pannus lenis: et fit, quod ipsa tenet fracturam Nasi uehementius, et ut non prohibeatur infirmus ab inspiratione.	 And sometimes a goose feather is inserted into the place of linen in the nose, after a soft cloth has been laid upon it; and this is done so that the linen holds the fracture of the nose more strongly, and so that the weak are not hindered from breathing.
Et non est haec res necessaria.	 And this is not necessary.
Si uis, fac illud: et si uis, fac licinia.	 If you wish, do it; and if you wish, do linen.
Quod si accidat Naso iterum dum operaris apostema calidum, emplastra nasum cum caeroto, aut cum coto infuso in oleo rosato, aut modico ex dyaquilon.	 And if it happens that the nose again when treating an abscess while operating, pack the nose with hot plasters, or with cerotic, or with pitch softened in rose oil, or a little bit of aloes.
Si autem non accidit apostema calidum, tunc oportet, ut emplastres ipsum cum farina sisami, et puluere thuris confecti cum albugine oui.	 But if an abscess does not occur, then it is necessary that the pack be made with sesame flour and incense powder prepared with cow's milk.
Deinde pone super ipsum stuppam lenem, et non liges Nasum cum aliquo omnino.	 Then place a soft wool on top of it, and do not tie the nose with anything at all.
Si uero franguntur ossa Nasi fractura parua, aut comminuuntur, tunc oportet, ut scindas super ea, et extrahas ipsa cum instrumentis quae conueniunt eis.	 If the bones of the nose are broken by a small fracture or crushed, then it is necessary that you cut above them and extract them with instruments suitable for them.
Deinde sue scissuram, et cura ipsum cum eo quod incarnat, et consolidat ex emplastris conuenientibus ad illud, uel unguentis.	 Then be cauterized and care for it with that which adheres to it, and let it heal with suitable packs or ointments.
Quod si accidat inter Nasum uulnus, tunc oportet, ut cures ipsum cum liciniis: et administres cannulam de plumbo, donec sanetur.	 If there is a wound between the nose and lip, then it is necessary to care for it with linen; and administer a lead tube until it heals.
¶ De restauratione Mandibulae inferioris, quando disrumpitur.	 Chapter on the restoration of the lower jaw when it breaks.
Caput V.	 Head V. (Fifth Chapter)
Quando disrumpitur Mandibula inferior, et fractura eius non est cum uulnere: conspice tunc si est fractura eius deforis tantum, et non frangitur in duo, et curuatur ad interiora: tunc cognitio eius est facilis.	 When the lower jaw is disrupted and its fracture is not accompanied by a wound: then examine whether its fracture is only on the outside and it does not break into two, and it bends towards the inside: then its recognition is easy.
Oportet ergo, si est fractura eius in parte dextra, ut intromittas digitum indicem sinistrae in os infirmi: similiter si fractura est in mandibula sinistra, tunc intromitte indicem manus dextrae: et impelle cum eo gibbositatem fracturae deintus cum facilitate ad exteriora cum manu tua altera ab interiori parte ossis decenter, et cum eo aequa ipsam.	 Therefore, if the fracture is in the right part of it (the jaw), insert your left index finger into the weak bone: similarly, if the fracture is in the left lower jaw, then insert your right index finger: and push with it the bulge of the fracture towards the outside with ease from within the bone using your other hand properly from the inside part of the bone, and with it equalize it.
Quod si fractura mandibulae iam separata est in duo, tunc oportet, ut administres extersionem a duabus partibus, secundum rectitudinem: donec possibilis sit aequatio eius.	 If the fracture of the lower jaw is already separated into two, then it is necessary to administer extension from both parts, according to rectitude: until it is possible to equalize it.
Si autem iam accidit in dentibus commotio, aut disruptio: tunc stringe illos de quibus speras quod remaneant cum filo auri, aut argenti, aut seta.	 If however, disturbance or disruption has already occurred among the teeth, then bind those which you hope will remain with a thread of gold, silver, silk, or floss.
Deinde pone super mandibulam fractam caerotum.	 Then place upon the broken lower jaw pieces of lead.
Deinde pone super ipsum pannum duplicatum, et pone super pannum astellam magnam decenter factam: aut frustum cutis soleae aequale, in longitudinem mandibulae.	 Then place over it a double cloth and put over the cloth a large star-shaped plaster well made: or an equal piece of shoe sole leather in length of the lower jaw.
Deinde liga ipsum desuper, secundum quod praeparatur tibi ligatura eius, et conuenit ipsius applicatio, donec non destruitur: et praecipe infirmo, uti tranquillitate et quiete: et pone cibum eius sorbitiones lenes.	 Then bind it above (the dressing), according to the preparation of its binding and the fitting of its application, until it is not destroyed: and order the patient to rest quietly: and put his softened food.
Si autem estimas, quod iam alteratur aliquid figurae aliquo modorum: tunc propera, et solue ipsum in die tertio.	 If you think that something has changed its shape by some means: then hurry and undo it on the third day.
Deinde rectifica quod alteratum est ex eo, et emplastra ipsum ex puluere molendini, cum albugine oui, aut cum farina sisami, postquam tu abstuleris caerotum: et pone super emplastrum lanam lenem.	 Then straighten what has been changed from it, and plaster it with flour mill powder, with egg white or wheat flour, after you have removed the lead: and place over the plaster soft wool.
Dum ergo permanet annexum illud emplastrum super ipsum, et non alteratur ossis dispositio, dimitte ipsum, ne soluas, donec sanetur: aut stringe fracturam.	 While that adhesive plaster remains on it and the bone arrangement does not change, leave it undisturbed until it heals; or tie up the fracture.
Multotiens enim stringitur haec fractura in tribus septimanis.	 This fracture is often tied for three weeks.
Quod si interim accidat apostema calidum, tunc administra illud quod diximus multotiens in sedatione eius, donec remoueatur illud apostema.	 If a warm abscess occurs meanwhile, then administer what I said earlier for its relief until the abscess is removed.
Et si fractura est cum uulnere, considera.	 And if there is a fracture with a wound, consider.
Namsi iam separatur ex osse frustum, aut a satagie: tunc subtilia te in hoc, ut auferas illa frusta satagiae cum eo quod conuenit tibi in ablatione eorum ex instrumentis.	 If the bone fragment is already separating from the bone or the flesh, then be careful with this. Use fine instruments to remove the bone fragments that are suitable for you in removing them from the instruments.
Si uero orificium uulneris est strictum, tunc amplifica ipsum cum phlebotomo secundum quantitatem necessitatis tuae.	 If the wound opening is narrowed, then expand it with a leech according to your needs.
Deinde quando abstuleris illa satagie, et non remanserit ex eis aliquid, sue tunc orificium uulneris, si est amplum: et si non, pone super ipsum ex emplastris quae conueniunt ad illud, et incarnant illud, donec sanetur.	 Then when you remove the flesh, and nothing remains of it, or if the wound opening is large: and if not, cover it with plasters that are suitable for this, and let it heal until it heals.
¶ De restauratione Furculae, quando frangitur.	 [Title] On the restoration of a fork when it breaks.
Caput VI.	 Chapter VI.
Plurimum quidem frangitur Furcula ab anteriore parte ex parte humeri, et fractura eius fit secundum unum trium modorum.	 Much indeed is broken by the Furcula from the anterior part, near the humerus, and its fracture is made according to one of the three modes.
Aut enim frangitur et separatur in duo, praeter quod accidant in ea satagiae: et est facilius ad restaurationem eius.	 Either it is broken and separated into two, apart from which complications may occur within it; and it is easier for its restoration.
Aut ita, quod accidunt in osse satagiae: et est difficilius ad restaurationem.	 Or, so that complications occur in the bone itself; and it is difficult for its restoration.
Aut ita, quod est fractura cum uulnere.	 Or, so that it is a fracture with wounding.
Et operatio in ea quando fractura est absque uulnere, est, ut facias praesentes esse duos ministros, ut teneat unus eorum adiutorium quod sequitur Furculam fractam, et alter extendat collum uersus partem.	 And the procedure for it when the fracture is without wounding is as follows: make two attendants present, so that one of them holds the assisting hand that follows the broken Furcula, and the other stretches the neck towards the side.
Deinde aequa fracturam digitis tuis, donec fiat forma eius, secundum quod oportet: et non sit in ea eminentia, neque concauitas.	 Then you must equalize the fracture with your fingers until it takes on its form, as is required; there should be no prominence nor hollow within it.
Quod si indiges extensione plus, tunc oportet, ut ponas sub titillico infirmi spheram ex panno, aut lana: et sit magnitudo eius secundum quantitatem necessitatis tuae: et extende, et eleua Furculam, et coarta spheram manu tua, donec aeques fracturam, secundum quod oportet.	 If you require more stretching, then it is necessary that you place a small ball made of cloth or wool beneath the weakened patient's neck, and its size should correspond to your need; and stretch, lift, and apply the ball with your hand until you equalize the fracture, as is required.
Quod si non potes trahere extremitatem Furculae ad exteriora: propterea, quia peruenit ad profundum: tunc oportet, ut resupinetur infirmus super ceruicem suam: et ponas sub humero eius puluinar medium in magnitudine, et premat minister humerum eius ad inferiora, donec eleuetur os Furculae quod est in profundo ad sursum: atque tunc rectifica fracturam, et aequa eam digitis tuis.	 If you cannot draw out the extremity of the Furcula to the outside because it has reached deep within; then it is necessary that the weakened patient lies on his neck and places a splint of medium size under his shoulder; and press an assistant on his humerus towards the lower part, so that the bone of the Furcula in the deep part is lifted upwards; at that time, correct the fracture and equalize it with your fingers.
Si autem sentis sathaiatum ex Furcula, et mouetur: tunc oportet, ut findas super illud, et extrahas ipsum alsathaiatum cum facilitate.	 If you feel a splinter from the Furcula and it moves; then it is necessary that you probe over it and draw out the splinter easily.
Si autem est retentum in osse, tunc ingenia in incisione eius cum uno Incisoriorum quae praeparasti ad illud, postquam tu posueris sub Furcula instrumentum quod seruat sifach: et est instrumentum ex ligno, aut ex ferro.	 If it is retained in the bone, then prepare a probe for its incision with one of the Incisorium you have prepared for that purpose; after placing an instrument under the Furcula to protect the Sifach (ligament), and this instrument can be made of wood or iron.
Et haec est forma eius.	 And this is its shape.
Assimilatur cochleari cui non est concauitas.	 It resembles a snail without a hollow part.
Et sit latitudo eius secundum illud quo indiges eo ex magnitudine ossis, et paruitate eius.	 Let its width be according to that which you require for it depending on the size of the bone and its smallness.
Longitudo uero eius etiam secundum quod possibile est tibi ad operationem.	 The length (of it) should also be, as much as possible, for your operation.
Et habeat duas extremitates, sicut uides: et extremitas una sit ampla, et altera stricta.	 It shall have two ends, as you see: one wide, and the other narrow.
Si autem disruptio uulneris quod scidisti quando extraxisti sathaiatum ossis, est ampla, et securaris ab apostemate calido: tunc aggrega duo labia uulneris cum sutura.	 If however the wound split which you cut when you pulled out the splinter of bone, is wide, and you are free from heat: then gather together two lips of the wound with suture.
Et si disruptio est parua, aut times apostema calidum: tunc imple uulnus cum pannis, et puluillis secundum quantitatem scissurae uulneris.	 And if the split is small, or you fear a hot abscess: then fill the wound with cloths, and lint according to the size of the wound cut.
Quod si accidat apostema calidum, tunc infunde pannum in oleo rosato, et aceto, et uino, et pone super ipsum.	 If a hot abscess occurs, then pour oil of rose into it, and vinegar, and wine, and place (something) on top of it.
Strictura uero ossis quando est absque uulnere, et absque sectione, est, ut ponas super os emplastrum factum ex farina molendini cum albugine oui.	 The narrowing (of a bone) without wound and without cutting, is to place on the bone a plaster made from flour milled with egg white.
Et pone stuppam lenem super ipsum.	 And place a soft cushion over it.
Deinde pone spheram sub titillico eius, si indiges illa.	 Then place a sphere under the sensitive part of it, if needed.
Deinde accipe himematem, id est, rotam quam tenent Saraceni, quae sit longa ualde: et sit latitudo eius palmi unius, aut circiter illud.	 Then take a roll (tourniquet), that which the Saracens hold, which is very long: and its width should be as large as one palm or approximately that.
Deinde pone puluillum duplicatum super stuppam et emplastrum.	 Then place lint (together) on top of the cushion and plaster.
Deinde accipe astellam ex tabula subtili, cuius latitudo sit trium digitorum, et in longitudine similiter.	 Then take a needle from a delicate wood, whose width is three fingers, and similarly in length.
Deinde inuolue eam in panno.	 Then insert it into the cloth.
Deinde inuolue pannum illum cum astella in loco alhimemati qui cadit super fracturam et locum.	 Then insert the cloth with the needle at the place of the bleeding that falls upon the fracture and place.
Deinde pone alhimemati super fracturam sicut reuoluiur, et inuolue eam super collum eius, et sub titillico eius sano, et sub titillico eius infirmo: et reduc eam super omnem partem, et quomodo uides quod strictura tenet fracturam strictura decenti: et est illud, quod non occultatur super te, et totum, ut non remoueatur astella desuper os fractum.	 Then place the astringent (tourniquet) upon the fracture as it is turned, and insert it upon its healthy part and its weak part: and tie it over all parts, so that the narrowing holds the fracture properly: and this is what must not be concealed from you, and all of it, so that the needle does not move from the broken bone.
Et propter hoc oportet, ut aspicias infirmum in omni die.	 It is necessary that you examine the sick person every day.
Quotiens ergo mollificatur ligamentum, et uides astellam iam remoueri: tunc rectifica illud, et stringe ligamentum.	 Whenever the ligament becomes soft and you see the splinter being removed, then adjust it and tighten the ligament.
Deinde pone somnum infirmi super dorsum eius, et pone sub titillico eius apud somnum eius puluinar paruum in nocte, ut cum eo eleuetur adiutorium eius a latere ipsius.	 Then place the sick person's sleep on his back and put a small pebble under his pulse during his sleep so that when he is awakened, help will be near him from the side of himself.
Eleuatur ergo fractura furculae per eleuationem humeri.	 The break in the collarbone is to be treated by elevating the shoulder.
Aut liga brachium eius ad collum ipsius: et non soluas ligamentum, si non accidat in loco accidens ex pruritu, aut ab apostemate, usque ad duodecim dies.	 Or bind the arm to the neck; and do not loosen the binding, unless it happens in the place of occurrence from itching or from an abscess, for twelve days.
Deinde renoua emplastrum, si uideris faciem eius ad illud.	 Then renew the plaster if you see his face turning towards it.
Et adde in strictura, et dimitte ipsum, donec restauretur et coaguletur.	 And add a small amount to the constriction, and let it go until it heals and hardens.
Et fractura quidem furculae stringitur et confortatur secundum plurimum in uigintiocto diebus: et quandoque fit in quibusdam hominibus in minore illo.	 The break in the collarbone is tightened and supported most for twenty days; and sometimes it happens in fewer than that number of days in some people.
¶ De restauratione fracturae Spatulae.	 Chapter on the healing of a broken oar.
Caput VII.	 Chapter 7.
Raro frangitur Spatula, et in loco lato eius: et non franguntur ex ea nisi margines eius.	 Rarely does an oar break at its wide part; and it is not broken except from the edges of it.
Quando ergo frangitur ex eo locus, et frangitur in medio eius, et non cognoscitur illud nisi per tactum: tunc secundum quod est figura fracturae conare praeparationem eius.	 When it breaks at its wide part and breaks in the middle, and this is not known except by touch; then prepare for it according to the shape of the break.
Et reduc eam super figuram naturalem omni modo ingenii, quod est tibi possibile.	 Reduce it to its natural form by any means that is possible for you.
Deinde pone super locum puluerem molendini cum albugine oui, et stuppam lenem, et pone desuper puluillum ex panno duplato.	 Then put on the place flour of milling with egg white and soft wool, and put a small cloth on top.
Deinde pone super ipsum astellam latam ex tabula subtili secundum quantitatem Spatulae totius, aut ampliorem ea parum.	 Then place over it a splint made of thin wood according to the size of the oar, or slightly larger but not much so.
Si uero sub astella est concauitas in aliquo locorum Spatulae, tunc aequa illam concauitatem cum stuppa leni, donec descendat astella secundum aequalitatem.	 If there is a hollow under the star (mark) on any spatula's handle, then fill that hollow with soft wax until the mark sinks down evenly.
Deinde ftringe desuper cum alhimemati longa, constrictione decenti, et firmitudine astellae, donec non remoueatur a loco suo.	 Then coat it on top with long alum paste, with appropriate constriction and strength of the star, until it is not removed from its place.
Et considera ligamentum in omni die.	 And consider the ligature (bandage) each day.
Quotienscunque ergo mollificatur ligamentum, stringe ipsum, et aequa astellam si remoueatur a loco suo: et iaceat infirmus super latus suum sanum.	 Whenever the ligature softens, coat it and if the star moves from its place, let it lie weak on its healthy side.
Et Spatula quidem restauratur in uiginti diebus, aut in uigintiquinque diebus.	 The spatula is restored within twenty or thirty days.
Quando ergo completur iste numerus, tunc solue ligamentum: et tu sis in securitate.	 When this number (20 or 30) is complete, then loosen the ligature: and you will be safe.
Nam ipsa est ex ossibus quorum communitio non timetur, neque eorum solutio.	 For it (the spatula handle) is made of bones whose fracture is not feared, nor their solution.
Si autem procedat ex osse frustum, et pungit sub cute: tune scinde super ipsum, et aufer ipsum.	 If a splinter comes out of the bone and pierces under the skin, then cut above it and remove it.
Et fac quod diximus in fractura furculae ex sedatione apostematis calidi, si accidat ex eo aliquid.	 And do as we have said in the treatment of a dislocated collarbone with warm poultice, if something happens from it (the spatula handle).
¶ De restauratione fracturae Pectoris.	 Chapter on the restoration of a broken breastbone.
Caput VIII.	 Chapter VIII.
Pectus quandoque frangitur in medio sui, et raro accidit illud.	 The breastbone sometimes breaks in half and this rarely happens.
Extremitates eius quidem plurimum franguntur, et comminuuntur ex accidentibus eius.	 Its extremities break more often and are crushed due to accidents of it.
Quando frangitur eius medium, quod declinat ad inferiora, et accidit ei dolor uehemens, et difficultas in anhelitu, et tussis: et fortasse euomit sanguinem, et declaratur concauitas in osse fracto, et non occultatur sensui, Restauratio eius est, ut resupinetur infirmus super dorsum suum: et pone inter Spatulas eius puluinar.	 When its middle breaks and declines towards the lower part, and it causes a violent pain, difficulty in breathing, coughing, and possibly vomiting blood, and a hollow is declared on the broken bone and not concealed from the sense, the restoration of it is that it lies weak on its back: and place between the spatulas its pulvinar.
Deinde preme humeros eius, et aggrega costas a duabus partibus uel lateribus cum manibus: et subtiliare in aequatione eius, secundum omnem modum quo possibile est illud et conuenit, donec redeat figura ossis, secundum quod oportet.	 Then press the arms and bring the ribs from both sides or flanks with hands: and grind it evenly in accordance with any way that can be possible for it to return to the shape of the bone, as is necessary.
Deinde pone super ipsum emplastrum et stuppam, et pone desuper astellam ex tabula subtili ex salice, aut chalingi, et ex eis similibus in leuitate, postquam tu inuoluis eam in panno.	 Then place upon it an ointment and a stopper, and on top of it an astel from subtle wood (such as willow or alder), or chalking (a type of plaster) and similar ones, after you have rolled it up in a cloth.
Deinde subtiliare in ligando eam super os fractum, ut non remoueatur: et uade cum ligatura secundum rotunditatem ad dorsum aliquotiens, et stringe ipsum strictura decenti.	 Then bind it firmly to the broken bone so that it is not moved: and go with the bandage according to its round shape towards the back several times, and tighten it appropriately using a suitable ligature.
Deinde considera ligaturam in omni hora, et quotienscumque mollificatur, stringe eam: et si necessitas eius prouocat ad solutionem eius apud pruritum, uel corrosionem quae accidit in loco, aut dolorem, aut apostema: tunc propera, et solue eam, et eradica emplastrum, et rectifica quod accidit cum modo curationis eius.	 Then consider the bandage in every hour, and whenever it becomes soft, tighten it; and if the need for its solution arises due to itching, corrosion that occurs at the place, or pain, or abscess: then go, unbind it, remove the ointment, and correct whatever has happened with the treatment method.
Deinde reduc emplastrum, si uides ad illud faciem: et annecte ei stricturam, donec sanetur.	 Then reduce the ointment if you see it facing that way; and connect a ligature until it heals.
¶ De restauratione Costarum, quando franguntur.	 Chapter on the restoration of ribs, when they are broken.
Caput IX.	 Chapter IX.
Scias, quod Costarum fractura non accidit, nisi in locis grossis quae sequuntur dorsum, et ex extremitatibus earum ab anteriori parte.	 Know that a rib fracture does not occur except in thick places following the back, and from the extremities of them from the anterior part.
Et non accidit eis attritio, nisi propterea, quia sunt cartilaginosae.	 And it does not occur by rubbing, unless because they are cartilaginous.
Et cognitio ipsius non occultatur sensui apud inquisitionem cum digitis.	 And the knowledge of this is not hidden from sensation during examination with fingers.
Et restauratio eius fit ita, ut aeques fracturam cum digitis secundum modum possibilem, donec aequetur figura, secundum quod oportet.	 And the restoration of it is done so that the fracture is aligned with fingers to the extent possible until it is equal in shape as required.
Deinde emplastra, et stringe os fractum cum astella, si indiget illo.	 Then apply ointment and bind the broken bone with a stopper if needed.
Et si fractura Costarum est decliuis ad interiora: tunc accidit infirmo dolor uehemens, et punctura, sicut punctura illa quae accidit illi qui habet pleuresim: propterea, quod os pungit uelamen, et etiam ei accidit difficultas anhelitus, et tussis, et uomitus sanguinis multi: et haec est difficilis curationis.	 If the rib fracture is sloping towards the inside: then a severe pain occurs, and puncture, just like the puncture that happens to one who has pleurisy: because the bone pierces the membrane (pleura), and also difficulty in breathing, coughing, and vomiting blood frequently; and this is difficult to treat.
Et iam ingeniati sunt antiqui in ea cum ingeniis multis: et ex eis sunt qui dicunt, ut ponas cibos infirmi qui generent inflammationem et uentositatem, ut inflammetur uenter, et extendatur, et impellatur fractura ad exteriora.	And the ancients were skilled in that [surgery] with many devices: and among them are those who say, that you should place foods for the sick which generate inflammation and wind, so that the belly is inflamed, and it is extended, and pushed, the fracture to the exterior.
Nos uero abhorremus, ut non fiat caussa uelox ad faciendum apostema calidum, si non accidit.	 But we abhor that a cause quick for making a hot abscess should not happen if it does not occur.
Si autem iam accidit, tunc addit in eo.	 If it has already happened, then you add it [the medicinal substance] to it.
Et dixerunt quidam eorum: ponatur super locum uentosa, deinde sugatur cum fortitudine, et est similius ratiocinationi.	 And some of them said: place a windy mixture on the location, then squeeze it with strength, and it is similar to reasoning.
Verumtamen timetur, quod attrahat uentosa superfluitates ad locum, propter dispositionem debilitatis.	 However, it is feared that windy superfluities are attracted to the location due to the arrangement of weakness.
Et dixerunt quidam eorum: oportet ut cooperiatur locus cum lana quae iam submersa est in oleo calido: et ponantur puluilli inter Costas, donec impleatur: ut sit ligatura aequalis quando inuoluis eam secundum rotunditatem.	 And some of them said: the location should be covered with wool that is already submerged in hot oil: and lice should be placed between the ribs until it is filled up: so that it will be a bandage equal when you turn it according to roundness.
Deinde curetur infirmus curatione pleuresis ex cibo et medicina.	 Then the sick person is treated with a pleural treatment from food and medicine.
Quod si coartat infirmum res uehemens, quam non tolerat, et os pungit uelamen punctura laedente, et timemus super infirmum: tunc oportet, ut scindamus super locum, et detegamus a Costa fracta.	 If something severe presses the sick person, which he cannot bear, and it touches the wound with a sharp object or prick it with a puncture, and we fear above the sick one: then it is necessary that we cut above the location and expose the broken rib.
Deinde ponamus super ea instrumentum quod conseruat sifac, cuius rememoratio praecessit: et incidamus os cum facilitate, et incidamus ipsum.	 Then we place on it an instrument that conserves sifac, whose memory has preceded: and we cut the bone with ease, and cut it itself.
Deinde aggregemus duo labia uulneris, si est magnum cum sutura: et curemus ipsum cum emplastris, donec sanetur.	 Then we bring together two lips of the wound, if it is large with stitching: and we treat it itself with plasters until it heals.
Quod si accidat interim apostema calidum, tunc propera, et infunde puluillos in oleo rosato, et pone super locum: et curetur infirmus cum eo quod conuenit apostemati.	 If a hot abscess happens meanwhile, then hurry, and pour lice into rose oil, and place it on the location: and the sick person is treated with that which is suitable for abscess.
Interim etiam resupinetur super latus super quod dormit, donec sanetur.	 The patient should also lie on the opposite side until he recovers.
¶ De restauratione fracturae Spondilium dorsi et colli.	 On the restoration of a fracture of the spine and neck.
Caput X.	 Chapter X.
Ossibus quidem colli quandoque aduenit fractura, et raro accidit eis attritio: et similiter Spondilibus dorsi etiam.	 Fracture sometimes occurs in the bones of the neck, and it rarely happens to them attrition; and similarly with the spondylus of the back.
Cum ergo accidit illud alicui, et uis scire, an sanetur, an non sanetur: tunc confidera.	 When such a thing happens to someone, and one wishes to know whether it will heal or not: then consider.
Nam si uides manus eius iam mollificatas, et stupefactas, et mortuas: et non potest mouere eas, neque extendere eas, neque constringere eas: et quando constringis eas cum digitis tuis, et pungis eas cum acu, non sentit illud, et non sentit in eis dolorem: tunc scias, quia non sanatur, et in pluribus dispositionibus est mortale.	 For if you see his hands already softened, stunned, and dead; and he cannot move them, nor extend them, nor contract them; and when you squeeze them with your fingers, and prick them with a needle, it does not feel this, nor does it feel pain in them: then know that it will not heal, and in many dispositions it is mortal.
Quod si mouet eas, et sentit in eis constrictionem cum digitis et puncturam: tunc scias, quia nucha ossis salua est, et quod infirmus sanabitur cum curatione.	 If it moves them and feels compression with fingers and prick: then know that the neck bone is intact, and that a broken one will heal with treatment.
Quod si eueniat Spondilibus dorsi simile illius, et uis scire, an sanetur etiam, an non: tunc considera ad pedes eius: tunc si uides quod mollificati sunt, et accidit in eis illud quod accidit in manibus: deinde quando iacet super dorsum suum, egreditur uentositas et egestio absque uoluntate: et quando resupinatur super uentrem suum, egreditur egestio sine uoluntate: et quando resupinatur super dorsum suum, et uult mingere, et non potest: tunc scias, quia est mortale.	 If such a thing happens to the spondylus of the back, and one wishes to know whether it will heal or not: then consider his feet; then if you see that they have become softened, and this happens in them as it happened in the hands; furthermore, when he lies on his back, discharge of wind and urine occurs involuntarily; and when he lies on his stomach, discharge of wind and urine occurs involuntarily; and when he wishes to defecate, he cannot: then know that it is mortal.
Non ergo labores in curatione eius.	 Therefore, do not labor in its treatment.
Si uero non accidit ei aliquid ex illo, res est leuior.	 If nothing happens to him from that, the matter is lighter.
Et curatio eius quod accidit ex illo est, ut coneris sedationem apostematis calidi: ita, ut ponas super Spondilem attritam oleum rosatum solum: aut cum uitellis oui assati.	 And the treatment for that which happens to him from that is, to apply warm compresses of apothecary's pitch; thus, you should place upon the affected spondylus warm olive oil or fresh cheese of lamb.
Pone super ipsam illud aliquotiens in die, donec quando sedatur apostema calidum: tum pone super locum unum ex emplastris confortantibus, exiccantibus, et stringe super ipsum cum ligamento: et praecipe infirmo, ut utatur quiete et tranquillitate.	 Place upon it several times a day until the warm compress is absorbed; then place upon one spot of an ointment that comforts and heals, and bind it over with a bandage, and instruct the sick person to rest quietly and peacefully.
Nec dormiat super partem cum qua inuenit dolorem, donec sanetur.	 He shall not sleep on the part where he found pain, until it is healed.
Quod si accidit apud attritionem ossis sathaiatum, aut aliquid quod iam separatum fit ex eo: tunc oportet, ut seces super cutem, et auferas illud.	 If it happens to be a fracture of the nasal bone or something that is already separated from it: then one should saw through the skin, and remove it.
Deinde aggrega duo labia uulneris, si est magnum, cum sutura.	 Then, bring together the two edges of the wound, if it is large, with suturing.
Deinde cura ipsum cum aliquo incarnatiuo, ex unguentis, donec sanetur.	 Then take care of himself with some fat, from ointments, until he is healed.
Si uero frangitur postremum ossis alhausos, et est finis caudae: tunc oportet, ut intromittas pollicem manus sinistrae in anum, et aeques os fractum manu altera, secundum quod possibile est, et secunda aequatione.	 If however the last bone of the jaw is broken, and it is at the end of the neck: then one should insert the thumb of the left hand into the nose, and with the other hand, align the broken bone as much as possible, according to what is feasible, and according to the second alignment.
Deinde pone super ipsum, et aufer ipsum: et cura uulnus cum curatione quae praecessit, donec sanetur.	 Then place it on top and remove it: and take care of the wound as before, until it is healed.
¶ De restauratione Anchae.	 Chapter on repairing anus.
Caput XI.	 Chapter 11.
Raro franguntur ossa Ancharum.	 Rarely are the bones of the anus broken.
Quod si franguntur, tunc fractura eorum non est, nisi comminutio in extremitatibus ipsorum: et scinduntur in longitudine, et declinantur ad interiora: et accidit infirmo dolor in loco, et punctura: et stupescit crus quod frangitur.	 If they break, then the fracture of their bones is not anything but a comminution at their extremities: and they are split lengthwise and inclined towards the inside: and it occurs that there is pain in the place, and puncturing: and the leg which breaks becomes numb.
Et restauratio quidem eius est, ut extendas manum tuam super ipsum, donec stes super fracturam qualiter est figura eius.	 And the restoration [of the broken bone] is that you place your hand upon it until you stand over the fracture as its shape is.
Quod si fractura est in extremitatibus eius tantum, tunc aequa illam fracturam, secundum quod praeparatur tibi ex aequatione, donec assimiletur figurae suae naturali.	 If the fracture is only at its extremities, then you should adjust that fracture according to how it is prepared for you by the equation, until it resembles its natural shape.
Si autem fractura est in longitudine, aut iam declinat ad interiora: tunc fac iacere infirmum super uentrem suum, donec praeparetur tibi restauratio illius fracturae.	 If the fracture is along its length or already inclines towards the inside: then make the weak one lie on his belly, until the restoration of that fracture is prepared for you.
Quando ergo aequaueris ipsam, pone super ipsam emplastrum: deinde pone super ipsam astellam ex ligno, aut ex cute: et stringe strictura super quam non timeas permutationem fracturae, neque remotionem astellae.	 When you have adjusted it [the broken bone], place ointment on it; then place a splint made of wood or hide over it, and bind a bandage over the splint where you will not fear the displacement of the fracture or removal of the splint.
Et aequa concauitatem illorum cum eo quod impleat eam, donec capiat eam strictura secundum aequalitatem: et praecipe infirmo, ut dormiat super dorsum suum, aut super latus suum sanum.	 And adjust the concavity [of the bone fragments] with what will fill it up until the bandage encloses it according to its equal shape; and command the weak one to sleep on his back or healthy side.
Si autem accidat ei apostema calidum: tunc cessa ab extensione eius, et ipsius restauratione, donec sedetur apostema calidum: et pone super ipsum quod sedet ipsum, secundum quod praecessit, deinde redi ad restaurationem eius: et stringe ipsum sicut oportet.	 If a hot abscess happens to him [the patient]: then stop the extension and restoration of it until the hot abscess sits; and place on it whatever sits under it, as before, then return to its restoration; and bind it as necessary.
Si uero accidit in osse satagie, aut comminuitur, extrahe.	 If it happens in a bone with pus, or if it is crushed, extract it.
¶ De restauratione fracturae Adiutorii.	 Chapter on the restoration of the fracture of the ulna (forearm bone).
Caput XII.	 Chapter 12.
Adiutorium est illud, quod est inter cubitum usque ad caput Spatulae.	 The ulna is that which lies between the elbow and the end of the spatula (wrist).
Si ergo frangitur, tunc restauratio eius est secundum unum duorum modorum.	 If it breaks, then its restoration is according to one of two modes.
Quorum unus est: ut accipias lignum planum mediae grossitudinis, secundum hanc formam, quae sequitur.	 One mode is that you take a flat piece of wood of medium thickness in the shape that follows.
Et ligentur in duabus extremitatibus duo ligamenta.	 And [the piece of wood] will be bound at its two extremities with two bands.
Deinde suspendatur ex loco eleuato: et sedeat infirmus super sedem.	 Then it is suspended from a raised place: and the sick one sits on a seat.
Deinde proiiciat brachium suum fractum super lignum, donec perueniat ad titillicum eius, in cuius medio sit annexa curuitas ligni.	 Then let him cast his broken arm upon the wood until he reaches its notch, in whose middle is attached a cleft of the wood.
Deinde suspende desuper ipsum aliquid graue, ut extendat ipsum minister ad inferiora.	 Then raise something heavy above him so that the assistant may stretch him to the lower parts.
Deinde aequet medicus fracturam manibus suis simul, donec redeat fractura, secundum quod oportet.	 Then the physician joins the break with his hands until it returns, as required.
Et modus alter est, ut resupinetur infirmus super ceruicem suam: et suspende manum eius a collo ipsius cum ligamento.	 And another method is that the sick one lies down on his neck: and hang his hand from his neck with a strap.
Deinde praecipe duobus ministris, ut teneat unus eorum illud quod est supra fracturam cum manibus suis: et ut alter teneat inferius eius, et extendat unusquisque eorum ad partem suam.	 Then order two assistants that one of them holds what is above the break with his hands: and that the other holds below him, and each one stretches to his side.
Et si uis, ut sit extensio fortior, tunc stringe sub fractura cum ligamento, et supra ipsam cum ligamento alio: et extendat ea unusquisque duorum ministrorum ad duas partes suas.	 And if you wish a stronger extension, then tie below the break with a strap, and above it with another strap: and each of the two assistants stretches to his two sides.
Si ergo fractura est propinqua extremitati humeri, tunc oportet, ut ponatur unum ligamentum sub titillico, et alterum sub fractura uersus cubitum.	 If therefore the break is near the end of the shoulder, then it is necessary that a strap be placed under the notch, and another under the break facing the elbow.
Et similiter si fractura est propinqua cubito: tunc oportet, ut ponatur ligamentum super illum locum, et super cubitum ipsum.	 And likewise if the break is near the elbow: then it is necessary that a strap be placed over that place, and over the elbow itself.
Deinde aequa fracturam cum facilitate absque labore, donec quando aequatur fractura secundum quod oportet, et applicatur applicatione bona: tunc stringe eam, si non accidit apostema calidum.	 Then equal the break with ease and without labor, until when it is joined as required, and applied with a good dressing: then tie it if no hot abscess occurs.
Si uero accidit apostema calidum, tunc dimitte stricturam usque ad diem septimum.	 If, however, a hot abscess occurs, then release the binding for seven days.
Et pone super ipsum lanam succidam imbibitam in aceto et oleo rosato, donec quando quiescit apostema: tunc stringe eam: et modus stringendi eam est, ut ponas emplastrum super fracturam.	 And place above him linen cloth soaked in vinegar and rose oil until the abscess subsides: then tie it: and the method of binding is that you put a plaster over the break.
Deinde pone inuolutionem ex panno nouo super emplastrum.	 Then place a new cloth layer on top of the plaster.
Deinde aggreget brachium super adiutorium ipsum, et ponat manum suam apertam super humerum suum.	 Then gather the arm upon the support itself, and place his open hand upon his shoulder.
Et pone pannum, et stringe super adiutorium brachium, ut brachium stet loco astellarum: si non prohibet te ab illo aliquid, neque alteretur super te aliquid ex osse fracto.	 Place the cloth and tie the arm to the support so that the arm remains in place like a star; if it does not prevent you from doing anything or if something from the broken bone does not change on you.
Quod si times, quod alteretur super te ex osse fracto aliquid, tunc utere astellis: et est, ut ponas super fracturam ipsam astellam quae sit latior et fortior reliquis astellis.	 If you fear that something from the broken bone may change on you, then use stars; and there is, so that you place upon the fracture itself a star which is wider and stronger than the other stars.
Et ponas inter omnem astellam latitudinem digiti: et sit longitudo astellarum secundum fracturam cum additione trium digitorum ab omni parte.	 And place the width of each star at the size of a finger; and let the length of the stars be according to the fracture with an addition of three fingers from every part.
Deinde stringe super astellas strictura quam dixi in principio capituli.	 Then tie on the stars with the bandage as I said at the beginning of the chapter.
Et est, ut sit strictura tua super locum fracturae strictior.	 And it is so that your bandage is tighter over the place of the fracture.
Et quanto plus elongatur fractura, sit strictura minor.	 And as the fracture becomes longer, let the bandage be looser.
Si ergo uides situm astellarum et stricturam, sicut diximus, in hora qua restauras membrum statim, tunc fac: et si times apostema calidum, tunc dimitte stricturam et astellas usque ad diem septimum, sicut diximus.	 If you see the position of the stars and the bandage as we said, in the hour when you restore the member immediately, then do so; and if you fear a hot abscess, then leave off the bandage and the stars until the seventh day, as we said.
Deinde considera ligamentum in omnibus tribus diebus, ut non accidat in loco pruritus, aut inflatio, aut prohibeatur cibus peruenire ad membrum, propter dispositionem superfluitatis stricturae.	 Then consider the bandage in all three days to avoid itching or swelling in that place, or for food to be prevented from reaching the member because of the accumulation of superfluity due to the tightness of the bandage.
Rectifica ergo illud totum, secundum quod diximus.	 Therefore correct this entire matter as we said.
Si uero es super fiduciam, ut non accidat ex illo aliquid: tunc non soluas ligamentum, nisi post tres dies, aut plus.	 If you are of the trust that nothing will happen from it: then do not loosen the bandage unless after three days or more.
Et sit dormitio infirmi super dorsum suum, et manus eius super stomachum suum: et pone sub adiutorio culcitram plenam lana aequaliter.	 And let the sick person sleep on his back and place his hands on his stomach; and put under the support a mat full of wool equally.
Et considera in omni hora noctis, aut diei, ut non soluatur figura membri fracta, aut mollificetur ligamentum.	 And consider at every hour of the night or day that the shape of the broken member does not become loose, or the bandage becomes soft.
Rectifica ergo illud totum uirtute tua.	 Correct that entirely with your power.
Et pone cibum infirmi secundum ordinem quem praemisimus, ita ut sit cibus subtilis in primis, donec incipiat os stringi: tunc oportet, ut ingrosses cibum eius.	 Feed the sick person according to the order we have prescribed, so that the food is subtle at first until the bone begins to close; then it should be increased in size.
De consuetudine enim adiutorii et cruris est, ut stringatur in quadraginta diebus: tunc ergo oportet, ut soluatur, et administretur balneum, et medicetur cum unguentis quae rectificant illud.	 For the custom of aid and the leg is that it should be bound for forty days; then it must be loosened, a bath administered, and it should be treated with ointments that correct it.
Quod si fractura fuerit foeda, attrita: tunc non soluas ab ea ligamentum et astellas usque ad quinquaginta dies, et usque ad duos menses.	 If the fracture is foul, scrape it; then do not loosen the bandage and splints for fifty days, nor for two months.
¶ De restauratione fracturae Brachii.	 Chapter on the restoration of an arm fracture.
Caput XIII.	 Chapter 13.
Brachium est compositum ex duobus ossibus, quae nominantur duo focilia.	 The arm is made up of two bones which are called the two humerus bones.
Quorum unum est paruum: et est illud quod sequitur pollicem.	 One of them is small: it follows the little finger.
Et alterum est magnum, et est illud quod est positum sub paruo ab inferiori parte.	 And the other is large, and it is placed below the small one from beneath.
Fortasse ergo frangitur focile maius solum, aut paruum: et fortasse franguntur simul.	 Therefore, the larger humerus bone may be broken alone, or the smaller one; and they may break simultaneously.
Quando ergo frangitur focile paruum superius, tunc restauratio eius est facilis, et sanatio eius est facilior.	 If therefore the smaller humerus bone is broken at the top, then the restoration of it is easy, and its healing is easier.
Et quando frangitur focile inferius, est fractura eius mala, et sanatio eius difficilis.	 And if the larger humerus bone is broken below, the fracture is bad, and its healing is difficult.
Et deterior ea est, quando franguntur duo ossa simul.	 It becomes worse when both bones break simultaneously.
Si ergo os quod frangitur est focile parum superius, tunc conuenit medico apud restaurationem eius, ut ponat extensionem paruam cum facilitate, donec aequet ipsum.	 If the bone that is broken is the smaller humerus bone at the top, then it is fitting for the doctor at its restoration that he should put an extension of lesser size with ease until it matches it.
Si uero focile magnum est illud quod fractum est: tunc oportet, ut ponat stricturam fortiorem ualde.	 But if the larger humerus bone is the one that is broken, then it is necessary to put a strong bandage on it.
Et oportet, ut ponat figuram manus apud restaurationem eius, et ipsius extensionem extensam super puluinar.	 And it is necessary to put the hand shape at its restoration and its extension extended over the pulley.
Et sit pollex manus ad superiora altior omnibus digitis: et sit articularis inferior omnibus digitis, uel reliquis: et infirmus sedens quadratus super seipsum, et sit puluinar coram eo, uel in directo eius, in altitudine, ut non incurrat infirmus laborem.	 The thumb of the hand should be higher than all the fingers; and the inferior joint should be higher than all the digits, or the rest [of them]; and if it is weak, the sitting man should be square with himself, and the pulley be in front of him, or directly below him, at a height so that the weak man does not strain.
Deinde extendat minister Brachium ab inferiori parte, aut manu sua, aut cum ligamento.	 Then, the assistant should stretch out the arm from the lower part, either with his hand, or with a rope.
Et minister alius extendat desuper similiter.	 And another assistant shall stretch out likewise above [it].
Deinde aequet medicus os, donec reducat ipsum secundum meliorem figuram quam potest.	 Then the physician shall set the bone until he has reduced it as best as possible to its proper form.
Quod si in fractura ossis sunt satagiae, tunc conare reducere omne frustum in loco suo uirtute tua.	 If there are pus-filled sores in the bone fracture, then try to reduce every fragment into its place with your strength.
Si uero apparet in eo sathaiatum separatum, et pungit cutem, et non est tibi spes in restauratione eius: tunc finde super ipsum, et aufer ipsum secundum modum quem diximus in eis quae praemissa sunt.	 If it appears that the pus-filled sore is separated and pierces the skin, and there is no hope of restoring it: then puncture it and remove it as we have said in the preceding [instructions].
Si autem fractura est cum uulnere, ego iam feci ad illud capitulum singulare, ergo accipe curationem illius inde.	 If there is a bone fracture with a wound: I have already made a separate chapter for that subject, so receive treatment from there.
Quod si accidat in principio tuae restaurationis apostema calidum, tunc line pannum cum caeroto facto ex oleo rosato, et caera alba, et sit medium inter spissitudinem et subtilitatem: et stringe pannum super ipsum strictura subtili, donec quando sedatur apostema: tunc remoue caerotum, et pone emplastrum praeparatum ex puluere molendini cum albumine oui.	 If a hot abscess occurs at the beginning of your treatment, then prepare a cloth with wax made from rose oil, white beeswax, and have it between thickness and subtlety; and tie the cloth over it with a thin ligature until the abscess settles; then remove the wax, and apply the ready-made plaster prepared from milled powder with egg white.
Deinde pone astellas, et sit astella quae ponitur super fracturam ipsam latior parumper, et fortior.	 Then place a splint, and let the splint placed over the fracture be somewhat wider and stronger.
Et scias, quod numerus astellarum Brachii est sex in pluribus dispositionibus: siue sit fractura in focili uno, aut in duobus focilibus simul.	 And know that the number of splints for the arm is six in various positions; whether it is a fracture in one splint, or in two splints at once.
Deinde pone stricturam tuam super locum fracturae fortiorem et uehementiorem, et aliquanto plus cum strictura ad superiora fracturae, aut ad inferiora eius: aut pone stricturam molliorem strictura eius parumper, secundum quod praecessit rememoratio eius in principio capituli.	 Then place a stronger and more powerful ligature over the location of the fracture, and apply a ligature with more string than the one at the top or bottom of the fracture; or place a softer ligature a little below the one mentioned earlier, according to what was recalled in the beginning of the chapter.
Et sint panni qui inuoluuntur super fracturam, panni lenes, humidi: et non sint duri, asperi.	 The fabric that is wrapped around a fracture should be soft, wet and not hard or rough.
Et sit filum quo stringitur ex lino proprie, medium inter subtile et grossum, sicut narrauimus.	 The thread with which it is tied should be made of linen specifically, neither too fine nor too coarse, as we have said.
Et considera membrum et ligamentum post dies.	 After days, examine the limb and ligament.
Quod si accidat aliquid cuius rectificatio sit necessaria, sicut pruritus qui accidit membro: tunc oportet, ut embroces membrum cum aqua calefacta, donec quiescat ille pruritus, et dimittas membrum non constrictum, donec quiescat, deinde itera stricturam.	 If something happens that requires correction, such as itching in the limb: then, one must heat embrocation for the limb with warm water until the itching stops, and release the unbound limb until it calms down, then repeat the binding.
Quod si strictura iam mollificata est, et os iam remotum, et similia illis: tunc rectifica illud totum uirtute tua, et considera iterum.	 If the binding has already been softened and the bone removed, along with similar cases: then correct it completely with your skill, and examine again.
Nam si nutrimentum prohibetur peruenire ad membrum, propter superfluitatem stricturae, tunc oportet, ut mollifices ipsum parumper, et dimittas ipsum aliquot diebus, donec currat ad ipsum nutrimentum, deinde stringe ipsum.	 If nutrition is prevented from reaching the limb due to excessive binding, then one must soften it slightly and release it for a few days until it reaches the same nutrition, then bind it again.
Si autem non accidit infirmo aliquid eorum quae diximus, tunc non oportet, ut soluatur, nisi post uiginti dies, aut circiter hos.	 If nothing happens to the weak limb from what we have said, then it is not necessary to be released, unless after 20 days or about this time.
Deinde suspendatur manus infirmi ad collum eius.	 Then, the weak hand should be suspended to its neck.
Et sit collum eius aequale, et custodiatur uirtute sua a motibus agitatiuis.	 Its neck should be kept straight and it should be guarded with your skill against excessive movements.
Et fac eum dormire super dorsum suum.	 Make him sleep on his back.
Et scias, quod haec fractura in triginta diebus, aut in triginta duobus diebus restauratur: et fortasse restauratur in uigintiocto diebus.	 Know that this fracture is restored within 30 or 40 days; it may possibly be restored in 28 days.
Totum illud est secundum dispositiones complexionum, et dispositiones uirtutis.	 Everything is according to the dispositions of temperaments and the dispositions of virtue.
¶ De restauratione fracturarum Manus.	 Chapter on the Restoration of Fractures: Hand.
Caput XIIII.	 Chapter XIV.
Scias, quod pectini Manus, et nodis digitorum raro accidit fractura.	 Know that a scissor's hand and the knots of fingers rarely occur a fracture.
Et non accidit ei, nisi attritio multotiens.	 It occurs to him only through frequent rubbing.
Quando ergo accidit plantae fractura, aut attritio: tunc oportet, ut sedeat infirmus quadratus: et coram eo sit sedes secundum aequalitatem.	 When a break or injury occurs in the foot, then it is necessary that the sick person sits on a level surface opposite to him.
Deinde pone Manum eius super eam extensam.	 Then place his hand upon it extended.
Deinde extendat minister ossa fracta, et aequet ea medicus, donec quando coniunguntur coniunctione bona.	 Then the assistant extends the broken bones, and the doctor adjusts them until they join together well.
Tunc oportet, ut ponat emplastrum et stuppam, si non accidat apostema calidum.	 Then it is necessary to place the plaster and the wool, unless a warm abscess occurs.
Deinde pone astellam desuper secundum quantitatem loci: et tu iam inuoluisti eam in panno lini.	 Then place the splint over it according to the size of the place; and now you have already wrapped it in linen cloth.
Si autem fractura est ad inferiora circiter uentrem plantae, tunc fac simile spherae ex panno: et praecipe infirmo, ut coartet super eam cum planta sua fracta: deinde stringatur cum panno longo.	 If the break is at the lower part near the sole of the foot, then make something similar to a ball from cloth; and order the sick person to bend over it with his injured foot; then wrap it tightly with a long cloth.
Et sit astella ex corio, in quo sit lenitas, ut applicetur corium cum corpore plantae: et stringe eam, secundum quod oportet.	 And let the splint be of leather, which has softness, so that it may be applied to the body of the foot; and tie it as necessary.
Si autem fractura est ad exteriora, tunc oportet: ut ponas astellam desuper, et astellam aliam ab inferiori in planta: et sit manus aperta recta.	 If the break is at the outside, then it is necessary to place a splint over it and another below on the foot; and keep the hand open straight.
Deinde pone stricturam, sicut reuoluitur manus: et extende inter digitos cum ligamento.	 Then apply the bandage, as the hand rolls; and extend between the fingers with a ligament.
Quod si accidat fractura alicui nodorum digitorum, tunc si est pollex, aequetur secundum quod oportet.	 If there is a break in any of the knuckles of the fingers, and it is the thumb, then adjust it as necessary.
Deinde stringatur cum planta: et si amas, pone ei astellam rectam, paruam: ut eleuetur fractura, et non moueatur.	 Then tie it with the palm of the hand; and if there is a wound, place a straight splint below it, small, so that the break is elevated and not moved.
Si autem fractura est reliquis digitis, sicut medio, et indici, aut auriculari, et anulari, tunc aequetur, et ligetur cum digito sano qui sequitur eum: aut ligentur omnes secundum continuationem: et est melius.	 If the break is in the other fingers, such as the middle finger, index finger, or little finger, then adjust it, and tie it to the healthy finger that follows it; or tie all of them according to their continuity; and this is better.
Aut pone super ipsum astellam paruam, sicut diximus in pollice.	 Or place a small splint over it, as was said for the thumb.
Et considera in restauratione tua, et post ipsam dispositionem apostematis calidi: et oppone cum eo quod oportet, quando accidit aliquid ex illo, secundum quod iteratur eius narratio.	 Consider in your restoration, and after its arrangement remove the tumor with warm [substance]: and apply to it what is necessary, when something happens from that, according to his story's repetition.
¶ De restauratione fracturae Coxae.	 On the Restoration of the Hip Fracture.
Caput XV.	 Chapter XV.
OS Coxae multotiens frangitur, et declaratur sensui: quoniam conuertitur ad interiorem et posteriorem partem.	 The hip is often broken and becomes apparent to the senses because it turns towards the inner and posterior part.
Et restauratio eius fit ita, quod stringitur ligamentum supra fracturam, et ligamentum aliud sub fractura.	 And its restoration is done in such a way that the ligament above the fracture is tightened, and another ligament below the fracture.
Et infirmus prostretur super faciem suam.	 The patient stretches himself out on his face.
Deinde extendat omne ligamentum minister ad partem suam secundum aequalitatem: et hoc, quando est fractura in medio ossis.	 Then, stretch every ligament that belongs to its part equally: and this when the fracture is in the middle of the bone.
Si autem est fractura propinqua radici Coxae, tunc sit ligamentum ad partem pectinis, ut cadat extensio ad sursum: et ligamentum aliud sub fractura.	 If it is a fracture close to the root of the hip, then let there be a ligament towards the wing-shaped part, so that the extension falls upward; and another ligament below the fracture.
Et sic similiter si est fractura propinqua genu, tunc sit ligamentum propinquum genu, ut sit extensio ad inferiora.	 And similarly if it is a fracture close to the knee, then let there be a ligament near the knee, so that the extension is towards the lower parts.
Deinde aequet medicus os utriusque manibus suis, donec reducat ipsum secundum similitudinem figurae naturalis: et coniugatur os coniunctione bona.	 Then the physician reduces the bone with both hands until he restores it to its natural shape; and the bone is united by a good union.
Tunc oportet, ut ponas emplastrum et stricturam, si non accidit membro apostema.	 It is then necessary to apply a plaster and a bandage if there is no tumor on the limb.
Quod si accidat in eo apostema: tunc dimitte ipsum diebus aliquot, donec sedetur apostema calidum, deinde redi ad curationem tuam.	 If a tumor occurs in it: then let it be left for several days until the warm tumor subsides; then return to your treatment.
Strictura autem eius ita sit.	 The bandage of this should be in such a way.
Oportet ut inuoluas super fracturam imema duram, id est, bindam: et dupla eam bis, aut ter: et remaneat ex ea superfluitas.	 It is necessary to wind something hard over the fracture, that is, a bandage; and double it twice or thrice; and there should be excess in it.
Deinde inuolue crus, donec perueniat calcaneus apud radicem natis.	 Then wind the leg until it reaches the calcaneus at the root of the toes.
Et intromitte filum longum inter Coxam et crus prope genu ad inferiora, et ueniant extremitates fili a superiori parte duarum partium.	 Insert a long thread between the hip and the leg near the knee towards the lower parts, and let the ends of the thread come from the upper side of each part.
Deinde reuolue super Crus et Coxam quod superfluit ex alimema.	 Then wind around the leg and hip that which is surplus from the bowels.
Deinde pone super Coxam in loco fracturae ipsius astellas, et pone ex eis astellam unam super os cruris.	 Thereafter place a star on the hip at the location of its own fracture, and place one star upon the bone of the leg.
Deinde imple uacuitates inter crus et coxam cum pannis lenibus, ut aequetur strictura.	 Then fill the voids between the leg and hip with soft cloths, so that they may be made firm.
Deinde incipe cum strictura forti a medio super locum fracturae tribus inuolutionibus, aut quatuor.	 Thereafter begin the strong suture at the middle above the location of the fracture with three or four turns.
Et quanto plus elongaris cum ligamento a loco fracturae, sit strictura tua minor et mollior, et lenior.	 And as you extend more with the ligament from the location of the fracture, let your suture be smaller and softer, and looser.
Deinde intende ad duas extremitates fili, quod tu intromisisti inter coxam et crus.	 Then direct the two ends of the thread which you inserted between the hip and the leg.
Liga ergo cum utrisque tres astellas quae sunt desuper.	 Tie then three stars with each of them that are above.
Deinde uade cum duabus extremitatibus fili ad inferiora, donec peruenias ad cauillam pedis.	 Then go with the two ends of the thread to the lower parts until you reach the ankle of the foot.
Et cum utrisque stringe etiam extremitates astellarum a parte altera: ut non remoueatur ligamentum ex loco suo.	 And with each tie also the ends of the stars on the other side: so that the ligament may not be removed from its place.
Deinde dimitte stricturam super illud, dum permanet, ita quod non accidat membro corrosio, neque apostema, neque inflatio, et similia eis.	 Then release the suture above that, until it remains, so that no rot can occur on the limb, nor abscess, nor swelling, or similar things.
Quod si accidat aliquid ex illo.	 If anything happens from that.
Propera ergo cum solutione eius, et rectifica illud quod accidit inde totum, secundum quod diximus multotiens.	 Approach then with the solution of it, and correct completely what happened there, according to what we have said many times.
Si uero in osse est frustum ex osse quod pungat: tunc oportet, ut aeques illud, si est tibi possibile.	 But if there is a splinter in the bone that pierces: then it is necessary, to equalize it, if it is possible for you.
Et si non, finde super illud, et remoue illud: et cura cum eo cuius praecessit rememoratio, donec sanetur.	 And if not, seal over it, and remove it: and treat with care the one who preceded it in memory, until it is healed.
Et quandoque stringitur haec fractura Coxae, praeter quod addantur ei astellae, sicut diximus in adiutorio et brachio.	 And sometimes this hip fracture is sutured, besides the addition of stars, as we said in assistance and in the arm.
Verumtamen in restauratione eius taliter fracta, non accidit infirmo claudicatio.	 In the restoration of such a fracture, it does not happen that the infirm (person) limps.
Et si restauratur sola, praeter quod applicetur ei crus alterum, tunc necesse est, ut claudicet ille cuius est, semper.	 If only one is restored (the broken part), except if another leg is applied to it, then it is necessary that the one whose it is limps forever.
Et scias, quod Coxa stringitur in quinquaginta diebus, uel additur parum, aut minuitur parum: totum illud est secundum diuersitatem complexionum, et reliquarum dispositionum.	 And know that the hip is bound for 50 days, or a little more, or a little less; all of this is according to differences in complexions and other dispositions.
¶ De restauratione fracturae Rotulae genu.	 Chapter on the restoration of the knee joint fracture.
Caput XVI.	 Chapter 16.
Scias, quod Rotulae genu raro accidit fractura, sed accidit ei attritio multotiens.	 Know that the fracture of the patella of the knee joint occurs rarely, but it often happens that it wears down (rubs).
Si uero accidit ei fractura, tunc non nisi aut fissura, aut foramen in partibus suis.	 If there is a fracture, then it is not anything other than a crack or a hole in its parts.
Et est illud cum uulnere, et absque uulnere.	 And it is with (accompanied by) a wound, and without a wound.
Et statur super illud totum cum sensu.	 It stands on the whole of it with feeling.
Et restauratio eius est ita, ut aequetur quod disruptum est ex partibus eius cum digitis, donec aggregetur, et coniungatur secundum quod possibile est ex aequatione et facilitate, et fabricatione.	 The restoration of it is such that it is fitted together from its parts with the fingers until it is united, according to what is possible from fitting and ease, and construction.
Deinde pone emplastrum ex farina sisami, uel molendini, cum albumine oui: et pone super ipsum astellam rotundam, si indiges illa: et stringe desuper strictura conueniente ad illud.	 Then apply a plaster made from rice flour or milled wheat with egg white; place on top of it a round bandage if needed; and bind above with a suitable binding for that.
Deinde considera omnes dispositiones quas narrauimus in reliquis fracturis: sicut apostema calidum, et similia illi: ita, ut opponas omni accidenti cum eo quod conuenit ei, donec sanetur.	 Then consider all the dispositions that we have mentioned in other fractures; such as a hot abscess and similar things; so that you oppose to each event with what is suitable for it until it heals.
¶ De restauratione fracturae Cruris.	 Chapter on the restoration of the leg fracture.
Caput XVII.	 Chapter 17.
Scias, quod Cruri sunt duo ossa, quorum unum est grossum, et nominatur nomine Cruris: et alterum subtile, et nominatur Focile.	 Know that there are two bones in the leg, one of which is large and is called by the name "leg"; and the other small and slender, and is called "shin".
Et accidit utrisque ex speciebus fracturae quod accidit duobus ossibus brachii: et propter illud fit restauratio eius, sicut restauratio brachii aequaliter, et operatio est una.	 And it happens that there are the same kinds of fractures for both bones of the leg as for the two bones of the arm; and because of this, the restoration of it is the same as the restoration of the arm, and the operation is one.
Quod si franguntur duo ossa simul, conuertitur Crus ad omnes partes.	 If two bones are broken together, the leg is turned in all directions.
Et si frangitur os subtilius, conuertitur Crus ad anteriorem partem.	 If a bone is broken more delicately, the leg is turned to the front part.
Et si frangitur os grossius, inuenis illud inferius: et est ex eis quae non occultantur tibi.	 If a bone is broken coarsely, you will find it lower and it belongs to those that are not hidden from you.
Deinde administra extensionem, et aequationem, et ligationem astellarum secundum illud aequaliter.	 Then administer the extension, the equality, and the binding of stars according to that equally.
Verumtamen oportet, si fractura Cruris est fractura foeda, habens sethagie multa: ut sit extensio minor, et lenior alleuiatione tua.	 Nevertheless, if the fracture of the leg is a foul one, having many seithages: let the extension be less and the alluviation softer by you.
Et in Crure quidem est ex operatione quiddam super brachium: et est, ut quando tu aequas astellas, et comples omnem operationem tuam, tunc accipe duas fascias ex ligno pini, quod administratur in fabricatione solariorum quod ponitur sub tabulis: et fiunt ex spatulis palmae: et elige ex eis quibus est grossitudo parua, et neque sint ex minutis: et sit longitudo earum secundum longitudinem Cruris a genu usque inferius.	 And in the leg there is something from the operation that resembles the arm and it is, when you equalize the stars, and complete your entire operation, then take two bands made of pine wood which are used for the construction of solaria placed under the tables; they are made of spatulas of the palm and choose those with little thickness and not from the small ones; and let their length be according to the length of the leg from the knee downwards.
Deinde inuolue super unamquamque pannum duabus inuolutionibus secundum longitudinem eius.	 Then roll up on one band with two folds according to its length.
Et pone unam partem Cruris a parte una, et alteram a parte altera: et sint ex genu usque inferius pedis.	 And place one part of the leg on one side and the other part on the other; they should be from the knee down to the foot.
Deinde liga duas fascias in tribus locis ex duabus extremitatibus et medio.	 Then bind the two bands at three places from two ends and the middle.
Cum enim strictura prohibetur, Crus declinat ad dextram et sinistram, et stat statione bona.	 For if pressure is forbidden, the leg inclines to the right and left, and stands firmly in a good position.
Et iam quidem administretur cunabulum ex ligno secundum longitudinem Cruris, et ponatur in eo Crus, ut conseruet ipsum a motu.	 And already the cradle made of wood according to the length of the leg should be placed under it to keep it still.
Et plurimum quidem oportet, ut facias illud in fractura quando cum ea est uulnus proprie.	 And indeed you should make that in the fracture when there is a wound properly.
Deinde considera Crus in omni die, et stude cum eo studio ultimo ab apostemate, aut inflatione, aut reliquis aliis.	 Then consider the leg every day and strive with it the utmost diligence from swelling, or inflammation, or other things.
Si ergo accidit aliquid ex illis, tunc oppone ei cum eo quod oportet, usquequo sanetur, si Deus uoluerit.	 If something from these occurs, then oppose it with what is necessary, until it heals, if God wills.
De fractura ossium Pedis, et Digitorum.	 On the Fracture of Bones in the Foot and Fingers.
Caput XVIII.	 Chapter XVIII.
Calcaneo quidem non accidit fractura penitus.	 The calcaneus does not suffer a complete fracture.
Ossibus uero Pedis accidit quandoque fractura, et Digitis parum etiam accidit fractura: et non accidit eis nisi attritio in pluribus dispositionibus.	 Bones of the foot do sometimes suffer a fracture, and fractures do also occur seldom in the fingers; they do not occur unless there is rubbing in various positions.
Quod si accidit ossibus Pedis fractura, et uides illa ossa sublimari super se adinuicem, tunc ponat infirmus Pedem suum super terram praeparatam, sicut ambulans.	 If a fracture of the bones in the foot occurs and you see those bones rising above one another, then place the injured foot on the ground prepared like when walking.
Deinde sta tu, et pone Pedem tuum super illud quod eleuatur ex illis ossibus: postea preme, uel calca eam: et aequa ipsam, donec redeat in locis suis.	 Then stand you and place your foot on what rises from those bones; then press, or trample it; and apply equal pressure until it returns to its original position.
Deinde pone emplastrum, et stuppam desuper: et pone sub uentre Pedis tabulam paruam, cui sint duo capita plana.	 Then place ointment and wool on top of it; and place a small board under the heel, with two flat heads.
Deinde stringe eam cum Pede strictura decenti, postquam tu inuoluis eam cum pannis, et reliquis quibus indiget.	 Then tie the foot with a suitable binding when you have wrapped it with linen and whatever else is required.
Cum ergo praetereunt ei tres dies, aut quatuor, tunc solue ligamentum.	 When three or four days have passed, then loosen the binding.
Nam tu inuenies ossa aequata, siue sint fracta, aut sint dislocata.	 For you will find the bones to be aligned if they are fractured or dislocated.
Operatio ergo in eis est, sicut uides.	 Therefore, the operation is as you see it.
Si autem franguntur aliqui digiti, tunc restaura eos, et aequa ipsos secundum quod narraui tibi in restauratione digitorum manus.	 If some fingers are fractured, then restore them and align them according to what I told you in the restoration of fingers of the hand.
Deinde pone digito tuo astellam secundum longitudinem digiti, et sit latior eo parumper: deinde pone sub Pede hanc tabulam quam narraui tibi, et stringe eam strictura decenti.	 Then place a star under the finger according to its length, and make it slightly wider; then place this board that I told you about under the foot and bind it with a suitable binding.
Si uero quod frangitur ex ossibus est duo, aut tria, aut plus, tunc pone super omnem digitum astellam suae quantitatis, inuolutam in panno lini: et stringe tabulam in inferiori Pedis: et sit stans super unum capitum tabulae extra uentrem Pedis, ut teneat retentione bona.	 If what breaks from the bones is two or three or more, then place a star of its size on each finger, rolled up in linen; and bind the board at the bottom of the foot; and let the standing board be above one head of the foot to hold it well by retention.
Et conuenit tibi, ut non obliuiscaris, quin consideres omnia quae dixi tibi in reliquis fracturis ex accidentibus quae diximus: et oppone omni accidenti cum eo quod oportet.	 It is suitable for you to remember that you should consider all the things I said to you regarding other fractures due to accidents, and apply it to every accident as necessary.
¶ De fractura Vuluae mulieris, et ossis pectinis, et uirgae uiri.	 On female facial fracture, clavicle fracture, and the bone of the male thigh.
Caput XIX.	 Chapter XIX.
Quando frangitur Vulua mulieris, tunc fac eam sedere quadratam.	 When a woman's face is fractured, then make her sit upright.
Deinde inclina eam ad partem dorsi ipsius parumper, et teneatur retro.	 Then tilt her head towards the back a little bit, and hold it in that position.
Deinde impleat obstetrix Vuluam eius coto, donec impleat eam: et fiat in Vulua ex eo sicut sphera.	 Then the midwife should fill the woman's wound with linen until it is filled, and her face should become round like a sphere from that.
Deinde concutiatur mulier, et eleua dorsum eius paulatim.	 Then shake the woman gently and press her back gradually.
Illud enim cotum egreditur, donec fiat ante portam Vuluae sicut sphera, et os fractum redit.	 That linen will come out until it becomes before the mouth of the wound like a sphere, and the broken bone recovers.
Deinde pone puluillum super dorsum eius.	 Then place a poultice on her back.
Quando ergo uult mingere, remoueat cotum cum facilitate, deinde mingat: et reduc ipsum secundum modum, quo intromisisti ipsum in primis: deinde redeat ad puluillum suum primum.	 Whenever you want to apply the poultice, remove the linen easily, then apply it; bring it back as you initially inserted it, and then return to the original poultice.
Faciat illud septem diebus, aut circiter, os ipsum enim restauratur.	 Let it be done for seven days or approximately, because the bone recovers itself.
Et si uis, accipe uesicam ouis, et stringe super foramen eius cannulam arundinis, et intromitte uesicam totam in Vuluam eius.	 And if you wish, take the bladder of an egg, and tie a reed tube around its opening, and insert the entire bladder into her wound.
Deinde suffla in cannulam cum uirtute, donec infletur uesica intra Vuluam, fractura enim redit.	 Then blow air into the tube with force until the bladder inflates inside the wound, because the fracture recovers.
Deinde impleatur cum coto, et stet aliquot diebus, secundum quod narrauimus, donec sanetur.	 Then fill it again with linen and let it stay for some days as we said before, until it heals.
Et quando frangitur os Pectinis uiri, aut mulieris, tunc administra in restauratione eius, et ipsius aequatione illud quod narrauimus in osse Anchae.	 When the clavicle of a man or woman is fractured, then apply treatment for its restoration and perform what we described regarding the bone of Anchus.
Et non occultatur rectum in his fracturis propinquis, quae parum contingunt, praecipue cui est quiddam studii, uel usus.	 And it is not concealed (the straight line) in these nearby fractures that are not serious, especially in one who has some study or practice.
Et intellige librum meum istum multum, quoniam fractura ipsa significat tibi in pluribus dispositionibus uiam rectam in restauratione sui, et strictura sui: intellige ergo.	 Understand my book much, for the fracture itself signifies to you in many dispositions a straight way in its restoration and constriction: understand therefore.
In Virga autem uiri quando frangitur, accipe guttur anseris: et intromitte uirgam in ipso.	 In the man's member when it breaks, take the goose's gullet; and insert the rod into it.
Deinde pone super ipsum inuolutionem ex panno, et inuoluatur, et dimittatur tribus diebus, aut circiter eos, et sanabitur, si Deus uoluerit.	 Then place upon him a cover made of cloth, and wrap it around, and let it be for three days, or about those, and it will heal if God wills.
¶ De restauratione fracturae ossium, quando est cum uulnere.	 [Chapter] On the restoration of a bone fracture when it is with a wound.
Caput XX.	 Chapter XX.
Conuenit ei cui accidit fractura cum uulnere, praecipue si est magnum, sicut os coxae, aut adiutorii, aut simile illi, ut properes, et phlebotomes ipsum statim: si attestantur tibi conditiones phlebotomiae, sicut praemisimus.	 It is suitable for him who has a fracture with a wound, especially if it is large, such as the thigh bone or arm bone, or similar to it, that you hasten, and have the blood-letting done immediately; if the conditions of blood-letting are attested to you, as we have previously stated.
Quod si uulnus effluit sanguinem, tunc oportet, ut properes ad abscisionem eius, ita ut puluerizes super ipsum zegi tritum: si non est tibi praesens aliud.	 If the wound discharges blood, then it is necessary that you hasten to the incision of it, so that you powder over it some sieved vinegar; if there is no other present for you.
Deinde incipe restaurare fracturam in illo eodem die: et non postponas illud, si non accidit apostema.	 Then begin to restore the fracture on that same day: and do not delay it, unless an abscess occurs.
Si uero accidit apostema calidum, tunc dimitte restaurationem eius usque ad diem nonum, donec sedetur apostema.	 If however an abscess hot occurs, then let the restoration of it wait until the ninth day, until the abscess settles down.
Et non appropinques ei in die tertio, et quarto omnino, nam tu faceres ei accidere accidentia mala.	 And do not approach him on the third and fourth day at all, for you would cause harm to come upon him.
Si autem os fractum est eminens super cutem detectum: tunc oportet, ut coneris reducere ipsum, et aequare ipsum manibus tuis cum facilitate et extensione parua.	 If the broken bone projects above the skin and is detected, then it is necessary that you compress it back and level it with your hands with ease and slight extension.
Si autem non praeparatur extensio eius, et ipsius aequatio manibus tuis: tunc reduc ipsum cum isto instrumento.	 If however the extension is not prepared, and its equality with your hands: then reduce it with this instrument.
Et est instrumentum quod fit ex ferro, cuius longitudo est quantitas septem digitorum, aut octo: et eius latitudo est secundum quantitatem uulneris.	 And the instrument is made of iron, whose length is seven or eight fingers' breadth, and its width according to the size of the wound.
Et propter illud necesse est medico, ut accipiat ex eis tria, aut quatuor secundum quantitatem qua indiget ad illud ex curatione in omni specie fracturae.	 And therefore it is necessary for the physician to take from them three or four according to the quantity that is needed for that cure in every type of fracture.
Et sit rotundum: et sit in eo grossitudo parua, ut non duplicetur apud compressionem super ipsum in hora operationis: et sit acutae extremitatis, cui sit margo in extremitatibus suis.	 And it should be round and have a small thickness so as not to multiply on the fracture during the hour of surgery, and it should have sharp edges with a margin at its extremities.
Et sit superius eius ad grossitudinem ex medietate eius usque ad inferiora.	 And let the upper part of it be thick from the middle downwards.
Et haec est forma eius.	 And this is its shape.
Oportet in Hac Operatione, ut ponatur extremitas eius acuta curuata super extremitatem ossis eminentis: et impelle ipsum cum eo uice una, donec quando redit os et aequatur quadam aequatione.	 It is necessary in this operation that its sharp edge should be bent over the projecting bone's extremity and push it with it once until the bone returns and becomes equal to some measure.
Conare ergo aequare extremitates fracturae adinuicem.	 Therefore strive to match the fracture's extremities against each other.
Quod si extremitates eius fracta est subtilis, et non accipit eam instrumentum accaeptione bona, tunc opotet, ut incidas extremitatem illius ossis, donec instrumentum potestatem habeat eius.	 If the fracture's extremity is subtle and the instrument does not receive it well, then it is necessary to cut the bone's extremity until the instrument has control over it.
Si uero non potes reducere eos cum eo quod narrauimus omnino, tunc incide ipsum cum eo quod conuenit ei ex Incisoriis quae diximus: aut serra ipsum cum una serrarum quocunque modo possibile est tibi.	 But if you cannot reduce them with it as we said entirely, then cut the bone with one of the saws that we mentioned, or cut through with a chisel in any way possible for you.
Deinde rade illud quod remanet in osse ex asperitate et corticibus minutis.	 Then smooth what remains on the bone due to roughness and small cortices.
Cum ergo reducitur os, et inuenit infirmus post reductionem eius dolorem uehementem laedentem, tunc scias, quod os non rediit ad locum suum naturalem.	 When the bone is reduced and an unusually strong pain is found after its reduction, then you will know that the bone has not returned to its natural place.
Fac ergo illud.	 Make that.
Nam tu confers infirmo iuuamentum magnum, cum completur restauratio tua quam facis ossi.	 For you give great help to the weak one when you complete the restoration you make of the bone.
Tunc submerge pannum in uino stiptico, nigro.	Then dip cloth in strong wine, black.
Et proprie si est in aestate.	 And it should properly be in summer.
Et non ponas super uulnus caerotum, neque aliquid in quo sit oleum: ut non faciat accidere in ipso putredinem et corruptionem.	 And do not place upon the wound any lead or anything containing oil; lest it cause rot and corruption at the wound site.
Deinde administra astellas in hora complementi tui a restauratione ossis.	 Then administer the stars in the hour of completion of your bone restoration.
Et dimitte uulnus detectum: ita, ut incidas cum forficibus foramen in inuolutionibus secundum quantitatem uulneris.	 And leave the wound exposed: so that you cut with forceps a hole in the layers according to the size of the wound.
Et caue omni cautela, ne stringas uulnus cum fractura.	 And be careful not to stitch the wound along with the fracture.
Multotiens enim fecerunt istud stolidi medici: et fecerunt accidere super infirmos suos aut mortem, aut corrosionem, aut zuchem, id est, saniem.	 For often have foolish doctors done this; and it has caused death, or rot, or gangrene, that is, pus, upon their patients.
Et sit strictura tua mollis, lenis, diuersa stricturae fracturarum reliquarum.	 And let your suture be soft, gentle, diverse from the sutures of other fractures.
Quod si uulnus est malum, aut est uulnus magnum, et times super ipsum quaedam accidentia mala quae narrauimus, et inuenis dolorem in loco suspensum: tunc non oportet, ut ponas super ipsum astellas.	 If the wound is bad, or the wound is large, and you fear some unfavorable occurrences that we have mentioned, and you find pain at the site: then it is not necessary to place stars upon it.
Et fac eis inuolutiones ex pannis duris in loco astellarum, et stringe ipsum cum eis.	 And make layers with stiff cloths in place of the stars and stitch it with them.
Cum autem est post diem unum, aut dies duos, et uides uulnus iam incipere, ut in eo generetur pus: tunc aufer desuper ipsum pannum quem posuisti super ipsum cum uino.	 But if it is a day or two later, and you see the wound beginning to generate pus: then remove from above it the cloth that you placed upon it with the wine.
Deinde administra licinia, et unguenta cum quibus de consuetudine nostra est, ut medicemur uulnera: sicut unguentum tetrapharmacon, et similia illi.	 Then administer linen and unguents with which we are accustomed to treat wounds; such as the tetrapharmacon ointment and similar ones.
Et conuenit tibi, ut soluas ligamentum.	 And it is suitable for you to loosen the binding.
Et considera uulnus in omni die mane et uespere, donec consolidetur, et sanetur.	 And examine the wound every day at morning and evening until it becomes consolidated and healed.
Et oportet, ut praeparetur membrum taliter, ut currat ex eo pus ad inferiora cum facilitate.	 It is necessary that the limb be prepared so that pus runs out of it easily towards the lower parts.
Quod si praetereunt uulneri dies multi, et non consolidatur, neque abscinditur pus ab eo: tunc scias, quod illic sunt satagie ossis parua.	 If days pass over the wound and it does not heal nor discharges pus from it: then you know that there are small fractures of bones there.
Quare oportet, ut inquiras uulnus cum tenta.	 You should examine the wound with a probe.
Quot uero ex illis alsatagie sunt separata, remoue ea, et extrahe ipsa.	 Count how many of those fractures are separated, remove them and extract them.
Et quae ex eis sunt non separata, et pungunt membrum, et faciunt accidere dolorem, conare incidere ea, et auferre ea omni modo quo possibile est tibi illud.	 And those which are not separated, and pierce the limb, and cause pain, try to cut them and remove them in every possible way for you.
Quod si accidat uulneri zuchen, aut ekileten, id est, estiomenus, aut species alia corruptionis et putrefactionis: tunc oportet, ut opponas unicuique ex eis cum eo quod conuenit ei ex curatione, cuius praecessit narratio in capitulo suo.	 If it happens that the wound becomes blighted, or ulcerated, i.e., it becomes gangrenous, or of another kind of corruption and putrefaction: then you should apply to each of them what is suitable for it according to the treatment that has been narrated in its own chapter.
Et ex eo in quo oportet ut stet sermo meus, et cui facias praesentem mentem tuam quando frangitur os, et eminet super membrum, sicut os coxae, et adiutorii, et similia eis ex membris magnis, est, ut non praesumas attractionem eius, multotiens enim accidit ex illo mors, imo dimitte ipsum, donec putrefiat.	 And from that which my speech should remain firm and the thought you should have when a bone breaks and protrudes above the limb, such as the hipbone or the arm, and similar ones from large members, it is that you should not presume to draw it, for often death happens from this; on the contrary, leave it alone until it putrefies.
Fortasse enim cadet per se post uiginti dies, aut triginta.	 Perhaps it will fall out by itself after twenty or thirty days.
Tunc ergo cura uulnus, si uidetur tibi: et sinon, dimitte ipsum.	 Then take care of the wound if it seems to you; otherwise, leave it alone.
¶ De curatione Nodationis in uestigio fracturae.	 Chapter on the treatment of a swelling at the site of a broken bone.
Caput XXI.	 Chapter XXI.
Multoties accidit haec Nodatio in uestigio sanationis fracturae.	 This swelling often occurs at the site of healing of a broken bone.
Praecipue, quae est prope iuncturas: et foedatur ex ea figura membri.	 Mostly, it is near joints; and becomes corrupt in its shape from it.
Et fortasse prohibet membrum ab operatione sua naturali.	 And perhaps it prevents the limb from operating naturally.
Considera ergo tunc, si nodatio est recens: administra in ea medicinas quae stipticitatem habent, sicut aloe, et olibanum, et myrrha, et sarcocolla, et acacia, et similia eis.	 Therefore consider if the swelling is recent; administer to it medications that have astringency, such as aloes, olibanum, myrrh, resin of turpentine, acacia, and similar ones.
Ita, ut accipias ex istis quasdam, aut omnes eas: et confice eas cum uino stiptico, aut cum albumine oui, aut cum aceto: et pone eas super nodationem in stuppa, et stringe eas super ipsam strictura bona.	 Take some or all of these [items], and sew them up with sticky wine, or with egg white, or with vinegar; and place them on the swelling in a linen cloth, and tightly bind them there with a good binding.
Et dimitte stricturam, nec soluas eam diebus multis.	 And release the binding, do not loosen it for many days.
Deinde solue eam, et itera aliam, donec remoueatur nodatio.	 Then loosen it, and apply another one until the swelling is removed.
Aut stringe super ipsam laminam plumbi decenter.	 Or bind it over the lead plate properly.
Plumbo enim est proprietas remouendi omne quod timetur ex membris.	 For lead has the property of removing all that is feared from limbs.
Si autem nodatio iam in lapidem conuersa est, et stricta est, et festine prouocat necessitas ad auferendum eam: tunc finde super eam ex superiori parte eius, et incide superfluitatem eminentem: aut rade eam cum quibusdam rasoriis, donec remoueatur: et cura ipsam, donec sanetur.	 If the swelling has already turned into a stone and is bound and urgently requires removal: then seal over it from above and cut off any projecting excess; or file it with certain rasps until it is removed; and take care of it until it heals.
¶ De curatione quando restauratur, et remanet membrum post illud subtile, non secundum naturam suam.	 Chapter on the treatment of a limb that remains tender after healing.
Caput XXII.	 Chapter XXII.
Quando restauratur fractura ossis, et remanet membrum post illud subtile, debile: tunc non fit illud nisi propter caussas multas.	 When a bone fracture heals and the limb remains tender and weak, this is not done except for many reasons.
Quarum una est, multitudo solutionis ligamenti et ligationis eius non secundum quod oportet: aut propter superfluitatem stricturae ligamentorum, donec prohibeatur nutrimentum currere ad membrum: aut propter multitudinem embrocationis superfluae in non sua hora: aut propter paucitatem sanguinis in corpore infirmi, et debilitatem eius.	 One of the reasons is an abundance of loosening and binding of the ligament that is not as required; or because of the excessive tightness of the ligaments, preventing nutrients from reaching the limb; or because of an excess of embrocation at an incorrect time; or because of a scarcity of blood in the body of the weak person and its debilitation.
Et curatio illius est, cibare infirmum, et tenerum facere corpus eius, donec multiplicetur sanguis in eo.	 And the treatment for this is to feed the weak person, and make his body soft until blood multiplies in him.
Et administra balneum.	 And administer a bath.
Et intromitte gaudium et laeticiam super eum.	 And introduce joy and happiness over him.
Deinde pone picem super membrum: ut attrahat pix ad ipsum nutrimentum multum.	 Then place pitch on the limb, so that the pitch attracts nourishment in large amounts.
Et assiduet embrocationem eius cum aqua tepida, donec currat nutrimentum, et redeat ad figuram suam naturalem.	 And continuously apply embrocation to it with warm water until the nourishment returns, and it regains its natural shape.
¶ De curatione ossium fractorum quando restaurantur tortuose.	 On the treatment of fractured bones when they are restored crookedly.
Caput XXIII.	 Chapter XXIII.
Quando accidit membro iam restaurato post sanationem eius tortuositas, et eminentia ossi fracto, aut nodatio: et foedatur per illud forma membri, uerumtamen membrum non prohibetur ab operatione sua naturali: tunc non oportet ut recipias sermonem eius, qui existimat, ut frangatur membrum denuo.	 When, after the healing of a limb that has been restored, crookedness or protrusion of the fractured bone, or nodosity occurs and the limb becomes deformed due to it, nevertheless, the function of the limb is not prohibited; then it is not appropriate to listen to the opinion of one who suggests breaking the limb again.
Et iam fuerunt multi stolidorum medicorum et restauratorum, qui fecerunt illud in terra nostra.	 And there have been many foolish doctors and restorers who have done this in our land.
Et haec quidem operatio est uituperabilis ualde, perducens ad mortem, uel timorem magnum, ut scilicet sit mortalis.	 This operation is highly blameworthy, leading to death or great fear that it might be fatal.
Verum si claudicatio et nodatio sunt recentes: tunc oportet, ut embrocetur cum aqua tepida, in qua decoctae sint herbae mollificantes, sicut folia alteae, et radix eius, et mellilotum, et illis similia.	 If the limp and nodosity are recent: then it is necessary to bathe it with warm water in which softening herbs such as althea leaves, its root, melilotus, and similar ones have been boiled.
Et fiat ei emplastrum cum emplastro mollificatiuo, sicut dyachilon decenter factum.	 And prepare an ointment for it with a softening plaster such as well-made diachylon.
Aut sumatur mucilago radicis alteae, et concutiatur cum adipe gallinae, aut oleo sisamino: et emplastretur cum eo.	 Or take the mucilage of the althea root and grind it with chicken fat or sesame oil; and apply an ointment with it.
Aut sumantur ficus pingues, et terantur cum fimo columbino, et similibus eis quae nominantur ex medicinis diminuentes consolidationem.	 Or take figs that are fatty, pound them with dove excrement and similar ones that are called medicine reducing consolidation.
Et quandoque soluitur nodatio cum fricatione assidua, antiqua, et leni, quae fit cum manibus humidis.	 And sometimes the nodosity is dissolved by persistent, gentle, old-fashioned friction, which is done with wet hands.
Et administretur motus membri ad omnem partem in horis omnibus.	 And the movement of the limb should be applied to every part daily.
Si autem tortuositas iam antecessit, et fortis facta est, et conuersa est in lapidem, et prouocata est necessitas ad curatonem eius cum ferro: tunc oportet, ut secetur superius eius, et soluatur continuatio ossis, et incidatur quod superfluit ex nodatione aut osse cum Incisoriis subtilibus: et administretur facilitas in illo cum sollicitudine et studio.	 If crookedness has already occurred beforehand, and it has become strong and turned into a stone, and the necessity of treating it with iron has arisen: then it is necessary to saw above it, to separate the continuity of the bone, and cut off what protrudes from nodosity or bone with finely sharp tools; and apply ease to it with diligence and care.
¶ De sermone in Dislocatione.	 On Speech in Dislocation.
Caput XXIIII.	 Chapter XXIV.
Dislocatio est exitus alicuius iuncturarum a loco suo.	 Dislocation is the displacement of some joints from their place.
Quare prohibetur a motu suo, et foedatur figura membri.	 Why it should be forbidden from moving and mutilated in appearance of the member.
Et facit accidere super infirmum dolores, et laesiones uehementes.	 And causes the occurrence of pains on the weak and severe injuries.
Quando ergo accidit alicui dislocatio, tunc oportet festinare ad restaurationem eius: neque tardet eam omnino.	 When dislocation occurs to someone, then it is necessary to hurry for its restoration; it should not be delayed at all.
Nam si tardatur, apostematur locus, et fortasse cum eo reductio dislocationis.	 For if it is delayed, the location becomes putrid, and perhaps with it the reduction of dislocation.
Propter illud ergo non oportet, ut moueatur, neque extendatur in hora apostemationis eius.	 Therefore, it should not be moved nor extended at the hour of its putrefaction.
Quoniam multotiens facit accidere spasmum, et dolores laedentes.	 Because it often causes a spasm and painful injuries.
Verum quando accidit illud, tunc oportet, ut properes ad phlebotomiam infirmi.	 However, when this happens, then it is necessary to hurry to the bloodletting of the sick person.
Deinde dimittatur, donec quiescat apostema.	 Then it is let go until the putrefaction ceases.
Deinde embrocetur membrum cum aqua calida et oleo.	 Then anoint the member with warm water and oil.
Deinde reducatur cum facilitate.	 Then reduce it gently.
Et curetur omne membrum cum eo cuius rememoratio ueniet in loco suo.	 And treat every member along with it when its memory comes back to its place.
Ego quidem iam ordinaui capitula dislocationis, etiam secundum quod praecessit in fractura, a superiori parte corporis usque ad inferiorem eius.	 I myself have already arranged the chapters on dislocation, even according to what preceded in fracture, from the upper part of the body down to the lower part of it.
¶ De cura dislocationis Mandibulae inferioris.	 Chapter on the care of dislocated lower jaw.
Caput XXV.	 Chapter XXV.
Parum dislocantur duae Mandibulae nisi raro.	 The two jaws are rarely dislocated to a lesser extent.
Et dislocatio ambarum fit secundum unum duoru modorum.	 The dislocation of both [occurs] according to one of two modes.
Aut enim remouentur a locis suis remotione parua, et mollificantur parumper.	 Moreover, they are moved away from their places by slight removal and made somewhat soft.
Aut dislocantur dislocatione integra, completa, donec mollificentur ad partem pectoris, donec currat saliua infirmi, et non possit tenere eam, neque possit claudere os suum, et inuoluatur lingua eius cum sermone.	 Moreover, they are dislocated entirely and completely until they become soft to the chest part, until the saliva of the sick runs, and it cannot hold it or close its mouth, and its tongue is wrapped with speech.
Quando autem dislocatio eius est parua, tunc redit in pluribus dispositionibus per se cum paucitate.	 But when the dislocation is slight, then it returns by itself in various ways with a lack of abundance.
Si uero est dislocatio completa, integra: tunc oportet, ut administretur reductio eius uelociter, et non tardetur penitus: et est, ut teneat minister caput infirmi: et intromittat medicus pollicem manus suae unius in radicem Mandibulae dislocationis inter os eius, si dislocatio est a parte una.	 But if the dislocation is complete and whole: then it is necessary that its reduction is administered quickly, and it should not be delayed deeply; and there is [the need] for the minister to hold the head of the sick one; and the physician should introduce his thumb of one hand into the root of the Mandible dislocation if the dislocation is from one part.
Aut intromittat duos pollices suos simul, si dislocatio est a duabus partibus.	 Or he should insert two thumbs at once, if the dislocation is from both parts.
Et reliqui digiti manuum eius sint extra, quibus aequet.	 And the remaining fingers of his hands should be outside, as required.
Et praecipe infirmo, ut mundificet Mandibulas suas, et absoluat eas ad manducandum ad omnem partem.	 And command the sick one to clean his Mandibles and purify them for eating in every respect.
Et medicus aequet Mandibulam, et impellat Mandibulam, donec redeat ad locum suum.	 The physician should press and push the Mandible until it returns to its place.
Quod si difficilis sit reductio eius, praecipue si sunt ambae Mandibulae simul: tunc administra uaporationem cum aqua calida, et oleo, donec fiat facilis reductio ambarum: neque tardes reductionem ambarum omnino, sicut diximus.	 If the reduction of it is difficult, especially if both Mandibles are at the same time: then administer steam with hot water and oil until the reduction of both becomes easy; do not delay the reduction of both entirely, as we have said.
Cum ergo redeunt et aequantur, et clauditur os infirmi, et non mollificantur: tunc pone super eas puluillos pannorum, cum ceroto quod sit factum ex cera: et oleo rosato.	 When they return and meet and the mouth of the sick one is closed, and they are not made soft: then place on them cotton wool pads, with a preparation made from beeswax; and with rose oil.
Deinde ligetur cum facilitate cum ligamentis mollibus.	 Then it should be tied easily with soft cords.
Et sit somnus infirmi super dorsum suum: et caput eius sit stans inter duo puluinaria, ut non moueat ipsum ad dextram et sinistram: neque conetur, uel cogatur masticare aliquid: imo ponatur cibus eius sorbitio lenis, donec quando remouentur dolores, et nodatur Mandibula: tunc comedat quod uult, et administretur illud cum facilitate.	And let the sleep of the sick one be upon his back: and his head should stand between two pillows, so as not to move it to the right and left: neither let him try or be forced to chew something: rather, let his food be made soft, until when the pains are removed, and the jaw is tied: then let him eat whatever he wants, and let that be given to him with ease.
Non laboret super operationem oris sui apud comestionem et potum, et oscitationem, donec nodetur Mandibula, et sanetur.	 He should not labor on the operation of his mouth while eating and drinking, and speaking, until the jaw is tied, and it heals.
Quod si difficilis fiat reductio duarum Mandibuiarum, quando dislocantur in hora aliqua, et non conuertuntur ad loca sua: tunc multotiens accidunt inde febres, et soda assidua: et fortasse soluitur uenter infirmi, et fortasse uomit choleram puram.	 If the reduction of both jaws becomes difficult when they dislocate at some hour and do not return to their places: then often fever occurs, and there is constant soda: and perhaps the stomach of the sick one breaks open, and he vomits pure bile.
Cum ergo uides illud: tunc scias, quia est perditio, et multotiens moritur ille cui accidit illud in decem diebus.	 Therefore when you see that: then know that it is a loss, and the one to whom that happens often dies within ten days.
¶ De reducione dislocationis Furculae, et extremitatis humeri.	 Section on the reduction of dislocation of the jaw and the end of the arm.
Caput XXVI.	 Chapter 26.
Furcula quidem non dislocatur ex latere intrinseco, propter continuationem suam cum pectore.	 The collarbone is not dislocated from inside outward due to its continuity with the chest.
Et dislocatur quandoque ad exteriora: et declaratur illud sensui.	 It becomes dislocated sometimes outside, and this is perceived by feeling.
Et restauratio eius est, ut iaceat infirmus super dorsum suum, et extendat brachia sua.	 And the restoration of it is that the sick one lies on his back, and extends his arms.
Deinde coarta locum cum palma tua coartatione forti, nam ipsa redibit.	 Then, with your bent hand, press the dislocated joint, because it will return.
Deinde pone super ipsam emplastrum, et puluillos, et stringe eam.	 Then place an ointment on it, and pack it with cotton, and bind it.
Extremitates uero eius quae sequuntur cubitum, et continuantur cum eo, non dislocantur, nisi raro.	 However, the extremities that follow the elbow, which are continuous with it, do not become dislocated unless rarely.
Quod si dislocatur die aliquo: tunc oportet, ut reducatur et aequetur secundum quod diximus, et quod praeparatur tibi.	 If it becomes dislocated on any day: then it must be reduced and set according to what has been said, and what you have prepared for yourself.
Deinde pone super ipsam emplastrum, et puluillos, et stricturam.	 Then place upon it [the wound] the plaster, and the leeches, and the ligature.
Et praecipe infirmo, adhaerere tranquillitati et quieti, donec sanetur.	 And instruct the sick man to adhere to tranquility and rest until he is healed.
Et cum hac eadem curatione reducitur extremitas Humeri, quando separatur etiam a loco suo.	 When this same cure brings the edge of the arm back to its place, it should also be separated from its place.
¶ De reductione dislocationis Humeri.	 Chapter on the reduction of dislocation of the arm.
Caput XXVII.	 Chapter 27.
Scias, quod Humerus non dislocatur, nisi secundum tres modos.	 Know that the humerus is not dislocated, unless in three ways.
Quorum unus est, ut dislocetur ad partem titillici ad inferiora.	 One of them is, it dislocates to the part of the pectoral at the lower side.
Secundus est, ut dislocetur ad partem pectoris.	 The second is, it dislocates to the chest part.
Et fortasse dislocatur ad superiorem partem Humeri: et illud fit raro.	 And perhaps it dislocates to the upper part of the humerus: and that happens rarely.
Et non dislocatur ad posteriora, propter spatulam.	 Nor is it dislocated at the backside, because of the spade [splint].
Et non dislocatur ad anteriora, propter neruos.	 Nor is it dislocated to the front side, because of the nerves.
Et plurimum quidem dislocatur et egreditur ad inferiora uersus titillicum: praecipue in illis, quorum carnes sunt paucae.	 Indeed, it is most often dislocated and comes out to the lower side turned towards the pectoral: especially in those whose flesh is scanty.
Quoniam egrediur in eis uelociter, et ingreditur uelociter.	 Because it goes out quickly in them and enters quickly.
In illis autem quorum carnes sunt multae, est econtrario illius, scilicet quia egreditur cum difficultate, et ingreditur cum difficultate.	 But in those whose flesh is abundant, the reverse holds true: namely, because it goes out with difficulty and enters with difficulty.
Et fortasse accidit quibusdam hominibus percussio, aut casus, et apostematur Humerus apostemate calido, et putatur propter illud, quia iam dislocatus est.	 And perhaps some people experience a blow or an accident and the humerus is dislocated by a hot application, and it is thought to be so because it has already been dislocated.
Oportet ergo, ut experiaris illud, donec stes super certitudinem eius, et tunc procedas in curatione eius.	 Therefore, one must experiment with that until you are certain of its nature, and then proceed in treating it.
Et cognoscitur dislocatio, quando est ad inferiora uersus titillicum: et distinguas inter Humerum dislocatum, et humerum sanum.	 And the dislocation is known when it is to the lower side turned towards the pectoral, and you shall distinguish between a dislocated humerus and a healthy humerus.
Nam tu inuenis inter eos diuersitatem manifestam, et inuenis in capite Humeri concauitatem, et sub titillico apud tactum caput humeri quasi ipsum sit ouum: et non potest infirmus reducere manum ad aurem suam, neque mouere eam omnibus motibus.	 For you will find among them an evident difference, and in the head of the humerus there is a hollow, and beneath the pectoral at the touch of the head of the humerus as if it were an egg: and an invalid cannot bring his hand to his ear nor move it with all movements.
Et similiter, si dislocatur uersus pectus, aut ad sursum: tunc inuenis manifestum tactum, neque occultatur.	 And similarly, if it is dislocated towards the chest or upward: then you will find an evident touch, and it cannot be hidden.
Et huius quidem dislocationis fit facilis reductio, quando est recens, aut infirmus est puer.	 And this kind of dislocation has an easy reduction when it is recent or the child is weak.
Et reductio eius est, ut eleuet minister manum suam ad superiora.	 The reduction is that he elevates his hand to above.
Deinde pone tu pollices tuos sub titillico eius, et eleua iuncturam cum fortitudine ad sursum ad locum suum: et minister eleuet manum suam, et extendat eam ad sursum.	 Then place your thumbs beneath his, and with strength lift the joint until it is in its place; then he will elevate his hand, and stretch it upward.
Deinde ponat eam inferius, ipse enim redit uelociter.	 Then put it down, for he quickly returns.
Si autem non redit per illud quod diximus, et sunt a principio quo accidit dislocatio dies multi: tunc oportet, ut balneetur infirmus in aqua calida, et administretur embrocatio quae mollificat et lenit, sicut si decoquantur radices alteae, et foenugraecum, et mellilotum in aqua, et administretur.	 If it does not return as mentioned, and from the beginning when dislocation occurs are many days: then it is necessary that the sick one bathe in warm water, and receive embrocation which softens and soothes, just as if they decoct root of althea, and fenugreek, and melilotus in water, and give it.
Deinde resupinetur infirmus super dorsum suum: et ponatur sub titillico eius sphera et lana, quae sit aequalis inter lenitatem et stricturam.	 Then the sick one lies on his back upon his back; and let a sphere and wool be placed under his thumb which is equal in softness and tightness.
Deinde ponat medicus calcaneum suum super spheram, et eleuet caput humeri cum uirtute, et attrahat manum infirmi ad inferiora.	 Then the doctor places his heel upon the sphere, and lifts the head of the humerus with force, and draws the hand of the sick one to below.
Et minister alius teneat caput infirmi, ut non moueatur ad inferiora: ipse namque redit statim.	 And another person holds the head of the sick one, so that it is not moved downward; for he quickly returns immediately.
Et si uis, reduc eum secundum modum hunc: et est, ut facias esse praesentem uirum qui sit longior infirmo, et stet a parte lateris, et intromittat humerum suum sub titillico infirmi: et eleuet titillicum eius ad superiora, donec sit infirmus suspensus in aere.	 And if you wish, reduce him according to this method; and it is that you make the man present who is taller than the sick one, and stands on his side, and introduces his humerus under the thumb of the sick one: and lifts the thumb of the sick one to above, until the sick one is suspended in the air.
Et minister alius trahat manum infirmi ad inferiora uentris eius.	 And another person pulls the hand of the sick one to below his stomach.
Si autem infirmus est leuis: tunc oportet, ut suspendatur cum eo aliquid aliud, ut grauet ipsum: nam redit dislocatio statim.	 If the sick one is light: then it is necessary that he be suspended with something else, in order to weigh him down; for the dislocation quickly returns.
Et reducitur etiam secundum modum alium: et est, ut figatur in terra lignum longum, cuius caput sit rotundum figura: sicut manica mortarii: quod non sit grossum, neque subtile.	 And it is also reduced according to another method; and it is that a long wooden rod is fashioned on the ground, whose head is rounded in form: like a mitten of a hammer-maker; which is neither too heavy nor too thin.
Deinde ponatur sub infirmo postquam ponuntur super caput ligni panni lenes: et infirmus sit stans secundum longitudinem ligni.	 Then place it under the patient when logs of soft cloth are placed on his head, and let the patient stand according to the length of the logs.
Deinde extendatur manus eius ad inferiora a parte altera, et extendatur corpus eius ab altera parte cum fortitudine: nam iunctura redit ad locum suum cum uelocitate.	 Then extend his hands towards the lower part from the other side, and extend his body from the other side with force, for the joint will return to its place quickly.
Quod si difficilis sit eius reductio per omnia quae diximus, tunc utere hac cura: et est, ut accipias lignum cuius longitudo sit quantitas duorum brachiorum, et eius latitudo quantitas quatuor digitorum, et grossitudo eius quantitas duorum digitorum: cui sit caput rotundum, ut alleuietur introitus eius in profundum titillici, secundum hanc formam.	 If the reduction (restoration) is difficult by all that has been said, then use this care: and it is to take a log whose length is the size of two forearms and its width four fingers, and its thickness two fingers, with rounded head to widen its entrance into the depth for pressing, according to this shape.
Deinde ligentur super caput rotundum panni lenes, ut non laedat lignum infirmum.	 Then wrap around his head with soft cloth logs, so as not to injure the log supporting the patient.
Deinde ponatur sub titillico infirmi, ut extendatur manus, aut brachium super lignum usque ad inferiora: et ligetur lignum super adiutorium et brachium et extremitatem manus.	 Then place it under the support of the patient, so that his hand or arm may be extended over the log to below, and tie the log above the arm and hand and lower limb.
Deinde ponatur brachium super gradum scalae per latitudinem, et extendatur manus ad inferiora, et dimittatur reliquum corpus suspensum a parte altera.	 Then place the arm on a step of the ladder widthwise, and extend the hand to below, and let the rest of the body hang suspended from the other side.
Iunctura enim ingreditur statim.	 For the joint enters immediately.
Cum ergo completur introitus eius secundum quemcunque modum possibile est: tunc oportet, ut ponas sub titillico spheram aequalis quantitatis ex lana.	 Since the entrance is filled to the greatest extent possible, then it is necessary that you place under the support a sphere made of wool equal in size to it.
Deinde pone emplastrum praeparatum ex puluere molendini cum olibano, et albumine oui super humerum totum, sicut reuoluitur desuper.	 Then place a prepared plaster made from milled flour with balm and egg white on the entire shoulder as it is rolled on top of it.
Deinde stringe sub titillico strictura decenti: et reuoluatur ligamentum super emplastrum desuper: et annectatur manus eius ad collum ipsius, et dimittatur, neque moueatur manus eius septem diebus.	 Then tie a suitable suture below the support and roll the bandage over the plaster above it, connect the patient's hand to his neck and do not move his hand for seven days.
Et oportet, ut ponatur cibus infirmipaucus, donec confortetur membrum: quoniam est uelocius ad sanationem eius.	 It is necessary that a scanty food be placed (for the patient) until the limb recovers its strength, since it heals more quickly in this way.
Deinde ponatur amplior post septem dies, aut quinque, et ex ercitetur cum motu.	 Then it should be placed larger after seven days, or five, and it should be opened with motion.
Si ergo firmatur et non mollificatur, tunc iam sanatus est.	 If therefore it is firm and does not become soft, then it is healed.
Si uero iunctura dislocatur multotiens, propter humiditatem quae accidit ei, aut propter caussam aliam: tunc oportet, ut administretur in ea cauterium cum tribus foraminibus, secundum quod praemissum est in capitulo de cauterio.	 If however the union is dislocated many times on account of the moisture that occurs to it or on account of some other cause: then it is necessary that a cautery be administered in it with three holes, according to what has been said in the chapter on cautery.
Quod si fiat hoc totum, et soluatur ligamentum post septem dies, et non confirmetur iunctura, et reducatur emplastrum et strictura super ipsum aliquotiens, et non firmetur, et cadat, et non possit eleuare ipsum ad superiora: tunc scias, quod nerui eius qui sunt ad caput humeri, iam incisi sunt, aut extensi, aut mollificati: et scias, quod iunctura nunquam figetur in loco suo.	 If this is done entirely, and the ligament is loosened after seven days, and the union does not become firm, and a plaster and pressure are applied to it several times, and it does not become firm and falls, and cannot be raised upwards: then you know that the nerves which are to the head of the humerus have been cut or extended or softened: and you know that the union will never fuse in its place.
Dislocationis autem quae fit uersus pectus et mammillam, aut ad posteriora reductio, fit cum impulsione et extensione cum manibus: donec redeat, et administretur in ea reliqua strictura et cura, donec sanetur.	 Dislocation that happens towards the chest and breast, or to the back reduction, is made with pressure and extension with hands until it returns, and a remaining pressure and care are administered until it heals.
Quod si accidat post sanationem grauitas in membro, et tarditas in motu eius, tunc utatur infirmus balneo multotiens, donec leniatur illa grauitas, et redeat ad naturam eius primam.	 If after healing there is heaviness in the member and slowness of its motion, then the sick person should use baths many times until that heaviness is relieved, and it returns to its first nature.
¶ De curatione dislocationis Cubiti.	 Chapter on the treatment of shoulder dislocation.
Caput XXVIII.	 Chapter 28.
Scias, quod iunctura Cubiti dislocatur cum difficultate, et similiter redit cum difficultate etiam: et ipsa quidem dislocatur ad omnes partes, et praecipue ad anteriorem, aut ad posteriorem.	 You know that the union of the shoulder dislocates with difficulty and similarly returns with difficulty; and it is indeed dislocated to all parts, but especially in front or behind.
Et eius dislocatio non occultatur tibi: quoniam est cadens sub uisu, et sub tactu, secundum quamcunque figuram dislocetur.	 And the dislocation of the shoulder is not hidden from you; because it falls under sight and touch, according to whatever form it is dislocated.
Et quando coniungis cubitum dislocatum cum sano, declaratur tibi illud manifeste.	 And when you join a dislocated shoulder with the healthy one, that is clearly shown to you.
Concauatur enim iunctura, et non potest duplicare brachium, neque tangere cum eo humerum suum.	 The joint must be closed, and it cannot be doubled over the arm nor touch its own shoulder.
Et oportet, ut properes, et reducas dislocationem statim, antequam accidat ei apostema calidum.	 You should rush and immediately reduce a dislocation before it gets an abscess.
Nam si accidit ei apostema calidum, difficilis fit eius reductio: et fortasse non sanatur omnino, praecipue quando est ad posteriora.	 For if an abscess occurs, the reduction becomes difficult; and it may not heal at all, especially when it is towards the back.
Est enim deterior omnibus speciebus dislocationis, et uehementioris doloris eis: et multotiens descendit cum ea mors.	 Indeed, every kind of dislocation is worse and more painful; and death often accompanies it.
Et restauratio eius quando est ex eis quae possibile est reducere, est, ut extendatur manus eius cum duabus manibus: et brachium eius sit expansum, et manus medici sint supra cubitum et sub eo, et ipse impellat iuncturam cum pollicibus manuum suarum simul, aut cum radice palmae suae, donec redeat ad locum suum.	 And its restoration, when it can be reduced, is to extend the hand with two hands; and the arm should be extended, and the hands of the physician are above and below the elbow, and he himself pushes the joint with his thumbs or the root of his palm until it returns to its place.
Aut uero dislocatio est ad anteriora: tunc redit ita, ut duplicet manum cum manu sua, donec percutiat cum radice palmae suae cubitum qui est dislocatus.	 Or the dislocation is towards the front: then it is reduced in such a way that the hand doubles over with its own hand until it strikes the elbow which is dislocated with the root of its palm.
Quod si non obedit dislocatio ad reductionem, tunc administra extensionem uehementem, fortem ualde: et est, ut extendant brachium duo ministri: et teneant ipsum duo ministri etiam, ut non remoueatur apud extensionem.	 If the dislocation does not obey reduction, then administer a violent extension, very strong; and it is to be done that two attendants stretch the arm; and they are to hold it so that it is not moved during the extension.
Deinde reuoluatur brachium ad omnem partem postquam inuoluitur super manum eius pannus duplicatus longus, aut ligamentum latum.	 Then the arm is rotated to all parts after it has been wrapped around the hand with a double cloth or wide bandage.
Et quando tangit medicus manu sua iuncturam, inungat ipsam cum oleo: ut sit illud ex eis quae adiuuant in lubricitate iuncturae cum facilitate.	 And when the physician touches the joint with his hand, he binds it with oil; so that it is one of those things which help in the lubricity of the joint with ease.
Deinde impellat iuncturam impulsione uehementi, donec redeat.	 Then he pushes the joint forcefully until it returns.
Et post reductionem eius oportet, ut ponatur super ipsam emplastrum, in quo sit stipticitas, et exiccatio cum albugine oui: et stringatur strictura decenti.	 After its reduction, it is necessary to place an ointment on it, which contains styptic and purifying properties with egg white; and it is to be bandaged tightly.
Et suspendatur brachium a collo infirmi: et dimitte diebus aliquot.	 And let the arm of the sick person be suspended from the neck for some days.
Deinde soluatur.	 Then it is loosened.
Si ergo firmatur iunctura in loco suo, tunc solue ligamentum ab ea, et dimitte ipsam.	 If the joint becomes fixed in its place, then loosen the bandage from it and let it be.
Et si uides iuncturam non bene stringi, tunc itera emplastrum, et ligamentum, et dimitte ipsam diebus aliquot, donec stringatur.	 And if you see that the joint is not well closed, then apply the plaster again, and bandage it and let it be for some days until it is closed.
Deinde solue ipsam.	 Then loosen it.
Si autem accidit ei grauitas post reductionem iuncturae, et dispositio sit in motu: tunc administra humectationem in balneatione, et fricationem subtilem, et compressionem, donec liniatur, aut pone super iuncturam iliati, id est, natem arietis pinguem.	 If, however, there is pain after the reduction of the joint and it has movement: then administer humectation in a bath, fine friction, and compression until it is lined up, or place upon the joint, that is, the fat of the ram's woolen cloth.
Deinde ligetur, et dimitte ipsam super eam die et nocte.	 Then let it be bound and kept for a day and a night over it.
Deinde aufer eam, et intromitte ipsum in balneum.	 Then remove it, and immerse it in the bath.
Cum ergo sudat, tunc frica iuncturam fricatione temperata.	 And when it sweats, then friction the joint with a moderate friction.
Deinde itera super ipsam aleliati uice una, et secunda, et tertia cum introitu balnei, donec leniatur.	 Then apply to it three times with warm poultices when entering the bath until it is softened.
Et si uis, pone super ipsam stercus uaccinum, humidum, calefactum cum butyro, et stringe super ipsum.	 And if you wish, place upon it dried dung, warm, mixed with butter, and bind over it.
Fac illud aliquotiens.	 Make this often.
Ipsa namque lenitur, et redit ad dispositionem suam.	 It becomes softened, and returns to its former condition.
¶ De curatione dislocationis Almahassem.	 Chapter on the treatment of dislocations by Albucasis.
Caput XXIX.	 Chapter XXIX.
Mahassem manus multotiens dislocatur, id est, iunctura quae est inter brachium et manum.	 The hand of Almahassem is frequently dislocated, that is, the joint which is between the arm and the hand.
Et reductio dislocationis eius est facilis.	 And the reduction of this dislocation is easy.
Econtrario reliquarum iuncturarum.	 On the contrary, the other joints are more difficult to reduce.
Verumtamen oportet, ut uelocitas sit in reductione dislocationis eius in hora in qua dislocatur, antequam apostemetur locus: aut accidat in eo apostema calidum.	 However, speed must be taken in the reduction of this dislocation within the hour in which it is dislocated, before the place is loosened: or a hot abscess occurs at the site.
Et reductio dislocationis in eo est, ut ponas Mahassem manus infirmae super tabulam, et extendat minister manum eius: et ponat medicus palmam suam super eminentiam iuncturae, et impellat eam, donec redeat.	 Reduction of dislocation is to place Mahassem's weak hand on a table, and let the attendant extend it; and the physician shall place his palm on the prominent joint, and push until it returns.
Verumtamen oportet, ut consyderetur, si palma iam recessit ad uentrem manus: tunc ponat infirmus dorsum manus suae super tabulam apud extensionem et reductionem: et si dislocatio est procedens ad dorsum manus, tunc sit positio manus eius intrinsece super tabulam, id est, interior pars manus eius super tabulam ponatur, ut cadat manus medici super ipsam eminentiam iuncturae.	 Furthermore, it is to be considered if the palm has already retreated into the body of the hand: then let the weak place his back of the hand on a table for extension and reduction; and if the dislocation is proceeding towards the back of the hand, then let the position of the hand be placed intrinsically on the table, that is, the inner part of the hand should be placed on the table, so that the physician may fall upon the prominent joint.
Si ergo redit statim, bonum est: et si non, tunc stringe eam cum emplastro sedante apostema: et dimitte ipsum, neque iteres illud.	 If it returns immediately, that is good; and if not, then bind it with a plaster sitting on the abscess; and leave it alone, do not repeat that.
Nam si non tolerat, neque potes super reductionem eius, postquam praetereunt ei dies, uerumtamen iunctura remanet secundum tortuositatem suam: et non nocet infirmo aliquid, nisi quod mollificatur manus, et non potest stringere aliquid: tunc scias, quod nerui sunt abscissi, aut attriti.	 For if it cannot bear (the pressure), nor can you perform reduction of it afterwards when the days pass, but the joint remains according to its twist; and nothing harms the weak unless what is softened for the hand, and nothing can be bound; then know that the nerves have been cut or rubbed.
Non est ergo ingenium in ea, nisi ut stringatur cum cauterio prope casum eius.	 Therefore, there is no skill in it except to bind with a cautery near to its destruction.
Et fortasse non confert illud aliquid.	 And perhaps it does not bring anything about.
Cum ergo non redit Almahassem, tunc pone super ipsum emplastrum, quod narrauimus.	 When Almahassem does not return, then place an ointment on him as we have said.
Deinde stringatur, et dimittatur quinque diebus: postea soluatur et dimittatur, et exercitetur manus.	 Then bind it, and let it be for five days; afterwards it is to be loosened and let go, and exercise the hand.
Si autem priuatur motus eius, et accidat in ea aliquid grauitatis: tunc leni eam cum aqua calefacta, et fricatione aliquotiens, donec leniatur.	 If its movement is taken away, and something heavy happens in it: then soften it with warm water, and rub it gently many times until it is softened.
¶ De curatione dislocationis Digitorum.	 Chapter on the cure of finger dislocations.
Caput XXX.	 Chapter XXX.
Quando dislocatur ex eis Digitus ad omnem partem, uel ex eis Digitus ad dorsum palmae, aut uentrem eius: tunc extende Digitum, et impelle dislocationem pollicibus tuis, donec redeat.	 Chapter XXX: When a finger is dislocated from any part, or from the back of the palm to its body, or the inside of it: then extend the finger and push the dislocation with your thumbs until it returns.
Deinde sustenta caput Digiti, et suspende ipsum uersus partem ad quam dislocatur, et dimitte ipsum duobus diebus.	 Then support the head of the digit, and suspend it towards the side where it is dislocated, and leave it for two days.
Deinde suspende eum, et extende ipsum, donec aequetur rectus in illo die suo.	 Then extend it until it aligns with its proper position on that day.
Cum ergo fuerit nox, liga ipsum secundum narrationem ipsam: et non cesses soluere ipsum in die: et exerce eum cum motu: et liga ipsum in nocte.	 When it is night, tie it according to the story given: and do not cease to loosen it during the day: and exercise it with movement: and tie it at night.
Fac illud diebus aliquot, donec stringatur.	 Do this for several days until it tightens.
Et similiter fac cum eo, si dislocatur ad uentrem manus: et liga eum ad partem ipsam, et fac cum eo operationem tuam primam, donec sanetur.	 And do the same with it if it is dislocated towards the palm of the hand: and tie it to that side, and perform your first operation on it until it heals.
Et similiter fac cum eo quando dislocatur ad reliquas partes.	 And do the same with it when it is dislocated towards other parts.
¶ De curatione dislocationis Spondilium dorsi.	 Chapter on the treatment of dislocation of the spondylus of the back.
Caput XXXI.	 Chapter XXXI.
Quando accidit alicui Spondilium dorsi, aut colli dislocatio completa, aut remouentur Spondiles multae a locis suis: tunc non est in ea curatio, quoniam mors properat infirmo.	 When a person experiences dislocation of the spine, either complete of the neck, or multiple spondyles are displaced from their places: then there is no cure in it, since death approaches the weak.
Et signum illius est, quod egestio infirmi egreditur absque uoluntate, neque potest tenere eam: et multotiens mollificantur ex eo quaedam membra eius, aut duo crura eius, aut duo brachia ipsius, aut unum eorum: aut remouetur Spondilis una de loco suo.	 And the sign of this is that the hunger of the weak escapes without will, and he cannot hold it; and many times some members of his are softened, or both legs of him, or both arms of himself, or one of them; or a spondyle is displaced from its place.
Multotiens enim remouetur, quod multotiens fit remotio earum ad quatuor partes.	 For many times it is displaced, which is often done to four parts.
Illa ergo quae remouetur ad posteriora, nominatur Gibbositas.	 That which is displaced towards the rear is called a humpback.
Curatio uero eius est, ut consyderes tunc, si Gibbositas accidit a puericia: tunc non est in ea curatio, neque ex ea est sanatio omnino.	 The cure for it is to consider whether the humpback occurs from childhood; then there is no cure in it, and there is no healing at all from it.
In illa autem quae accidit a casu, aut percussione, aut similibus illis, iam dixerunt antiqui modos curationis sermone prolixo.	 But in that which occurs from an accident, or blow, or similar things, the ancients have already said the methods of treatment in a lengthy speech.
Cuius plurimum non redit cum proficuo.	 Of this, more often than not it does not return with recovery.
Ego uero iam abbreuiaui ex illo, cuius parum excusat a multo eius ex propinquitate mea ad intentionem: et expositione mea qua exposui illud, et formaui instrumentum eius diuerso modo ab eo quo ostenderunt illud, et exposuerunt ipsum.	 I myself have already abbreviated from that which is rarely justified by a large part due to my proximity to the subject: and in my explanation, I explained that, and shaped its instrument in a different way from how they showed it and explained it.
Dico ergo, quod in gibbositate quae accidit ab anteriori parte, non est ingenium, neque sanatio ex ea.	 Therefore, I say that in humpback which occurs from the front part, there is no talent, nor healing from it.
Et similiter in illa quae fit ad duo latera etiam.	 And similarly in that which occurs to both sides.
Et non curatur ex eis, nisi illa quae accidit in dorso proprie, cum eo quod ego narro: et est, ut extendatur infirmus super faciem suam super podium aequale prope parietem: et expandatur sub eo stramentum humidum, ut non laedatur pectus eius.	 And it is not cured from them, unless that which occurs in the back properly, with what I speak: and it is to extend the weak over his face on an equal plank nearly up to the wall; and expand under him a wet cloth, so as not to harm his chest.
Deinde ponatur lignum rectum fixum in fouea in terra, in extremitate podii, circiter caput eius: et lignum aliud circiter pedes eius in extremitate altera podii: et minister teneat lignum, et sit non firmatum in fouea.	 Then place a straight stick fixed in the bowl on the ground, at the end of the foot, about its head: and another stick about its feet at the other end of the foot: and let a servant hold the stick, and it shall not be fixed in the bowl.
Et minister alter teneat alterum.	 And let another servant hold the other one.
Deinde inuolue super caput infirmi, et sub titillicis eius ligamentum lene, firmum: et extende extremitatem ligamenti ad lignum quod est apud caput eius: et liga ipsum in eo.	 Then bend over the head of the patient, and under his chin tie a firm bandage, and extend the end of the bandage to the stick that is at his head, and tie it there.
Deinde stringe ligamentum aliud supra anchas eius, et supra genua ipsius, et apud cauillas eius.	 Then bind another bandage above the ankles of the patient, and at the joints of his knees.
Deinde aggrega ligamenta omnia, et liga ea in ligno altero quod est apud pedes eius.	 Then gather all the bandages together, and tie them to the other stick that is at his feet.
Deinde extendat omnis minister ad partem ligni ligamentum, et non remoueantur duo ligna ex locis suis in quibus sunt fixa: uerumtamen non sint firmata, sicut diximus.	 Then let all the servants extend their bandages to the part of the stick, and neither of the sticks should be moved from its place where it is fixed: but they shall not be fastened, as we have said.
Et medicus ponat palmas suas super Spondilem cum fortitudine, donec redeat: aut ponat super eam tabulam.	 And the doctor shall put his hands on the hip-bone with force, until he returns: or place a board over it.
Deinde annectat super tabulam pedes suos, donec redeat.	 Then he attaches his feet to the board until he returns.
Si autem non redit per hanc curationem, tunc accipe tabulam cuius longitudo sit circiter tria brachia.	 If he does not return through this treatment, then receive a board whose length is about three arms.
Et caua in pariete de quo diximus quod est prope infirmum, locum in quem ingrediatur extremitas tabulae.	 And carve a hole in the wall that we mentioned which is near the patient, into which the end of the board may enter.
Deinde pone medium tabulae super Spondilem.	 Then place the middle of the board on the hip-bone.
Et ponat pedes suos medicus super extremitatem alteram.	 And let the doctor place his feet on the other end.
Et stringat bene, donec coartetur Spondilis, et redeat ad locum suum.	 And bind tightly, until the hip-bone is dislocated, and he returns to his place.
Deinde si uis, operare cum torno quod inuoluitur cum manu tua: et est, ut figas in terram apud caput infirmi in postremo podii duo ligna, quorum longitudo sit brachii unius: et apud caput eius in postremo podii duo ligna.	 Then, if you wish, operate with a lathe that turns by hand: and it is so that you may carve two sticks in the ground at the head of the patient's last foot, whose length is that of an arm: and at his head at the last foot two sticks.
Et sit longitudo quae est inter omne lignum palmus unus: et iam factum est in omni loco foramen, in quo currit tornum: et firmetur lignum omne in terra multum, ne moueatur omnino.	 And let the length be that which is between every stick and a palm [width]: and now a hole has been made in every place where a tourniquet runs: and let all the sticks be fixed strongly to the ground so that they do not move at all.
Et intromittatur lignum rotundum: et est tornum in quo reuoluitur ligamentum in duobus foraminibus duorum lignorum.	 And insert a round stick: and there is a tourniquet in which a cord is turned in the holes of two sticks.
Et in extremitate eius est foramen, in quo firmatur lignum, cuius longitudo est palmus cum eo quod reuoluitur: et in duobus lignis aliis est similiter illius.	 And at the end of it there is a hole where the stick is fixed, whose length is a palm plus what is turned: and similarly in two other sticks.
Deinde stringe ligamenta quae strinxisti in pectore infirmi torno quod est apud caput eius: et ligamenta quae strinxisti in cruribus eius in torno quod est apud pedes eius.	 Then bind the cords which you have bound around the chest of the sick man at the tourniquet that is near his head: and bind the cords which you have bound around his legs at the tourniquet that is near his feet.
Deinde stet apud omne tornum minister, qui torqueat manum suam cum licinio, cum quo reuoluitur tornum: et medicus aequet Spondilem, secundum quod diximus.	 Then stand by every tourniquet the servant who turns his hand with a cloth, with which the tourniquet is turned: and the physician measures the pulse, as we have said.
Haec est forma torni, quae sequitur.	 This is the form of the tourniquet that follows.
Deinde postquam redit Spondilis, et aequatur locus, tunc oportet, ut ponas emplastrum exiccatiuum cum albumine oui.	 Then when the pulse has been measured and the place is ready, then it is necessary to put on a plaster made from excrement and egg white.
Deinde stuppam.	 Then apply [a substance called] stuppa.
Postea pone supra emplastrum astellam ex tabula, cuius latitudo sit trium digitorum, aut circiter eos.	 Then put on top of the plaster a star-shaped piece from wood, whose width is that of three fingers, or about those [dimensions].
Et longitudo eius quantitas quae capiat locum Gibbositatis, et super partem Spondilis sanae.	 And its length shall be the quantity that covers the depression and the healthy part of the pulse.
Deinde ligetur cum ligamento quod diximus.	 Then bind it with the cord we have mentioned.
Et utatur infirmus nutrimento subtili, donec sanetur.	 And the sick man shall use nourishment that is subtle until he is well.
Quod si remaneat quiddam eminentiae in loco in fine sanationis: tunc oportet, ut administrentur medicinae quae mollificant, et leniunt, cum administratione tabulae quam narrauimus tempore longo.	 If there remains something raised in the place at the end of healing: then it is necessary to administer medicines that soften and soothe, with the use of the tablet we have mentioned for a long time.
Et iam administratur in illo lamina plumbi.	 And now, it is administered on that plate of lead.
Et quandoque accidit eminentia in postremo Spondilium dorsi: et putatur per eam dislocatio, et est illud os quod iam eminet.	 Occasionally, a protrusion happens in the last vertebra of the back; it is thought to be a dislocation, and that bone which has become prominent is involved.
Quare non oportet, ut praesumptio fiat ei cum hac medicina: fortasse enim accidere faciet mortem.	 Therefore, it is not proper to presume this medicine for him; perhaps it will cause death.
¶ De curatione Anchae dislocatae.	 Chapter on the treatment of a dislocated ankle.
Caput XXXII.	 Chapter 32.
Scias, quod iuncturae Anchae, et iuncturae humeri, non accidit, nisi dislocatio tantum: neque accidit eis quod accidit reliquis iuncturis ex remotione parua, et concauitate.	 Know that the union of the ankle and shoulder joint does not occur except in a dislocation; nor does it happen to them what happens to other joints from a slight displacement and hollowing out.
Et iunctura quidem Anchae dislocatur secundum quatuor partes.	 Indeed, the ankle joint is dislocated according to four parts.
Quod est, quia dislocatur ad anteriora, et ad posteriora.	 Because it is dislocated toward the front and toward the back.
Et plurimum quidem dislocatur ad interiora: et parum dislocatur ad anteriora, et ad posteriora.	 It is indeed dislocated most of all to the inside; it is dislocated less frequently to the front and to the back.
Et curatio dislocationis eius ad interiora, est: quia quando tu coniungis crus infirmi sanum cum infirmo, est longius: et est genu eius eminens plus quam sani, et non potest infirmus duplicare pedem suum apud inguen: et est locus qui sequitur inguen apostematus apostemate calido, propterea, quod caput coxae iam peruenit illic.	 The treatment of a dislocation to the inside is as follows: because when you join the limb of a sick person with a healthy one, it is longer; and the knee joint of the sick person is more prominent than that of a healthy one, and the sick person cannot double his foot near the knee; and there is a place following the knee which is hollowed out by a hollow instrument, because the head of the hip has already reached that place.
Et signum eius cui accidit dislocatio ad exteriora est, quod sunt accidentia eius contraria istis accidentibus.	 The sign of one who has a dislocation to the outside is that his symptoms are opposite these symptoms.
Et signum eius cui accidit dislocatio ad anteriora, est, quia expandit crus sanum secundum complementum: uerumtamen non duplicat ipsum absque dolore qui est in genu: et si conatur ad ambulandum, non potest super illud ad anteriora: et retinetur urina eius, et apostematur inguen eius, et apud ambulationem est calcatio eius super calcaneum.	 The sign of one who has a dislocation to the front is that he spreads out the healthy leg to its full extent; however, he cannot double it without pain in the knee, and if he attempts to walk, he cannot step forward on it; and urine retention occurs in him, his knee becomes hollowed out, and during walking there is a striking of his foot on the heel.
Et signum eius cui accidit dislocatio ad posteriora est, ut non expandat genu, neque possit duplicare ipsum antequam duplicet inguen: et est crus eius etiam breuius altero: et inguen est mollificatum, et est caput coxae apud locum ilii.	 The sign of the one who experiences dislocation at the posterior [region] is that it does not extend the knee, nor can he double it before doubling the thigh; and his leg is also shortened on the other side; and the thigh is softened, and it has the head of the hip in that place.
Reductio uero huius dislocationis specierum est, ut consyderes tunc, si dislocatio est uetusta, quae iam antiquatur cum habente ipsam.	 The reduction [of this dislocation] is of the following forms: consider then, if the dislocation is old and has already degenerated with it.
Deinde si tu administres reductionem eius, et remanet secundum dispositionem suam: tunc non est in ea curatio omnino.	 Then if you administer the reduction of it, and it remains according to its position; then there is no treatment at all in it.
Non ergo oportet, ut praesumptio fiat ei penitus.	 Therefore, one should not make a rash assumption about it [the condition].
In illo autem cuius dislocatio est recens, et est ex una specierum quatuor dislocationis: tunc propera ad hoc, ut uoluas iuncturam, et extendas ipsam ad interiora et ad exteriora, et moueas eam dextra et sinistra: fortasse enim redit, et non indiget alia cura.	 In the one whose dislocation is recent, and belongs to one of the four forms of dislocations: then go ahead and apply pressure on it, extend it towards the inside and outside, and move it right and left; perhaps it will return, and no other care is needed.
Si autem non redit hoc modo, tunc oportet, ut praepares ministrum fortem, et extendat crus eius ab inferiori parte: aut cum manibus suis, aut cum ligamento, quod ligetur super crus eius supra genu: et minister alius extendat manum eius desuper, ita ut intromittat manus suas sub titillicis eius.	 If it does not return in this way, then a strong attendant should prepare and extend the leg from below: either with his hands or with a rope that ties above the knee; and another assistant should extend his hand above, so that he may insert his hands under the armpits of the patient.
Deinde stringat cum ligamento leni super radicem coxae, et teneat extremitatem ligamenti alterius.	 Then tie a soft rope around the root of the hip and hold the end of another rope.
Et sit extensio eius aut ab anteriori parte inguinis ad partem furculae, aut a posteriori ad partem dorsi.	 And the extension [of the leg] should be from the front of the thigh to the neck of the collarbone, or from the back to the backbone.
Et sit extensio eorum omnium uice una, donec eleuetur infirmus cum corpore suo a terra, et remaneat pendens.	 And the extension [of all] should be one and the same until the sick man with his body is raised from the ground and remains hanging.
Et haec enim species extensionis est species communis specierum quatuor.	 This is indeed a common form of the four forms [of dislocation].
Si ergo redit dislocatio cum eo quod diximus, est bonum: et si non, tunc necesse est omni speciei illud quod dicam de curatione propria.	 If the dislocation returns as we said, it is good; and if not, then it is necessary to follow the specific cure mentioned below.
In reductione quidem eius propria quando dislocatio est ad interiora, oportet, ut resupinetur infirmus super latus suum sanum.	 In the reduction [of a dislocation], when it is toward the inner parts, the sick one must lie on his healthy side.
Deinde ponat ligamentum super radicem coxae, in eo quod est inter caput coxae, et locum qui est sub inguine.	 Then put the bandage over the root of the hip, where it is between the head of the hip and the place that is below the groin.
Deinde extende ligamentum ad sursum a parte inguinis ad altiorem partem corporis, ad partem furculae.	 Then extend the bandage upward from the groin to the higher part of the body, to the neck (region).
Deinde accipiat minister alius fortis brachia eius, et minuat locum grossum coxae infirmae, et extendat ad exteriora extensione uehementi.	 Then another strong man takes hold of his arm and reduces the large place of the weak hip by extending it to the outside with great force.
Iam enim redit ad locum suum.	 Now it is back in its own place.
Et haec species est facilioris reliquis speciebus curationis, qua reducitur hoc membrum.	 And this method is easier than the other methods of treatment, by which this limb is reduced.
Si autem excusatur super te, et non obedit tibi ad introitum cum hac specie curationis omnino: tunc oportet, ut ligentur duo pedes infirmi simul cum ligamento forti, leni, super duos calcaneos, et super duo genua: et sit longitudo cuiusque a compare suo quantitatis quatuor digitorum: et sit crus infirmum extensum plus altero quantitate duorum digitorum.	 If, however, it is dislocated above you and does not obey you at all with this method of treatment, then it is necessary that two weak feet be bound together with a strong bandage, loosely, on both heels, and on both knees: and the length of each one should be four fingers' breadths: and the weak leg should be extended by more than two fingers.
Deinde suspendatur infirmus super caput ligni, quod sit in domo: et sit longitudo eius a terra quantitas duorum brachiorum.	 Then the sick one is suspended over the top of a log that is in the house; and its length from the ground should be two forearms' lengths.
Deinde praecipe iuueni forti, ut muniat caput coxae: et suspendatur cum infirmo inuenis alius: et impellat iuuenis alius, muniens coxam cum fortitudine, nam iunctura redit ad locum suum cum uelocitate.	 Then command a strong youth to bind the head of the hip; and suspend another with the sick one: and another youth pushes, while binding the hip with force, because when it is bound together, it returns quickly to its own place.
In reditione autem eius propria, quando est dislocatio ad exteriora, oportet, ut iaceat infirmus super podium, secundum quod narrauimus in habente gibbositatem.	 In the reduction [of a dislocation], when it is toward the outer parts, the sick one must lie on a couch, as we have said in the one with a hump.
Et stringatur ligamentum super crus eius, infirmum proprie, et super pectus eius.	 And bind the bandage over his weak leg and over his chest.
Deinde ponantur duo ligna, unum apud pedes eius, et alterum apud caput ipsius.	 Then two logs are placed, one at his feet and another at his head.
Deinde ponatur lignum additum in medio podii, fixum bene: super quod inuoluti sint panni humidi, ut non laedat infirmum: et sit lignum inter coxas eius, ut non attrahatur ad inferiora apud extensionem.	 Then place a support stick in the middle of the foot, secure it well; upon which let the wet cloths be wrapped, so as not to hurt the weak; and let the stick be between his thighs, so that he is not drawn downwards during extension.
Deinde extendat omnis minister ad partem suam, et medicus aequet reductionem manu sua.	 Then let every attendant go to their place, and the doctor shall adjust the reduction with his hand.
Si ergo obedit ad reuersionem, erit bonum.	 If it obeys in returning, it will be good.
Et si non, pone super ipsam tabulam, et preme ipsam, sicut diximus in gibbositate, aequaliter.	 And if not, place it on the table and press it evenly, as we have said in swelling, likewise.
Verumtamen oportet, ut iaceat infirmus super latus suum sanum.	 However, it is necessary that the weak one lies on the side of the healthy.
Et quando dislocatio est ad anteriora, tunc oportet, ut extendatur crus infirmi uelociter: et est secundum hanc eandem narrationem super podium: et ponat medicus palmam manus suae dextrae super inguen infirmum.	 And when the dislocation is towards the front, then it should be extended quickly; and this is according to the same narrative on the foot; and the doctor shall place the palm of his right hand on the sick person's thigh.
Deinde coartet ipsum cum manu altera, et cum illa coartatione pone ipsum extensum ad inferiora ad partem genu.	 Then bend him with one hand, and with that bending place him extended towards the lower part of the leg.
Et si dislocatio est ad posteriora: tunc non oportet, ut extendatur infirmus ad inferiora, et sit eleuatus super terram: imo oportet, ut sit positus super rem duram, sicut oportet, ut fit etiam si dislocatur ancha eius ad exteriora, secundum illud quod diximus de accubitu eius super duas anchas: et est super faciem eius, et ligamenta extensa: secundum quod diximus nuper.	 If the dislocation is towards the back: then it should not be extended downwards; and the sick one should not be raised up from the ground; instead, he should be placed on a hard surface, as it should also be done if his dislocation is towards the outside, according to what we said about his lying on two sides: and it is on his face and his limbs are extended; according to what we said recently.
Et oportet, ut administretur compressio cum tabula etiam super locum ad quem egreditur iunctura, cum completur reductio secundum quod oportet.	 And it is necessary that compression is administered with a board also on the place from which the joint departs, when the reduction is completed according to what is required.
Et signum reditionis eius non occultatur tibi: et est, ut extendas duo crura infirmi: et quando uides ea aequalia, et infirmus stringit crus suum, et expandit ipsum absque excusatione: tunc scias, quia iam redit membrum, secundum quod oportet: tunc coniunge duas coxas, et pone emplastrum, et stringe cum imemati, id est, rota: ita, ut non moueatur ancha ad aliquam partium: et adhaereat infirmus quieti tribus diebus, aut quatuor.	 And the sign of his reduction is not hidden from you; and it is to extend two legs of the sick one; and when you see them even, and the sick person tightens his leg, and expands himself without any resistance; then you will know that the limb has returned, according to what is required: then join the thighs, and apply a plaster, and tie with gauze, that is, roller; in such a way that the dislocation does not move towards any part; and let the sick one remain quiet for three or four days.
Deinde solue ligamentum, et emplastrum, et compara crus cum altero: tunc si uides ea aequalia in statu, tunc scias, quod dislocatio iam firmata est: absolue ergo infirmum ad ambulandum.	 Then unfasten the ligament, and apply the plaster, and compare the leg with the other: then if you see that they are equal in position, then you will know that the dislocation is already fixed: therefore leave the patient to walk.
Et si uides aliquid mollificationis: tunc redi, et emplastra illud, et stringe illud secundum stricturam tuam primam: et dimitte illud etiam tribus diebus.	 And if you see something softening: then return, and apply the plaster again, and bind it according to your first binding: and let it be for three days.
Deinde solue illud et fac ipsum tardare in ambulatione super utrumque aliquot diebus, donec confortetur bene.	 Then unfasten it and cause it to slow down in walking on both sides, until it recovers well.
¶ De dislocationis Genu.	 Chapter on the Dislocations of the Knee.
Caput XXXIII.	 Chapter XXXIII.
Genu dislocatur secundum tres modos.	 The knee is dislocated in three ways.
Dislocatur ad exteriora, ad interiora, et ad inferiora, scilicet ad posteriora.	 It is dislocated to the outside, to the inside, and to the below (i.e., the back).
Et non dislocatur ad anteriora.	 And it is not dislocated to the front.
Et signum dislocationis eius, est, ut praecipias infirmo, ut applicet crus suum ad coxam suam.	 The sign of this dislocation is that you order the patient to apply his leg to his hip.
Si autem non adhaeret cum coxa: tunc scias, quod Genu est dislocatum.	 But if it does not stick to the hip: then know, that the knee is dislocated.
Et restauratio omnium modorum dislocationis eius est, ut facias sedere infirmum rectum, ita ut iam extendat crus suum si potest super illud, et adhaeret dorsum tuum ad faciem eius: et pone pedem eius inter pedes tuos.	 And the restoration of all the modes of dislocation is that you make the patient sit upright, so that he now extends his leg if possible over it and presses his back against his face; and place his foot between your feet.
Deinde adhaerere fac Genu eius cum palmis tuis, et recta eas inter digitos tuos super Genu eius.	 Then cause the knee to stick to your palms, and keep them straight across the knee.
Deinde applica cum palma tua duo latera Genu eius cum fortitudine.	 Then apply two palms of your hand firmly on both sides of the knee.
Et minister alius extendat pedem eius, donec redeat Genu ad locum suum.	 And let another servant extend his foot, until the knee returns to its place.
Et signum reditionis est, ut adhaereat crus cum coxa in lenitate, non laboriose.	 The sign of return is that the leg sticks to the hip gently, not forcefully.
Deinde emplastra ipsum, et adhaerere fac crus cum coxa.	 Then apply a plaster to it, and cause the leg to stick to the hip.
Deinde liga ea simul cum uitta tribus diebus, aut quatuor.	 Then bind them together with ointment for three or four days.
Deinde solue ea.	 Then dissolve it.
Et non utatur infirmus ambulatione aliquot diebus, donec sanetur.	 And let not the sick person walk for some days until he is cured.
Si autem recusatur tibi reductio eius, tunc administra extensionem fortem cum ligamentis, quorum praecessit narratio in curatione anchae, donec redeat.	 If he refuses to return, then give him a strong extension with ligaments, whose description is found in the treatment of an aneurysm, until he returns.
¶ De curatione dislocationis Calcanei.	 Chapter on the treatment of dislocated heel bone.
Caput XXXIIII.	 Chapter XXXIV.
Calcaneus quandoque remouetur remotione parua, et quandoque dislocatur secundum complementum.	 Calcaneus is sometimes removed by a slight removal, and sometimes it is dislocated according to its extent.
Et dislocatio eius fit, aut ad interiora, aut ad exteriora.	 Dislocation of it happens either towards the internal or external parts.
Et signum dislocationis eius est, quod uides Calcaneum inflatum, procedentem ad partem ad quam dislocatur.	 The sign of its dislocation is that you see the calcaneus swollen, projecting towards the part to which it is dislocated.
Curatio autem remotionis eius, est facilis reditionis: et est, ut extendatur cum facilitate cum manibus, et aequetur, donec redeat.	 But the treatment of its removal is easy return: and it is that it is extended with ease with hands, and adjusted until it returns.
In curatione autem eius quando dislocatur secundum complementum, oportet, ut facias sedere infirmum rectum: et teneat ipsum minister fortis ualde a posteriori parte dorsi eius, in medio ipsius.	 However, in its treatment when it is dislocated according to its extent, one must make the patient sit straight: and a strong assistant should hold him very firmly from the back part of his middle.
Deinde tene tu cum manu tua dextra pedem eius a superiori parte eius, et cum manu tua sinistra ab inferiori parte pedis eius loco cauillae.	 Then hold with your right hand the foot from above its part, and with your left hand from below the foot at the place of the ankle.
Deinde trahe pedem ad tecum manu tua dextra.	 Then pull the foot towards you with your right hand.
Deinde cum sinistra duabus uicibus.	 And with your left hand in two places.
Deinde extende cum sinistra, et impelle pectus pedis cum dextra uersus crus absque labore.	 Then extend it with your left and push the sole of the foot towards you with your right without strain.
Fac illud bis, sicut narrauimus.	 Do that twice as we have said.
Deinde impelle pectus pedis ad crus in uice tertia, et tu trahis cauillam.	 Then push the sole of the foot towards the leg at the third place, and you pull the ankle.
Si ergo redit in uice una, aut in duabus secundum hunc modum, et uides pedem aequatum, est bonum: et si non, tunc itera operationem super ipsum: quoniam ipse redit.	 If therefore it returns at one or two places according to this method and you see the foot aligned, it is good: and if not, then repeat the procedure on him; because he will return.
Si autem prohibetur tibi reductio eius cum eo quod narrauimus: tunc fac iacere infirmum super dorsum suum super terram, et fige paxillum in terra firmatum ualde, ut cadat inter coxas eius: et tu iam inuoluisti super ipsum pannum, ut non laedat infirmum.	 But if the reduction of it with him as we have said is forbidden to you: then make the patient lie on his back on the ground, and fix a peg in the ground firmly so that he falls between his thighs; and now roll a cloth over him so that he does not harm the sick one.
Deinde accipiat minister coxam eius: postea extendat minister alter pedem, aut cum manibus suis, aut cum ligamento quod liget super collum pedis.	 Then receive an assistant his thigh: then another extends the leg, either with hands or with a strap that binds around its neck.
Deinde extendat omnis minister contra extensionem comparis sui: et paxillus sit stans inter duas coxas infirmi retinens eum, ut non attrahatur corpus eius ad inferiora apud extensionem.	 Then let every attendant extend himself opposite to the extension of his own [position]: and let the pillow be standing between the two hips of the sick person, holding him, so that his body is not drawn downwards during the extension.
Deinde aequet medicus dislocationem manibus suis, et minister alter teneat crus sanum ad inferiora.	 Then the physician should dislocate [the bone] with his hands, and another attendant holds the sound leg towards the lower parts.
Nam dislocatio redit cum uelocitate.	 For dislocation is regained quickly.
Quando ergo redit dislocatio, et declaratur tibi sanitas reditionis eius: tunc pone emplastrum et stuppam, et stringe ipsam cum ligamentis firmiter, et liga pedem cum ligamento ad crus.	 When therefore dislocation has returned and the health of its return is shown to you: then put an ointment and a plaster, and sew it firmly with bandages, and bind the foot with a bandage to the leg.
Et oportet, ut caueas uel timeas de neruis, qui sunt supra calcaneum posterius, ut non sit ligamentum super eos uehemens, et laedat eos.	 And it is necessary that you be careful or fearful of the nerves which are above the heel at the back, so that the bandage is not too tight and harms them.
Deinde dimitte ipsum duobus diebus, aut tribus.	 Then let him go for two or three days.
Quod si mollificatur ligamentum, stringe ipsum: deinde solue ipsum in die tertio, aut quarto: et prohibe infirmum ab ambulatione quadraginta diebus.	 If the bandage becomes softened, sew it again: then dissolve it on the third or fourth day: and forbid the sick person from walking for forty days.
Si uero conatur ambulare ante illud spacium, non fit securitas quin dissoluatur super ipsum dislocatio, et corrumpatur, et non recipiat post illud curationem.	 But if he attempts to walk before that time, there will not be safety unless the dislocation is dissolved upon him, and it is spoiled, and it will not receive treatment afterwards.
Quod si accidat ei apostema calidum: tunc oportet, ut administres in sedatione eius illud, in quo praecessit narratio nostra in alio loco ex curatione, et embrocationem, donec remoueatur.	 If it happens to him a hot abscess: then it is necessary that you administer for its sedation what was previously told in another place about the cure, and an embrocation until it is removed.
¶ De dislocatione Digitorum pedis, et cura.	 Chapter on Dislocation of Fingers of the Foot and Cure.
Caput XXXV.	 Chapter XXXV.
Oportet, ut aequetur quod dislocatur ex eis cum extensione pauca absque labore: et illud quidem non est difficile, imo est facile.	 It is necessary that it be equalized what is being dislocated with little extension without effort: and this is not difficult, rather it is easy.
Si autem dislocatio est in quibusdam nodis dorsi pedis: tunc oportet, ut faciat sedere infirmus pedem suum super locum aequalem terrae, aut super tabulam: et est stans sicut ambulans.	 But if the dislocation is in some nodes of the back of the foot: then it is necessary that the sick person sits his foot on an equal place to the ground, or on a table: and he stands thus as walking.
Deinde tu sta, et pone pedem tuum super illud quod eminet ex illis iuncturis.	 Then you stand, and place your foot upon that which projects from those joints.
Deinde calca illud cum pede tuo cum uirtute, donec redeat, et uideas ipsum iam aequatum, et non appareat in loco eminentia.	 Then press it with your foot with force until it returns and you see it has become even, and no projection appears in its place.
Deinde pone sub uentre pedis eius tabulam quae capiat pedem totum, cui sint duo capita.	 Then place under the heel of that foot a board which can hold the entire foot, having two handles.
Deinde stringe ipsum strictura decenti tribus diebus.	 Then bind it with a ligature decent three days.
Deinde solue ipsum, et fac quiescere eum ab ambulatione diebus multis, donec stringatur et securetur a reductione.	 Then unbind it and let him rest from walking for many days until it binds and assures against relapse.
¶ De speciebus dislocationis cum uulnere uel fractura.	 On the types of dislocations with wound or fracture.
Caput XXXVI.	 Chapter XXXVI.
Quando accidit aliquid ex illo, et conaris curationem eius, et ipsius restaurationem, multotiens succedit mors: et propter illud non oportet, ut praesumat super curationem eius, quod est huiusmodi, nisi qui est prudens in arte longi usus, misericors, pius, tardus, non audax, neque praesumptuosus: et ut utatur in incaeptionce medicinis quae sedant apostemata calida tantum: et dimittat infirmum diuino iudicio.	 When something happens to it (the wound or fracture) and you attempt its cure and restoration, often death occurs; and therefore, one should not presume about the cure of such a thing unless he is wise in long practice, merciful, pious, slow, not bold, nor presumptuous; and that he uses for the beginning of treatment only medicines which quiet inflammations hot only; and that he allows the weak to the divine judgment.
Nisi uideas, aut speras salutem a perditione cum lenitate aegritudinis, et in quo apparet quiddam spei.	 Unless you see or hope for recovery from destruction with mildness of illness and where something appears with hope.
Conare ergo reductionem eius statim in principio rei, antequam accidat apostema calidum.	 Therefore, attempt the reduction of it immediately at the beginning of the matter, before a hot abscess occurs.
Si ergo redit membrum, secundum quod uolumus, tunc administra regimen quod sedat apostema: et cura uulnus cum eo quod conuenit ei ex unguentis desiccatiuis.	 If the limb then returns as we desire, then administer a regimen that quiets the abscess; and cure the wound with it which suits it from dry ointments.
Quod si dislocatio est cum fractura, et accidunt in osse satagiae separatae, tunc conare ablationem earum, et fac in illo quod diximus in aegritudinibus simplicibus ex eo quod praecessit in locis earum.	 If the dislocation is with a fracture, and pus-filled sores separate from the bone occur, then attempt their removal; and make in it what was said for simple illnesses in the places of those sores.
Et caue secundum tuam uirtutem, et custodi teipsum ab introitu in uiam timoris: secundum quod praecessit praedicatio mea tibi.	 And take care according to your strength, and guard yourself from the entrance into the way of fear; according to what was previously said to you.
Nam illud est melius tibi apud Creatorem tuum, et magis permanens ad gloriam tuam, et magis saluum tuo corpori apud illos in tuo tempore.	 It is better for you with your Creator, and more lasting for your glory, and more healthy for your body with them at your time.
