This ailment often occurs on the soles of the feet, and it is a rough thing that pains the man. Cauterization for it is done in two ways: either cauterization with fire or cauterization with a potent liquid.	This disease, which is something hard paining the foot, very often occurs in the soles of the feet. The cauterization in this case is twofold, actual or caustic.	0.7327628
Cauterization by fire is done by heating a hollow iron, similar to an eagle's feather, made of iron, the size of which surrounds the nail on all sides, and having a thin edge. Then you place it hot on the nail, then turn your hand with the iron around the nail until the iron reaches the depth of the nail.	The actual cautery is to heat a hollow cautery like a vulture's quill, made of iron, narrow of edge, of such a size as to surround the corn all round.	0.69730014
And you leave it for three days to fester with pus, then you dress it with crushed wild mallow with salt and leave the dressing on it overnight, for it will remove it from its roots. Then you treat the wound site with the flesh-generating ointment until it heals if the nails are not ingrown.	Then put it, hot, on the corn and rotate it till the cautery reaches the root of the corn; and let be for three days to draw the pus; then apply a plaster of wild mallows ground up with salt, and leave the plaster on one night; then it may be drawn out with its root. Then treat the site of the wound with stimulating salve till it heals.	0.8261514
And it often occurs on the surface of the body, especially on the hands and feet. You should take a tube of copper, iron, or eagle's feather, and place it on the nail or wart, then pour a small amount of potent liquid into the tube.	If the corns are not inverted, which usually happens on the surface of the body and particularly on the hands and feet, you should take a cannula made of bronze or iron or made of a vulture's quill, and place it on the corn or wart; then pour into the cannula a small quantity of caustic solution; keep your hand on it and rotate it, keeping up a slight pressure so that the edge of the cannula impresses a mark at the root of the corn and the caustic makes its way to the root of the corn.	0.7595929
And hold your hand while turning it with a slight squeeze of your hand so that the edge of the tube affects the base of the nail, and the potent liquid finds its way to sink to the base of the nail. The patient should endure the sting of the potent liquid for a short time.	Let the patient endure the action of the caustic for a while, then remove it; for the corn may be drawn out with its root.	0.40330422
Then leave it, for the nail will come off by its roots.  This is how you do it one by one until you have removed all of them from the body. Then, after they have been removed, treat their places with ointments that promote flesh growth.	Treat them in this manner one after another till you have accounted for all of them. Then treat the site of them, after eradication, with stimulating ointments.	0.7072913
