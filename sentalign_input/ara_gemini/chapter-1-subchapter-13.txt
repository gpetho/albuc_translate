The thirteenth chapter on cauterizing chronic tears.
If the tears of the eye are chronic and permanent, and they are due to the veins and arteries that are on the surface of the head, from outside the head
and you are certain that this is due to excess cold, thick, phlegmatic humors
then cauterize him with the cautery that I described specifically at the beginning of the falling water
a cauterization in the middle of the head
and two cauterizations on the temples
and two cauterizations on the nape of the neck under the two bones
and if you need to increase it, cauterize him with a cauterization on each side of the corner of the eye at the edge of the eyebrow with a small cautery iron.
