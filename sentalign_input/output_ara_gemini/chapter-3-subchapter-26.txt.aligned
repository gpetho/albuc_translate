Chapter Twenty-Six on Reducing a Dislocated Shoulder	CHAPTER TWENTY-SIX. On the reduction of a dislocation of the humerus.	0.73950875
Know that the shoulder dislocates in three ways, one of which is that it dislocates downwards towards the armpit	You should know that there are three ways in which the humerus may be dislocated.	0.6570398
and the second is that it dislocates towards the chest and sometimes it dislocates upwards above the shoulder, and that is rare	One is a dislocation down into the axilla, another is a dislocation toward the breast; it may also be dislocated upward, which is rare.	0.7395063
and it does not dislocate backwards because of the scapula and it does not dislocate forwards because of the nerves	It is not dislocated backward, because of the scapula; nor is it dislocated forward, on account of the tendons.	0.8000858
And it mostly dislocates and comes out downwards towards the armpit, especially in those who have little flesh, because it comes out quickly and goes in quickly in them	Mostly it is dislocated and displaced down into the axilla, and particularly in those of a spare build; in such it quickly comes out and quickly goes back.	0.7281685
But as for those who have much flesh, it is the opposite of that, I mean that it comes out with difficulty and goes in with difficulty	But in those of a fleshy build it is the opposite; it comes out with difficulty and goes back with difficulty.	0.72106767
And sometimes a person experiences a blow or a fall, and the shoulder swells with a hot swelling, so it is thought that it has dislocated, so it is necessary to examine it until you ascertain its truth, and then proceed with its treatment	Sometimes a man suffers a blow or a fall, so that the upper arm swells up with an effusion, whence he forms the opinion that there is a dislocation. So you must examine it to make sure of it and then proceed to treat it.	0.85374403
The dislocation is recognized, if it is downwards towards the armpit, if you compare the dislocated shoulder with the healthy shoulder, for you will find a clear difference between them, and you will find the head of the shoulder with a curvature, and under the armpit, upon touching, the head of the shoulder is like an egg, and the patient is unable to raise his hand to his ear, nor to move it in all movements	A dislocation down into the axilla may be diagnosed by comparing the sound and the dislocated humerus; for you will find an obvious difference between them; you will find a hollow at the head of the humerus, and in the axilla the head of the humerus may be palpated like an egg, and the patient is unable to lift his hand to his ear, and full movements are restricted.	0.8210466
Likewise, if it dislocates towards the chest or upwards, you will find that obvious to the touch, not hidden	Similarly if it is displaced toward the breast or upward you will find it obvious to the touch and not hidden.	0.90087104
This dislocation may be easy to reduce if it is fresh or if the patient is a child	The reduction of this dislocation will be quite simple if it be only recent or the patient be a child.	0.8583667
Its reduction is that an assistant raises his hand upwards, then you place your two thumbs under his armpit, and lift the joint forcefully upwards to its place, and the assistant raises his hand and extends it upwards, then lowers it downwards, and it will return quickly	To reduce it, his hand should be lifted up by an assistant, then you should put both your thumbs under his axilla and lift the joint up powerfully into its place, while the assistant lifts and stretches his hand upward; then he puts it down and the dislocation will at once go back.	0.8865187
If it does not return by what we have mentioned, and the dislocation has been there for many days, then it is necessary for the patient to bathe in hot water and to use the emollient that softens and relaxes, such as cooking marshmallow root, fenugreek, and melilot in water and using it	If it is not reduced by the means we have stated, being a dislocation of many days' standing, the patient should take a hot bath and use relaxing and softening fomentations, such as decoction of marsh mallow root and fenugreek and melilot.	0.8751619
Then the patient lies on his back, and you place under his armpit a ball of wool that is moderate between soft and firm, then the physician places his heel on the ball, and holds the patient's hand with his hand, and extends it downwards, and pushes the ball with his foot, and it will return to its place	Then the patient should lie on his back and you put under his axilla a ball of wool of moderately hard consistency. Then the doctor should put his heel on the ball and grasp the patient's hand and draw it downward, while pushing the ball with his foot, and it will straightway be reduced.	0.88847303
And if you wish, reduce it in this way, which is that you bring a man taller than the patient and have him stand by the side, and he puts his shoulder under the patient's armpit, and lifts his armpit upwards until the patient is suspended in the air, and another assistant pulls the patient's hand down to his lower abdomen, and if the patient is light, then it is necessary to hang something else on him to weigh him down, and the dislocation will return immediately	Or, if you prefer, reduce it in this way: get a man taller than the patient to stand on one side and pass his shoulder under the patient's axilla and lift it up until the patient is suspended in mid-air, while another assistant pulls the patient's hand down towards his lower abdomen (if the patient is light it will be necessary to hang a weight from him); then the dislocation will straightway be reduced. It is also reduced by another method: that is, to fix in.	0.8869801
It may also be reduced in another way, which is to fix a long piece of wood in the ground, the top of which is round like the bottom of a mortar, neither thick nor thin, then it is placed under the patient's armpit after you place a soft cloth on the top of the wood, and the patient is standing along the wood, then you extend his hand downwards from the other side, and he also extends his body from the other side with force, and the joint will return to its place quickly	It is also reduced by another method: that is, to fix in. the ground a long spar of wood; its head should be of a round shape like the pestle of a mortar, neither massive nor slender; then after a soft pad has been put on the head of the spar it should be placed under the axilla of the patient, who should be standing alongside the spar; then let his hand be drawn downward on one side and his body on the other, powerfully. Then the joint will immediately return to its place.	0.8879782
If its reduction is difficult by all that we have mentioned, then use this treatment, which is to take a piece of wood about two cubits long, four fingers wide, and two fingers thick, with a rounded head to facilitate its entry into the depth of the armpit, in this way:	If it proves difficult to reduce it by any of the means we have stated, employ this treatment: take a wooden spar some two cubits in length, two fingers thick, and four wide; it should have a round head to facilitate its introduction into the hollow of the axilla; of this shape.	0.9003909
Then soft rags are tied on the rounded head so that the wood does not harm the patient.	Then you bind on the round head soft rags so that the wood will not hurt the patient.	0.9447024
Then it is placed under the armpit and the entire hand and arm are extended on the wood downwards, and the wood is tied on the upper arm, forearm, and the edge of the hand.	Then it is placed under the patient's axilla, and his whole hand and arm are stretched down over the spar, which is to be bound down to the upper arm, the forearm, and the tip of the hand.	0.83891106
Then the arm is placed horizontally on the rung of a ladder and the hand is extended downwards, and the rest of the body is left hanging from the other side, for the joint will enter immediately.	Then let the arm be placed cross-wise over the rung of a ladder and the hand stretched downward, and let the rest of the body hang down on the other side; then the joint will very quickly go back.	0.87608945
Once it has entered, by whatever means possible, a moderately sized ball of wool should be placed under the armpit. Then the prepared poultice of mill dust, frankincense, and egg white is carried on the entire shoulder as it rotates from above.	Once it has gone back properly, in whatever way is possible, there should be put under the axilla a ball of wool of moderate size; then apply the plaster prepared from mill-dust with olibanum and egg-white, all round the shoulder.	0.84680104
Then the ball is tightened firmly from under the armpit, and it is rotated with the bandage on the poultice from above, and his hand is hung to his neck, and he is left without moving his hand for seven days.	Then firmly bandage the ball under the axilla and carry the bandaging round over the plaster. Sling his hand from his neck, then let him be left without moving his hand for a week.	0.80069613
And it is necessary that the patient's food be made little until the limb strengthens, for it is faster for his recovery.	The patient's diet should be light until the limb gets strong, for that will hasten the cure.	0.79707134
Then it is loosened after seven or five days, and he is trained in movement, and if it is stable and does not relax, then he has recovered.	After five or seven days it can be unfastened and he can make trial of its movement; if it is firm and not slack then it is healed.	0.8337835
If the joint dislocates frequently due to moisture affecting it or another ailment, then it is necessary to use cauterization with the three needles as mentioned previously in the chapter on cauterization.	If the joint is frequently dislocated, on account of a humidity arising in it or some other cause, then use should be made of the cautery with three prongs spoken of earlier, in the book on cauterizations.	0.8916296
If you have done all of this, and loosened the bandage after seven days and the joint did not stabilize, and you repeated the poultice and tightening on it several times, and it did not stabilize and fell and relaxed, and you were unable to raise it upwards, then know that its nerve in the head of the shoulder has been severed, or stretched, or relaxed. Then know that the joint will never be stable in its place.	If you do all this and loosen the bandaging after a week and the joint is still not firm, and you repeatedly plaster it and bandage it, and it is still loose and comes down and dislocates and you are unable to raise it up, then you may know that the tendons at the head of the humerus are either cut through or stretched or loosened; in which case you may know that the joint will never stay firm in its place.	0.8891891
As for the dislocation that is towards the chest and breast and backwards, its reduction is by pushing and extending with the hands until it returns.	As to the dislocation toward the chest and breast, and posteriorly, the reduction of this is done by thrusting and extension with both hands until it goes back.	0.93066615
And all the tightening and treatment is used on it until it heals.	And apply the usual bandaging and treatment until it is healed.	0.75839597
If after healing there appears a stiffness in the limb and slowness in movement, then let the patient use the bath frequently until that stiffness softens and it returns to its original state.	If, after it has healed, a callosity arises in it, and it is slow in movement, the patient should take frequent hot baths until that callosity is softened and the member returns to its original condition.	0.8105259
