Of the cautery of pleurisy	On cauterization for pleurisy.	0.5986435
The ancients said that for pleurisy, cauteries should be made from the roots of birthwort, and in this manner: Take a long birthwort root, the largest you can find, and let it be dry, and be as thick and as long as your finger; and soak it in oil, and light it on fire, and cauterize one cautery between the armpit and the neck, and two small cauteries a little lower down in the area that is below the chin;	The Ancients mentioned a cauterization for cold pleurisy by means of the roots of the long birthwort, in this fashion: you take the longest you can find of the roots of the long dry birthwort, and of the thickness of one finger; dip this in oil and light it at the fire; then burn the patient with one cauterization in the space between the junction of the neck with the clavicle; and two small cauterizations below the jugular veins, inclining slightly toward the region below the beard.	0.8539635
and two cauteries between the fifth rib and the sixth, sloping downwards a little; and one cautery in the middle of the chest, and another over the stomach, and one between the two shoulders, and two on the two sides of the chest outside the cautery that is between the two shoulders;	And two big cauterizations above the nipples in the space between the third and fourth ribs; and two more between the fifth and sixth ribs, tending slightly toward the back; and another in the middle of the chest; and another above the stomach; and three more behind, namely, one between the scapulae and two on either side of the dorsal spine below the one between the scapulae.	0.8973411
And some ancients said that some men use an iron cautery resembling a razor, and heat it and place it between the ribs, until it reaches that abscess; and the pain jumps out, as we have said regarding the abscess of the liver.	Now one of the Ancients mentioned that there were some people who used an iron cautery shaped like a probe, and introduced it red hot into the intercostal space until it reached the abscess itself and evacuated the pus, as we have mentioned under tumour of the liver.	0.81335366
But in this procedure, there is danger that the patient dies immediately, or a fistula develops that cannot be healed.	But in this perforation with the cautery there is a danger either that the patient may die on the spot or that an incurable fistula may arise at the place.	0.81432545
