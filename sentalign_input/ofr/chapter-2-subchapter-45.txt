of the knots/tumors
There are many kinds of lumps, of which I will describe all the appearances;
and now I must explain all the differences between a lump and an ulcer.
I say that an ulcer involves heat and persistent fever, until the boiling is over, and the suppuration is complete;
then the fever and heat subside.
With a lump there is neither heat nor fever nor pain, and it contains a syfac, which is its own sac and is the same color as the body, and begins like a bean and grows large;
and there are two types, either fatty or moist, and of many colors as I have said in the division.
It is necessary, when you come to treat the lump, that you first examine and probe it with the instrument called "probe", according to the form which will come in the chapter that follows.
And the way to examine the abscesses of the lumps is that you take the most moist place that you find in the abscess, and turn your fingers little by little, until you know that the instrument has pierced the core, provided that it is according to the size of the abscess;
then withdraw the probe, and pay attention to what comes out.
If a thin, flowing moisture comes out, note what color it is, and smell it as I have said of other abscesses;
and if no moisture comes out after the probe, know that it is fatty, then cut it crosswise, and take it with forceps, and peel it gently from each side and watch the skin in which it lies so that you pull it out whole with the lump;
and if you cannot pull it out whole, then pull it out in pieces so that nothing remains.
For if anything remains, the lump will return many times;
and if a little remains, and the blood troubles you, then fill the wound with some sharp corrosive powders, and constrict the wound, and apply soothing things for a hot abscess, and treat it with other treatments until it is healed;
and if the lump is large, then sew the two lips of the wound, and treat it with that which generates flesh.
And if the pulsating vein or other [vessel] hinders you, then hurry and fill the area with crushed vitriol, and leave it there for two or three days, until the wound rots, and the boiling of the blood subsides;
then return to cutting what remains of the lump.
