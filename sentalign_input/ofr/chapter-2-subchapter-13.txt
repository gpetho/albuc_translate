Of the rotting of the eye (or eyelid)
When this illness which is called "alacrati" or the rotting comes in the eye, there are two kinds: one natural, and the other unnatural.
And it occurs suddenly from a wound, or a cut or a cautery, and similar things.
And the way to work on it is that you split this seam/adhesion, and separate the lips/edges of it, and put inside tents of linen, and bind it until it is healed; and you should not use in its treatment things that dry and constrict.
For if you do that, the illness returns worse than the first; but work with softening things, such as fenugreek; and bathe it with water in which althea and linseed are cooked, and ointments of melted diachylon in some oil, and wrap a tent in it, and treat it with that.
And the key to your treatment is that you take care that it does not heal in the same way it was before; and this work that we have described is nothing other than the correction of this illness, that it does not return in the form it was before.
