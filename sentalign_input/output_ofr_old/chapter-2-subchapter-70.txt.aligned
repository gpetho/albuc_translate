of hermaphrodites	On the treatment of the hermaphrodite.	0.4441322
Hermaphroditism occurs in two ways in men: one is that between the two testicles there appears something like the female genitalia, sometimes with hair, and sometimes urine comes out of it. The other way is in women, where they have something like a penis and two testicles above the base. The treatment for both men and women is to cut all the extra flesh and treat it like other wounds. In the second way, in men where urine comes out through the skin of the testicles, there is no treatment.	There are two kinds of male hermaphrodite: one has the appearance as of female pudenda with hair in the region of the perineum; the other has the same in the skin of the scrotum between the testes. Sometimes also urine is excreted through that which is in the skin of the scrotum. There is also one kind among women, in which there is, above the female pudenda, on the pubes, what resembles the male organs.	0.84063876
