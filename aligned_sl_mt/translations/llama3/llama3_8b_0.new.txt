Oh, children, since I have completed this book for you, which is the last of the science of medicine, because it has reached its end through me and my consequences, and through my explanations and declarations, it seems to me that you should complete that which is in this treatise, which is part of my surgery.
Since my surgery is neglected in our region and in our time, completely private, so that the science of it is almost forgotten, and its practice remains hidden; and there remain only a few small descriptions in the books of the Ancients, which are changed to the most part and added to those errors and aberrations, until the intentions of it are closed and its force and art are elongated.
And it seems to me that you should revive that ancient order of this treatise in accordance with the way of exposition and declaration and abbreviation; and so that you may acquire the forms of the instruments of cauterization and other tools of the craft as if by addition to the declaration, and for preparation thereto, which is necessary.
However, the reason why there is not found a good craftsman in our time who has mastery of his hand in this art, is that the art of medicine is long and tedious, and it requires one's actor to be exercised beforehand in the science of anatomy, which Galen recognized, so that he may know the joints of the members and their forms, and the conjunction and separation of them; and have knowledge of the bones, nerves, and ligaments, and their number, and the arrangement of them; and of the pulsating and quiet veins, and the places of their efflux.
And therefore Hippocrates says that a name is not a motive, but rather in small work, and most of all in the art of surgery.
But we have already spoken of that in the introduction to this book; for one who is not skilled in what we have said about anatomy is not fit to be a surgeon, lest he fall into error by which men will die, as I have seen many of those who are thus formed in this science and gain nothing from it, but rather lose their science and experience.
For I saw a foolish and inexperienced doctor who had inserted an abscess of scrophulous humor into the neck of a woman, and he had cut through some arteries of the neck so that a great deal of blood flowed, whereby the woman died between them.
And I saw another doctor who thought he would pull out an abscess from a man's groin which had developed in his state, and the abscess was large, and it came to him and removed that abscess with a piece of the bladder, whereby that man died on the third day.
And I had already called out to him to remove it, and I saw that because of the size of the abscess and the condition of the patient he knew it would kill him.
And I saw another doctor who took a stipend from a duke in our land for surgery, and he proceeded to operate on a blacksmith's son who had a fracture in his thigh; and the doctor, with his ignorance, extracted the bone, placing it above the wound, using pillows and splints with excessive tension, and did not allow the wound to breathe.
And then he released the dressing according to his own desires, and released the splint, and released it for several days, commanding that we remove the bandage; and it happened thus that the thigh and leg became inflamed, and perished.
And I was called to him, and I prepared to remove the bandage, and achieving calmness and easing his pains.
But meanwhile corruption was confirmed in the member, so that I could not restrain it, and it did not cease to corrupt the member until the patient perished.
And I saw another doctor who pierced a cancerous abscess, and made it ulcerate after some days, until the pus magnified the evil of it with its lord.
Which cause is that the cancerous part is pure of melancholic humor, whereas it does not need to be brought to him with all force, but rather should be left as a member which suffers and is completely hostile.
And therefore, children, it is necessary for you that the surgery with me be divided into two divisions: one is in operation which is associated with health, and the other is in work where danger is involved in the greatest circumstances.
And I have already existed here in every place of this book where operation is in the wrong and fear; therefore it is necessary for you to keep this and set aside that, so that foolish ones do not find a way to speak and to deceive you.
And therefore take up your own arms with solicitude and protection of God, and your own patients with felicity and firmness.
And use the best method by the grace of God to achieve health and praiseworthy success, and put aside terrible diseases that are difficult to heal, and keep your own arms away from this which makes you fear, so that you may situate yourself in your faith and in your own name, not being deceived: for it remains to your glory, and even more so in the world and finally to your sanctity.
Galen already said in some of his own writings: "Do not heal bad diseases, lest you be called a bad doctor."
And I have divided this book into three chapters.
The division of the book begins, and the first part of the first chapter. The first chapter, ordered by the head to the feet, in the forms of instruments and in the furnishings of cauterization, and from which it is necessary for the operation.
The division of the second part. The second chapter, on dryness and puncturing, and on sponges, and wounds, and extraction of splinters and similar things, all chaptered and ordered according to the forms of instruments.
The third chapter, on restoration and dislocation, and on curing of fractures and similar things; chapter ordered from head to feet, and according to the forms of instruments.
I should say what quality the joints have of that cauterization and what injuries it inflicts on them, and in what condition cauterization is prohibited.
So I say that the discourse on the quality of the joints in cauterization and its injuries is a long and prolix sermon, subtle by science, and secret and hidden; and already many wise men have spoken about it, and some have disagreed with each other, and for my part, I will only briefly touch on some of their sermons, fearing prolongation.
And so I say that cauterization is suitable for all complete configurations universally, which are in material or its materials, except for two configurations, which are configurations of dry matter.
In the dry and withered configuration of material, it will desiccate; for some would say that cauterization is beneficial to it, while others would say the opposite of it, that cauterization is not suitable in a disease which is caused by quality and dryness, for nature of fire is quality and dryness, and it is inconvenient that a dry and withered configuration with water that is hot and dry should be healed.
And say that the one who says the opposite of it is wrong, that by cauterization it is made healthy in all dry and withered diseases that are found in the bodies of men, for when you compare the human body and its humidity to the configuration of fire, you find the human body cold.
And I say by this sermon that this experiment is already known to me on several occasions to uncover.
But meanwhile it is not necessary that this come to be written again in detail, since it has already been exposed and exercised in the chapter on cauterization for the last exercise, and understood the diversity of human configurations and the disposition of diseases in their own bodies, and the causes of these, and their accidents, and the space of time for these.
But in other configurations, there is no fear on your part, and especially in cold and humid diseases, for all doctors have already agreed on these, and are not in discord about the joint treatment with cauterization in those.
And know, children, that the secret of healing through cauterization with fire and its goodness is that on top of cauterization with medicine, it is combined because fire is simple, the action of which only reaches the member that is being cauterized and does not harm another member that is adjusted to it except for a little damage.
But the action of medicine combined reaches that member which is distant from it, and very quickly brings disease of difficult healing to the sick member, and very quickly increases suffering.
But the fire, by its sublimity and goodness of substance, does not do this except to superfluously. And it is already known to us through experience and the length of service in studying the art about the truth of causes; and therefore I am excused from the length of this sermon. But if it were not for the fact that it is not read well in this pause, I would reveal to you a secret hidden in the fire, and the quality of its operation in the body, and its expulsion by which it expels diseases, with a philosophical demonstrative sermon, which would be sharp in your minds.
And know, children, that they disagree on the time when it is suitable to perform cauterization and pause at the best time of spring.
And I say that cauterization is suitable at any time, because the harm caused by the accident of time is submerged in the joint of what is attracted to cauterization, and even more so if the cauterization is for necessary pains or necessary torments, which do not suffer delay because they are feared of those who come with evil, which is greater than small damage entering through time.
And thus it does not sit in your minds, or, children, this is not esteemed except by the common people and foolish doctors, so that to that disease which is cured by cauterization there is no reduction of time, and pause is taken for the consequence.
And the cause is not thus, as they think by this, because cauterization is only in a place of medicine that alters the configuration and dries out the humors which are the cause why pains come.
But meanwhile, cauterization is excessive above medicine by virtue of its validity and virtue of its operation and greatness of its lord.
And it is possible that his disease may return at some hour of time, according to the configuration of the patient and the location of his disease, and the virtue of him, and what is prepared in his body through the accumulation of superfluidities there, and what is brought to him through acquisition of victuals and similar things to those causes; but if the disease that is administered cauterization is a subtle disease in a member with few superfluidities and humors, just as cauterization of teeth for pain and similar things, it is possible that in him that pain may not return, but rather it will be reduced.
And besides, it is common speech that cauterization is the last resort of medicine, and it is a dubious saying, not in what I understand there, because I believe that there is no cure that profits by medicine or any other cause approaching cauterization.
And the cause is contrary to that; and my understanding is that cauterization is the last resort of medicine only when one administers the methods of cure in some diseases, and those medicines do not concur, and just at the end of the cause one minimizes cauterization, and it profits thereby. And I see now that cauterization is the last resort of medicine, not according to my understanding which understands the common people and many foolish doctors.
And the ancients said that cauterization with gold is better than cauterization with iron, and they did not say this except for the equality of gold and the sublimity of its substance.
And they said that the place of cauterization does not make a difference, as long as it is absolutely true, because I have already shown and proved that it does not do this except in certain bodies, and cauterization with gold is good and better than with iron, just as they say; but meanwhile, when you perform cauterization with fire on aurum, it is not to be declared, because it is unknown according to the quantity you wish for the roughness of the aurum, and since it prepares to receive heat; and if you adjust over it ignition so that the aurum melts by the fire, and a case occurs in the fire where some plates are formed so that the artisan can see through the occupation of that.
And therefore, it is made to perform cauterization with iron in a way that we must be more lightly and more promptly guided towards the correctness of operation.
And I have already organized this chapter on cauterization according to chapters, and I have organized those from head to feet, so that it may be easier for the one asking about it.
The First Chapter.
This cauterization refers to the humidity and coldness that occurs on the surface of the accident, which has two causes: one is caused by soda and the other is caused by a torrential flow of rheumatic fluid, called corissa, from the head to the parts of the eyes and ears, and also due to excessive sleep, toothache, and yawning, and universally all diseases that come through coldness, such as paralysis, sogginess, apoplexy, and similar things in those diseases.
The form of this cauterization is as follows: first, I command the patient to be evacuated with laxative medicine in the morning, for three or four nights, according to what the virtue of the patient and their age and habit demands.
And then I command him to shave his head with a razor, and afterwards make it smooth between the hairs on top of a well-crafted bench, and have him rest his head on the stone floor.
And then pause the razor's edge on your palm above the nose between your eyebrows. But meanwhile, when your mouth says the middle part is reached, mark that place with a tent, and then ignite the olive cauterization of which this is the form:
And then pause that on the marked place with a tent, in a way that it descends, by which your thumb is gradually constricted little by little, and you revolve it.
And then lift your hand lightly and look at the place, and if you see that some quantity of bone has been uncovered on the skull, just as the amount of grain of errors, then raise your hand, and if it does not return to its original position with that iron, but is cooled down, until what I have said to you becomes visible.
And then take a small amount of salt and dissolve it over the place, and let it sit for three days.
And then pause on that spot surrounded by borders and let it stay there until the scar of fire is destroyed. And then cure the place with four-leaf gentian medicine until it is healed.
And they said that the more the wound remains open, the better it gets, so that it is more helpful and beneficial.
And they said that some of theirs should be cauterized with a red-hot iron into the bone, and hold the cauterization until some part of the specificity of the bone is tempered.
And then remove that which has been tempered with the bone, and then cure it.
And others said that with the cauterization, it reaches the end, and then presses on the bone with great force until the bone cracks, and this is the form of little alphetiation. And they think that from that place, the vapors of the head are released.
And the wound is kept open for a long time, and then it is cured until it is consolidated.
But to me it seems that these two species of cauterization are not visible from head to toe, but only in some men according to the way of fear; and leave it alone, I think, better is for health when it is so, because the head is revealed by solution of continuity like we have testified in other members, and even more so when the patient's head is of a fearful nature.
And the first species of cauterization is more saved and better, according to my opinion; and from that house and with that work there is health.
Second Chapter.
On Cauterizing the Head.
When chronic and long-lasting pain occurs throughout the head in a patient, and they are prolonged in their condition, and use ointments, poultices, capes, emplasters, poultices, and similar things, and especially if it has already been cauterized with one cauterization which does not benefit or relieve the patient, then consider whether the head of the patient is prone to strong creation in its nature; and if not fearful and finds a great chill, then that cauterizes another cauterization, leaving a little bit. And then cauterize it on the crown of the patient's head with a cauterizing iron until the skull is divided. Cut the skull and expose the quantity of bone which we have counted, and then cauterize it with a cauterizing iron in the rear part of the head, in the place called "vas", where the wind pipe is located. And then lift your hand away from there, and do not expose the bone, for the patient will experience a great deal of pain that is different from all the other head cauterizations.
And you will say that this cauterization is in its place, for it is necessary to cauterize the crown of the head and the occiput with a more subtle cauterization than that which is used for the middle part of the head; and this is the form of it.
Third Chapter.
On Cauterizing Headaches Not Caused by Ancient Causes.
When headache pain is felt in the crown of the head or spreads to the eye, and evacuation with laxative medicines does not help, then another cure should be administered, which I have mentioned in the divisions of diseases; and if it does not benefit, there are two ways to cauterize: either by using acute medicine combined with a cauterization, or by using iron.
But cauterization with combined medicine is when you take a piece of aloes, scrape it off, and cut off the extremities at both ends. And then make an incision in the spot of the pain on the temple with a well-sharpened lancet until it is made into a small hole, so that it may be hidden.
And then strengthen it with a stopper made of descending constriction, and leave it for the space of three hours; and then remove the plaster and treat the aloes, and let the wound be open for two or three days, and then pause on that spot surrounded by borders until the place becomes firm.
And then cure it with gentian medicine until it is healed.
And if you wish, do this with some combined medicines which I have written about in the two treatises on combined medicines.
But the iron cauterization according to this manner: ignite by cauterization of which this is the form:
and is called "claus clavilhs", because the head of it is shaped like a clove in which there is some curvature, and in the middle part of it is a small elevation.
And then pause on the spot of pain, and hold your hand steady - so that the iron is not scorched where it is left - and slowly revolve the small iron with speed.
And if the quantity of blood that is scorched by the specificity of the bone is like the majority of it, and lift your hand for this reason - so that the artery which is left is not scorched, lest a flow of blood comes.
And then immerse the cloth in saltwater and pause it on the spot, and leave it for three days; and then pause another cloth wrapped around the border, and cure with gentian medicine until it is healed.
And if you wish, cauterize at the extremity of the scalpel according to the method, and be careful not to cut into an artery in this proper non-ancient headache.
Fourth Chapter.
On Cauterizing Ancient Headaches.
When you cure a headache with what we have said about the previous treatment and what we have said in the divisions of diseases, and if the treatment does not benefit and the disease is such that it does not reach the point where we have said about the first cauterization with medicine or with fire, then you must ignite the cutler's cauterization until it becomes white, because you signify on the spot of pain with a line of length equal to the majority of the same thing, or whatever; and pause your hand for one moment and strengthen that until you incise the artery and reach into the bone.
However, it is necessary for you to beware of the continuity of the jawbone, which is damaged by mastication, and that the ligament not be scorched and the nerve which is affected by that, and that there be no spasmodic contraction.
And if it is about the custody and caution of the flow of blood from the artery that is cut, because in the cutting of it there is fear, and especially to him who ignores what he is doing and is not studious or experienced; and leave the operation to begin.
And you will find in memory of the regimen of accidental blood flow according to your own manner, in your place in this book.
And if you see that this disease does not reach the point of this cauterization and you see that the patient's body is tolerable, then cauterize it in the middle part of the head just as we have recounted, and cure the wound until it is healed.
And if you wish, administer the cauterization which we have said in the chapter on stretching the artery with two cloths, and it is a better cauterization and more conducive.
Fifth Chapter.
On Cauterizing Earaches.
When in the ear there is pain due to cold and it has been treated with laxative medicines and the other cure which I have mentioned in the division, and the pain is not relieved, then ignite the cauterization, and this is the one called "puncta", of which this is the form:
And then place the puncta near the ignition, and be guided to the entire ear as if a wheel is turned around, or in the circuit of each example if the pain is in each. Hold the cauterization of the ear's root slowly and gradually as you have indicated the location with a tentative touch.
And if the cauterization of those points in the entire ear is done, and whichever one it may be, then cure the spots until they are healed.
Sixth Chapter.
On Cauterizing Turtura.
Turtura which is cured and by cauterization it is nothing but the species that comes through phlegm, according to what we have said in the divisions of diseases.
Avoid cauterization of the species that occurs due to dryness or spasm of the nerve.
When you cure that species of turtura with jerrals and capipurgies and guarguarisms, and your treatment does not bring relief, then it is necessary for you to cauterize the patient with three cauterizations: the first at the root of the ear, and the second a little below the temporal temple, and the third at the junction of two lips.
And pause your cauterization at the opposite part of the affected side, because softening only appears on the side that seems to be healing.
And the form of cauterization is that you cauterize it with the cauterization in the right extremity of the ear, a little above the crown of the head, and on the temple another, the length of which is according to the length of the said thumb, and pause your hand with the cauterization until the quantity of the majority of the specificity of the bone is consumed.
And this is the form of the cauterization, and it is a species of the scalpel, the form of which is before us. But however subtle it may be, that which you see a little bit is what you must cut off in excess of unnecessary growth.
And then cure the spot with water as it proceeds until it is healed.
Seventh Chapter.
On Cauterizing Ancient Apoplexy.
When apoplexy is ancient and you cure it with the water that we have said and your treatment does not bring relief, and the patient has no fever, then cauterize it with four cauterizations: on all the crowns of the head; and with the middle cauterization in the middle part of the head, just as we have said; and with the cauterization in the back of the neck. And the manner of the cauterization is made according to what has been said above.
And it has been cauterized at the mouth of the stomach; and it is more recent; and then it should be cured with water as it proceeds.
Eighth Chapter.
On Cauterizing Oblivion Caused by Phlegm.
It is necessary to give the patient in the beginning large jars and pills of serving medicines that clean the mind.
And then remove the cloth from the entire patient and place on the back of the neck an emplastrum described in the treatise on emplasters.
And pause that for a few moments, because it is the manner of cauterization. And do so according to that order which I have already said.
And therefore if by those means he is healed; and otherwise, then do to him three cauterizations in the back part of his head, which are descendents of the upper part of the head down to the lower part of the neck. And pause between each cauterization the thickness of a finger, and then cure the cauterization with water as it proceeds.
But if you add more and the patient is thus tolerant, then do to him the cauterization in the middle part; and if you desire greater addition, then immediately cauterize that on both crowns.
And then cure it until it is healed; and be the olive cauterization according to the form previously given.
Ninth Chapter.
On Cauterizing Parasites and Softening the Entire Body.
It is necessary for you to proceed with the softening of the head with jars and water as we have said; and then remove the cloth from the patient's head, and then cauterize it with a cauterization in the middle part of the head, and one on all the crowns of the head, and one on the back part of the neck, and three cauterizations on the vertebrae of the neck.
And if it is necessary in the disease of softening the body of many and the patients are tolerant and the disease is strong, then immediately cauterize it with four cauterizations on the vertebrae of the back, and subsequently with one cauterization until it is consumed by the bone's motion, and lift your hand. And then cure it until it is healed, and this be olive cauterization.
Tenth Chapter.
On Cauterizing Epilepsy.
It is not cauterized the epileptic, but that epilepsy is due to phlegm.
And therefore it is necessary to soften the brain at the beginning with jars and other cure which we have said in the division when the disease is great and the patient is tolerant, except for medicines.
And if it is an infant who cannot tolerate medicines, then immediately administer guarguarisms and mastiguarists serving softening medicines, before this for many days, with the blessing of good food.
And then remove the cloth from the patient's head, and then cauterize it with one cauterization in the middle part of the head according to the previous manner, and another cauterization on the back of the neck, and on each crown of the head be cauterized. And if the patient is strong and tolerant, then immediately cauterize it with the cauterizations which I say, having paralysis and softening of the body on the vertebrae of the neck and the vertebrae of the back.
And be olive cauterization according to what has been said previously.
But if the patient is an infant, then immediately pause subtle cauterization according to this manner.
Eleventh Chapter.
On Cauterizing Melancholy.
When the causes of melancholy are corrupted and gross phlegm, then immediately cauterize it with the cauterizations which we have said in the previous chapter, having paralysis.
And if the cause of melancholy is excess and decline into melancholy, and the patient's body is humid, then immediately give him to drink water that softens the brain of him according to what has preceded in the division.
And then remove the cloth from the patient's head, and then make a gentle circular motion on him around the circle, and then place it in the middle part of the head.
And the patient shall be seated comfortably, and held from all sides.
And then pause the liniment; and it is more worthy of ancient border of sheep's wool. And warm that over the fire with gentle heat by measure, which the patient has suffered when it is most in him. And then place that in the middle part of the head of him in the circle, and let it enter until he is cooled down.
And do so with the patient for one week at a time, with another regimen of good things until he is healed; or if you wish, cauterize it making small points according to what is best for him, without holding your hand with a cauterization thus ordered: this is a species of cauterization which moistens the brain with equality.
And then pause that wrapped in cloth or in gray flannel.
Twelfth Chapter.
On Cauterizing Water Descending into the Eye.
When you declare the beginning of water in the eye by the signs which I have said in the division, then begin and give to drink to the patient water that softens the head of him, and guard it from all humidity.
And then place that in a bath of hot water for several days.
And then command him to wash his head, and cauterize it with a cauterization in the middle part of the head; and then cauterize it with two cauterizations on both temples if there is the beginning of water flowing from both eyes, or on one side if there is the beginning of water flowing from one eye.
And incise all the veins and arteries that are left by the bone; and be the cauterizations in that length on the latitude of the temples.
And be careful of bleeding when it is cauterized; and if you see any bleeding from it, stop it with some medicine that is at your disposal.
And you will find wisdom which is in the extraction of arteries and in the excision of those and caution in bleeding.
And some times it is cauterized in the vertebrae left between two bones with two cauterizations subsequently produced.
Thirteenth Chapter.
On Cauterizing Old Tears.
When the tears from the eyes are old and accumulated through the veins and arteries that are in the manifest location of the head outside and it is verified that this is excessive and watery phlegm, then immediately cauterize it with a cauterization which we have recounted in the chapter on the beginning of water flowing into the eyes, and also with a cauterization in the middle part of the head and two cauterizations in the vertebrae left between two temples, and two cauterizations in the vertebrae left between two bones. And if you need to add something, then immediately cauterize it on the entire back of the eyebrow above the upper eyelid with a small cauterization.
Fourteenth Chapter.
On Cauterizing Stench from the Nose.
When you treat him with water as we have said in the division and your treatment does not produce relief, then prepare yourself and give to drink to the patient cochineal for three nights; and then remove the cloth from the head of him, and cauterize it with a middle cauterization and olive cauterization. And then cauterize it with a clove cauterization and two cauterizations on both upper eyelids left between the hair a little.
And be careful not to cut into that artery.
And of the clove cauterization, this is the form.
Fifteenth Chapter.
On Cauterizing Softening of Eyelids of the Eyes.
When the eyelid of the eye is softened by disease or humidity, then immediately cauterize that eyelid with a cauterization with this lunar cauterization; and this is the form of it:
And if you wish, then cauterize that over both upper eyelids a little with two cauterizations in every part, and be prolonged from the temples. And be the length of each cauterization according to the quantity of the upper eyelid.
And do not press too hard with your hand on the cauterization, but rather according to the quantity that the third part of the eyelid is softened.
Sixteenth Chapter.
On Cauterizing the Eyelid of the Eye When the Hairs are Converted to the Inner Partitions and Punch the Eye.
When the hairs of the eye are converted to the inner partitions so that they punch the eye, cauterize it in those places according to two manners, whether it is by fire or by a medicine that combines.
If by cauterization of fire, command the patient to hold his eyes thus as those which are cleaned, until they are prolonged and equalized; and if it pains him, then immediately you should strengthen the eyes of him with a bandage so that no harm comes to them while the hairs are growing.
Then when they are grown and equalized, immediately pause the patient's head in your seat, and then sign above the eyelid of his eyes with a tentative sign, with a signal which is according to the figure of a mercurial leaf, and be the beginning of the signal near the hairs.
And then place it wrapped in alum water or in pectinate mucus over the eye.
And then ignite the cauterization of which this is the form of it.
And then cauterize over the figure which you have signaled, little by little, in many times, until the surface of the bone which is thus like a leaf of myrtle, appears properly.
And the sign of health for this operation is that you see the eyelid of the eye already contracted and the hairs of it being elevated above the puncture of the eye.
And therefore elevate your hand and leave it so for three days, and then pause on top of it with cloth until the scar is educated. And then cure that with ointment until it is healed.
But if some cause returns for the hairs and they become painful again, and the eyelid is softened, then immediately do another time the cauterization over it just as you did previously.
But if the hairs are in the eyelid itself, then immediately cauterize it until it is elevated to its natural place and equalized, so that the hairs do not hurt the eye.
But the cauterization with a medicine that combines is this: you command the patient to hold his hairs until they are prolonged and equalized, and then make a form of a leaf of myrtle from cloth.
And then take one ounce of known saponin and one ounce of living cause. It seems like the text has ended! And then take what is here, and immediately mix those causes well, and make this with a fumigation so that it will not be cooled; and then expand the water on the paper which is made thus in the form of a leaf of myrtle, and pause over one eye or both; and pause below the eye wrapped in alum water, and the patient's head should be in your seat.
And then pause the said on the medicine and press it a little and not harm it until the patient feels the biting of the medicine, for biting is in it as from fire.
And therefore when you perceive that he endures the biting, immediately let go of the medicine and make it clean with your said; then when the biting ceases, immediately remove the medicine and wash his eye with water; and then consider if at times the eyelid is raised as if it were washed away by fire or incision, for then you are well; and if not, return to that place of medicine where no medicine has been applied and do not disdain until your operation is equalized and the eye is constricted.
And then pause on top of it with cloth until the bone of adjustment is eradicated, and then cure that with ointment or another substance until it is healed.
And it is necessary for you to carefully watch over your operation with diligent vigilance so that no residue of medicine falls into the eye; and if the eyelid becomes softened and some cause from the hairs hurts the eye after a few days, then immediately repeat your medicine on that place where the eyelid has become softened, and just as you did at the beginning, and then send it back until it is healed.
And this is the form of leaf of myrtle.
And know that the eyes of men are diversified according to magnitude and smallness, and therefore according to this is made your contraction.
And may not be hidden the way of rectitude to him who studies in this art.
Seventeenth Chapter.
On Cauterizing Fistula that is in the Lacrimal of the Eye.
When you cure fistula with water as we have said in the divisions of diseases and it does not conform to your treatment, then immediately know that you must cauterize it according to this manner: command the patient to place his head on your seat, and hold his head steady between your knees in such a way that it is neither harmed nor agitated with his own head.
And then place it wrapped in alum water or in pectinate mucus over the eye of him.
And then ignite the cauterization of which this is the form:
which should be curved, like a shape of cane or the horn of a bull, from one end to which is made the cauterization.
And if you wish, it should penetrate into the other end. And if you wish, it should come out thus as if it were a test.
But in any case, the one that is curved is better for your work.
And then press on the fistula if it is open, and draw out from him the pus and dry that up. And if it is not open, then immediately work on it and extract the purulence from him.
And then pause on top of it with the cauterization which is well ignited, and take with your hand a little bit of the cauterized area from the edge of the nose, so that you do not err or trouble the patient, and then pause the cauterization in the gray matter of the eye and corrupt that.
And therefore if at the beginning of your cauterization it goes into the bone, that is good; and if not, then immediately repeat the cauterization one or two times, as needed; and leave it thus for three days, and then pause on top of it with cloth and surround it with drying ointment until it is healed.
But if it has been passed eleven days and it is not healed, then immediately pause on top of it with acute corrosive medicine until the bone is uncovered and is rough as is fitting in your own chapter.
And there is another manner of cauterizing fistula which some people call "first" day: go to the location of the fistula and fill it with it; and then pause in that fissure as subtle as its form: And put into it the quantity of one ounce of melted lead; and take your hand with a gentle touch, and do not harm the patient so that the melted lead does not penetrate into his eye; and know that you pause on top of the patient's eye wrapped in alum water or water, for lead adheres to the location of the fistula and cures it through marvelous healing.
And if the fistula is healed with the water that we have said about cauterization and healing, that is good; and if not, then immediately it is necessary to make a cut of the nose and reduce the fistula to the body of the nose according to what will come in its proper place.
Eighteenth Chapter.
On Cauterizing the Crack of the Pot.
Many times accidental cracks occur on the lips, and most often on the lips of children.
Therefore, when you cure those cracks with the water that we have said in the divisions and your treatment does not take effect, then immediately ignite the cauterization small cutlass according to this form that is learned:
And be the curvature of it according to the subtlety of a cutlery.
And then pause that initial application with care in those cracks until the cauterization reaches the bottom of the cracks.
And then cure that with ointment until it is healed.
Nineteenth Chapter.
On Cauterizing Fistula in the Mouth.
When in the throat of uvula or on the palate or on the roots of teeth an apostema forms and becomes swollen, and then breaks and is antiquated, and the swelling bursts and a fistula is formed, and you cure that but your treatment does not take effect, then immediately know that you must ignite cauterization according to the quantity received in the fistula; and then put that ignited thing into the track of the fistula, and take your hand until it reaches the bottom of it, and at the end of it do so one or two times; and then cure that with water as we have said about healing until it is healed.
And therefore if the pus is absorbed and is healed, that is good; and if not, then immediately it is necessary to uncover the location and expose the corrupted bone according to what will come in its own chapter.
Twentieth Chapter.
On Cauterizing Teeth and Softening Gums.
When the gums are softened by moisture and the teeth are damaged, and you cure them with medicines but it does not conform, then immediately place the patient's head on your seat, and ignite the cauterization in the form which will come to this, namely that you pause the quill over the tooth and insert into it the ignited cauterization rapidly, and take your hand a little so that the patient feels the heat of the fire at the root of the tooth being reached.
And then lift your hand, and immediately repeat the cauterization several times according to your will.
And then the patient should blow his mouth with salt water and hold it for an hour, and then stop, because the damaged tooth is closed and the softened gum is strengthened and the corrupted moisture is dried.
Twenty-first Chapter.
On Cauterizing Toothache.
When toothache is due to coldness, or if there is a black spot or worm in it, or if the patient does not conform to the treatment with medicine, then immediately know that the cauterization in that case should be done according to two manners: either cauterizing with the border of cows, or cauterizing with fire.
Cauterizing with the border is that you take the border of cows and boil it in iron water, and then take a piece and wrap it around the extremity of the tent, and immediately immerse it in boiling border, and pause it over the painful tooth rapidly until it is cooled.
And then immediately repeat that several times until the virtue of fire reaches the root of the teeth.
And if you wish, submerge the wool or cloth in the boiling border mentioned above, and pause it over the painful tooth, and then pause on top of that with hot iron until the iron reaches the bottom of the crack of the tooth.
But in any case, the cauterization with fire is that you attend to the quill of iron or steel, and it should be in the core of it some roughness and the sharpness of the fire does not reach the mouth of the patient.
And then ignite the cauterization in the form which will come, and pause it on the tooth and take your hand until the cauterization is cooled; and do so several times until the pain is relieved or within a day or two.
And it is necessary for the patient to fill his mouth with good border and hold it for an hour, and then spit it out; and this is the form of the cauterization.
And cauterize as you wish to the extreme limit according to what is possible for you.
And this is the form of the quill:
Twenty-second Chapter.
On Cauterizing Ulcers.
When ulcers are of phlegm and cold humors and do not obey digestion by medicines and you wish to ease the digestion of those slightly, then immediately ignite the cauterization curved in the shape which is this follows, having two extremities bulging so that the smoke of the cauterization rises on one side, and pause that ignited thing over that apostema once, and another if needed, until it reaches the bottom of the ulcer.
And if the ulcer is small, then immediately pause the cauterization according to the quantity of the ulcer, and then let it be for three days and pause on top of it with cloth wrapped in border until what the fire has burned off is relieved.
And then cure that with ointment, and tents, and cloths, until it is healed.
Twenty-third Chapter.
On Cauterizing Hoarseness of Voice and Constriction of Ale.
When the humidities come upon the canal of the lung, and especially when that is due to coldness of congestion, then it is necessary for the patient to be evacuated at first with laxative medicines, and then immediately cauterize that with fire on the root of the cough in the affected location.
And beware that you do not reach the lung with the cauterization nor burn too deeply into its fabric, but only a little.
And then cauterize that with another cauterization on the junction of the neck at the last vertebra of the spine. And let the cauterization be done in a similar manner as before.
And then cure that with water as is preceded, until it is healed.
Twenty-fourth Chapter.
On Cauterizing Disease of the Lungs and Cough.
When cough and disease of the lung are due to cold humidities and the patient has no fever nor phlegm, but is an old disease, then immediately cauterize that with two cauterizations on the furcula in the affected locations, one on each side; and another cauterization in the middle location of the breast between two nipples; and let the cauterization be done in a similar manner as before.
And if you wish, make your cauterization punctate with the point that is called puncture, in the form which precedes in the puncturing of earache.
And make points until they reach those places; and then cure that with water as is preceded, until it is healed.
And so the cauterizations have three steps which are for that: in one stroke you can do three cauterizations according to this form:
Twenty-fifth Chapter.
On Cauterizing Titillating which is the Head of the Assistant.
When the head of the assistant is dislocated due to lubricating humidities and does not stay in its place during its return movement, then it is necessary to reduce the dislocation and immediately reverse the patient's position onto his back or onto his side; and then elevate the cord which is in the anterior part of the citillic to the upper parts with your left hand, if the joint is dislocated backwards.
And then ignite the cauterization having two heads; and this is its form:
And then cauterize the cord until it penetrates into the other side; and the figure of cauterization will be like this: immediately ignite four cauterizations.
And several times it is adjusted according to this count, and because there are eight cauterizations.
And then pause on top of the cauterization with pores full of salt, and immediately make the patient adhere to tranquility, and let the member not be damaged for any time until it is comforted.
And if the dislocation is in the upper parts and it is thus done, then immediately cauterize on the muscle with a sharp-pointed cauterization or with multiple punctate cauterizations, because the joint is confirmed and the humidity is dried up and the patient is healed.
Twenty-sixth Chapter.
On Cauterizing the Stomach.
When cold and many humidities come into the stomach, causing that external part of its congestion to be multiplied in it, and if you continue with the methods of treatment and do not conform, then it is necessary for the patient to be placed on his back, with his arms and legs stretched out, and immediately cauterize that with three cauterizations: one leaving a space of the size of a finger's breadth between the breast and the cauterization, sharp-pointed; and two cauterizations leaving the two sides of the cauterization, so that it forms a triangular figure; and elongate between them so that they do not interfere with each other to cause inflammation.
And if the depth of the cauterization is equal to the size of two-thirds of the thickness of the cord.
And let the figure of the cauterization be according to this form, with addition; and if you wish, cauterize with a large cauterization in the middle location of the stomach, according to this form; and this is one cauterization according to the form of a circle, according to this form:
And let the stomach be cauterized punctate to that which is frightened by this cauterization: and it is that you sense on the stomach point by point according to the quantity you wish with cloth, and then cauterize that with a cauterization at those points; and then cure that with the treatment which precedes until it is healed.
Twenty-seventh Chapter.
On Cauterizing the Fretted Vein.
When the patient has pain in the vein due to coldness or humidity or great swelling, and it is caused by excess flow from its normal condition, and the disease is cured with water as we have said and does not conform, then immediately place the patient on his back onto his cervical vertebrae, and sense three cauterizations according to this form and this quantity of cloth placed over the vein left of the hip bones, in which way it is customary for a man to lie down.
And let the space between each cauterization be according to the thickness of the finger, and let the cauterizations be in line with the length of a straight arm.
And do not compress the cloth on the cauterized part.
And if the quantity of water applied is equal to the quantity of the middle part of the thickness of the cord, and it is not adjusted further; and if the patient is standing on his feet; and if he is not standing, then let him be lying down, which has already stretched out his legs, and lifted his arms.
And if it is possible for you to cauterize these cauterizations with a sharp-pointed cauterization, when it is according to your subtlety and prudence in the art.
And beware that you do not process too much in the cauterization, and let the subtlety of all the cord be applied so that it is applied to all the body and reaches into the vessels, for this cord here is subtle; and know this.
Twenty-eighth Chapter.
On Perforating Ulcer of the Vein with a Cauterization.
When you endeavor to excise or ulcerate in the vein and you wish to know if that ulcer is in the flesh of the vein or in its tunica, then immediately if it is in the flesh of the vein, the patient's gravity and pain will increase without abatement.
And if it is in the tunica of the vein, then with great pain and many times that you have exhausted the physicians' cure for him.
Therefore it is necessary for the patient to be turned onto his back onto his cervical vertebrae; and then sense the location of the ulcer with cloth; and then ignite the cauterization which is similar to a rag, in the form which has preceded on the other page. And then cauterize with that and that cauterization until all the cord is burned away, until it reaches the groin, until healthy flesh appears.
And then cure that with the treatment of other ulcers until it is healed.
And do not use this form of cauterization unless you have studied medicine and it has been prolonged through experience, and many diseases have known its efficacy; but in this case, it may be bold to operate on this ulceration, yet nevertheless follow my counsel, and it will be better.
Twenty-ninth Chapter.
On Cauterizing Pleurisy.
The ancient cauterizations of the roots of aristology, which are applied to pleurisy coldly, according to this manner make it, and take one long, dry root that is found, and let it be of the thickness of a finger.
And then immediately submerge that in oil and ignite it at the fire, and then cauterize with a cauterization on that location which is between the continuation of the furcula and the neck; and two small cauterizations left guiding, one slightly inclining towards the side below the beard, and two cauterizations in what is declining between the fifth rib and the spine, declining slightly towards the back parts; and another cauterization in the middle location of the breast; and another on the stomach, and three cauterizations on the back parts; and one cauterization on that location which is between the two shoulders, and two cauterizations from the two sides of the breast, left guiding the cauterization which is between the two shoulders.
And do not compress your cloth with the cauterized part, but let it be in the manifest of the cord in operation.
And already some ancient ones have said that certain men among those who used iron cauterizations similar to rays and ignited them, and placed them on that location which is between the ribs, until they reached the ulcerated part and healthy flesh appeared, just as we have said in the apostema of the vein.
But in this perforation with a cauterization there is no fear, for if it happens that way soon, the fistula will occur at the location where there will be no healing.
Thirtieth Chapter.
On Cauterizing Melancholy.
When you cure the disease of melancholy with water as we have said in the division and do not conform to your treatment, then immediately cauterize there according to three methods, all of which are driutaries, one of which is that you make three or four linhan (lines) according to the length of the melancholy, following the figure of the cauterizations of the vein, the figure of which has preceded.
And let the thickness between each cauterization be that of a finger or slightly more, and the manner of the cauterization be the manner which we have said in the cauterizations of the vein equally.
And do not compress your cloth on the cauterized part; and let the patient be placed on his back.
And there is another manner of cauterizing, so that you ignite the cauterization having two points, which cause we have said in the chapter on dislocation of the muscle, and elevate the cord which is in the endreyt (end) of the melancholy, where the patient's left side will be affected.
And let your elevation be such that you elevate the cord according to the length of the body, so that the cauterizations are made according to the latitude of the body.
And then insert the two points, ignite one, in that location where the cord will penetrate from the other side.
And then extract the cauterization; and thus make four cauterizations.
And if you wish, cauterize with a cauterization having three points.
And then cure the cauterization more thoroughly than you would have laid down to take it for too many days, because it is more certain that other causes precede in the treatment.
Thirty-first Chapter.
On Cauterizing Hydrocephalus.
Cauterizations are not applied in hydrocephalus, but only in acute cases properly.
When you cure the hydrocephalus with the methods of treatment which we have said in the division and do not conform to your treatment, then immediately it is necessary to cauterize with four cauterizations around the belly button, one on the stomach, one on the vein, one on the melancholy, two between the vertebrae of the back, one on the right side of the breast, and another on the stomach. And let the quantity of the depth of the cauterization be proportionate to the subtlety of the cord.
And then leave the cauterized part untouched for so long that it will take several days.
And do not evacuate the patient from treatment immediately after the cauterization with water as is necessary for two intentions to be added, and let it be hastened with the help of salvation.
The form of the cauterization with which the belly is cauterized is sharp-pointed according to its previous shape, and it is that one with which the back is cauterized is olive-shaped according to its previous shape.
Thirty-second Chapter.
On Cauterizing Feet and Legs.
When the feet are ulcerated in hydrocephalus and filled with serous water, it is necessary to cauterize the feet on the top of the foot between the auricular and anular bones, using no caustic water that is between the ear and wrist, and elevate your cloth with the cauterization and do not twist it; and then elevate your cloth and do not return all the way, because serous water resists.
And this is the form of the cauterization: And then make two cauterizations on both legs, and in each leg make a cauterization with the sharp-pointed end of the cauterization. And let the cauterizations be according to the length of the leg: one below the knee and the other above the middle part of the leg; and on each leg, two cauterizations.
And leave the wound open without treatment for a long time in order that some water may drain from it.
And then cure with those causes which we have said.
Thirty-third Chapter.
On Cauterizing the Abdomen.
When the abdomen is full and humid to the point where it debilitates the virtues, such as the digestive and retentive virtues in the stomach and intestines, and if the patient suffers from a cauterization of virtue exhibiting, then immediately cauterize that with a great cauterization on his stomach, according to what preceded in the cauterization of the stomach, with the cauterization of the circle and four cauterizations in the subtle circle of the navel, with sharp-pointed cauterization; and with cauterization on the flank or two cauterizations.
And if sometimes the humidities abound and the patient can tolerate it, then immediately cauterize that on the navel and on the intestines, and firmly place two cauterizations on the stomach and near the groin, because it is perfect cure of the juice from which you will not err.
Thirty-fourth Chapter.
On Cauterizing Old Haemorrhoids.
When in nature there are old haemorrhoids or one of the gross humours that are fleshy or corrupted humidities, and they are cured with what we have said in the division and do not conform to your treatment, then immediately cauterize with three cauterizations on the remaining vertebrae of the little back and triangular, and one above the navel that descends by two digits.
And if you find that the patient's stomach is enfeebled and his food is not digested, and his face is often ulcerated, then immediately cauterize that on the stomach with a great cauterization according to what has preceded; and one on the vein, and another on the melancholy of him with sharp-pointed cauterization, and leave the cauterized part untouched for some time, and then cure him until he is healed.
Thirty-fifth Chapter.
On Cauterizing Abscesses.
When you excise an abscess, then immediately ignite the cauterization that is similar to a ray. And then insert that ignited thing into the excised abscess, and finally apply your cloth so that the cauterization reaches the orifice of the vein from which the blood flows.
And make it once or twice, because if there are many, then immediately cauterize each of them according to what we have recounted, and then cure those with the water that corresponds to their conditions until they are healed.
And if you cauterize with a great cauterization on someone, it is more certain in judgment.
Thirty-sixth Chapter.
On Cauterizing Fistulas that are formed in the natural parts of the body.
When nature does not obey the work which we have recommended in its place, and the patient is frightened by this, then let him be healed with a cauterization.
Therefore, when you find a fistula in the natural parts that is old and corrupted by blood and humidities, and thus what is most suitable for curing it is to attempt subtlety with it, and then know the quantity of its depth according to the preceding subtlety.
And then ignite the cauterization that is similar to a ray. And then place that ignited cauterization in this fistula, and according to the quantity in which the subtlety enters.
And iterate that cauterization over those corrupted bodies until they are completely burned away in one, two, or three iterations, according to the quantity of your need.
And beware of combustion of nerves and veins; or if the fistula goes to the bladder or intestines, then beware of all those places; and do not make it so until the fistula is in a place where it is not penetrating.
And then cure that place until it is healed.
And if the place is sealed, and all the matter has been removed from it, and it remains thus for a long time, then know that it is completely cured.
And if the matter is not removed from it, then know that it is penetrating or entering into the bone of the patient's body, or corrupting it, or falling under those causes from which a memory will be recalled in its place.
Thirty-seventh Chapter.
On Cauterizing the Tonsils.
When in the tonsils there is pain due to inflammation or gross ventosity, and because of this the patient's throat is dry, then it is necessary that you cauterize that on the tonsils with a cauterization on each tonsil with a sharp-pointed cauterization from which recall will precede.
And then cauterize with a small cauterization in the second one, so that three linear cauterizations will come to be, and thus they will be more certain in judgment.
Thirty-eighth Chapter.
On Cauterizing the Bladder.
When debilitation and softening occur in the bladder due to inflammation and humidities, such that the patient no longer retains urine, then immediately cauterize that in the lower part of the bladder where the hairs of the navel begin, and cauterize with one cauterization on the right side and another on the left side.
And let the length of each cauterization be according to the quantity of the knots in the bone; and cauterize that with a cauterization in the lower part of the back, or with two cauterizations if necessary.
And let it be a sharp-pointed cauterization according to what is processed.
Thirty-ninth Chapter.
On Cauterizing the Mare (i.e., the womb).
When inflammation and humidities occur in the womb, and because of this conception is prohibited, and the menses are corrupted and delayed, and pain occurs due to the shedding of them, then it is necessary that the place be cauterized with three cauterizations in the circle of the navel, just as we have said in the cauterization of the bladder; and one cauterization on the lower part of the back, or two cauterizations, and let the cauterization be sharp-pointed.
Fortieth Chapter.
On Cauterizing the Dislocation of the Hip (Anca).
When humidities are poured out at the part of the hip, and causes of swelling occur in that location, and the sign is that the leg is prolonged above the other when compared between them. And the place of the dislocation is found in the lower part of the buttock.
Then it is necessary that you cauterize the patient on the part of the hip with a cauterization resembling a circle, as you have marked with subtlety in the circle of the part, and because the part falls in the middle of the circle.
And let it be the cauterization of which the form preceded in the cauterization of the stomach.
And if this cauterization is not present to you, then immediately cauterize that with three cauterizations and one great olive-shaped cauterization.
And let the cauterization be made according to the quantity of the subtlety of all the cord; and then cure that until it is healed.
Forty-first Chapter.
On Cauterizing the Sciatic Vein.
When pain occurs in the part of the hip and its cause is inflammation and humidities, the patient is cured with what we have said and do not conform, and this is antiquated, then it is necessary that you purge the patient of gross humors with fetid pills or artificial pills or semblances; and then immediately cauterize that.
And the method of cauterization in this case is according to two methods: or cauterization with combustible medicines, or cauterization by fire.
According to two scientific methods, of which one is that you cauterize on the part of the hip with three triangular cauterizations according to this form; and make it with good depth. And let the space between each cauterization be the quantity of the thickness of the finger, and if the olive-shaped or great cauterization.
In some cases, there may be one cauterization on the middle point above the hip for a total of four cauterizations.
And if you wish, cauterize with the circle of which the form precedes in the cauterization of the dislocation of the hip, that it may be a continuous and burning circle that consumes the subtlety of all the cord.
And this is the method of cauterization in sciatica when pain is adherent to the hip and does not extend into the cleft.
But if it extends into the cleft, then immediately cauterize that with two cauterizations on the cleft over the location where the patient's pain is located; and one cauterization on the crease for four digits or a little of the hairy part.
And if the cauterization is cutaneous, and let the depth of the cauterization be according to the quantity of the subtlety of the cord.
And if the patient says that the pain is extended to the location near the digits of the feet, then immediately cauterize that place where it extends with a cauterization for three or four points or more if needed.
And if the patient says that the pain is below the hollow of the knee and near the cleft, then immediately cauterize that place with a single cutaneous cauterization.
And beware in all cauterization that you do not leave the cauterized area burning with nerve or great archery, and because of this it will be bad for your patient, causing harm or contractions.
And I have seen one and another of those whom I will cauterize on the crease, and ultimately in the cauterization, the fire becomes inflated until the tumor reaches its peak, and the focus is perforated and corrupted all over the foot. And then comes a strong solution of the belly, and then death follows.
And if the pain is in two parts together, cauterize each one according to this method.
And the wise men say that in the cauterization of the hip, this is the method: make it similar to a circle of iron, with the circumference being half the width of a palm; and let the orifice be according to the thickness of an almond or slightly less.
And within that circle is another third; and let the space between them be the quantity of the knots of the bone; and let those circles be above two parts; and let their length be one knot or two knots, and make in those margins a iron covering decently adorned with circles; and this is its form:
And then let it be ignited in the fire until it reddens and sends sparks, and then let it be placed on the part of the hip, the patient lying on their back. And therefore, cauterize that with three cauterizations that are rounded into one.
And then let that be left for three days, and then apply an ointment to it with borders, and leave the wound open for many days; and then cure that with remedies until it is healed.
Thus speaks Albucasis: "Oh, sons, we have used this type of cauterization sparingly due to the fear of its regard by those who look upon it."
But from good cauterizations on him who suffered them, and finds with that the place of his.
But cauterization with medicines that are adherent is when you make two circles having a perforated armlet in which the guaffo of the iron door should be inserted; and let the length of the walls in their naughtiness be two knots or as many as.
And if the space between each one is equal to the quantity of the thickness of the finger; and let them be above and below, and let them contain themselves within each other according to this form:
And then pause over the part of the hip where the patient is lying on their back, and compress your hand on the part of the hip; and then take cold water and pour it between the two circles, and let its quality be like a small fire, gradually increasing, and keep it for the quantity of an hour, and suffer the patient to endure the mordication and adjustment of him - since that mordication will be as if from fire - until the mordication ceases.
And then lift your hand with the instrument and wipe away the cold water from all of the hip with soft water.
And then leave that alone for three days and pause over it with borders until the blackness of the adjustment is renewed, and leave it so for some days, and then run away from him in shamefulness; this is the final result in judgment.
And then cure that with remedies until it is healed.
And if the pain is extended into the cleft or the knee, make him stand in water according to how it is made in the hip similarly.
And this is the method of cold water, and I have already written it in the treatise on the rectification of medicines. Recipe of alkali and of non-extinguished cause in both halves of one, and mix them together and pause in a new wave of which the left part is perforated by a small hole, according to the quantity that enters into him.
And pause in the fons of one wave another wave enveloped, and pour over that alkali and living cause with soft water which absorbs them by one finger, and then compress them with your tied hand for good compression, and leave the hole that lets out the sharp water into the left part of the enveloped wave.
And then adjust all that water, and pour it over another living cause and another alkali renewed, for that labor is of strong sharpness, which is administered in many operations of medicine and in cauterization of other members, for the operation is like fire.
And some of the medicines, with which the hip is cauterized, are like this: tezizic and mel anacrat mixed with a substance that is dissolved in water.
And Gualia recounts the story of a man from ancient times who underwent an operation and was cured of hip and sciatic vein pain, and magnificently says that it is as if it were a marvel, and he declares that no other cure is needed, and because it has been healed in one moment just as recommended, for it has taken him to the bath and to the bed already satisfied with that.
And it is that he is pressed with certain vertigo, and if not found green, then take a fig leaf recently gathered; and mix it with a little gray powder and apply it to the hip where the pain is, or in the cleft, or in the knee, and tie it.
And let it be left for the quantity of three hours or until the patient has yielded to the adjustment.
And then put him in a bath and therefore when his body is reddened, introduce him into the sun, for the pain ceases and he is healed.
And know that it is not necessary to use cauterization with these medicines except when the evacuation of the body is proper.
But already Escorides has said that when in a wound of the goat the sciatic vein is cauterized, it brings relief to him; and let the cauterization be done according to this method: take wool and soak it in old oil, and place it between the toes of the foot and the shin.
And then take dried goat's flesh and fill it with fire until it is made into carbon; and then place it on the wool and leave it there until it is stretched. And then repeat this process, and do not cease to apply it until the sensation of the biting reaches into the hip and rests the pain.
And this method of cauterization is called "cauteri de vaquas".
Chapter 42.
On the Cauterization of Pain in Two Places.
Sometimes pain is in two places due to numerous causes, such as by bruising or piercing or excessive evacuation, and similar causes, by the infusion of wet and humid matter.
And the cauterization is done not on all these species, but only in this one which is made by effusion of wet matter.
Therefore, it is necessary to evacuate the patient with fetid pills and similar ones, which are made on the two places where the pain is three lines apart according to the latitude of the place, plus or minus a tenth in each line, depending on the quantity that one sees from the tolerance of the patient and the virtue of the matter.
And let the cauterization be done with a puncture cauterizer.
And if you wish, cauterize with three or four cauterizers of the medial type, according to this form:
Chapter 43.
On the Cauterization at the Beginning of Gout.
Many times this illness befalls small children; and the signal of its beginning in children is that it occurs on their joints, accompanied by swelling and elevated motion.
And then it appears in the last vertebra of the spine and on the knots of the back that already begins to rise above the other vertebrae.
And then when you see this and want to prohibit it, immediately cauterize that with a cauterizer in the shape of a circle according to this form: which takes the cauterizer over the entire part of the vertebra similarly.
And if you wish, cauterize in the circle of the vertebra with a puncture cauterizer two or three lines. And let the points be proper between them.
And then cure the place until it is healed, with what we have said.
But be careful that cauterization is not administered in gout that is caused by spasm of nerves.
Chapter 44.
On the Cauterization of Gout and Joint Pain.
When joint pains are caused by wet humors that are imbedded in each member of the body, and when pain comes to the feet, it is customary for doctors to call this "podagra" properly.
And therefore, as podagra caused by wet humors is cured through a method of cure and the pains are not renewed, immediately renew the cauterization.
And then you cauterize that with evacuation in the circle of the joint of the foot, using many cauterizers.
And let it be an olive-shaped cauterizer, whose form is this:
And if it is necessary to make points on the fascia of the foot, then do so with a puncture cauterizer. And if the pains rise into the toenails or to other joints, and this disease endures for many years, then immediately cauterize that on each toenail with three or four puncture cauterizers of olive shape.
And if many punctures are necessary for these punctures to be at your disposal, then immediately cauterize that and do not press too hard with the cauterizer before, so that it is only as much as the thickness of the cord.
And if the pains rise into the toenail and knee, then administer the cauterizer which we have said in its own chapter.
And if the pains are only in the most part, and it is called "suagra", then point in the circle of the toes just as they turn, pointing to those two lines.
And if there remains pain in the said places, then point in the circle of the toes on each toe and on the crease of the palm.
And if the pains rise immediately to the kidneys or muscles, then cauterize all of them on all sides of the assistive devices.
And do not evacuate the patient with good regimen and reception of medicines, for if there is a good regimen and the flux is evacuated with this cauterizer, then it will be healed, may God help.
Chapter 45.
On the Cauterization of Lacerations.
When a laceration occurs in the navel and says that it is opening up the bags before the altar of the genital area, and this is when it begins to approach, then it is necessary that you instruct the patient to leave their diet alone for that day and to use lenient causes so that the wound opens up from its own ventricle.
And then follow the patient with your hands on their back over their knee, and command them to keep their arm inside until the hole is fully opened or appears the altar or the bags.
And then return that place with your said digits and signal with a tenth the rupture on the bone of the pubis, with the extremity of which is similar to half a circle at the parted parts of the chest.
And then ignite the cauterizer whose form is this:
until it becomes hot and red like embers. And then reduce the bag or altar to its natural shape, and then place your hand on the location so that the bag does not burst.
And you have opened between the clefts of the patient and left one cleft, and another serves on his knees, and another on his feet, which has its own hands.
And then pause the cauterizer on that spot, signaling with your hand and cauterizer standing upright, and bring it into contact with the bone of the pubis in the middle of the duodenum; and repeat with another pass if you have not achieved it in the first pass until the bone.
And observe wisely the state of the bag at the time of your cauterization, lest you burn that bag and cause great harm to the patient.
And know that when you have the cauterizer do not touch the bone, nor compare your operation.
And it is necessary that the cauterizer for children be subtle according to their great and small size.
And then cure the place of the cauterization for three days with a border, until the scar of the fire is renewed.
And then cure that place with other remedies, until it is healed.
And the patient should lie on his back for 40 days until the wound and sore are sealed.
And it is necessary that you pause the patient's nourishment according to the length of time of their cure, which stretches their belly and does not burst forth with the effort of healing.
And then, when it is time to lift after 40 days, immediately administer a decently made medicine, and keep him on that for other 40 days.
And thus be moderate in work and in replenishment of food and drink, and in strong voices, for when you use this regimen of entire healing, then it will be healed.
And you will say the cure of lacerations in other parts of the belly, and thus at the beginning, and if they do not cease, then cauterize the rupture with a redon cauterizer according to the quantity of it, and let this be what is excreted from the cord just as the third part of it; and then cure that place with what we have said, and it will not be adjusted.
And already some first ones have said that rupture should be cauterized with a triangular cauterizer according to this form, since it is signaled by a tenth:
and is paused line that goes through the latitude in the lathe and above the rupture, and another line above it; and then place your hand with a cauterizer of clavilh, but the first cauterizer is lighter and better.
Chapter 46.
On the Cauterization of Torsion.
When a pain occurs in some member due to bruising or piercing and the pain persists for a long time and does not yield to cure with medicines, then it is necessary that you cauterize with a puncture cauterizer.
And let the cauterizer be of all members according to their magnitude and smallness, virtue and defect, location of torsion and pain.
Therefore, if it is healed by the first cauterizer, good; and if not, then immediately repeat the cauterization on the patient; for it is customary with those pains to be punctured in one member to another which approaches the patient, so that you must achieve these with a cauterizer until the patient is healed.
Chapter 47.
On the Cauterization of Leprosy.
Some lepers are cured with cauterization by great divine providence, and more so if the species of leprosy is caused by putridity of blood and melancholy.
And therefore, when you want to cauterize that person, consider if the leprosy is common and has been cured with what we have said in the division, and do not neglect or delay, for fear of the patient's corruption comprehending the entire body and all its complexity. Then cauterize it on the head with 4 cauterizers: one in the middle part of the head, and the second slightly behind, up to the forehead; and both on the two temples; and one behind, on the neck or services.
And finally, your hand with the cauterizers a little bit into the bone to make a small impression, and from there the scabs are dislocated, so that the exhalation of thick vapors is alleviated; and cauterize on the mole according to what has been prescribed.
And if the leprosy has already spread over the patient's body and is manifestly apparent, then it is necessary that you cauterize that person with those cauterizers which we have said on the head; and one cauterizer on the tip of the nose, and two cauterizers on both elbows, and two cauterizers on both vertebrae of the neck, and six cauterizers on the vertebrae of the back, and one large one on the vertebrae near the coccyx, and one on the coccyx, and two on each hip, and one on each knee, and two on each ankle, and one on each foot; and cauterize that person on all the joints of the arms and legs, and on each heel of their feet, and on the toes of their feet.
And beware of the nerves that are over the ankle, lest you burn those.
And sometimes it is cauterized with a cauterizer on the bone of the pubis and another on the mouth of the stomach and another on the bladder.
And know that the more you adjust the cauterizers, the more they are helpful and effective; and know that the patient does not have pain in the cauterizer, just like they do with their own, because the body of the patient is already stupified.
And it is necessary that the cauterizers be great or small according to the members and joints, as indicated by the species of the instruments.
And then cure the cauterizer with rye flour mixed with honey and with another remedy until it is healed.
Chapter 48.
On the Cauterization of Stupor.
When some member is stuporized or asleep and is cured with medicines, oils, and emplasters, but does not heal, then you should cauterize that numb member with cauterizers according to its magnitude or smallness.
And let your cauterizer enter the sharp point of the cord a little bit. And then cure that place with remedies until it is healed.
And sometimes the stupor is cauterized which occurs in the arms and legs, and on the vertebrae of the back, and you see the evidence of the nerves which govern that member, and the stupor is renewed.
But do not presume on this unless you are knowledgeable in the anatomy of the members and the emission of the nerves throughout the entire moving body.
Chapter 49.
On the Cauterization of Alabares that is Morphia.
When alabares is ancient and does not yield to any of the remedies of medicine, then you should cauterize on it with a preon cauterizer for a little bit according to the quantity of the species of the cord until the whiteness and color of it are restored and the color of it is changed.
And then cure that place with rye flour and lentils mixed with roasted oil and with leaves of arnagrosa, and with the blood of a dove or with the blood of a hen, each part being one portion and all being mixed together; and then anoint a cloth with it and apply it to the location until it is healed.
Chapter 50.
On the Cauterization of Cramp.
When cramp is beginning and you want to stop it, then cauterize that place with a circular cauterizer in the circle of it just as it revolves.
And the wise men say that it should be cauterized with the last cauterizer in the middle location; but to me it has not been seen thus, for I fear it may be ulcerated, and I have already seen this a few times.
And it is better to be cauterized in the circle of it with a circular shape just as we have said, or with many cauterizers.
Chapter 51.
On the Cauterization of Adulteries.
When some adulteries are delayed in maturation, and thus it is because of the superfluity causing that, or due to the state of the patient, for it is old in decrepitude, with little blood, or due to time, and you want to hasten the maturation of adulteries; then cauterize in the circle of it with many small punctate cauterizers; and immediately leave off when it begins to mature.
But if you want the perforation of it with a cauterizer, then ignite the cauterizer whose form is this: and place that in the middle location of the adulteries until it penetrates the cord.
And if the cauterizer in that location is slightly behind, for so that the body of the arm is relieved; and then cure that place until it is healed.
Chapter 52.
On the Cauterization of Corrosion.
Corrosion is corruption that walks in the member, which corrupts that place just as fire consumes dry wood.
Therefore, if you find that corrosion in a place where a cauterizer with fire is suitable, then ignite the cauterizers with a small number of large ones, and few small ones, according to what is convenient in that place where corruption is occurring.
And then cauterize that place entirely until you eradicate all the corrosion and there remains no cause of it.
And then leave off from that for three days, and pause over the cauterized places only thrice with oil mixed together until all the scars are eradicated and all corruption.
And then cure that place with flesh-generating remedies.
But if after three days the flesh has grown healthy in which there is no corruption, good is; but if not, then reiterate the cauterization on that place which remains corrupted.
And corrosion is treated with acute medicine for several times, since it is half in the location of a cauterizer. But nonetheless, cauterization with fire is more helpful.
And I have already said the cure of it with acute medicine in the division, and therefore take that when you will find occasion.
Chapter 53.
On the Cauterization of Knots and other similar things.
Many times it occurs in the left parts of a sick foot that is called a knot, and it is a great, deep-seated cause which causes the foot to be lame; and cauterization in those places is done in two ways, namely with fire and with hot water.
But cauterization with fire is when you ignite the concave cauterizer resembling a vulture's beak, which is made of iron according to the quantity that contains the knot of all parts, and it has subtle margins.
And then pause the ignited cauterizer on the knot, and then rotate your hand with the cauterizer in the circle of the knot until the cauterizer penetrates to the depth of the knot. And then leave off from that for three days until you begin to see improvement. And then apply an emplaster to that place with wild mallows thrashed with salt, and leave the emplaster on that place for one night, so that it will be eradicated from its roots.
And then cure that place with flesh-generating remedies until it is healed.
And if it does not convert, and many times accidents occur on the surface of the body, mostly in the arms and legs, then it is necessary that you administer cauterizers with water; and this is done by taking a quill made of iron or bone or vulture's beak, and placing it on the knot; and then take a small amount of hot water, and place your hand on it, and rotate the quill with compression of your hand all around, so that the edge of the quill presses on the root of the knot, and the hot water flows back into the preconception of the root of the cauldron; and wait for the patient a little while to experience the mordication of the hot water for an hour, and then remove it, since the knot with its roots will be eradicated.
And thus do for those who are afflicted and then proceed to the other, until you have reached all of them in their own place within the body.
And then cure those who have had the roots of the knots eradicated with this remedy, and with these remedies which cause flesh to regenerate.
Chapter 54.
On the Cauterization of Tremors.
When you find that someone is affected by some tremor due to irritation of the nerves or due to fever caused by irritation, or for another similar reason, then it is necessary that you cauterize that place with four cauterizers or five on the vertebrae of the back, between each vertebra with one cauterizer; and also on the feet of him, and on his stomach with an olive cauterizer.
And the trembling of him ceases and hastens the health of the diseased body.
Chapter 55.
On the Cauterization of Accidental Bleedings in the Body.
When in the body there are accidental bleedings and pustules that open up which are made from gross corrupted matter; then it is necessary at first to apply, as appears, a cauterizer on top of the fistula with a subtle cauterizer made of myrtle wood, the extremity of which is extended with fire; or with the roots of long-lasting erestology; or with a lentecular cauterizer.
And sometimes it is necessary to cauterize again at the beginning of its expulsion according to this manner; and do not believe, and is interrupted the surplus causing those things, and heals from those.
But nonetheless it is necessary that this be done properly with evacuation through phlebotomy.
Chapter 56.
On the Cauterization of Accidental Bleeding due to Incision of Artery.
Many times it occurs that an artery is cut which causes a wound to open up, or the incision of apophtosis or cauterization of a limb, and afterwards similar things occur, and it is difficult to treat that.
Therefore, as it happens to some people, then you should take your hand and apply a cauterizer to the opening of the artery, and place that on top of it with the aforementioned pressure many times until the bleeding from the artery is stopped, and so that there is no more.
And then pause in the fire with olive cauterizers, small and large, in a few numbers, and exhale upon them until they are thoroughly ignited.
And then take from those one small or large cauterizer according to the location and wound where the artery is broken, on that vein, hastening more than you have already removed the aforementioned blood, and place the cauterizer until it absorbs and restrains that blood.
And if the blood is expelled from the opening of the artery when you remove the aforementioned and extinguish the cauterizer, then take another cauterizer carefully among those which are prepared in the fire, and therefore do not cease to do this again until the blood is restrained.
And beware that you do not burn the nerve which is here, and that another mischief comes upon the patient.
And know that when blood flows from the artery, then it is not possible to restrain the blood in those cases, and even more so when the artery is large, unless by one of four means: or with a cauterizer such as we have said, or through extraction when it is not extracted, for when it is extracted, the extremities are burned and the blood is restrained, or that it be tied with thread or with ligature by strong constriction, or that medicines be applied to it which have the virtue of restraining the blood; and be strengthened by a poultice with decent constriction.
But he who administers restraint with thread or ligature and constriction with cloths or by position of concurring causes and similar things does not yield until late.
But if this happens to someone and the doctor is not present nor medicine, then work with the aforementioned pause on the opening of that vein just as we have said, and understand by great constriction to stop the blood from the superior part of the wound, and on the artery do not remove what has been removed; and above the artery be sprinkled with hot water of great coldness until the blood is congealed and thickened; and more certainly in cases where there is a need for cauterization or medicine.
On Incision, Perforation, and Vents, and on Phlebotomy, and Wounds, and their Similarities.
We have already said in the first chapter all the diseases in which cauterization with fire is suitable and with medicine that concurs, and the occasions and causes of them, and the instruments necessary in those cases with the forms of the cauterizers; and we have arranged the chapters according to the subordination of the head down to the feet.
And you will proceed in this chapter by that same method, so that it may be clarified for whoever seeks this, then on what has been asked.
And before you begin this, it is necessary, son, that you learn that in this chapter it is for fear of what is said in the first chapter on cauterization.
And therefore it is necessary that there be great caution, for in the operation which is in this chapter many times evacuation occurs which is with blood and in which lies the life of the patient; and thus it is necessary to be cautious when applying the cauterizer to the vein or incising on the apostema or warning of exitura or purging the wound or extracting an arrowhead or incising a peyra and their similar things. And from all these there is accompanying fear and trembling, and in the most of them death.
And I warn you that over you does not fall this in which is the situation, for sometimes case of necessity requires you to take ways of men with many methods of diseases. And of these some may stray away with their own disease and it is light to them for him to die, and thus through the intensity of what they find in their disease, and through the length of their disease, and with the disease is fear which means death.
And from these some may be those who give you their son and daughter, you expecting health for them, and their disease is mortal.
And therefore it is not necessary that you consent to him who comes to you with this manner; and your caution be greater than covetousness and rapacity; and do not presume any cause on that except true scientific certainty which verifies what you have, and by which succession praise is achieved.
And use in the cure of all your sick patients prophesy and indication of that which is converted into salvation, for in that there is to you aid on acquisition of fame and memory, of praise and glory.
Oh, sons, God inspires your understanding and does not withhold from you direction and protection, for this is in His hand.
And you have ordered this chapter distinct by chapters according to what preceded in the chapter on cauterizers, from the cure of the head down to the feet, so that it may be clarified for you what you ask about this and of which you have need.
First Chapter.
On the Cure of Water which is contained in the Head of Children.
Know that this disease often occurs in children, especially during infancy and childhood, when the fontanel is still open.
And sometimes it occurs due to a hidden cause which is unknown.
But I have only seen this disease in children; and all those whom I have seen were on the verge of death, and thus it was shown to me left undone work in them.
And I have seen that a child whose head was full of water, and his head was always magnificently swelled so that he could not stop it from flowing forth through the greatness of his head, and more so that the moisture increased until mortal fire.
And this moisture either accumulates between the bone and the skull, or accumulates below the skull on the forehead.
For the operation in that case if the moisture is between the bone and the skull and the apostema is small, then it is necessary to make an incision in the middle of the head with a fissure in the latitude, and the length of the fissure should be about two inches so that the moisture can flow out, and this is the form of the spatum:
And therefore if the moisture is more increased and the apostema is greater, then there are here two fissures according to this method:
And if the moisture is below the skull, the sign of this is that you must open the commissures of the head on all sides and the water is squeezed out when you compress that with your hand to the inside parts and it is not hidden from you. It is necessary that you make an incision in the middle of the head with three fissures according to this method:
And then apply the incision to remove all the moisture; and then strengthen the fissures with cloths and poultices; and then broach this over with vinegar and oil within five days, and then loosen the ligament and cure the wound with tents and bandages, and strengthen the head with equality; and feed the patient with dry food of little moisture so that the member is comforted and healed.
And there is another way of making an incision, which takes into account the magnitude of the apostema and the collection of water, for sometimes it is greater in the occipital region, or in the anterior part, or on the right side, or on the left side; and therefore attend to the incision where the apostema appears and the accumulation of water, and do so according to what seems best to you.
And observe that you do not cut the artery and avoid bleeding from the wound, and thus the patient dies due to the flow of blood with evacuation of moisture.
Chapter 3.
When there are catarrhs or rashes on the eyelids or feet, and this is old, and you do not expect any healing from medicines, then the last resort in this case is the incision of those two arteries.
And therefore it is necessary when you want to incise those which the patient's head swells, and apply pressure on the spot with a rough cloth so that the arteries appear; and then strengthen the neck of the patient with some cloth; and consider where the vein pulsates; and the spots of each one over the spots which are near the ears, and as much as they are hidden except in certain men.
And then mark the artery with a tent, and then incise each one with the spatula of each side going up to the bone and incising into it, and so that this is done according to the latitude of the head.
And if you want, insert the spatula below the artery and cut it at that point where it meets the incision in the sides above.
And be the length of the incision about two fingerbreadths, for when some vein is incised, the blood flows out with pulsatile emission, which jumps forth by frequent leaps.
But if the artery does not appear at the incision, then it is necessary that you measure from the ear the quantity of space equal to three fingerbreadths, and mark with a tent, and make an incision into the bone.
And what flows out as blood is a quantity of vinegar. and very little flows out of it more or less, and all this is according to the quantity which appears from the virtue of the disease and the accumulation of the artery in it.
And then consider the wound, and therefore if there remains on the bone some cause of the forehead, then incise this to prevent the apostema from becoming inflamed.
And then strengthen the wound with poultices and bandages of linen cloth, and cure this with ointments until it is healed.
Chapter 3.
On the Extraction of the Arteries which are in the Temples.
When old age or catarrhs arise from the temples, caused by excessive humidity and quality of the lacertae in the temples, or very ancient and similar to those, and is treated with the methods of medical cure and this does not bring comfort, then we have resorted to extracting the arteries in the temples, or cauterizing them as we have shown.
And the method of the operation and extraction is that the patient swells the skin which is on the temples; and understand the artery which appears in the temple, because it is shown to you by its pulsation, and is hidden except in a few men due to the intensity of pressure.
And if it is hidden from you, then strengthen the neck of the patient with some cloth; and apply pressure on the spot with a rough cloth or evaporate the spot with hot water until the artery appears manifestly to you. And then take the spatula, which has this form: And then you scrape the bone with that [spatula] with ease until you reach the artery; and then get into it on one side and extract that from the upper parts until you extract that from the bone and discover those tunics which are below it, from all sides.
But if the artery is slender, then you must surround it with the extremity of the oncus, and then incise one side of that according to the quantity by which the extremities of it are lengthened and contracted, and do not allow a flow of blood, for if they are not incised, the blood will not rise at all.
And then evacuate the blood with vinegar. until three.
And if the artery is large, then it is necessary that you divide it into two parts with a double thickness of cedema or with cords at length, and do not allow putrefaction to occur before the consolidation of the wound and prevent blood flow.
And then incise the superfluity which is between two bandages; and do this at that hour or almost another hour.
And if you want, cauterize that with a cauterizer into the bone and cauterize it with a cauterizing knife until the extremities of it are incised, and stay in place for that middle work.
And it is better work if the patient has fever or is in a heated complex; for cauterization is one of those causes that help to finish the final moistures, and therefore it is better in judgment.
And it is necessary to extract the arteries that fill the old wound, and be paused above on decently made powders, and then be cured with dry medicines that make the flesh and with some remedies until it is healed.
And if while you work another time bleeding occurs from the artery, then you must apply yourself to restrain that blood, or with a cauterizer, or what fills the old wound, and strengthen your hand until the blood is restrained. And if no cause of those is present to you, then pause your hand over the spot until the blood is congealed, and envelop the spot with hot water of vehement coldness so that the sharpness rests, and be strengthened according to what is needed.
And what is easier in extracting the artery is that you cauterize the vein with this cauterizer having two handles, because you have marked two spots with a tent, and then put each one aside, entirely burning, so that they reach the bone and cut the vein in two places, in order that it may be lengthened what is between the extremities of it, since they are not consolidated at all with this cauterizer.
And this is the form of the cauterizer:
And the sharpness of the two handles is example. But even if the sharpness is less than two handles, it is better, because if they are as sharp as two handles close to each part and do not cut the flesh with velocity.
Therefore, when there is some thickness in those [handles], it is held that the heat of the fire is in those and the flesh is cut off slightly.
And this work is better than all work and easier.
And the space which is between the two handles is the quantity of the thickness of the said [handle].
Chapter 4.
On the Cure of Eyes Afflicted with Sharp and Acid Tears of the Hidings.
When there are acid tears, and the body of those veins which are above the forehead of the head appear outside, and no cause of medicine brings comfort to this, and the face of the patient is already inflamed and feels like wandering about on its own front, as if it were a procession of ants, and the eyes of that one are exhausted, moistened in such a way that their eyelids are constricted, and the eyelids are scalded by the sharpness of the tears, the ancient physicians mixed in the cure of those with this operation, and called that cure "spassa".
And it is that you command the patient to rub the skin which is on their forehead, and then incise three fissures equally distant on the forehead according to its length. And if the length of the fissure measures two fingerbreadths: one fissure should be equally distant from the length of the nose in the middle of the forehead, and the second according to the length of a small movement of the lacertae which are in the lacrimal, and the third on the other side.
And guard yourself from incising the arteries which are in two sides, and stretch your hand along the continuation of both mandibles. And if the space of each incision is equal to three fingerbreadths adjusted.
And if you have a piece of sponge applied or dry cloths moistened with the blood.
And then insert the spatula of two sharp extremities, the form of which is as follows: which is from the part of the temples to the second incision. Scrape away the entire bone which is between two incisions on the skull, and then make this move into the second incision. And then grasp the spatula and enter into the first incision again with another instrument which is called a cauterizer, sharp on one side and not sharp on the other.
And pause the blade of that cauterizer so as to cut off the flesh attached to the bone, and the blade of it cut into the bone, and fill up that space until it reaches the middle fissure, and cut off all the vessels that descend from the head to the eyes.
But it is necessary to continue the incision up to this point on the bone, and then make this move in the middle fissure into the other fissure.
And when there is a quantity of blood equal to that, express the places of the clots of congealed blood.
And then pause in each fissure a layer of old wound, and pause above those powders imbued with vinegar, oil, and vinegar mixed together, so that there may not be inflamed apostema.
And on the third day loosen the bandage and administer great abundance of hot water or tepid water, and then cure this with ointment based on balsam and rose oil and others until the wounds are healed.
Chapter 5.
On the Cure of Tears by Cataracts and those descending from the outer parts of the head.
When some people have severe cataracts and continuous ones, and their eyes are exhausted small, and the management of theirs is debilitated, and their eyelids ulcerated and with their case their skin, and in the forehead of the head there is a sharp pain leading to exhaustion consequent, then it is necessary for you to know through these accidents that the materials and cataracts do not come from but few veins of the outer parts proceeding.
And the best cure for those is this: that you command the patient to rub their forehead, and then incise a fissure in the middle of the forehead, a little bit longer (and starting from the left temple into the right temple; and be incised into the bone; and stretch your hand from the lacertae of the temples which are opposite to the mastication), until the bone is revealed.
Dry up all the blood with sponge or dry cloth, and then fill in between the two lips of the incision with old wound or with cloths soaked in it. And then strengthen above on those powders imbued with vinegar and oil, so that there may not be inflamed apostema.
And when you have done this and see that the apostema is already diminished, then it is necessary to cauterize the bone until it begins to show flesh, and then cure that with an emplastic remedy which makes the flesh come out, just as if you took two parts of wheat flour and four parts of colophony and mixed them together, and from this made a poultice and administered it in these wounds at the time of natural birth.
Chapter 6.
On the Cure of that which is in the Ears.
All the causes that are in the ears are one of four species, for either it is a mineral pyrrhus or a similar cause like iron and lead, or it is from a plant like cypress or fava, or it is a fluxible cause like water and vinegar mixed together with their similitudes, or some animal.
And therefore when pyrrhus catz in the ear or another cause similar to those causes that do not adjust or believe in the ear, and pause the ear at the sun, and if you times the pyrrhus, then it is necessary to distill into that some cause of violet oil or musk, and then administer the extraction from there, and make the stornutacio to happen according to the conditions, and stop up the nostrils until the event of stornutacio. And then pause in the circuit of the ear some cloths or woolen fabrics, and stretch the ear to the upper parts, because many times it is forgotten with these causes.
And if not forgotten, then administer extraction from there with the instrument called epicyclic gestures, which is as follows:
And if it is forgotten with the gestures, then it is good; and otherwise, then administer the extraction from there with a subtle oncus of little duplication.
And therefore, if not forgotten by that, then make a needle of iron and insert the extremity of the needle into the hole of the ear and seal around the needle with wax and softened oil, in order that nothing but the needle may be left. And then extract from there with your own breath by strong attraction, because many times as we have recounted.
But if not forgotten in this manner, then take from a lamp or from a well-prepared vessel with which birds are caught and obtain a small quantity of it, and place that at the extremity of the ray, and then wrap around that spot decently placed. And then insert that into the hole of the ear with ease, and then dry up the ear from the humidity.
And therefore, if not forgotten by all the causes which we have recounted, then you must take care to cut that before it becomes inflamed or spasmodic.
And the manner of cutting that is: first, you must bleed the patient from the saphena vein and extract the blood according to the virtue of it, and then make that cease between your hands and convert the ear into the upper parts, and finally, make a small incision in the root of the ear opposite to the grey hair of it in the place where it was previously prepared. And the incision should be in the shape of a moon until it reaches the pyrrhus, and when the pyrrhus is blackened, stop that if you can with appropriate instruments; and then close the incision at that hour with speed, and cure that until it is healed.
And if the cause falls in the ear is one of the fat that swells and becomes inflamed, then administer the cure and extraction from there; but if it does not obey your order, then you take a subtle spatula according to this form: and administer to that the removal of that fat which has fallen into the ear.
And do not do this when you think that it has already become humidified by the vapor of the ear, and pause that in many cloths, and then extract from those with onces or with subtle gestures, or by incision as we have said, because it is alleviated the extraction from there.
But in the water which has entered the ear, it is necessary for the patient to use stornutation with conditions at first, and fill their own ear with some old wound, and then place that on top of the ear where the water is, and if forgotten by this, good; and otherwise, take many sharp iron needles and lemons according to the length of the finger, and heat those in the fire for a little while, and then have the patient insert one of those into the hole of their own ear and press upon one side of that partition and strike another needle against the needle which is below the ear. Therefore, do not cease this with a pyrrhus until all the water has been forgotten.
Therefore, do not cease this with a pyrrhus until all the water has been forgotten. And already the water will be forgotten in such a way that you take from paper or from parchment, i.e., and place one extremity of it into the ear and extend the other extremity with fire until the middle of it is burned.
And then place another parchment and do this as many times until all the water is forgotten, and extract that with a needle just as it was said above about the pyrrhus extractor.
But in the extraction of animal matter that enters into that ear, if it is a small amount, just as much and similar to it, cure that just as we have said in the division; but if it is from a large body which appears in the sense of the vertebrae, then administer the extraction of it with gestures and onces, and the cause of it is more lighter than all other causes that fall into the ear.
But in the extraction of worm born in the ear, when you cure that with what we have said in the division and in the treatise on distillations, and do not confirm your cure, then it is necessary for you to look at the ear towards the sun.
And therefore, if any cause of worms appears here, then extract that with gestures or with subtle onces; but if no cause appears, then take a needle, broad and above which this is the form: And then insert the subtle extremity into the ear according to the quantity which can be tolerated by the patient; and then suck on that with strong suction, and do this many times, until all the worms are forgotten.
But if it does not obey your order, then you must plug and close in the circuit of the needle with wax just as we have said; then administer those distillations which the ancients have already tried in the cure of worms, and you will find this in the treatise on distillations.
And then is your effusion with which you pour the medicinal oils into the ear with this instrument, of which this is the form: And make that of silver or of iron, broad and above, with a small hole in it.
And therefore, just as they are driven to that which is in the conquest of the needle's continent, here where it will be necessary. And if you wish, take the reed and wrap it around the extremity of it decently cut, and then pour oil into the concavity of the ear, or the juice of some herb, or whatever you want from these medicines in the needle — and that is in the ear —, and then insert the reed with a cut above and press with your hand that on the medicine in a gentle compression until the oil is expelled into the concavity of the ear and the patient feels the oil outside.
And what is inserted into the ear is already scarred with fire, a little bit. And beware that the cause which you distill into the ear is not too hot, for the medicines of the ear cannot tolerate this.
Chapter 7.
On the Cure of Ear Blockages.
Some times certain children are born with the vents of their mothers not perforated, and this already happens in some men, blockage in the ear canal due to wound or flesh nothing in that; and this blockage sometimes occurs in the forehead of the trauma of the ear which does not consent to the vertebrae, and sometimes it is in the outer parts.
And that which occurs in the forehead of it, which does not comprehend the vertebrae, is in the major difficulties of difficult healing.
And in that which comprehends the vertebrae, it is necessary for you to pause the ear of the patient towards the sun and look at that. And therefore, if there appears an obstruction, open that with a subtle spatula of which this is the form:
If the extremity of it is in the ear where there is a small latitude, with one part sharp and the other not; and the spatula has two lion's claws to prevent any harm to the ear.
And therefore, if the blockage is due to born flesh in the ear or in the ear canal, then extract that with subtle onces and cut that with vehement facility until all the flesh is removed.
And if the blockage is in the forehead of the ear, then take a subtle reed and heat it slightly with fire, and then place that in the ear canal.
And therefore, if you have sensed blockage with what the patient has obtained with facility, by weight of air, press the oppression of it with facility; and beware that you do not harm the nerves of the ear.
And then pause in the ear a cloth of linen according to the quantity of the breadth of the hole which you have wrapped around with Egyptian ointment; and do this for several days until you are sure of the consolidation of the wound, or that you take some water and pour it into aqua and pulverize over it in a sieve and use it; and if at times the ear is already inflamed, then it is necessary to extract the pus and replace it with another pus which you have wrapped around with cerote made from rose oil, until the inflamation subsides; and then cure that until it is healed.
But if there is bleeding, then submerge a sponge or cloth in hot water and pause over the ear, and use another cure that constricts the flow of blood, which is mentioned in the treatise on distillation.
Chapter 8.
On the Cure of Athazil, which induces to the eyelids.
Athazil, which induces to the eyelids of men and women, sometimes is moist, at other times it is dry.
Therefore, it is necessary for you to take those with tenhallahs or onces, and cut them with the spatula of their roots, and then pause over the places sifted.
But if pain with bleeding comes, then you must cauterize those with a subtle cauterizer lunar.
And the best cauterization is when you apply it to the incisions and many times they return when there remains some cause of their roots; and when they are cauterized with fire, those roots are burned and do not return.
Chapter 9.
Cure of Grandeysssa which comes to the eyelids of men.
Many times it develops in the eyelids of men some cause which is assimilated to grandness in its strength and hardness, and therefore it is called grandeysssa.
And it is an aggregation of thick moisture in the eyelid below and above.
Therefore, the operation in them is that you consider whether the grandeysssa proceeds from there in what appears from the eyelid and is made to all parts; and the cause of it is light.
Therefore, make an incision above that with a small latitude, and then search for all parts of it with facility until it is evacuated, and then suspend it with a needle and cut it.
And if the figure is great, then you must adjust it with a suture; and cure that until it is healed.
And if it is little, you will not suffer harm from that because the agent of it restores that and embodies.
And if the grandeysssa is declining to the outer parts of the eyelid, then you must remove the surface outwardly, then ease the eyelid and suspend the grandeysssa with a needle, unless you need an incision, and press that in all parts; and if the eyelid by incision is lengthened, this will not help in any cause.
And then wash the eye with salted water; and cure that place with water which embodies until it is healed.
Chapter 10.
On the Cure of Axirnah in the eyelid above the eye.
Axcirnah is a grayish condition which is generated in the tunics of the eyelid above, and most commonly affects children, aggravating their eyes and causing them to weep; and they cannot gaze at the brightness of the sun because tears are shed upon them.
And for this reason you should often wash their faces, and sleep on their faces; and thus the humid upper eyelids, which have already covered with inflammation, are in imminent danger of appearing in the eye; and when you press that place with those drops I mentioned, you will find inflammation within them.
And one method of operation is this: the patient places their own head in the hole, and then pauses a cloth of linen and wool, and makes a cauterize, and makes a circle according to the quantity which contains arthernach from all parts; and then pauses that over that place and presses with those drops I mentioned throughout so that inflammation is aggregated in the middle of the circle; and then makes an incision in the middle of that moisture with a spatula having a fissure by latitude, and the fissure should not be greater than the one made in flabotomia.
But in the forehead it is necessary for you to cut the cord entirely until you reach arthernach, because in the most difficult situations arthernach proceeds through a fissure according to the form of white grey.
Therefore, extract that with cloths which you have wrapped around between the eyelids and the outer parts, and revolve between your right and left hands until it is dispersed.
And beware that you do not adjust in the fissure, lest with the spatula you may not reach the eye and cause it to be damaged.
But if you do not see arthernach at the beginning of the fissure, but rather that you adjust in the fissure a little with facility until arthernach processes; and then extract that just as we have said; and then submerge cloths of linen in water and vinegar and pause them over the place and strengthen those with powders.
And thus some that are troubled by salt, pause it in the concavity of the fissure because this which remains of that moisture.
And then cure that until it is healed.
But if there is apostema in the place cautious, then cure that with gentle poultices until it is healed.
Chapter 11.
On Methods of Touching the Eye.
When in the eyelids of men, there are those which are natural and so ancient, then those no longer belong to the eye and cause endearment methods of maladies such as constant tears and softening of eyelids and skin, until this becomes a cause of destruction of the eye that is called touching the eye, and it cures in four ways: or by cauterization with fire; or by acute medicine according to what is said before in the chapter on cauterization; or by atactini through incision and suture; or by cannas as I will say.
And therefore it is necessary for you to pause the patient's head in the hole; then convert the eyelid of the eye with your left hand, and if it is converted, good it is; and if not, insert an agulha into that in which there is a thread from the outer part of the eyelid, and make the agulha penetrate with the thread above, and thus - right next to the edge of the eyelid where the hair is - next to the hairs, and pull the thread upwards with the palpebra, and convert it with the ray.
And then make an incision in the outer part of the eyelid below the hairs with a spatula inscident of the lacrimal major into the lacrimal minor; and then extract the thread and pause below the eyelid with small powders of cotton or cloth, and then send [it] over the eyelid with a tent, and be like a figure of mirth.
But nonetheless it is necessary that the figure be according to the quantity of elevation of the eyelid, for this is already diversified in men, for some are those which require that a great quantity be incised from the eyelid, according to the quantity by which the eyelid is softened.
And then make an incision with the spatula on both lines which you have marked, and begin from the lacrimal major into the lacrimal minor. And if your incision is right next to the natural hairs like it is the thickness of a king.
And then place the needle in one of the two angles of the cord, and then excise that entirely, and then adjust with the incision the two lips with a subtle wool thread or a fine thread, and wipe away the blood, and make what is superfluous from the threads adhere to two upper eyelids with some causes that are visible, if you wish to do so, and if not, do not cure.
And then loosen the suture of the threads within three or four days, and then cure that.
And if you wish, leave the wound open and cure that with what dries and strengthens, for the eyelid is raised because of the closure of the wound and the aggregation of pus; but suture is better. And thus I say so to the ancients of touching.
But meanwhile there is solicitude over the patient, and it is a good operation, and not in haste.
And it is another method in touching, and it is that you mark on the eyelid a figure like a bunch of myrtle, and then lift the eyelid with three unguents separated and gathered according to this form:
But if it is not possible to have the unguents, and this is not equated, then take a needle with thread and insert it in the middle of the figure, and enter one end into the lacrimal major and the other end into the lacrimal minor, and adjust between the two eyelids the threads with equality, and then raise your hand with equal elevation, lift all the cord above which is marked as we have recounted.
And then adjust the two lips of the wound with suture, and cure that until it is healed.
But if apostema occurs because of your incision or your wound, cover that apostema with cerote and lukewarm water, and with unguents.
And sometimes the eyelid becomes converted to its own hairs, then it is necessary for you to use in that what we have said about incision; but suture in all cases is more artificial.
Atactini by cannas is according to this form: and it is that you convert the eyelid and cut out the figure which is below, according to what I have recounted; and then by art make two cannas or two subtle astals of which the length is according to the length of the eyelid and the latitude of them is less than the latitude of the spatula. And you have already incised in the extremities of each part, where you have the threads.
And then add each one with subtlety over what is superfluous from the eyelid of the eye, and constrain the cannas of each part with a very tight stricture, and leave that for some days, because the cord will die and be rejected and will dissolve into nothingness until it falls away by itself.
But if it is delayed, then tear it off with the tweezers, and then cure the wound until it is healed.
Therefore, when it is solidified, the eyelid is elevated and the hairs do not prick.
And this is the form of two cannas which you will make according to this form: and has the quantity of length and latitude neither more nor less.
Chapter 12.
On the Elevation of Pricking Hairs in the Eye with a Needle when the Hair is Hard.
When the hairs are unnatural, hard and rough, and prick the eyes, then the operation in this case is that you take a subtle needle and insert it into that thread of subtle silk and lion, and then adjust the extremities of it and notice each one in a very subtle manner. And the length of the threads should be of the quantity of one palm.
And then you compose another subtle thread below it in brief, and unite the extremities of that if you wish.
And then place the patient's head in the hole, and be right next to the sun so that your work is declared, for it is a subtle and minute operation.
And then insert the needle into the root of the hair adjusted as needed with skill, and make it penetrate the eyelid swiftly until you extract it above the natural hair.
And then pull out the hair until it is above and insert it into the alligator's mouth, and be the hairs one, two, or three, but not more.
And then pull your hand away with that until the hair is pulled out with the alligator's mouth in the eyelid above the natural hair.
But if the alligator is attracted and does not pull out the hair, then attract the alligator to the parts below with the thread which you have composed there, until it pulls out the alligator from above.
And then look at that with the vision of the eye, for you will pull out the alligator and the thread, and gnaw each one and claw the eye, and leave the claws for two or three days, until the hair adheres to its place and grows over that good flesh.
And if the hair is too short, then you adjust a longer hair from the natural hairs, and it is elevated with that, or let it lie until it is lengthened to the space, and then you elevate that.
Chapter 13.
On the Cure of Echachatier which appears on the eyelid above.
When it appears on the eyelid echachatir, and it is contraction of the eyelid when it is contracted in itself, or to the right or left part, due to bad consolidation of wound or section or cauterization, and it is called leporina, and this echachatier is either natural or accidental, and it is caused by consolidation of wound or sections or cauterizations, or by resemblance to their maladies.
The method of the operation in this case is that you cut through that consolidation and separate the lips of it, and insert into it a piece of linen cloth, and tie those together until they are healed.
And it is not necessary for you to use any cure of it from the causes that dry and constrict; because if you do so, the echachatier will return worse than it was at first.
Use in that case a cause that softens, such as fenugreek, and enclose it with the water in which they are cooked, or an ointment of aquilon, which is liquefied with some oils, and submerge the cloth in that, and cure with that.
And the treasure of your cure is that you pierce through all that which is not consolidated according to the form that it had at the beginning.
And this operation which we have discussed is only some correction of echachatier that does not return to its original form as it was before.
Chapter 14.
On the Cure of Echachatier which is made in the eyelid below.
This echachatier which is made in the eyelid below, which is truly called echachatier; and it is either a natural one or an accidental one.
But the accidental one is made by wound, section, or cauterization, or by other similar things.
And the way of the operation is that you take a needle with double thread, and insert it into the flesh, and make it pass from the left lacrimal to the right lacrimal, until the thread reaches both ends of the flesh.
And then extend the flesh to the parts above with the needle and cut it with the needle, and incise it with a spatula wide. And then if the figure of the eyelid returns as it should, good it is; and otherwise, take the thread and pause it in the cut figure, and with that convert the eyelid, and close the two incisions on the side of the eyelid below.
And be the extremities of the two incisions at two angles of the incision, which you have made so that they converge, and be the formed angle when they come together, so that it forms a figure of theirs.
And this figure is the Greek letter: lambda.
And then stop the flesh there for the quantity that is the side of it, above the eyelid.
And then adjust the separated parts and sew them with wool thread; and then cure those with what we have said of softening medicines and poultices until it is healed.
And if echachatier occurs due to incision or suture or cauterization, then it is necessary for you to make a flat incision on the eyelashes of the eyelid as described previously. And then separate with a poultice between two lips as we have said.
In the summary of the sermon on the cure of echachatier when it is above or below, that which runs in its operation, according to the preparation of the form of echachatier, and that is in the form of various moths.
And the skilled craftsmen always prepare skillfully in each manner that is possible at that time, so as to make the figure return to its natural form or almost so, and that malady according to what is convenient for the operation and the instruments in the greatest disposition.
Chapter 15.
On the Adhesion of the Eyelid to the Conjunctiva or Cornea.
When this consolidation occurs in some men, it is necessary to solidify the eyelid more above the white of the eye, and be forbidden by the ease of movement and its natural works, therefore you must enter into the extremity of the ray below the eyelid, and lift that up or extend it with an instrument.
And then you incise the adhesion with a spatula that is not sharp, having only a small obtuseness so that the malady is not disturbed by the operation, and leave the spatula so as not to scrape the eye with its sharpness.
And be your incision such that it easily excises that adhesion, so that the eyelid is returned to its natural form and all the adhesion is healed.
And then you put in the eye salty water which you wash with, or distill into it the juice of juniper dissolved in water.
And then separate between the eyelid and the eye with a poultice of linen, and place it on the eye wool infused in album of hen, and then use for three days causes that consolidate until it is healed.
Chapter 16.
On the Incision of the Eyelid and Eminence of Flesh of the Lacrimal.
Know that the eyelid is according to two manners, because either it is nervous, and is similar to a hard, subtle cypress; or it is non-nervous, resembling white congealed humidity, which when iron touches it, or it is forced to take on a certain shape, is abscessed and the shape is not fixed in that place.
And both species do not begin until the lacrimal major, which gradually becomes smaller and covers the eye, prohibiting light and movement of the eye.
But the method of operating in this case is that the malady puts its head into the hole, and then you open the eyes of it, lift the eyelid with your hand, and then collect the eyelid with a small amount of doubling and extend it to the upper parts. And then take a needle and enter into it a piece of horse or oxen or cow's hair, or something similar, or a strong thread, or double the end of the needle little by little and place it in the middle of the eyelid, and penetrate it with the needle, and tie the eyelid with a thread; and extend it to the upper parts, and excise on the side of the eyelid which covers the pupil. And thus you follow that with the hair until the end of it.
And then you incise the remainder in the root of the lacrimal with a subtle spatula or small forceps, and let go of the natural flesh of the lacrimal so that by the incision of it there is no continuous flow of tears.
And in some cases the eyelid with its stretched thread or wire, as we have said, and then it is excised with a spatula, the form of which is this:
And beware that with the spatula you do not touch the corneal tunic and that there is a rupture in it, and that the pupil is perforated.
And then the incision gets in the eye a little bit of crushed salt or of sulfur made to sinew, and let it stay until the next day; and then cure that with what is necessary so that it heals.
And if the eyelid is not nervous and you cannot insert the needle, nor is it taken by the thread, then many times this species of eyelid is cured with medicines, and is healed in this way as you will see and be recounted in the division.
And if you want to incise it, then you work on the eye of the malady and take a subtle spatula, the form of which is this: with subtlety. And if at times it is rarefied and is congealed and filled with pus, then you distill from your eye some juice made of sulfur or of rosin or of crushed salt, and anoint the eye until the next day.
And then iterate on that the operation until everything that is of it is removed, except that the opposite apostema remains in the eye, because you will let it be, and cure at the beginning the apostema until it is healed.
And then repeat your operation on that with reason until it is healed.
The emminence of the lacrimal flesh, if you notice in the eye with great harm, is suspended by a thread; and incise that part of it, and do not complete the incision so that you do not excite flows of tears.
And then distill in the lacrimal some juice made of rosin and sulfur, until it is healed.
Chapter 17.
On the Incision of Algae and Water that is born from adjusted flesh in the eye.
Some times in the eyes of some people is born red flesh, and it is superimposed to cover the pupil, or almost reaches or stretches over the eyelids and strongly compresses the eyelids onto the parts above and is assembled like a rose on a balcony.
But the operation in this case is that the malady puts its head into the hole; and then you open the eyes of it and collect all that flesh with suitable threads or instruments; and then incise the flesh at the beginning until everything is finished with the instrument, and beware of the eye that you do not scrape that away as part of your operation.
And be the incision with which you incise those or with a spatula such as we have recounted in the incision of the eyelid, or with small forceps with which it is collected according to what will come to the form of this chapter.
Therefore, when your incision is completed and all that flesh is removed, then fill the eye with crushed salt, or distill into it red powder resembling corrosive medicines, and place over the eye a poultice made of hen's albumen to ensure against the opposite apostema.
And if there remains any cause of algae and it is lorded over with caution, and you fear the opposite apostema, then let go of the eye and cure that apostema with what relieves that apostema, and then iterate on that with an operation until it is healed, and similarly do in the adjusted flesh which occurs in the eye of this species.
But always be aware that you must remove all cure from the eye with great care through natural or accidental means, using iron, and do not put your hand in any of these operations until you see that member to be sufficient for that operation.
Chapter 18.
On the Collection of Scales in the Eye.
Scales come forth red and rough, which are crusty on the eye and prohibit its operation, and disclose the eye with length of days.
Therefore it is necessary at the beginning that you consider whether the eye in which scales are present is strong and there is no other disease besides scales, then you collect those scales.
And then you command the malady to put its head into the hole, and then suspend those veins with one thread or two according to your prudence; and be that thread of subtle doubling, as follows:
or two threads gradually in one body, according to this form:
And then they are collected with subtle forces, with subtlety, and washed away hour by hour, until you see those veins to be removed from the eye and turned over.
And beware that you do not scrape the eye with the edges of the spatula; and if your operation is in the middle of the day facing the sun, be very firm in your operation so as not to incise anything but those veins.
And when you have completed, then you distill into the eye green or red juice, so that with its acidity it will dissolve what is removed from the scales.
But if that juice is not to your taste, then collect all in that hour, and then apply all the juice that relieves the pain of it, and let it be for some days until the pain of it is settled and assured against the opposite apostema.
And then iterate on that according to the same manner, until it is healed.
And this is the form of the forceps:
Chapter 19.
On the Reduction of Rhinitis to the Nose.
When you cure the rhinitis with cauterization or sharp medicine, as it is preceded by the narration of that and does not heal, then do not operate on it, but rather incise above the apostema until its maturity, and extract all the moisture which is in it and pour it into the bone so that the bone is uncovered.
And therefore, when the bone is uncovered and corruption or blackness appears in it, then you scrape it with an instrument of which this is the form:
And it is called an asperg cap, and it is made of iron in India, and it is the head rounded like a ball, thus with a pointed tip, pierced by a lime or aliskalfati puncture, in a subtle manner (such as shown in the following form).
And then place that on the corrupted part of the bone, and then revolve it between those said points, and press your hand little by little until you know that corruption is removed.
And then it is done some times, and then restore the place with drying and astringent causes.
Therefore, if the place is consolidated and good flesh has grown in it, and the pus-filled abscess has been removed and there have been no accidents or relapses for 40 days, and there has been no apostema or accident occurring in it, then you know that it is healed.
And if not, then it is not in place to operate, but rather to reduce the fissure to the form of the nose, and according to this manner: and thus you uncover the second bone with iron or sharp medicine, and when the bone is uncovered, then you take a thread according to this form:
The extremity of the iron should be triangular, and the stem of it should be first attenuated up to the extremity, thus with three times.
And then place that on the bone, and be that close to the lacrimal; and stretch your hand a little bit further into the eye, and then revolve your hand with the thread until it penetrates all the bone, and that feels the malady by which it finds that something must come out from there when you pull it.
Therefore, then restore the place with astringent and drying medicines, just as if they were to be applied.
Therefore, since the flesh and the place is hardened, then the material which flowed to the parts above returns to the nose, therefore it is easier on the malady.
Chapter 20.
On the Reduction of the Eminence of the Eye.
When the eye protrudes in its entirety and there is no harm or diminution in the operation, then you must loosen the malady, and then follow, and then pause at intervals with gentle blows on the back without scarification, and suck for good suction; and then place a poultice on the eye made of acacia and aloe and gall and sarcocolla, and then strengthen the emplaustre over the eye with many powders.
And the manner of the powders is that you take four pieces of lion's mane cloth, and each piece is doubled into four folds; and make from those.
And then place those one on top of the other according to the quantity that the eye needs. And then strengthen on top of those with a cloth that is durable and has a strong stricture; and iterate the poultices with suction without scarification; and then stop the poultices and let the eye be tight day and night.
But if meanwhile the ligament is softened, then it is necessary that it be very tight.
And then stop the ligament at day and night just as we have said.
And if the eye has already been reduced, that is good; and otherwise, then iterate the poultice with powders, stricture, and suction until it is healed.
Chapter 21.
On the Incision of the Eminence of the Uveal Tunic.
When there is an eruption in the uveal tunic and it bulges out and proceeds beyond the eyelids like a grain of raisin, and its shape is that of a man through this, and you wish to incise it, then the operation in this case is done as we have recounted, that you insert the needle into the root of the uvea on the side left and above, and then place another needle in which is double-thread from the part of the lacrimal, and make that penetrate and let the first needle follow according to its disposition; and then incise the location of the double thread and lift up with that the part of the uvea in the circuit of the needle, and strengthen that firmly.
And then extract the needle and place on the eye wool infused in hen's albumen and let it be until the thread falls off with the uvea.
And then cure the eye with that which comforts it, so that the wound is healed.
And then gather from all parts with a circle of cloth around the eye adjusted to its great eminence, and be that perforated with a subtle spatula which comes before the eye, and flow the humectant albumen, and descend the eye and go in at once.
And then strengthen until it is healed.
Chapter 22.
On the Cure of Alconatis.
This disease which is called alconati is nothing more than pus that is lodged in the eye, resembling descending water and not being that.
But the manner of working on it is that you make the malady settle on the prepared and straight bed, and then take your own head in both parts and lift it up until you see the pus coming to the left side, and then be dried and not descend, and be stopped from flowing, and let the malady behold the causes just as it beholds.
And if it does not flow down, you know that it is water.
But if the descent of the pus is not prepared with water as we have said, then make the malady settle between your fingers and take a subtle spatula and pierce it over the pannicle, leaving a small portion to continue the conjunctiva with the tunic cornea in the crown (in the place where it should be), until the pus is forgotten.
Therefore, when it is forgotten, then you distill into the eye water that flows in which you have mixed honey with water in which you have already built fenugreek and honey.
And then be cured by other causes until it is healed.
Chapter 22. (again, since there was no new chapter number)
On the Cure of Water Descending from the Eye.
We have already said the species of water in the division and which ones are suitable to pierce with the spatula, then do that according to health.
Then it is necessary that you make the malady settle between your fingers on a cloth and tie your own eye tightly.
And then place your right hand near the eyelid of your own eye, if the eye with water is the left one; or with your left hand, if it is the right one.
And then with your left hand take alumina, if the eye is left; or with your right hand, if it is right.
And then place the extremity of alumina near the crown by the thickness of the ray in the album of the eye from the smaller lacrimal part, and then press alumina with force and revolve your hand with it.
And then penetrate into the album of the eye and feel that alumina has already reached its intended place.
And it is necessary that the measure of the path of alumina to its destination be the same as the measure of space which is from the pupil to the end of the blackness, and it is the crown of the eye; because you will see with it the pupil with the vision of the eye through the clarity of the tunic cornea.
And then place alumina in the location where the water is, and then draw it down once or twice, and thus if the water descends at once, you will see the malady above which bears its vision at once, and alumina in your own eye.
And then pause for a moment; thus if the water has descended, you will deposit that other time before alumina is dropped.
And then when it is dry and does not descend, you will extract alumina with ease, and revolve with it your hand little by little, and then dissolve in the water a small amount of clear salt from gemstone and wash the eye outward; and then pause outside the eye, cutting or stopping or infusing wool in red oil and albumen of hen's milk, and bind with water the eye socket.
But we and those of our time pause over that which is torn apart with albumen of hen's milk.
And if it does not obey your alumina at the instrument of the eye by its hardness - for it is one of the men whose eye is very hard -, then it is necessary that you take the spatula which is called alberid, and this is its form:
And then pierce with it that conjuncture, and do not withdraw your hand from the wound, and do not be so that you make a way to alumina's subtle location.
And then introduce alumina according to what we have said.
And you should complete your work, be prepared for the sleeping malady's descent made in which it will sleep on its back in a dark house, and be forbidden from all movements.
And pause in the nature of that water so that its nature is aligned, and do not bother your head to the right or left side at all.
And be the ligature according to its disposition within three days.
And then release that in a more dark and profound manner, and express the very clear vision, and make it see some causes, and then return the ligature within seven days.
And do not need to do this in the hour of cures or soon after infusion. They have need that you take care of this because the water flows more slowly due to great and vehement regard.
But if an abscess arises, then it is necessary that you release the eye before seven days, and correct that with water which relieves the abscess.
Then you will absolve the sight of it and pause on the face of the mouth for that which regulates the downward movement of it for some days, existing in the most dark.
And then be gotten rid of from that great degree and converted into its causes.
And know that the disciple is not exempt from vision some times, and then you should be bold on the operation.
And now it has come to us from some of those who are at the Artach, and some have said that a fire is made in the Ayrac, mighty pierced with which the water is sucked.
But however, I do not see anything so perfect in our land which has been pierced with water, nor have I read it in some of the books of the ancients; and it is possible that this may be new.
And these are the forms of the species of magdaan by which it is above those who ignore those:
And they are made of iron or copper properly, and are the extremities of them like this subtle triangular shape, the sharp extremity thus as it is the form.
Chapter 24.
On the Cure of Corneal Nodules on the Nose.
When on the nose are born diverse corneous nodules of which some cause is assembled to that of scorpio's weight or polyp's peel; and this disease is called polypus because it resembles that of a peel. And from it comes cancerous flesh, lapidary, of dark color; and from it comes lion's flesh not of dark color.
Then in that which is in these lion's flesh not fraudulent nor cancerous, it is necessary to make the malady settle between your fingers and place it at the sun, and pour out its contents on those flesh. And then extract that from the parts above, and then incise with it what you have comprehended of those with a sharp spatula from one part until you know that all the flesh is removed; for if there remains some cause by which abscess is possible, then you will ratify this with one of the subtle instruments with ease so that no cause remains. But if bleeding occurs or an abscess arises suddenly, then you must pause at that which is necessary; or it is one of the malignant abscesses, then you will cut and cauterize that until blood is absorbed and all cavities are removed.
And then be gotten rid of from the nose with the incision, whether it is water or not. But if the nose is obstructed and moisture proceeds from it into the palate, then you will know that it has already been cured.
But if the moisture does not penetrate as it should, then you will know that behind it is a carnoous substance in the superciliary bones of the nose to which abscess has not been applied.
Then it is necessary that you introduce faithfully the ligature to which some thickness belongs, and noise in it makes noises, and pause between each noise the quantity of the said or not, and engender the malady and introduce one extremity of the ligature into the nose with the ray or with another cause which is possible.
And when this is done, draw your own odorant into it so that it reaches the canals of the nose, and be situated above the same glabella, for many times the appearance of this action makes children laugh at school, and it is a light cause to one who wants to do it.
And then pause the two extremities of the ligature, one extremity that protrudes above the nose and the other that remains in the nose, and then administer a suture of flesh with the noises that are in the ligature, and do this until you know that the flesh is already attached to the noises of the ligature.
And then extract the ligature, and pause in the nose about the abstraction of blood for one week, and do this for three days or more until the scab is completely formed from the remaining flesh.
And then in the end of the cause, pause in the nose a lead cannula for several days until it is healed.
But if you degenerate from cure that exists, use this one.
And this is the form of the instrument maker of cappurging which oils and medicines are distilled in the nose:
And make this of silver or copper, which is similar to a small lamp opened, like a small shell, and the mouth similarly.
And if you want, make a closed cannula like a reed, and the cannula of the instrument maker of cappurging to be flat, uncovered; at which is attached in the back of it, with which you hold that when it is soaked in oil or water that you want from the juices and susceptible causes.
Chapter 25.
On the Natural Warts on the Extremities of the Nose.
Many times is natural warts on the extremities of the nose, and it is magnified and swollen in several days until the wound is large enough to be seen.
And therefore it is necessary that you incise that in the beginning of its appearance, and eradicate all that. And then pause over the place or cauterize or apply medicine which is present at that location.
But if the incision is delayed until it becomes magnified, then consider whether it is lapidated, hard, of dark color and little sensation, then do not touch that with iron because it is a cancerous abscess; for many times to one who incises this abscess, great malice is directed against him on account of which he had done.
And if the abscess is of lion's tooth and not of dark color, and when incision is possible in all that, then evacuate the malady and incise that without fear, and cure the place with what exists and constrain into being healed.
Chapter 26.
On the Suture of the Nose and Lips and Ears when Continuity is Dissolved by Wound or Similarities.
Know that when solution of continuity occurs in one of these cartilages, little confidence is given to that operation except in some men.
Then it is necessary, when you find any of those causes, to consider if it is a fresh wound with its own blood, and then you will adjust the two lips of the wound with suture, and then cure that until it is healed.
And if the lips of the solution of continuity are already separated and each is made healthy, then it is necessary that you excise each part of its own corded appearance until blood comes out. And then adjust the two lips with suture and strengthen those, and on top of them powder blood of dragon and mixed tisane, and pause over the powder a paste of emplastrum diaphanicon or of some other consolidated plasters, and leave that tied for two days or three, and then release that and replace it with another plaster and leave that until the flesh is completely absorbed, and then cure with scabbing until it is healed.
But the manner of suture is that you add the solution of continuity with threads or needles as we have recounted in the suture of the belly, or add the solution of continuity with ligature just like yours and make it known.
Chapter 27.
On the Extraction of those causes that come in the two lips in the back parts.
Many times it happens to many men in the back parts of their own lips that some hard and stubborn abscesses appear like grubs of errors, and some are smaller and some are larger.
Then it is necessary that you convert the lips and holes each of those hardnesses from all parts, and then fill the place with sagacious tisane until the blood is restrained, and then be washed with juice and be cured at the location with water that is stiptic, until it is healed.
Chapter 28.
On the Incision of the flesh adjusted in the Gingiva.
Great many times nay upon the gum flesh adjusted which the ancients called albulus, therefore it is necessary that you suspend that with one or that you hold that with forceps and incise that as it should be done, and let the blood run or flow.
And then pause over the place with sagacious tisane or other powders that are stiptic or excitatory.
And if that flesh returns, then incise it secondarily, and cauterize it, for then the cauterization will not return.
Chapter 29.
On the Reason of Teeth with Iron.
When on the surface of the teeth in the back parts and those of the front and between the gums are adjusted rough, sharp, and some are blackened and are made citrine or green so that to the gum it goes through corruption and the teeth are made weak.
And therefore it is necessary that you make the malady settle between your fingers and pause at the head of it in your own seat, and extract the teeth in which those roughnesses and causes appear like sand until there remains no cause from them, and thus remove the blackness and citrinousness and other imperfections so that they are purified.
Therefore if this is the outcome that is in those of the beginning of the reason, good; and otherwise, then you will iterate the reason over them on the second day and on the third day until it comes to the final statement as you want.
And know that teeth have required many receptacles of diverse forms and figures according to how it is prepared for your operation. And therefore because the receptacles with which the tooth is removed from the back part are different from those with which it is extracted between the teeth according to other forms, and these forms of receptacles should be prepared by you as you will soon see:
Chapter 30.
On the Extraction of Teeth.
Take care that you extract the tooth from its pain with all gentleness and quietness in the whole extraction of it, for there is no cause that should precede the removal of it when it is extracted, for it is a subtle substance into which it is excused in the extraction of it.
But when the malady is firmly seated in that tooth to be extracted, then you must be certain which tooth is the one that hurts, for many times pain deceives the malady and takes it to be in a healthy tooth, and you extract that one and then the pain does not cease until the sick tooth is extracted, for we have already seen this through the operation of barbers.
Therefore, when you are certain which tooth hurts, and what you know well, then it is necessary that you scrape in the circuit of the tooth with a spatula in which there is some virtue, until it is dissolved from the tooth to the gum on all sides, and then extract it with those same said instruments or with fine forceps little by little until it comes out.
And then take hold of it with strong forceps that are good for speaking or extraction, and pause the head of the malady between your fingers which will keep it from hurting, and then extract the tooth according to straightness in manner so as not to break it, nor give the major malady greater pain.
And therefore if it is not forgotten, then take one of those instruments and place it alongside the tooth on all sides with facility and effort the removal of it just as it was done at the beginning.
But if the tooth is cracked or corroded, then it is necessary that you complete with cloth that crack and strengthen it with the extremity of a subtle thread so that it will not be torn in the hour of your constriction upon it as you hold it.
And it is necessary that you work with great care and gentleness in the circuit of all parts of the gum, and guard your strength so as not to break it and leave a part of it behind, and return upon the malady through the malice which is greater than the first pain of it.
And be careful that you do not do what some ignorant barbers do in their haste and audacity over the extraction of theirs, without administering what we have recommended; for many times they bring upon men great maladies which are more difficult to extract than they should be, and the roots of their mouths become all inflamed or some of those or that you extract with some bones of the jawbone just as many times we have testified.
And then the extraction of it should be washed with mouth with vinegar or juice and salt.
And if it happens that fluxes of blood appear in this way, just as many times happen, then take some quantity of egg white and sprinkle it over the wound, and if you do not find that egg white to be effective, then cauterize.
The shape of the forceps and fine tongs with which the tooth is extracted at the beginning should be of long extremity, short handle and thick, in order that they may not bend when you must work with them.
And be just like times of thick handle in order that when you strain with those they may not bend, and be short extremities.
And be made of Indian iron with descending shape and triple extremities, and in the extremities of those some teeth are placed one within another and strain through construction descent force, and sometimes the extremities of those take the form of a bird's beak called ciconia, so it is guarded, and they are of strong constriction.
Chapter 31.
On the Extraction of Teeth and Removal of Bones from Mandibles Broken.
When you must extract a tooth that is broken into several pieces, then it is necessary that you pause over the location with border for one day or two until the location is softened; and then introduce gentle or fine tongs, whose extremities are assembled like the beak of a bird called ciconia or guanta, in the shape of the forceps:
Their extremities are made backwards just like a file or an alabaster.
And if you do not obey to your eye with these forceps or tongs, then it is necessary that you cut over the root and remove all the flesh and introduce the instrument which has the name of atali, which is a small lever whose form is this:
And it should be of short extremity, thick and small, and not be enveloped in such a way that it is bent.
Therefore, if because of this the root is forgotten, good; and otherwise, help yourself with these other instruments whose forms are as follows: the form of the first instrument is a triangular extremity in which there is some thickness:
The form of the second instrument is that it should be triangular and with a more subtle extremity.
And then you will help yourself with this instrument having two rams, one of which is the form following: and with other instruments which will be mentioned in the extraction of teeth; for afterwards it is made with this instrument which is assembled with great once, and this is the form:
of a triangular extremity bent or short, which has some thickness, and is not enveloped in such a way that it is bent.
And other know that the instruments of teeth are many and similar to one another.
But the skilled and subtle artisans in the art find for themselves according to this what the operation means and the various illnesses; for they are of illnesses to which the ancients did not say nor pause proper instruments, by the forms of diverse species.
But if the bone of the mandible or of the other bones of the mouth is broken or splintered, then it is necessary that there be great care taken over that in its place where it is suitable for the instruments and forceps which we have mentioned in the extraction of the roots of teeth, and help yourself with gestures of which this is the form:
And be of some thickness little by little, and be wrapped or held in the mouth so that it does not escape or flee until the bone is completely forgotten; and then restore the location with suitable medicines for this.
But if there is a small splinter in the bone, then extract that from that splinter and its blackness, and cure that until it is healed.
Chapter 32.
On the Cure of Teeth Elevated above Others.
When teeth are elevated and not according to their natural form, and especially when it happens to women, and especially to venerable elderly women; therefore it is necessary that you consider: if a tooth is too close to another tooth, and it is not possible to suture or bind it with ligament, then extract that one; but if it is not joined to another tooth, then cut into that one with this instrument whose form is as follows; and it is similar to the jawbone of a pig, and is made of Indian iron with an extremely sharp extremity.
And it should be your incision with which you will cut into that one over a period of several days due to the hardness of the tooth, and that it should not be like another tooth.
And if an elevated tooth is exposed to decay, then grind that one with a file of Indian iron whose form is as follows:
And it should be entirely of Indian iron and with an edge well-made; and it should be with many small points just like a file with which needles are made, with which the tooth is ground little by little over several days in ease, so that no other tooth becomes deformed and decayed. And then line up that one at the end, and cut off that one with some razors.
And if it is a tooth whose part is broken and irritates the tongue, then it is necessary that you grind down that one until the sharpness of that fracture is removed and equalized, and be filled so that the tongue does not irritate nor the word become corrupted.
Chapter 33.
On the Restoration of Damaged Teeth with Gold or Silver Fillings.
When accidents occur to teeth before concussion and removal through percussion or chance, and the patient cannot endure over what is left, and you have cured that one with stiptic medicines, but your cure has not been effective, then it is necessary for the reason that they do not decay to be strengthened with a gold filling and not silver, because silver becomes green and soon turns black, whereas gold is never changed.
And the filling should be in such subtlety and thickness according to the quantity that can enter between the teeth; and the form of the receipt is that you take the filling and take twice its amount between two healthy teeth, and then increase it by two bends of the filling between two damaged ones, or one or several, until the fabric reaches the healthy tooth on the other side. And then repeat the process between the party from which you began, and strengthen your work with ease and wisdom until it is not damaged.
And then take a strong hold of the filling which you should strengthen the roots of the teeth so that they do not escape.
And then cut off the superfluous extremities of the filling with forceps or pincers, and add those to each location by gesture, and convert them and conceal them between the healthy tooth and the damaged one, so that they do not cause injury to the tongue. And then let it be as straight as possible.
But if it is loose or broken, strengthen that one or those with another filling in such a way at all times.
And this is the form of the teeth and figure of the restoration of two healthy teeth and two damaged ones, just as these are linked:
And when one returns or two return to their places, and are rejuvenated just as we have described, and remain.
And this is done only by good artisans and wise ones.
And sometimes it is suitable for some cause of cow bones, and it is made from them as the shape of a tooth, and it is placed in a location where the tooth falls out, and it is strengthened just as we have said, and remains and serves that one for a long time.
Chapter 34.
On the Cutting of the Ligament which is found in the Tongue and prohibits Speech.
This ligament which is found behind the tongue sometimes or is natural to it which one has, or accidental and occurs by a wound which is already consolidated.
And the operation in that is that you open the mouth of the patient, and lift his tongue which exists in his own seat; and then cut into that ligament nerve according to its latitude until the tongue is released from its recent recency.
But if in that is some hardness or knotting, and this is due to the consolidation of the wound, then you must cut into it with a knife and divide it according to its latitude until you have divided the ligament and dissolved the knot.
And beware that no fissure is made in the flesh of the patient, and that you do not cut too deeply and cause a flow of blood.
And then wash the vestige of the incision with warm water or with vinegar and water, and then pause and leave the tongue to lie down; this is the way that the patient should hold his tongue in each night so that it will not consolidate again.
But if a flow of blood occurs, pause over the location with a bandage pressed; but if the blood flows out, then it is necessary to cauterize the location with a cauterizing iron which is suitable for this. And then treat that one with the other causes until it is healed.
Chapter 35.
On the Extraction of a Ranula beneath the Tongue.
Sometimes beneath the tongue, an aposteme forms resembling a small tumor that prevents the tongue from performing its natural function; and it grows so large that it fills up the mouth.
And the operation in this is that you open the patient's mouth and examine the aposteme in the light of day, considering it carefully.
And if you see that it is a yellow or black, hard, and the patient does not feel any sensation, then do not touch it, for it is gangrenous.
And if it is whitened and has moisture, then you should place the once in it, and cut into that with a fine spatula, and cut it off completely; and if blood flows out during your operation, then pause over it with a bandage pressed, so as to stop the bleeding.
And then return to your work so that you have treated it with the complement of it, so that it is washed with vinegar and salt; and cure that one with the other cure in a similar way until it is healed.
Chapter 36.
On the Extraction of Apostemes from both Ears and that which is nothing in the Golauro and other Apostemes.
When there is a growth in the Golauro which is nothing, so that the glands which are assembled together become swollen, which swells out and are called two ears, which when you cure them with what we have said in the division and it does not heal, then you should consider if the aposteme is hard, yellow-colored, without sensation, then do not touch it with iron.
And if it is red-colored and the root is thick, then do not touch it with iron because of the flow of blood; before that, let it be mature, and then either you will break it or it will break itself.
And if it is white-colored, rounded, and the root of it is subtle, then that one should be cut.
And the operation in this is that you consider beforehand your operation whether the aposteme has already settled or if it is diminished by some diminution; and then make the patient sit before the sun, with his head in its proper place, and open his mouth, and take hold of his tongue with an instrument very noble of which this is the form:
And it should be made of silver or iron, and be as subtle as a knife.
Then when you take hold of that tongue and the aposteme is shown to you, and you cut above it with the same veil, then take a once and place it in the amnella, and pull it out to the outside parts as much as you can. Or another thing that pulls some cause of the tunics, and then cut into it with an instrument of which this is the form:
Or another thing that pulls some cause of the tunics, and then cut into it with an instrument of which this is the form: and it is assembled with forceps, however the extremities of it are curved, so that the orifice of each of those is in the end of another, very sharp, made of Indian iron enveloped.
But if this instrument is not with you, then cut into it with a spatula of which this is the form of it: And be sharp on one side, not sharp on the other side.
And then, after you have cut into one notch, cut into the other one in this same manner of cutting, and then let the patient gargle with vinegar water.
But if there is bleeding, let the patient gargle with water decoction of scorsa of myrrh or fern of mirta and similar to those stiptic causes until the bleeding flux is stopped, and then cure that one until it is healed.
And sometimes there are other apostemes in the Golauro besides those two ears, and cut into them according to what I have said in the cutting of two notches equally.
And I have already treated a woman with an apostema which was born in her Golauro, which apostema tended towards yellow, without sensation, which had already closed the Golauro of hers, and she breathed with great difficulty, and had already prohibited herself from eating and drinking water, and was on the verge of death if I had not intervened within a day or two.
And the apostema had grown so much that it had eaten away two rumps and was coming out through two holes.
So I cut into it forcefully and stayed in one of them once, and pulled out that thing, and it came out from the great part, and then I cut into the other notch, and then I forced her mouth open, and grasped her tongue, and then I placed the once in that apostema.
And then I cut off a great part of it, and only a little blood flowed from it. And then the Golauro of that woman was completely absolved, and she began to drink water and eat food again. And I did not cease cutting into that apostema many times for a long time, and successive apostemas arose in its place, which I cut into until it was prolonged.
And then I made it well and cauterized the Golauro of her, so that there was no addition; and then I walked around and did not know what God had done for me.
Chapter 37.
On the Cutting of a Hovel when it is Apostemated.
When the catarrh settles in the hovel, and it is apostemated and long, then it is called perpendicular; and if it is on the back part large and rounded, and then it is called a boil.
But when it is cured with the water that we have said in the division, and does not confirm your cure, and only sometimes the apostema remains of it and becomes subtle, then you should cut into that which is added on roundly; and if it reaches that length, and is sanguine, yellow-colored or black, and has no sensation to it, then you should hesitate in cutting into it, because there is fear for the patient.
And when you cut into it according to the manner that I have said of its whiteness and length, then make the patient sit down and take hold of his tongue with an instrument of which its form is processed, and place the once in the newness, and pull it down and cut into it with one of two instruments which are mentioned in the cutting of two notches.
And it is necessary that you do not cut into it unless it is adjusted to the natural term without addition, because if you cut too much, you will impair his speech.
And then use the instrument that we have recommended in the cutting of two notches, and cure that one until it is healed.
But if the patient is terrified by the cutting of it, then use force in the cauterization of it without fear, and the manner of the cauterization is only with sharp water, and you pause the head of the patient in its proper place, and then grasp his tongue with the instrument that we have said, and take from the water which we have said in the chapter on cauterization, and bring to life with it, and pause it not thick or subtle, and fill the concavity of the instrument of which this is the form:
So that the extremity of it is in the concavity where the medicine is paused, just like the concavity of a spoon, and pause the instrument with the medicine on the vulva, and the patient will stretch out his arm over his own lap so that he can spit saliva or mucus from the mouth of that one because of the intrinsic medicine, so that it does not descend to any cause on the Golauro of him and that he may recover.
And then take your mouth and the medicine, and express it over the uvula for the space of about an hour until you see that one being darkened and soothed by the biting of the medicine.
And if you wish, take a cloth and wrap it around the extremity of the ray, and submerge the cloth in the medicine, and introduce the ray with the cloth into a tube above until the cloth adheres to that tube, and do this many times until you achieve what you want from the cauterization of the uvula, and then let it be quar it will dry out and fall off within three or four days.
And if you need to repeat the medicine, repeat it, and then cauterize with a gentle touch in the circuit of the uvula wrapped in cloth, and purify with that what is in the circuit of it with the medicine, and be washed with vinegar water, and be cured externally with embrocation, and internally with gargling until it is healed.
And this type of cure is more saved than cutting and more long-lasting in fear.
Sometimes the uvula is cured with water that is more subtle than cauterizing and cutting, because it is cured through subfumigation in this manner: take calament, yseop, origan, ruda, Arabic sycamore, camomile, and similar herbs to those of plants, and adjust all or some of them into a bath, and let them be submerged in vinegar water, and boil; and the bath should be well stirred with a decent stirrer, and there should be a hole in the middle of the bath over which is placed an instrument of iron or silver according to this manner.
And the extremity should be introduced into the mouth of the patient so that the vapor can reach the uvula on the tongue, until the uvula is quite obscured.
And then repeat it many times until it is dry, and be careful not to do this cure at the beginning of the appearance of apostemas, because it would adjust too much in the apostema, and you should not do that, but rather wait for the declaration of the apostema of it first.
But if you don't have this instrument, then take a reed and shape it into the extremity of it a seal of clay, so that the mouth of the patient is closed, because the seal of clay prevents the vapor from burning the mouth.
And this cure is good for health.
Chapter 38.
On the Extraction of Thorns and that which adheres in the Golauro and other causes.
Many times thorns or spines of flesh or some other cause adhere to the Golauro.
Then you must extract that which is apparent from those thorns or spines of flesh or some other cause, on which the sight falls, because you grasp the tongue with an instrument in front of the sun, so that it may be declared to you what is in the Golauro.
And that which does not appear and is hidden from you in the Golauro, it is necessary to make the patient vomit before the food is digested in the stomach, because then the attached cause of the Golauro will be forgotten through vomiting; or that the patient drinks a glass of vinegar or of radish juice or a small cup of dry bread; or takes a sponge from the sea and binds it tightly with thread, and then makes the patient swallow it, so that when it reaches the place where the thorns are and is extracted, then they will be forgotten. And also take an eel and bind it with thread, and then place it inside and slowly extract it; or take a horn and then place it and then remove it.
But if the patient is not forgotten of those causes which we have said, then take an instrument of lead according to this form:
And be more thick than a ray, a little bit, and at the extremity of it be a concavity which you will introduce into the patient's Golauro with ease.
And it will raise its head up high and be careful that the touch of its bone in the throat is not felt by the patient, so that he does not feel pain or discomfort from the bone or spine, or that it touches his hand.
But meanwhile the patient that enters is mine, by virtue of my knowledge of the location of the attached cause and its descent into the lower part, and pulls his hand with the instrument towards me, all according to the quantity which has been prepared beforehand until it is forgotten.
Chapter 39.
On the Extraction of Bloody Discharge attached to the Golauro.
When the bloody discharge is medicated with the water that we have said in the division of cure by medicines and it does not confirm, consider then in the Golauro of the patient at sunset, because you have grasped the tongue of him with an instrument which we have recommended to you.
Then if you find the bloody discharge, extract it with a small once or with subtle gestures decently.
And if it is not possible to extract it, then take a concave tube and introduce it into the Golauro of the patient, and then pause in the concavity of the tube a heated iron, and do this many times (until the bloody discharge is dead and falls out of the Golauro) and abstain from giving the patient any water all day.
And then take a full vial of vinegar water, and wash the mouth of him with it, and wash his mouth with that; and do not swallow any cause or spit out the water for an hour after washing his hand, because the bloody discharge will soon come out as soon as it senses the water.
But if it is not forgotten of what we have recommended, then subfumigate the patient with cinnamon or assafetida through the instrument which we have recommended for the suffumigation of the uvula.
Do this, and it will come to pass.
And this is another manner of operation in suffumigation of that, namely: you take a bath where the coals are burning and the bath is covered with a covering in the middle of which is a hole; and in that hole, shape the extremity of the instrument; and then apply the subfumigation; and place the patient's mouth on the end of the tube, and close his mouth so that the suffumigation is not forgotten until you know that the suffumigation has reached the bloody discharge, for the bloody discharge will soon come out.
And if it does not come out, then you iterate the suffumigation many times, and abstain from giving the patient water to drink, and make him eat salty causes and herbs, and do not give him vinegar water, and thus it is necessary that with this regimen it will be forgotten.
And this is the form of the instrument with which the bloody discharge is drawn from the Golauro when it is seen; and it resembles forceps in shape, such as tweezers, but with some curvature. which is placed in the Golauro, and the extremity of it resembles the beak of a stork, which is curved, with a serration of lime, so that when you grasp any cause, it does not let go.
Chapter 40.
In which is the summary of the sermon in warning about apostemas and their section.
The apostemas are many species, of many manners, according to the remembrance of them, each one in this book.
And thus diverse in their perforation and section by two manners, of which one is by the species of apostemas itself, and because we grasp the humors.
And the second manner is proper to the places in which they occur in the body, because the apostema that occurs in the head is another from the apostema that occurs in the buttocks; and the apostema that occurs in a bony location is another from the apostema that occurs at a joint; and each of them has its own judgment by operation.
And besides, some apostemas are such that they must not be perforated, but rather allowed to mature in those places or complete their course.
And some apostemas are such that they must be pierced when they are crossed, and not allowed to mature according to their natural course, just like the apostemas that are proper to joints. For an apostema when it comes near a joint is prolonged within the circuit of that joint until it corrupts the ligaments or nerves of that joint, causing a contraction of that member; or it is an apostema proper to a main limb, and if you delay the perforation of it until it becomes madura for the main limb; or it is near the anus, therefore pierce it before it becomes madura; and do not pierce it when it is already crossed, but only that which is proper to the anus, so that it does not trouble the prepuce and be elongated towards the parts outside of the anus, and become a fistula, or that it becomes in the end what is not healed. But it is necessary to know the hour of the perforation of the apostema, and that is when it has matured.
And you know that it is mature when there is the abatement of pain and the cessation of fever, and then the decrease in rigor and pulse, and the sharpness of the head of the apostema, and other signs.
And therefore it is necessary to know that the perforation should be done in the place most distant from the apostema and most near to the cure of the Eminence.
And the perforation should be done through the length of the flesh or the body, if the apostemas are in the parts of the arms or legs, and in the location of the lacertz, cords of nerves, arteries; and, finally, in all locations where there is no reflection; because in those that are reflected, use perforation according to that member.
And when the apostema is in a bony location, then it is well that you do not pierce it before the digestion of it has been confirmed according to its natural course, just as we have said; because if you pierce it too early, the body of the abscess will be prolonged and many unpleasant consequences will follow, and indeed the lips of the wound will be thickened and its depth increased.
But some apostemas should be pierced according to the latitude of the flesh or body, as necessity demands, or according to what the member requires.
And it is necessary to administer a small perforation in some apostemas, and a large one in great apostemas, with wide or many sections according to the diversity of the size of the apostemas.
And others are the apostemas in which it is necessary to have the cord cut and tied off when it becomes as if bread and butter, and when it reaches a term that has already stood, just like those that occur in many cases of dubelics and bubos.
And of these there are some that are cut off with a section having three angles; and of these, there is one that is cut like the figure of a myrtle leaf, just as those apostemas of the Angonari.
And among them are some in which a round section and a lunar section are administered, and similar to those.
But as for the one that is not like the superficial apostemas of leons, you should pierce it with a superficial or flat perforation, only so much.
And it is necessary when the apostema is large and has collected much pus, to pierce it and not wait until you have extracted all the pus at once; having removed one part, and then covering the apostema with another day, and then removing a larger part, and then doing this many times according to graduation until it is forgotten.
And most especially if the patient is of a delicate virtue, or woman in childbirth, or young child, or old person in decrepitude, because the animal spirit many times is resolved by the exit of the pus, and soon the patient dies, and you open them.
Therefore keep this chapter with great caution, and properly administer the perforation in which you pierce these apostemas, so that you clean off the plagues and consider then whether the plague of the apostema is small or is a flat section, then you should administer some of the old or fresh remedy; and if the apostema is large, and the fissures of the perforation are many, then it is necessary that you pause in each opening until they come together.
And if in the apostema an part of the cord is abscessed or has been concaved in the circuit, then it is necessary that you fill it with old cloth or a piece of fabric soaked in hot water, just as when you treat pans or razors, so that their moisture is eliminated; and strengthen it within three days; and then process it and cure it with whatever remedy is needed for the swelling until it is healed.
But if bleeding occurs during the time of your operation, then you should administer vinegar water and vinegar in which a cloth is soaked, and place that on the location of the bleeding many times.
But if the bleeding persists, then it is necessary that you administer a remedy and cure, and powder those which I have recommended in many places of this our book and division.
But if it is in the time of winter, and the location of the apostema is near many nerves, then it is necessary that you envelop powders in wine and hot oil, and place those on the locations.
And if it is in the summer, and the locations are fleshy, then it is necessary that you place powders mixed with water and oil or with wine and oil, and all this should be applied three times a day, just as we have said, and then it is necessary to remove the apostema and cleanse it, and administer the remedy as needed until it is healed.
And thus is this what is necessary for the knowledge of the cure of apostemas universally, but according to the method of distinction which I have already said, each apostema in its own way is treated by specific chapters.
Chapter 41.
On the section of apostemas which come in the cord of the head.
In the cord of the head, small apostemas, and species of knots which contain tunics that are made to their own uses; and the species of them are many.
And among them are pustules, and those that contain humidity similar to lime. And among them are those that contain humidity similar to powder, and resembling their own kind; and those that are lithoid, hard.
And in the section of all and in the extraction of those, there is no fear, since the extraction of those does not cause contrariety to the arteries.
And the operation in section of those is that you express them with an instrument, the form of which is similar to this, which is called "entromes", until you know what they contain.
So if that which contains is humidity, then you should divide it by section according to its length, with a superficial section in this form:
And begins from the section of the line .B. to the line .G. Therefore, when the humidity is evacuated, then you should excoriate that part which contains that humidity, and do not leave any cause remaining, for many times it returns if some cause remains.
And then submerge the cloth in Egyptian ointment, if present, and if not, in water and salt; and fill it with that which fills the wound and leave it for another day, since in this way you will corrode all that remains of that peel.
And then repeat the process over that cloth with Egyptian ointment, second and third time if needed, until you are confident that there is no remaining cause of that peel; then cure the wound with ointment until it is healed.
And if the apostema contains fatty knots, then you should incise it according to this form: with a section having the form of a cross, and cut once between two lips of the section and scrape off all that part, and exert your virtue in extracting the tunic which contains it.
But if your arteries make opposition, then do what I have told you first.
And similarly do in the lithoid apostema of section and cure according to what we have said; and the section on the lithoid apostema is less laborious, because it has little blood and little moisture.
And sometimes there are some of these apostemas that are in the head of certain men, and which have no moisture; the cause of which is because you had incised on an apostema in the head of an old woman and then poked the apostema with a spongy, ashy, white substance that could not be bent, and if anyone touched it with that, it would wound.
But in other apostemas that occur on the head, this is not the same chapter, just as those that come to the heads of children and cause hair loss, but the section of all these should be a superficial section.
And pause the perforation of those at the lower part of them, so that the body of the pus may be alleviated in the lower parts.
And then cure those with what is needed for that of curing.
Chapter 42.
On the section of scrofulas which occur in the neck.
Many times these apostemas appear in the neck and armpits and groin; and sometimes they occur in other parts of the body.
And those that occur in the neck, and many that are generated between them, and all of this scrofula is surrounded by its own tunic, and just as with the nodes and apostemas of the head, just as we have recounted.
And the species of these scrofulas are many, because some are lithoid, and some that contain humidity, and some that are malignant and do not submit to cure.
Therefore, in that one which you consider to be of good disposition in the Tocament, whose color is manifest and is akin to the color of the cord, and is spread out over all parts, and is not annexed to the nerve of the neck, nor to the veins, nor to the arteries, and is not swollen, it is necessary that you incise it with a superficial section from the top part of the body down to the line .G. up to the line .B., and scrape off all that part, and extend both lips of the cord with one or many strokes if needed, just as we have said in the apostemas of the head, and extract that little by little.
And it is more cautionary not to incise the vein or nerve.
And if the spatula is not well adapted to your hand and incision, or if you disturb the patient, or if you incise something that is not necessary to be incised; for if you incise a vein or artery and then prohibit yourself from performing your operation, then stop in the wound's triad of wounds or other powders which prevent bleeding, strengthen the wound, and leave it until the apostema's sharpness subsides and the wound becomes softened and begins to heal. When the blood is abscessed.
Then return to your operation until you have completed it.
And then inquire about the sign that your teacher said would indicate if there is any remaining cause of other small scrofulas; therefore, incise those and clean them.
And if it is in the root of the great vein, then do not incise that scrofula from its roots. But it is necessary to leave that alone, and not touch it with a doubled force, and let it fall of its own accord without causing harm.
And then fill the wound with old cloth that you have already submerged in Egyptian ointment, and then cure it.
And if you incise that scrofula entirely, then it is necessary to adjust the two lips of the wound and cauterize them as soon as possible so that there remains no superfluity.
But if you find that there remains some superfluity due to the greatness of the scrofula, then it is necessary to understand how to incise the root of it, and to cauterize it and administer sutures according to what has been said.
And that of the scrofulas which contain humidity, pierce it with a superficial perforation at the place where it appears to you as the location of maturity, and pause the perforation from there down to the lower part of the body, just as we have said.
And then administer the perforation with a powder and similar to those, in order that it may corrode what remains of the corruption. And then, when you see the wound already cleansed, cure it with an ointment of genital flesh until it is healed.
Chapter 43.
On the section of the pith of the apostema that occurs in the groin area.
They called this section in the epilhot, and it is not seen by any man on our earth that has made it.
And this is the inscription of the sermon of those.
But in men with hemorrhoids, it is necessary to avoid the extraction of the epilhot, since through this, there will be no benefit for that reason, because all the veins and major vessels of the malady are here.
But in those who have apostemas in the mouth or groin or two armpits, when the malady is not in the cane, it is necessary to use the section of epilhot to escape the destruction which is made by perforation.
Therefore, when we want to do this, it is necessary to incise the epilhot behind three circles of the circles of the epilhot, or four with a small section for latitude in that which is between two circles by quantity, so that the section is in ciphac, not in cartilage, and this location is suitable for the section, because it is free from flesh and the vessels of blood are nearby.
And if the doctor is cautious, it is necessary then that he extends the cord of the groin with one stroke, and appropriates the cut to the canal, but avoids the vessels of blood if he sees any cause.
And then incise the ciphac according to what we have recounted; and it is signified on the section of the canal by the flame which is from that place and is broken up with water and for the abscission of the voice.
And leave the wound open for some time.
Therefore, when the hour is returned to which perforation is feared, add two lips of the cord to the wound, and cauterize it alone without touching the cartilage.
And then administer medicines that make the flesh heal until it is healthy.
And thus says Albucasis that the summary of the sermon which we have recounted is an exposition only to see that some of those apostemas have already filled up the groin area of the malady, and the malady has come to a point of death, and the ale of life has been extinguished, and some will go to incise the epigloss so that the malady may breathe over the site of the wound through some respiration, and thus be saved from death.
And therefore I command to leave the wound open until the malice of the malady is consumed; and it is a malice that lasts for three days; and thus I command to close the wound, and cure it until it is healthy.
And what you have seen through me is that a servant took a cote and placed it in his groin area and incised with it a part of the cane of the lung, and I was called to the cure of him, and he began to cough as if it were the dying man's last breath, and uncovered the wound and began to bleed little blood from the wound.
Therefore you were confessed that it had not incised a vein nor guided, and the breath was coming from the wound, and cured it until it was healed.
And did not happen to the servant except that he regained his voice, and then some days later returned to a state of better disposition.
And now I say to you that in the section of the epilhot there is no fear.
Chapter 44.
On the section about an apostema that occurs in the groin area outside and is called a hernia of the groin.
This apostema is called a hernia of the groin and it is a large apostema according to the color of the body, and it is often found in women.
And it is according to two manners, whether it is natural or accidental.
And in the natural one there is no need for cure.
And the accidental one is according to two manners of which one is similar to grassy nodes and the other manner is similar to an apostema made by the constriction of an artery, and in that there is fear. And it is not necessary to make an assumption about it as iron except in that which is small. And you should proceed to investigate that and examine it according to what has been said, and if you find it similar to grassy nodes, and it is not suspended from any of the veins, then you should incise it as with the nodes, and extract that which contains it, along with the skin and bursa; and otherwise, you should thoroughly investigate all its being, and then cure the location where it requires curing until it is healed.
Chapter 45.
On the section of the species of nodes.
Of the nodes, many species and you have already said all their species in the division.
And it is necessary that you recount thus the difference between a node and an exitura, as it causes doubt.
Therefore I say that in an exitura there is heat and fever and violent pains until the ebullition of the superfluity is cooled down; and it is completed putrefaction which then ceases the fever, pain, and heat.
But in a node there is no heat or fever or pain, and it contains that ciphac lion which is in its own sac.
And it is according to the color of the body, and its beginning is like a cheese and it is made thus as if from a vacuum, whether major or minor, and they are according to two species, either fatty and containing humidity, and the colors of the humidity are many, according to what you said in the division.
Therefore, when you arrive at the cure of a node, it is necessary that you expose it and inquire about it from the beginning with an instrument which is called an intro-mes, according to what will come in the chapter which is approaching this.
And this is the manner of inquiring about apostemas and all nodes, that you take this instrument and introduce it into the most humid location which you find in the apostema, and you turn those said parts with it little by little until you know that the instrument has penetrated the cord.
And then withdraw your hand according to the measure of the greatness of the apostema, and then extract the intro-mes and consider what is situated in its wake.
And if the flowing humidity is forgotten, of whatever color it may be, then you should incise it with a superficial section according to what I have said in other apostemas.
And if from the wake of the intro-mes there is no humidity, then you should know that it is fat.
And dry it over it with a section having the form of a cross according to this form: just as you are taught, and suspend it with an onyx, and excise the cord of all parts with ease, and preserve the skin or sac, if possible, over that and extract the pus from the node.
But if it is broken in the operation, it is not possible to extract that pus, and many times it happens that way, and then you should extract it by force until there remains no cause from it.
For if there remains no cause from it, either little or much, the node will return to its original state.
And if you find that there remains a small part from it, then complete the wound with some sharp, corrosive powders and strengthen the wound, and pause over that which seats the apostema cautiously, and cure that other way until it is healed.
And if it is a large node, then you should cauterize the two lips of it and cure that with what enfles.
But if the pulse is absent from it, or not pulsating, then you should compress and humple the site of the wound which is wet and leave that straight for two or three days until the wound is cleansed and the ebullition of blood subsides; and then return to incising what remains of the node.
Chapter 46.
On the forms of the instruments necessary in section and perforation.
Of those so the forms of intro-meses are, and there are three species, that some are great, and some medium-sized, and some small.
The form of the great intro-mes is this:
The form of the small intro-mes is this:
They are made of iron, with a handle of wood, and with rounded extremities, in such a way that they facilitate the insertion into the apostemas.
And these are the forms of the instruments, and they are named after their uses, and one of them is called a berid.
And there are three species, that some are great, medium-sized, and small.
The form of the great instrument, its shape is:
The form of the medium-sized instrument, its shape is:
The form of the small instrument, its shape is:
Conveniently, these forms are for those apostemas and exituras and fistulas and bubos, in order that they may be used among the bones and other causes.
And there are needles, large and small, lions, just as great hooks with which the shrubs are sewn together, and they are made of earthenware citron, or earthenware, or iron, or silver. And the best ones are when they are made of earthenware citron.
And there are instruments of black lead, which are adapted to those who wish to be proficient in the conquest of fistulas in the cavities where reflections occur, that they may be reflected back with their lightness upon those reflections.
And there are three species, that some of them are long, and others medium-sized, and others short, according to the quantity of the width of the fistula and the constriction of it.
Form of the great instrument of lead:
Form of the medium-sized instrument of lead:
Form of the small instrument of lead:
The forms of the onyches are many species, that some are simple, which have only one curvature, and there are three kinds: great, small, and medium-sized.
And among them there are onyxes of bone, and there are three species.
And among them there are onyxes that have two curves, and there are three species.
And among them there are onyxes that have three curves, and there are three species.
And all these are necessary in their place.
Form of the small simple onyx, its shape is:
Form of the great onyx with two curves: Form of the medium-sized onyx with two curves: Form of the small onyx with two curves:
Form of the great onyx with three curves:
Form of the medium-sized onyx with three curves:
And these are the forms of the scalpels with which nodes and apostemas are cut and scraped, and there are three species, that some are great, medium-sized, and small.
Form of the great scalpel:
Form of the medium-sized scalpel:
Form of the small scalpel:
The extremities of those with which section is made are sharp and the other extremities are not sharp, and they are not paused in such a way that there is made justament in the excoriation of nodes the fear of incision of vein or nerve, and for those to be healed the patient and bring tranquility a little by the adjustment which is found necessary for the excitation of the apostema.
And these are the forms of amalgaids, and there are three species: great, medium-sized, and small, just as veins.
They are made of earth and resemble a ray that is used to extract oil.
And it has on the left extremity a punctured point with a hidden spatula and in that course it runs through the inner and outer parts, when you want, just as you see.
The forms of spatimis, which are hidden between the said means of perforation of apostemas and do not perceive the sick, and there are three species: great, medium-sized, and small. And these are the forms of those:
The forms of venous tubes through which the flow of blood is diverted, and there are three species: great, medium-sized, and small; the forms of them are:
They are made of earthenware citron, rounded with some length, and they are subtle.
And it is necessary that you have these three species of venous tubes: great, medium-sized, and small, so that through them the flow of blood can be diverted with speed in necessity, and then when it first happens, there is no medicine.
However, you should not use them to divert blood in all parts of the body, and you should only use them in fleshy places, just as in the ligaments of the hips and thighs, and in the ligaments of the arms, and breasts, and belly, and groin, and similar to those of fleshy flesh.
And sometimes they are made of those small instruments resembling scissors according to this form; by which the blood is diverted when it is made by phlebotomy, or incision of vein or artery.
And sometimes they are made round according to this form:
Chapter 47.
On the cure of the breasts of men which are similar to those of women.
Sometimes the breasts of some men become inflated as they begin to be full-bodied, and accordingly, the breasts are swollen, and similar to those of women, and resembling apostemes, distant.
And to him who has this condition, it is necessary that you incise those with a lunar section according to this form, from the line of B to the line of G, and accordingly, excise the tumor entirely, and accordingly, fill the wound with a medicinal flesh-coloring, and accordingly, adjust the two lips of the wound with stitching, and cure that until it is healed.
But if the breast declines into its divisions and is softened by its magnitude, just as it does in women, then let it be cut into two halves along their natural lines, with two sections resembling a lunar figure, of which each one is contained within the other, until the major line contains the minor one according to this form from the line of B to the line of G. And accordingly, excise the cord that lies between the two lips of the wound, and stop the bleeding, and administer what we have said about suturing and those powders which are necessary for the cure until it is healed.
And if you do not complete the incision of that which needs to be cut for the restlessness of the patient and the flow of blood, then let it be filled with a poultice submerged in corrosive gallnut and leave it until the corroding liquid that is left from the grayish matter is gone, and accordingly, cure that until it is healed.
Chapter 48.
On the perforation of apostemas that come forth through the navel.
Those apostemas that come forth through the navel are of the species of scrophulas, hard ones, which contain a sack.
And of those, some contain humidity; and those that contain humidity must be incised with a lunar section according to this figure: from the line of G to the line of B. And when all the discharge of blood is evacuated from the apostema, then you should fill it with a poultice and leave it until the next day.
And accordingly, the poultice should be stopped and cured with a suitable dressing for that wound, until it is healed.
And if the apostema is of the species of nodes or scrophulas, then you should incise it on top just as we have said in the section about scrophulas equally.
And if the wound is extended in such a way that it would be a bother to poultice, then you should administer in it a cauterization according to what we have said before.
Chapter 49.
On the section of apostemas that occurs through artery or vein.
When an artery is broken and the cord that lies over it is consolidated, then many times an apostema occurs. And the signs by which it is known that inflammation and apostema are through the artery or vein: for when the apostema is through the artery it is long and swollen in the groin of the body; and when you impel the apostema with those said parts, you will feel a stridor in it.
And that which is through the vein is swollen around the visible part of the body.
And the section on this apostema is an error, and more so in those that are located near the armpits, and in the groin, and in the neck, and in many other parts of the body; and it is very great, therefore it is necessary to avoid its cure with iron, and that which is in the extremities or at the head should be avoided.
But in that which is caused by inflammation of the orifice of the artery, incise a section on the cord in the long direction; and accordingly, cut the section with scissors and accordingly, open up the artery, and deliver the tunics until it is uncovered.
And accordingly, tie on top of that needle and make it penetrate into the other side, and strengthen the artery with double thread in two places, — which cause is necessary for you to sew up two arteries which are in the temples.
And accordingly, push the place that is between two ligaments with a spatula until all the blood that is in it is let out and the apostema is dissolved.
And accordingly, administer the cure in which power is generated until the ligaments fall off; and accordingly, cure that with suitable dressings for that wound until it is healed.
And if it is an apostema caused by section of the vein, then you must take with your hand as much water as is possible from the apostema and the cord, and accordingly, insert the needle below the place that you have held with your hand, and make it penetrate; and be in that double thread until you extract that from the other side, and accordingly, tie the apostema with two ligaments just as we have said to you about the ligament of grapes for two parts with two extremities of the thread.
But if you fear that the thread will break, then accordingly insert a needle with a thread under the entire apostema, and make the first incision of the needle, and strengthen those threads in four places.
And accordingly, cut the apostema in the middle of it so that when you have extracted what is inside it, then you should incise the excess cord and leave what remains tied.
And accordingly, pause over the poultice which you have submerged in wine and oil, and accordingly, administer the cure which is made with some and dressings until it is healed.
Chapter 50: On the apostema that occurs due to twisting of nerves.
Just as the apostema occurs in artery and vein, and similarly the apostema occurs in nerves when it occurs in their percussion or twisting, and due to excessive strain, and for similar reasons.
And it is made in the most part of the body in the locations of the joints or the ankle, or in any place where the articulations are faulty.
And it is a grave apostema, and it is similar in color to the rest of the body, and it is located in the major parts of the body, disposed in its own way, when it is tightened with vehemence, as if the patient were in a state of stupor.
And it is not an apostema that grows in the groin of the body, and therefore it is left behind the cord, and it is faulty to all parts and does not go to the parts before or behind.
Therefore, in those that are in the joints, it is not necessary to be treated with iron, because it would very easily cause contraction.
But that which is in the head or forehead should have the cord removed with a spatula. But if it is an apostema of little size, then take away that part with forceps and incise that part to its roots.
And if it is large, then you should suspend that part with thread, and excise that part, and accordingly, stop that bleeding; and adjust the wound with stitches, and cure that until it is healed.
Chapter 51.
On the section of apostema which occurs in the cheek that occurs at the belly.
I will describe to some men that are often found in the bellies of those and in other parts of their bodies which are called fungals by similarity to those with fungi, from whose roots is subtle and whose head is large; and now the lips of those are converted, and it is of those who is small, and it is of those who is very magnificent.
And I have already seen one, and in its belly were two theils which resembled fungi more, and there was no difference between those white ones, with small roots.
And now the lips of those were turned inward and were fissured, and moisture flowed from that at all times.
Therefore, you should incise them and weigh in one pan 18 ounces. and the other weighs 6 ounces.
And the operation in the incision of theirs is that you consider, when the patient is humid, and the color of the theil is white, humid, with subtle roots; then you should incise them with a spatula, and be present at the time of the cauterization by the fire, because many times the section of it expels much blood; and if you see the blood flowing, cauterize that.
And if the patient is poor and timid, beware of incision with iron; but then take a thread of lead that has been made recently, and strengthen that theil, in the manner which we have said; and leave it for two days.
And accordingly, adjust it in the constriction of the lead thread; therefore, do not cease to strengthen the lead thread strongly on that theil, until it is cut and falls off by itself, without any effort.
But if the theil is of large roots, then in the incision of it there is some cause for fear and dread, and more so in that which is in the belly.
But possible is that you cut away most of it, and accordingly, cauterize that so that it does not return.
And accordingly, cure that until the wound is healed.
And beware that you do not presume to incise a theil which is of dark color, of little sensation, with no regard, for that is an abcess.
And I will come back in memory of cancer, accordingly.
Chapter 52.
On the cure of a swelling at the navel.
A swelling at the navel is caused by many reasons; or by fissures of the cicatrix which is above the belly, and the yarn or budgel comes out according to the way it has been torn in other ruptures; or by blood which flows from a vein or artery, as has been said before, or by a constricted ventrality in that place.
But if it is caused by a fissure of the cicatrix and the bursting forth of the yarn, then the color of the apostema is similar to the color of the body; there is no great pain, and accordingly, it appears in diverse situations. And if it is caused by the bursting forth of the budel, then the situation of that part with water as we have recounted, with a more vehement diversity; and when you press that part with the said threads, it becomes hidden, and accordingly returns; and very easily it comes out again, and it is magnified much with the entrance of heat and violent labor.
But if it is caused by humidity, then there is no pain and it is not hidden when you press with your hand, nor is it constricted or creased.
And if it is caused by blood, then accordingly the apostema appears with these signs declining towards blackness.
But if it is caused by nothing but flesh, then accordingly the apostema is a serious one, large and hard, and is fixed according to a quantity.
But if it is caused by a constriction, then accordingly the touch of that part is painful.
And the operation in that case is that you consider whether the swelling at the navel is caused by blood from an artery, or a vein, or constriction; then it is necessary to be prohibited from curing that, because there is fear and dread thus as I have taught in the chapter on apostemas caused by arteries and veins.
And if the swelling at the navel is caused by the budel or yarn, then it is necessary to command the patient to take hold of his own hand and be standing upright; and accordingly, make a sign with the thread in the circuit of all the navel, and accordingly, command him to stand between your two hands on his shoulders, and accordingly, circulate around the navel with a spatula in the location which I have marked with the thread; and accordingly, extend most of the apostema to the upper parts with strong thread or cede, and tie it in the circuit with a firm thread or ceda, and do so decently.
And accordingly, take the middle of the extended apostema and insert the said thread into that indication and guide the yarn; and if you have not found nor guarded it by the thread, then accordingly, extract the rest and push the yarn to the lower parts of the belly.
And if you have found the thread, then take that with a thread; and incise the excess parts of it.
But if it is contrary to your artery or vein, then accordingly circle around that part, and accordingly return to your operation; and take two needles and insert them into those two strong threads and enter the two needles in the circuit which you have made around the apostema in a cross-like manner, making them penetrate; and accordingly strengthen the apostema in four parts above the needles.
And if you wish, remove the needles and leave the place until the flesh extended and falls off by itself; or incise that part when it is softened and becomes pliable, and accordingly cure that with water as needed, until it is healed.
And if the swelling at the navel is of flesh only or due to humidity, then it is necessary that you conquer the apostema as we have said and extract the blood or humidity which you find in it, and accordingly cure that with water as needed, and consolidate the place.
Chapter 53.
On the cure of cancer.
We have already said in the division, about the type of cancer and how it is treated with medicines, and what a hindrance is in its cure by iron so that it is not ulcerated; and we have said that cancer is generated in great caution and carefulness in its treatment.
And the ancients have said that sometimes cancer is in a place where it is possible to eradicate it, just as with cancer which is in the nipples or in the armpits and similar to the members allocated to remove all that, and especially when it begins small.
But when it is old and large, it does not become necessary for you to take possession of it, because I have never seen nor heard of anyone curing that, nor has it ever come to my attention.
And the operation in this case is when it is allocated as we have said, that you precede and leave the patient and purge with black bile some times, and accordingly sign it, if there is a clear and manifest repletion.
And accordingly, prepare the patient with preparation in which it is located for the operation, and accordingly prohibit the use of those threads which are needed for that; and accordingly concave all parts with a good cord to avoid any cause of roots remaining. And accordingly, let the blood flow and do not incise it slightly, and express the places, and wash away the blood thoroughly with your hand or with an instrument of which you are master of the tools.
But if you encounter opposition from the flowing blood in incising a vein or artery, then accordingly cauterize that until the flow of blood is stopped, and accordingly cure that with other treatment until it is healed.
Chapter 54.
On the cure of dropsies.
We have already recounted in the division, about the types of dropsies caused by water, and the signs of each type, as well as the treatment with medicines.
And that which is cured with iron is only the type of dropsy caused by black bile alone, and it is not approached with iron to the type of dropsy caused by yellow bile or that caused by corruption, because this is deadly.
And when you have already medicated this type of dropsy caused by yellow bile with medicines and do not confirm your treatment, then consider that if the patient has already been debilitated, or is afflicted with another illness, such as dropsy again, just like it is in the lungs or belly and similar to those, then beware that you do not treat them with iron, for fear is above that.
But if you find the patient full of virtue and in that condition there is no other illness but dropsy alone, and not young nor old, then the manner of the operation for that is that you lift the patient between your hands, and minister to them accordingly by emptying their belly with their own hand, filling the water at the outlet of the pentenilh, and accordingly take a spicula according to this form:
to be of two sharp parts long, with an acute extremity just like a spatula; but however there should be in it some smallness little by little, so that in the operation on that part you do not pass into the budel and lead it.
And accordingly consider if the generation of dropsy is from the parts of the budels, because then it is necessary for you to make the section with a spatula that is three times as long as those parts left behind, in the right side of the belly over the pentenilh.
But if the generation of dropsy is from illness of the liver, then accordingly your section should be on the left side of the navel for three times.
And if the generation of dropsy is from melancholy, then accordingly your section should be on the right side.
And it is not necessary for your section to be on the side where the patient wishes to lie, so that the superfluous fluids do not flow to that location freely.
And accordingly pierce with the instrument all the cord, and accordingly enter into that section, and lift your hand with the spatula between the cord and the siphac, and you excise it; and if it is as much as a fingernail or thereabout.
And accordingly pierce the cicatrix until the spatula reaches the location where you want it to be, and that is the location of water. And accordingly extract that and enter with an instrument whose form is: and it is similar to a silver cannula; made of silver or iron or lead lion, to which at the lower part of it there is a small hole, and on its sides are three holes: two on one side and one on the other side; and made is the extremity of it inscribed according to the manner of a feather, just as you see:
And in the extremity of it is an armor, because when the instrument reaches the water, then that so soon descends upon the instrument, thus evacuating the water in a moderate quantity; for if you evacuate more than what is necessary at that hour, very easily the patient will die from resolution of his animal spirit or by approaching death.
But evacuate from that according to the quantity of the virtue of it and according to what your disposition is to the patient's virtue, pulse, and good condition.
And accordingly extract the instrument, and retain the water which is caused because it is held back by the cord which retains the hole that is on the cicatrix of which I have recounted to you that you should pierce that according to this manner.
And accordingly repeat the instrument to another day if the patient tolerates this, and extract a small quantity of water, and make it so for some days over fear, and beware of error until there is only a little water left.
But if you fear for the patient, and leave a great quantity of water, then accordingly cure that with burial in hot sand, and mix it with warm wine, and wait under the sun for a long time; and cure that with desiccative medicines until it is healed.
And accordingly cauterize on the stomach, and the melancholy and liver in proportion to the extraction of water, according to what I have recounted earlier.
Chapter 55.
On the cure of children who are born with unperforated kidneys.
Sometimes one of the children is born from his mother's womb and the head of his mixture is not perforated (or has a narrow opening or is not in its proper place).
Therefore it is necessary to cauterize with perforation of that as soon as it is born with a spatula made of subtle matter according to this form:
And accordingly pause in the opening a small clasp made of subtle lead and bind it, and let it be so for three days or four.
And when you wish to urinate, it will be re-formed and hardened; and accordingly return that.
And if you do not pause the lead, it is possible that the urine which flows over the place may not close this opening.
But that of which the opening is narrow should be medicated with a leaden clamp, as we have said, for many days until it is amplified.
But those in whom the opening is not in its proper place, are led to this condition because of them, that which is born and remains is at the end of the head of the foreskin, so that it cannot urinate downwards, until it raises the foreskin with its hand upwards; and it is not a natural generation, therefore the sperm cannot reach the mother according to right, and it is a bad illness.
And the manner of the operation for that is that the patient should be bent over his own back, and accordingly extend the head of the foreskin with your left hand with a vehement extraction, and incise the head of the foreskin at the location of the perineum with an acute spatula, just as a feather is inscribed, or as you would inscribe some part, so that the middle of it will resemble the head of the foreskin and the opening will fall in its proper place according to what is necessary.
And beware that in your operation of bleeding flux, many times it happens thus; and pause at that point where you cut the blood, and cure the wound until it is healed.
Chapter 56.
On the matter of albugo, which occurs in the prepuce at the head of the foreskin and is accompanied by corruption, blackness, and adhesion of the prepuce to the head of the foreskin.
Many times this albugo occurs in the foreskin and is an inflammation of the surrounding flesh.
And one of these two types is malignant, while the other is non-malignant.
Non-malignant, requires that you suspend with a subtle thread and incise it until the whole is clean; and accordingly pause above this wound, submerging it in Egyptian ointment; and accordingly cure it with this ointment until it is healed.
And if the albugo is malignant, with a bad color, then accordingly you should administer cauterization to it, in proportion to its incision and ratio.
But if the albugo is in the prepuce of the uncircumcised head of the foreskin, and one part of it is inside the prepuce and the other part is outside, then accordingly you should open up the albugo that is inside first, until it is consolidated; and then you should cure that which is outside, because when you cure that simultaneously with the prepuce, it is not ensured that it will not be torn.
And also you will see that in the genitals and the prepuce there is blackness and corruption, therefore it is necessary to scrape away all that which is already denigrated and which already wants to corrupt or which is corrupted; and accordingly line upon this with a mixture of honey, which is mixed with flour of coriander seed and of three-year-old eggs, well crushed and sifted.
And accordingly cure that with the other treatment until it is healed.
But if there is bleeding flux, then accordingly administer lunar cauterization according to this form:
because the cauterizing instrument is useful in two dispositions together, namely in bleeding flux and in a wound when it is corrupted.
And if the head of the foreskin is corrupted and destroyed entirely in an hour, then accordingly it is necessary to insert into the opening of the prepuce a leaden cannula, so that the patient may urinate through it.
In the adhesion of the prepuce to the head of the foreskin (and this adhesion does not occur except in those whose prepuce is dry, and who have not undergone circumcision; and when adhesion occurs due to a wound or apostema) it is necessary to excise with an obtuse spatula until the bond is dissolved and the head of the foreskin is completely freed.
And if it is difficult to excise those precisely, then accordingly you should excise with a spatula some cause of the head of the foreskin and the prepuce, and thus it is because the prepuce, when it is subtle, is easily perforated by its own subtlety little by little.
And accordingly separate between the prepuce and the head of the foreskin with a thread of subtle lead, which is already moistened in hot water so that they do not stick together again.
And accordingly it should be treated with a warm poultice until it is consolidated.
Chapter 57.
On the purification of children and the cure of that which occurs to them in circumcision.
Circumcision is not a solution of continuity like other wounds: but rather it is our operation and our will, and the purpose of it is properly in children; therefore it is necessary that we assign to it the better operation and way that is less troublesome to health.
Therefore I say that the ancients did not write about circumcision in any of their books, because they did not use it in their laws, and it is only because we have acquired through experience, which cause is that you have found that most of the artists and barbers use circumcision and purification with a razor and with torches; and they use a ligature with thread and an incision with the fingernail.
And you have already condemned all these methods and did not find a better purification with razors, with ligature with thread that is used in purification like the fingernail, because many times the cord above has been cut off, because the cord of the prepuce has two layers, and the tone is left behind, and very easily it is forced to another incision and certain pain. And in purification made by the Alphecati, which is digitate, of which barbers use, it is not ensured that the incision of the extremity of the male member is secure, because very easily it enters into the wound.
But in the operation with fingernail, very easily rust and corrupts your operation. And the cord of the child is short by nature, and many times it does not need purification in this way, and I have seen that.
But from the purification that is made with razors and ligatures with thread, I have discovered by experiment, because the razors are of proportional incision, therefore the acuteness above is just like the acuteness below; and thus when you press your hand so proportionately two acutenesses, and inscribe so according to a comparison in one time; and it is made compression of the thread with a figure containing the cord of the foreskin from all sides, in which there is no error at all.
And the manner of the first operation is that you should make the child as comfortable as possible if it understands a little, and not do anything else but tie the thread to its foreskin just so much, and leave it like that until the next day.
And accordingly make him happy in all that manner which is possible to you from what he receives of his intelligence. And accordingly make him stay between your arms as prepared as possible, and not be at all anxious; and conceal the razors in your hand or leave them to rest on your lap, so that the child does not see those nor anyone else of the instruments.
And accordingly place your hand on the foreskin and blow into the cord, and pull that which is attached to it until the head of the foreskin is reached, and accordingly purify that which is aggregated in the scrotum.
The form of the razors for purification, this is the form:
Be the outermost not cutting and the others cutting, so that the end of the claw is not reached, and the length of both acuteness be as the length of two equal hands.
But the error in purification is because very easily the inner cord is cut off entirely or a part of it is incised.
Therefore, it is necessary that you stretch that from your hour with your fingernail in front of the wound's inflammation and inscribe it according to equality.
And if you cannot hold it with your fingernail, then accordingly extract that with a thread and inscribe that.
But if three days have passed and the foreskin has remained inflamed behind, then accordingly you should leave that until the inflammation is calm, and excise that with facility, and inscribe that according to what is prepared for you.
And beware of the head of the foreskin, because it will not be well there.
And therefore cure that with the powder which is recommended in the treatise on powders.
And if it is incised from the cord with measure, and obeys the parts above, then that will not cause trouble there.
And therefore cure that with what we have said until it is healed.
Chapter LVIII.
On the Cure of Retained Urine in the Bladder.
Retention of urine in the bladder is caused by oppression made by pain or by congealed blood or by pressure or by swelling, and resembles those cases that we have mentioned above regarding the methods of cure in the division.
And if it is not dissolved with what we have said, then a strong cause is made on the patient, accordingly it is necessary to administer an extraction of it with an instrument called syringe, whose form is this: It should be made of silver and very subtle copper, just like a tube of a swallow's quill with subtlety of ray long in similarity to a palm and a half, to which a thin cane is attached at the head.
And the method of extracting urine with that is to take a double thread and tie it at the extremity of the instrument, either wool or cotton, for good binding; and insert the extremities of the thread into the rear part of the syringe, and inscribe with razors if any superfluous cause exists in the wool, but introduce it into the tube with vehemence. And accordingly, fill the syringe with border and album of egg white.
And make the patient sit on a stool, and encircle their bladder with it and the foreskin with olive oil and egg yolks.
And accordingly insert the syringe with facility into the foreskin until it reaches the root of the foreskin; and accordingly fold the foreskin upwards towards the umbilical region; and accordingly push the syringe into that; and accordingly push that into the bladder, so that it causes the patient to be relieved of the cause, and not as said before in this order, but rather the method in which it goes astray.
And accordingly stretch the thread with the wool little by little, because the urine is soaking the wool.
And accordingly extract that and make it for urinary cure, and use the syringe, do not stop doing this and use the syringe until the bladder is evacuated and the patient receives relief.
Chapter LX.
On the Quality of Cathartics for the Bladder with Clamp-Creed and Similar Instruments Which are Accordant with this.
When ulceration or apostema occurs in the bladder, or congealed blood is present in it, or pressure is applied to it, and you want to cause aqueous medicines to flow into it, then accordingly use an instrument called clamp-cedra, and this is its form:
but in the extremity of it is deaf, i.e., closed. And in that there are three holes: two on one side, just like times.
In the beginning it is a concave space, in which water is inserted, and it should be according to the quantity that fills it, without addition, until when some cause is pulled out by that, pulling out the humidities, and when it is expelled, with water it is pulled out, and when it is long, just as clamp-cedra pulls out naptha in naval battles.
Therefore, when you want to draw out the humors in the bladder, insert the extremity of the clamp-cedra into the humor, and pull it with that water which is inserted into the upper parts, because the humor is drawn into the concavity of the clamp-cedra.
And accordingly insert the extremity of the clamp-cedra into the foreskin as we have recommended in the syringe; and accordingly push the humor with water that pushes it, because that humor flows into the bladder at once, and the patient feels relief.
The form of the cathartic instrument with which the bladder is cathartized, and this is its form:
And it should be made of silver or lead, with the head more like a small feather, and behind it a thin cane attached.
And accordingly take the bladder of motion, and pause in it the humor that you want to cathartize in the bladder, and accordingly tie it between two with a strong ligature with double thread, and warm up that humor over the fire.
And accordingly insert the extremity of the cathartic instrument into the foreskin.
And accordingly stretch your hand over the bladder with the humor and stricture descend into, so that the patient feels relief as that humor has already been conveyed to the bladder.
But if you do not have a bladder present, then accordingly take a purse made of papyrus and make from it a circle; and pierce that through all its circumference; and accordingly insert a strong thread into those holes, just like they are revolved; and accordingly add the circle just as it is added alsofatur, so that you pause in that water that you want of the humors, and oils and waters.
And accordingly tie that to the instrument and make it as you have made it for the bladder, and express yourself with your hand into, so that the humor conveys to the bladder.
Chapter LX.
On the Extraction of Pain.
We have already said in the division about the kinds of pain and its cure by medicines, and the difference between pain generated in the lungs and pain generated in the bladder, and the signs of it.
And we have said about the pain which requires an operation by hand and section.
And the pain generated in the bladder properly is that which is placed in the bladder.
And you so narrate that with a manifest exposition and abbreviation.
Therefore I say that the pain generated in the bladder is mostly seen in children; and among its signs is that the urine which comes out of the bladder is like water in subtlety, and appears on the surface; and the patient rubs their foreskin, and many times they cry out, and accordingly it is dressed; and with this you should check the anus in small pieces.
And it is a joyful thing to heal children of that before they have reached 14 years old; and it is difficult cure in the elderly. But in the young, it is easier because it is among them.
And of that from which the pain is greater and the cure is lighter; And if it is small, it is contrary to that.
Therefore, when we come to the cure of that, it is necessary at the beginning of that to purify the patient with a cathartic instrument which extracts all the fissure that is in their intestines; for that fissure sometimes hinders the conception of the pain by inquiry into it.
And accordingly, the patient should be pressed by their own weight and contained and mitigated in joy because of that which causes the pain to descend into the lower part of the bladder, or to jump to another place sometimes.
And accordingly make that sit between your most prepared arms and those of it are left the things of it, because of which the bladder is made to decline into the lower parts.
And accordingly, prepare all that and everything outside.
Therefore, if you feel the pain in the space, then you should sit down at once with section on it.
And if you can't see at all the slightest touch, then it is necessary that you anoint with oil your left hand's indication of the pulse, if the patient is a child, or the right hand's indication if they are a young adult, and insert that into their anus. And prepare for the pain until it stays behind your left hand's indication. And convert that little by little into the neck of the bladder.
And accordingly press upon that with your left hand's indication, and push it out into the lower parts outside of the place where you have taken the section.
And command the minister to press the bladder with their right hand; and command another minister to extend the legs upwards with their left hand, and with their other hand to relax the cord which is below the legs, in the part of the place where the section is being done.
And accordingly insert the spatula which is incident to this, and this is its form: and cut into that which is between the anus and the legs, not in the middle location, but rather before the left side of the cleft; and this section should be over that pain and your left hand's indication should be in the anus, and it should be a transverse section, so that the section outside is broad and narrow behind according to the quantity that you have extracted from the pain, up to what is possible, and not greater, because then the pain would overwhelm your left hand's indication which is in the anus and forgets its defect.
And know that some of the pain is angled and marred, because of which the extraction from it is made difficult.
And that water is like a lion, smooth and round, and the extraction from it is made easier.
Therefore, if it is that to which angles and marrows belong, adjust in the fissure.
And if it is not so, then it is necessary that you engender upon that, or that you strengthen upon that with decent gestures, the extremity of which should be like a file with which you strengthen upon the pain, and do not escape from it; or that you insert behind it a subtle instrument with curved extremity.
But if you cannot upon that, then you should amplify the hole a little, and if you see a flow of blood, cut into it with strength using vinegar distilled.
But if the pain is more than one, then at first you should guide your hand to the mouth of the bladder, and accordingly insert into it; and accordingly guide a little further along; and similarly do so if there are many more than two.
And if the pain is very great, then ignorance is that you insert it with a large section, for you will cause one of two things to happen to the patient: either death or the disturbance of the continuous flow of urine, because of which the place is not fully consolidated.
But administer expulsion of it until it is forgotten, or generate in the fracture of it with razors until it extracts that into pieces.
Therefore, when you have completed your operation, then fill the wound with the juice of aloe and blood of dragon, and strengthen that. And pause over that cloth infused in oil and wine, or in roasted oil and lukewarm water, so that the apostema is cauterized.
And accordingly, lay the patient on their back and do not remove the bandage for three days.
And when that has been removed, wrap the wound with water and some oil, and accordingly cure it with divine and devilish potions until it is healed.
But if in the wound there occurs a cauterized apostema, which is hard and corrosive, and from that it seems as if the blood is congealed in the bladder, and because of that the urine is prohibited (and this is known through the egression of blood with urine), then accordingly insert your left hand into the wound and extract that blood, for if it remains, it will provoke the bladder to corruption and putrefaction.
And accordingly wash the wound with vinegar, water and salt, and with opposition to all species, in which it is necessary for the cure of that until it is healed.
And it is necessary during all hours of the cure that you lie both hands on both parts and adjust the medicines which are placed upon the wound.
And if the pain is small and is in the meat of the foreskin, and it is fixed there, and the flow of urine is prohibited, then accordingly cure that with what you have recommended before you came to the section, for many times this cure is accused of being a section; and already you have tried this, and it is that you take a perforator made of iron and lead, the form of which is this:
with a triangular extremity, sharp, fixed in a handle.
And accordingly take a thread, and tie it to that foreskin behind the pain, so that it does not return to the bladder.
And accordingly insert the iron into the foreskin, piercing with ease until the perforator comes to that pain. And accordingly rotate the perforator with your hand in that pain little by little, and you pierce the piercing of it until you make the other side penetrate; for then the urine is soon abolished.
And accordingly press your hand upon that which is remaining of the pain from the outside part of the foreskin, for that is blocked, and forgotten with urine, and the patient is healed.
But if this cure is not adapted to your equipment for some reason which prohibits it from that, then accordingly tie one thread below the pain, and another thread above the pain. And accordingly enclose upon the pain in that foreskin between two ligatures. And accordingly extract it. And accordingly remove the bandage and cleanse the congealed blood that has formed in the wound.
And it is not necessary to tie a thread below the pain, except for the reason that it does not return to the bladder, and the other thread above, only then, because when the thread is untied near the extraction of the pain, the cord returns to its place and swallows the wound.
And therefore it is necessary for you when you tie the thread above to lift the cord upwards, or that it should return to its original place, and swallow the wound just as we have said.
Chapter LXI.
On the Extraction of Pain from Women.
Pain in women is rarely generated.
But if there is pain in some of those women, then it is difficult to cure it, and it is prohibited by many methods.
One of them is because the woman herself is too modest.
And the second one is because you do not find a woman well enough informed to know how to reveal herself if she were to meet a doctor when she is chaste, or if she is one of the women who have husbands.
The third one is because you do not find a woman well enough informed about this art, especially the operation with the hand.
And the fourth one is that the location of the section on pain in women is too far from the location of the pain, so you need a prior section, and in that there is fear.
But if necessity provokes you to do this, then it is necessary that you take a woman who is a midwife and well informed, and not too obstinate.
But if you are deprived of that one, then look for a midwife who is quiet and subtle, or present a matronal woman well versed in the nature of women, or a woman who has parted from this art.
Therefore, present her and command her to do everything that you will instruct her to do, from the inquiry about the pain to the beginning; which cause is that she should consider if the woman is chaste, then it is necessary that she puts her own hand into the anus and feels the pain.
Therefore, if she finds it, cut it below her own hand, and then command her to insert herself into that.
But if she is not chaste, then command the matron to insert her own hand into the patient's private parts and inquire about the pain, since she should put her left hand on the bladder, and compress it with good compression.
Therefore, if she finds it, then it is necessary that she gradually massages that from the orifice of the bladder to the lower parts, with the summit of her virtue, until she arrives at the root of the cleft.
And accordingly, insert yourself into that, approaching the midpoint of the private parts to the root of the cleft, whichever part is in front and centered on the pain, and your hand should not be removed from the pain below.
And the section should be small at first; and accordingly, insert the ray into that section, and if you feel the pain, then adjust the section according to the quantity which you know will cause the pain to be released from that.
And know that the kinds of pain are many: for some are small and great, and sharp and rough, and long and round, and have ridges.
Therefore, you know how many kinds there are of it by this which you signify about what you want.
And if you see a flow of blood, adjust with vinegar distilled and tie that for one hour until the blood is cut off, and then return to your operation until the pain is forgotten.
And prepare with you the instruments which are said in the extraction of pain in men, so that you may be helped by them in your operation.
And if you see a flow of blood, and know that the expulsion of blood is from the piercing that is inserted, then you pause powder on the spot and strengthen it with powders and strictures descending, and do not repeat this; and leave the pain and do not extract it, for very soon the patient will die. And accordingly, cure the wound.
Therefore, when the sharpness of the blood has subsided after some days, and the place is healed, then you return to your operation until the pain is forgotten.
Chapter LXII.
On the Section for Hernia in the Groin.
Hernia in the groin is nothing but an accumulation of moisture in the white membrane which is below the cord of the genitals containing the humors, and it is called a "ciphac".
And sometimes it is in the proper panniculus which nature prepares in the part of the humors, so that it may be cut off when it has become another humors; and it is the cord of the genitals between the white membrane which we have said, and not this but rather a "tart".
And the generation of this hernia is due to weakness which occurs in the genitals, by which this matter flows into those, and sometimes it occurs through a blow struck on the genitals.
And this humidity has many colors, because the color of it either declines to citrine or to blood-red, or to reddish-brown, or is blackish-feculent, or is white and watery, and that is the most common one.
And the signs by which it is known where this accumulation of water is are these: because if it is in the white membrane which we have said, then the apostema is rounded and declining a little towards length thus as a figure of humors, and appears the genitals, for the moisture contains that from all parts.
And if the humidity is in the proper panniculus, then the apostema is rounded with the part of humors and thus one estimates that it is another humors.
And if the humidity is between the cord of the genitals and the white membrane, then cut below the sentiment.
And when you want to know the color of the humidity, then observe the color of the humidity in the apostema with the cayrat which precedes its form; and according to that which is situated in the vestige of the cayrat, judge from there what it is destined for.
Therefore, when we come to the cure of it with iron, then it is necessary that we command the patient to be flux- botomated if this is possible for you, and sometimes fill his body full.
And accordingly, be resupinated on your back over some cause for a little bit above, and pause below you many cloths.
And accordingly, sit you on the left side of him, and command the assistant to follow on the right side of him, which should stretch his arm to one of two sides to the cord of the genitals and to the part of the miracle of the belly.
And accordingly, take a spatula and cut through the cord of the genitals in the middle part for its length until it reaches the navel.
And be made the section according to right and equal distance from the line that you should draw on the skin of the genitals, until it reaches the white membrane comprehending.
And excoriate that, and observe, and take care to not insert it; and your excoration with which you excoriate by part below that is suspended in the humors more subtly examines according to the quantity that is possible for you.
And accordingly, pierce the white membrane full of water with a wide piercing, and extract all the water.
And accordingly, separate between two lips of the section with hooks, and extend the white membrane to the upper parts; and do not touch the cord of the genitals comprehending, and insert the white membrane in that manner which is possible for you. And accordingly, insert that with its total amount or in patches, and most of all your subtle left side, for if you do not scrutinize the insertion of it exquisitely, there is no surety that the water will not return.
But if the humors proceed from that outside of its cord in the hour of your operation, then when you have completed the section of the white membrane, return inside and accordingly adjust the two lips of the cord of the genitals with suturing, and accordingly cure it just as with other wounds, until it is healed.
And if you find the humors corrupted by another disease, then it is necessary that you open up the vessels which are sore on the suspender, and extract the humors, and accordingly cure it with what we have said.
But if the water is accumulated in two separate parts, then you should know that there are two hernias; therefore, insert that part according to what you have done in the other equally; and if it appears to be one operation, then you do it.
And accordingly, wash the blood away, and insert into the sections wool submerged in oil or rosy oil; and pause outside another wool which you have submerged in wine and oil, and spread that over two genitals and the belly of wonder; and pause above double cloths and powders, and tie those together with a bandage according to this form:
and accordingly, two cloths should be pressed and filled with Carmen wool according to this resemblance; and the extremities should be made with those which are bound by a knot or moist wool, and should be added to the structure in the belt of the breeches, and one of the extremities should take from the buttocks to the waist, and the second should take from the navel to the groin, and two other extremities on two thighs and two other extremities on two arms, and all the structure should be adjusted in the belt of the breeches.
And sometimes this hernia is medicated artificially with a cauter in the place of section with iron; and it is that you take a cauter cutlery subtle and insert into that the cord of the genitals, and ignite according to what we have recounted until the white membrane containing the water is revealed, and then you take the cauter in this form: And it is assembled in Greek letter.
And accordingly, pierce with that cauter and ignite until all the humidity is purged away.
And accordingly, extend the white membrane with hooks, and excoriate with hooks, and excoriate with a subtle cauter ignited; and insert that according to what is possible for you until all of it is radiated away; and take care not to let the humors come into contact with the fire.
And know that this operation is more safe and longer-lasting than the flow of blood, and better than an operation with section.
But if you encounter opposition such as an apostema in the hour of section or in the hour of cauterization, or bleeding, then it is necessary that you cure what opposes you according to what is said, with a cure which is suitable for him.
But if the patient is poor and does not hope for a second operation due to its horror, then administer perforation according to what we have said above; and it is when you are certain, by virtue of what we have said about the signs, that this hernia is watery.
Therefore, it is necessary that you make the patient sit on some elevated seat, accordingly pierce the apostema in the lowest part of him with a spatula, and pause the piercing according to the length of the body.
And be the perforation wide enough that it drains all the water.
And accordingly, pause over the location and tie it up and leave it, so that the remaining water flows out. And accordingly, cure that until the wound is healed.
But if opposition is to the evacuation of water in that hour you pierce it: and this is not done except by means of which the white panniculus at the orifice of the wound makes opposition and forbids the emergence of the water, then it is necessary that you put into the wound a point or instrument with which the water from the drops is extracted, in the form which precedes; or adjust in the opposite of the wound a small one.
And know that the water returns and is accumulated accordingly after about two months or so; and when it is accumulated, then it should be pierced in that manner again, for the patient will thus pass through his days.
Chapter LXIII.
On the Section about Fleshy Hernia and its Cure.
Know that in the section about this hernia, there is fear of losing one's life through destruction in greater dispositions; for which I have seen the patient's dismissal and being saved by that better one.
And you should be reminded of the operation in this case and the species of the apostemes.
Therefore, I say that the apostemes arise in the bodies of those whose genitals are composed and it is made so by many causes: or due to acute and severe superfluity which is poured into the genitals, or due to a blow.
And it is the color of the apostema according to the color of the body, and it is not found in the patient's pain, and it is a serious apostema.
And very often it is an apostema lapified, of which the color is dark, and there is no sentiment in him.
And sometimes it is caused by constriction of the arteries, and by inflammation of those vessels just as one remembers it, or by inflation of veins.
But what is caused by constriction of arteries is known by the dispersion of the apostema when you compress it with those said ties; and there is no need for that to touch.
But what is caused by inflammation of veins is not dispersed from it because of any cause, nor by compression with those said ties.
And it is possible that on this species a section should be made and on the other flesh; and it is that you insert the cord of the genitals, and accordingly stretch the humors to the upper parts, and extract that from the white membrane, and loosen the suspender of the vessels, and tie them up, and insert the suspender more than you loose that of all part of the humors.
Therefore, if the humors are already consolidated in those fleshly parts, then it is necessary that you extract the humors and insert that.
And if there is adhesion between some cause of the white membrane, or between what is between the vessels, then it is necessary that you loosen all that adhesion and insert that by rounded insertion.
But if there is a birth of flesh in the location of the adhesion which is behind, then it is necessary that you insert all that is from him, and extract the humors just as we have said.
Therefore, when your operation is complete, then fill the wound with wool impregnated in rosy oil and wine; and accordingly cure that with another cure until it is healed.
Chapter LXIV.
On the Cure of a Hernia which is of Vine.
Vine is an apostema enveloped by some envelope similar to a bud in the softening of the testicles, and it is made difficult for the patient to perform movements, exercise, and walking.
And in the cure of this disease, it is due to fear for that which is preceded by remembrance.
However, it is necessary to say operation in that according to what the first ones did.
And I say that it is necessary to make the patient sit on an elevated seat; and accordingly, loosen the suspender of the testicles towards the left parts; and accordingly, take the cord of the genitals with those said ties and vessels which are proved by the arm; and hold them with another minister than you, and extend them with vehement extension.
And accordingly, insert with a spatula flat and broad by a transverse section in the right of the vessels until the vessels are discovered.
And accordingly, excoriate all around just as we have said in the extraction of arteries which are in the temples.
And accordingly, place an aglet in those which has a double thread, and tie it at the first of the places where it occurs, and tie it again another time at the last of them. And accordingly, insert those in the middle location by a straight section according to the length of the body, and extract what is accumulated with foul and corrupted humors.
And accordingly, cure the wound with a cure of other wounds in which you want to be generated for that reason that the vessels which are not nourishing one of two genitals, because it is not bad for that.
But if the vine occurs in all the vessels, then it is necessary that either the testicles be extracted or that the testicles are equated with the vessels, so that it is deprived of all nourishment by the insertion of the vessels, and that they are estivated, or that it is equated for that reason that it is not beneficial to those.
Chapter LXV.
On the Cure of an Intestinal Hernia.
The advent of this hernia is by a section that devolves in the white membrane extended over the belly on one side of the miraculous ventricles, so that the intestines of that rupture fall into some of the intestines.
And this rupture is either of the white membrane or of excrescence from it, and occurs in these two species by many causes: or percussion, or by suddenness, or by shouting, or by elevation of some grave cause, or by similar things.
And the sign of this, when it is due to extension of the white membrane, is that it occurs gradually over a long time, and does not occur suddenly, and it is an apostema which grows in width between the preone for that reason that the white membrane compresses the intestine.
And the sign of it is when it is due to section of the white membrane, because at first it causes a violent pain suddenly; and it is an apostema which appears different from what is apparent below the cord, and this is because of the emergence of the intestine, and the body of it in the parts outside the white membrane.
And sometimes it is forgotten with the intestine and is called this intestinal hernia "cirbel".
And sometimes it is caused by ventosity, and sometimes it flows into the intestinal fissure, and here it is retained, and it is with this great perturbation of the patient, and sometimes it causes a wicked pain and most especially when it is pressed.
And in the cure of the species of this disease with iron there is fear, because it is necessary to avoid the caustic in that.
And the manner of the operation of that is that you command the patient to straighten the intestine with his own hand towards the parts outside of his conquest if he obeys the returnment, and accordingly it should be inserted over his navel between your thighs, and lift up the legs of him.
And accordingly, stretch the cord which secures the cord of the testicles to the upper parts, and insert the cord of the testicles all along; and accordingly, place it in two lips of the section uncis according to what is necessary to fill the section with those.
And if the section is in accordance with the quantity that it is possible for you to forget about that humors.
And accordingly, excoriate that white membrane which is below the cord of the testicles, until the white membrane is revealed in each part.
Therefore, you should insert the said tie in this which secures the testicle, between the white membrane and the one that is below the cord of the humors, and between the white membrane secondarily, and absolve with that adherence which is in the part behind the humors.
And accordingly, take with your right hand the cord of the testicles to the parts outside, and with that same extension extend the white membrane to your left side, and lift up the humors with the white membrane to the part of the section; and command the minister to extend the humors upwards and you will dissolve the adherence which is behind with complete solution.
And search for the said ties that there be no cause of the intestine wrapped in the white membrane hard. But if you find any cause, then you should loosen it below the belly.
And accordingly, insert into the part below the cord of the testicles by section of which blood and serum flow just as we have recounted in that which we have said.
And accordingly, apply the wool saturated in oil to the wound; and pause on the wound; and apply the bond which we have recounted (and sometimes the white membrane is cauterized, which we have said should be done at the insertion of the thread to prevent flux of blood, for many times these things happen) and leave the bond until it falls off by itself.
But if the bleeding is delayed, then let cold water be poured on it, and pause over that until it falls off according to what we have said.
And accordingly, cure the wound with another cure of wounds until it is healed.
Chapter LXVI.
On the Cure of Hernia Ventosa.
In this hernia, there is not seen anyone who has been cured with iron.
And the first ones said that it is caused just as we have recounted in the hernia which is with wine; which is that you should tie the vessels accordingly near the section on that side with facility; and accordingly, cut in the middle location around the apostema with that which brings about that, until the vessels fall.
And cure the wound according to what we have said until it is healed.
Chapter LXVII.
On the Disruption that is caused in the Navel-strings.
Sometimes a rupture occurs in the navel-strings just as we have said, and protrude the place.
And there is no cause for the intestines to go back into the navel-string; and if there is, it is only a little bit; and returns back in all hours.
But if the time is prolonged with that, a fissure is adjusted in the white membrane until it goes down into the navel-string; and this occurs due to the extension of the white membrane which is in the navel-strings just as we have said, which cause is because the white membrane is stretched, and accordingly it is mollified and the place becomes apostematized and protrudes.
And the cure of that is with a caustic just as we have previously recounted it.
And sometimes it is cured with iron according to this manner: and is that the patient lies down on his back between two thighs, and accordingly cuts the location of the rupture of the apostemas protruding by section according to latitude, with a quantity of three fingers.
And accordingly, strengthen the white membrane that is below the cord until it is revealed.
And accordingly, take the ray and pause it over the protruding part of the white membrane, and press that onto the preoneum of the belly.
And accordingly, cut the two protruding parts on the extremity of the ray of the white membrane, and adjust them with a suture one to the other.
And accordingly, extract the extremity of the ray, and do not insert it into the white membrane entirely, nor extend the humors, nor any other cause just as you would have known in the cure of intestinal hernia.
And accordingly, cure that with the cure of wounds, and when you insert the threads, cleanse it and restore the wound until it is consolidated; for the white membrane is constricted and the protrusion of rupture is not adjusted.
And cauterization is better in this location, for it is more conducive to health.
Chapter LXVIII.
On the Softening of the Cord of the Testicles.
Many times the cord of the testicles in some men is softened because the flesh that is between it is softened, and it is conducive to health.
Then it is necessary for the one who is treating him to make the patient lie down on his back, and insert all the cord which is softened over the natural cord; and accordingly, adjust two lips with a suture.
And if you want, cut off the excess of the softened cord at the beginning with three or four cauterizations and a firm suture.
And accordingly, insert between the sutures; and accordingly, cure by curing other wounds until it is healed and the threads fall.
Chapter LXIX.
On Castration.
Know that castration in our law is excommunicated, but for a reason it was ordained to me that I should remember of it in this book; and it is not necessary to recall it except by two methods, one of which is because of the science of the doctor when he is asked about it, so that he knows the cure of it which occurs; and the other method is that we have many times had need of castration of other beasts for our benefits through those animals, just as with horses, and oxen, and pigs, and similar to animal-like creatures.
And therefore I say that castration is done in two ways: either by castration, or by incision at section.
But in that which is done by castration, the way of the operation is that we make the animal lie down in cold water until its genitals are softened and relaxed and hang. And accordingly, take those with your right hand until they are resolved and do not appear to be left behind the touchment.
But in castration done by incision and section, it is necessary that you hold the animal and press the cord of the testicles with your left hand.
And accordingly, tie the suspenders, and insert one section on each humors until two humors process.
And accordingly, insert those more than you will have cut out. And do not leave any cause on the white membrane of the cord, but only the subtle white membrane which is above the vessels.
And this manner of castration is better which is done by castration, for castration is gentle and leaves no cause of the testicles so that the animal desires to copulate.
And accordingly, cure the wound until it is healed.
Chapter LXX.
On the Cure of Hermaphrodites.
Hermaphrodites in men are according to two methods: one is when it appears in that which is the space in the cord of testicles, between two testicles, where a figure like that of a woman appears, with breasts.
And sometimes from that which flows urine which is in the cord of the testicles.
But in women, it is one species: and is that the breast of the woman on the navel is like two testicles of a man, a little of everything, as much outside as the pubic hair of a man and two testicles.
And the cure is of three species: those of two men and one species of women. And it is necessary that you insert those adjusted flesh into the wound to escape the impression of that, and accordingly, cure those with the cure of other wounds.
And in the second species of men from which urine flows which is in the cord of the testicles, there is no cure or operation in that.
Chapter XXI.
On Linting and Exuberant Flesh due to Causes of Women.
Linting is very gently adjusted over natural causes until it is stretched and made to be a leg to the regulation; and sometimes it is magnified in some women so much that it spreads out just like in men and penetrates into the act of copulation.
Therefore, it is necessary that you take the excess of linting with your right hand or with a probe and insert.
And do not leave it uninserted, especially in the region of the navel, lest a flow of blood ensues.
And accordingly, cure that with the cure of wounds until it is healed.
But born flesh is flesh that grows in the horrible excess of the mother until it fills that, and very gently emerges at the outer parts according to the resemblance of a cock (and for this reason we will also call this "disease of the womb"); therefore, it is necessary that we insert it just as we insert linting, and cure that until it is healed.
Chapter LXXII.
On the Cure of Leucorrhoea.
Leucorrhoea is when the breast of the woman is not pierced, or is only slightly perforated. And it is either natural or accidental.
Accidental is due to disease which has preceded, and it is caused by flesh not adjusted or by subtle white membrane or thickened.
And it is caused either in the navel of the mother or in the ribs of her, or in the upper part of her, or in the lower part of her, and prohibits coitus and pregnancy and childbearing, and very gently prohibits menstruation.
And the cognition of that is made by examining the metrona, if the opacity is apparent, proceed; but if it is not apparent, wait until you find it with the said fingers or with the probe.
But if the opacity is due to subtle white membrane and is adjacent to both lips, then you should cut and break that.
And it is that you pause on the two lips of flesh, and accordingly, pause those fingers indicating both sides together.
And the woman should lie on her back, her arms extended, and accordingly, stretch out both lips with force until that subtle white membrane is broken and the opacity is opened.
And accordingly, take wool and anoint it with oil and pause that over the location, and lie down at home for a day so that the inserted location is not consolidated.
But if the white membrane is thick and dense, it is necessary that you insert it with a spatula or with a firmer branch of myrtle.
But if the opacity is due to fleshiness, then suspend it with a probe and insert it.
And are with you the medicines that stop blood flow without causing harm, such as astringency, dragon's blood, and gallstone, adjusted with album of urine.
And accordingly, administer a leaden cannula broad so that the wound is not consolidated slightly.
And keep it for some days and administer lukewarm water.
And accordingly, be cured with the other cure of consolidation until it is healed.
And sometimes occurrences happen in the natural birth of other flesh, and it is necessary that you insert according to this manner. But if it is so due to cancerous apostema, the apostema in the mother should not be made contrary with iron in any manner.
Chapter LXXIII.
On the Cure of Hemorrhoids, Tail and Red Booter that occurs in the Breast of Women.
Hemorrhoids are a swelling of many veins, causing continuous bleeding from those orifices; and when old hemorrhoids become hardened and form ulcers.
And I have already said in the division the species of those and their signs, and I will also say which ones receive cure and which ones do not.
Therefore I say that hemorrhoids and ulcers when they are in the navel of the mother and do not appear with a sensation, then in those cases there should be no cure made with iron.
But those which are in the orifice of the mother above which one senses a sensation, are those which can be cured.
And it is necessary that you put the woman in a warm bath and accordingly, stretch her thigh with forceps or with rough cloth, and insert those into the roots.
And accordingly, sprinkle on those the fluxes of blood with one of the inserting powders that do not cause harm, such as astringent and similar to those.
And accordingly, wrap her feet with cold water for an hour, and accordingly, pause that in cold water.
And if the bleeding persists, then make her drink a decoction of Sumat and scorched almonds, and gualas and similar things.
And accordingly, take barley flour and mix it with honey and vinegar, and make a poultice with water on the back of her.
And if the blood is stopped, it is well; and otherwise, make her adhere to two bellows, and on the breasts without scarification.
And accordingly, take wool and submerge it in the juice of colander or in the juice of arnagloza or in the juice of guarravier mixed with vinegar, and make her adhere to the location; and accordingly, cure that location with a poultice until it is healed.
And cure that until it is healed.
Chapter LXXIV.
On the Perforation of Accidental Hemorrhage in the Mother.
Many species of accidental hemorrhages in the mother, such as cancerous and lapidated apostemas, ulcerous and adhubelated, erpetromened and fistulous hemorrhoids, and rugarious and thighed others. And you have already said these diseases and their species, signs, and cures in the division.
And it is necessary that you say in this treatise of the apostema caut which appears in the mother when it is one of those apostemas that cures itself, and if you want to know how the operation is done with iron.
Therefore it is necessary that you consider whether the pain of the apostema in its beginning is acute with percussion and flux and fever, and sometimes that redness appears, and if there is a sensation on that, then do not cut with perforation of iron, and cure that with water that helps on maturation until the acuteness of accidents ceases.
And accordingly it is necessary that you make the woman lie on a bed with two pillows; and recline her back and adjust her feet to the part more distant from the belly, and have her arms expanded, and pause her breasts below her nipples, and bind each one with a bandage suitable for water.
And accordingly, the midwife should follow the right side and administer the instrument with which the orifice of the mother is opened, in the form that will be done accordingly.
And accordingly, when you want to administer this instrument, make it with the probe in the navel of the mother's womb, and that which is entered into the mother's womb not be more than the navel of the mother's womb, and lead the patient. But if the instrument is greater than the navel of the mother's womb, then it is necessary that you sprinkle powders on the texture of the navel of the mother's womb so that it may be prohibited for any instrument to enter into the mother's womb.
And accordingly, you should pause the vertigo that runs in the instrument on the left side above and the minister should hold the instrument and turn the vertigo until the orifice of the mother is opened.
And when the excitement appears and it is touched with the hand and is hot and moist, then it is necessary that you cut off what appears to be the head of it with a spatula.
And when the pus is evacuated, then it is necessary that you pause in the wound a poultice submerged in red oil or green oil which has some stinging properties; and pause the clamping in the section of the navel of the mother.
And pause outside the mother and on the pendent flesh a clean wool submerged in water which has been boiled with mallows.
And accordingly, it should be cured after two days with a poultice that agrees with the water until it is healed.
And sometimes the mother and the wound are washed with soap made from water and honey, and accordingly, with water in which the root of lily or aristolochia longa has been boiled, and accordingly, it returns to the poultice.
And if the wound is in the mother's belly made, then it is necessary that you be prohibited from the cure of it with iron, having cured it with water as we have said in the division.
Chapter LXXV.
To teach midwives how to medicate living beings when they appear unnatural according to figure.
A necessary cause is that the midwife knows in the beginning the figure of natural childbirth by its signs, and is that when you see the woman expel her parts below and desire to smell the air, and above it is lifted up what comes out from part, and hasten the emission of the fetus, then you will know that this part is according to natural figure, and is the emission of it on its head, and the second one with it or suspended or pendant from the navel.
Therefore, when you see those signs, it is necessary that the belly of it be compressed so that the fetus descends lightly, for when they descend on its head, they will come out to it, and it will be cleaned of those superfluities with good cleansing.
But that which is another part is not natural and not acceptable, for when the fetus is emitted on its feet and the body of it is emitted before its head and its feet, and one hand or at the foot. i.e., or it is emitted the head of it and one hand or at the belly of it, and very strongly it is converted on its neck, and similar to the figures of it not acceptable.
Therefore, necessary cause is that the midwife should be wise and subtle in all those causes, and that she should beware of error and deception.
And you show the entire figure of those, and what sign is in them for that which is meant by it and is established upon it.
When the fever is emitted on its head by natural excitation, and it is vehement upon the woman and is made difficult for her to give birth, and sometimes the virtue of her is debilitated, then make her drink , or that women may have it, and evaporate the womb of her with fenugreek seeds and with warm oil.
And accordingly, insert the metrona between the said spatula and the small gap, or cut that with her own fingernail until it runs with what is in her of humidity. And press the belly of the woman until she gives birth to the fetus.
But if it does not come out, then it is necessary that the woman be cleansed with a poultice of pille and a poultice of fenugreek with camomile.
And accordingly, command it to her, accordingly the cleansing, that it be compressed and make her sneeze with condiments; and tie her mouth and nose of hers for an hour, because the fetus will soon forget.
And if the two more of the fetus are forgotten at the beginning, then it is necessary that you reduce those with gentle ease little by little. But if it does not obey the instrument, then it is necessary that you pause the woman on a bed and lift her feet up, and accordingly, conceive the bed on the earth; and the woman should be held so as not to fall from the concussion.
And if the membranes are not returned and the fetus is dead, then it is necessary that you insert those and extract the remains of the fetus or tie the body to her hand with a cloth and extract it with equality, because it will soon be forgotten.
When the fetus emits on its feet, then it is necessary that you push those into them, and accordingly, convert the small foot, and accordingly, make equal with it, and accordingly, take one foot of yours and stretch it little by little.
But when they are emitted into the thighs, then you command it to her that she may express herself, and make her sneeze with condiments, because it will soon be forgotten if God wills it.
And if it is not forgotten with that which we have recounted, then you return the small foot little by little until it pauses according to natural figure, because it will soon be forgotten with a lighter emission.
And if it is prohibited with all that which we have recounted, then take a poultice of althea and dissolved gum, and beat it well in the mortar for good beating, and accordingly, line it with water on the womb of the woman, at the lowest part of her belly. And accordingly, make that poultice cease in warm water, until it reaches the hypochondria.
And when the parts below of it are relaxed, then make it submit to the sub-fumigation of myrrh and sub-pause it for her. And when the sub-fumigation lasts for an hour, then make it cease on a bed, and accordingly, make her sneeze and stretch out her mouth, and take away from that, and press the lower part of her belly with gentle compression, because the fetus will soon be forgotten.
Emission of the Fetus laterally hanging from one of its arms. Be gentle in reducing her arm, but if you cannot reduce it, then lift the woman and make her walk.
And if she cannot walk, then make her sit on the lyre, and conceive the thighs of her with violent concussion, and accordingly, administer those which I and you have recounted to be poultices.
And if the childbearing is done, then make her cease on a bed, and accordingly, study on the reduction of the arm, and equalize the fetus according to natural figure, and make her sneeze and command her to compress herself until it is forgotten.
Emission of the Fetus on its neck, with its arms expanded and the flesh of her stretched out to both sides of her mother's. It is necessary that the midwife hold the hand of the fetus and accordingly turn it little by little, and make it equal with ease.
And when it is and what is equalized, then pause over the womb of her with that which we have recounted, namely oil and poultices.
And accordingly, command her to compress little by little, and when you have done this, then make her cease on a bed and command her to be inclined over the right side, and accordingly, command her to compress herself; and make her sneeze with condiments. The exit of the prepared fetus is above the shoulder.
When it is about to emerge from the mother's womb according to this manner, consider, and accordingly, you insert the second finger of your hand into her own fingernail until the humidity is evacuated.
And if the fetus is suspended over her face and neck, then you insert your finger into the umbilical cord, so that it may not be retained and die.
And accordingly, push the fetus into the lower parts until it is paused according to what is necessary, and command the woman to compress herself some times, and if God wills, it will be forgotten with a lighter emission.
The exit of twins or many fetuses. Know that twins are sometimes born, and some times not, nor three or four, but this is strange and does not happen often; however, there are causes natural and not living.
And among those, whether they be multiple or not, a second one is born, and are separated by ciphac, distinguish them into each bond in the umbilicus of each of them And some times they are forgotten thus as if it were only one fetus for lighter natural emission, and sometimes they are separated thus as we have recounted.
And if some of them are difficult to give birth and proceed according to what we have said about the unnatural figures, then you cure those thus as we have recounted.
And if the midwife is subtle and does what is done with ease and subtlety, and in delay, and is gentle according to all figure, according to how it is prepared for her by the engineer leading to health.
A reminder of what is formed in the womb from embryos and those that are aborted.
Some times are formed in the womb one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, and up to ten, and you must verify for me that a woman aborts at seven months, while another gives birth to all ten, which is caused by measurement of the glorious sages.
And thus it is necessary for the science of the midwife, since it is a small resemblance to this, and therefore pause at this with what is necessary.
Chapter LXXVI.
On the Extraction of the Fetus when it is Dead.
When you cure the dead fetus with what we have said in the division of medication and it does not come out, and you are forced to use operation by hand, then it is necessary that you consider whether the woman is of good virtue and not affected by any of the accidents for which danger is feared over her.
Then it is necessary that the woman be elevated on a lyre over her back, and her head inclined downwards, and her thighs lifted.
And the minister should hold that of two parts or tie it on the lyre, so that her body does not stretch too much during the extraction of the fetus.
And accordingly, you moisten the mouth of the mother with oil and with the poultice of althea and fenugreek and with the seeds of lily.
And accordingly, the midwife takes her hand with those oils and poultices, and accordingly, inserts her hand with ease into the mother, and accordingly, seeks out the exact location where the fingers rest on the fetus.
And so located in that: then you consider if the fetus is prepared to descend on its own head, and accordingly, place your fingers on the temples of her, or on the neck, or in the mouth, or on the palate, or below the beard, or at the furcula of her, or on the places suitable for the ribs, or below the hypochondria.
But if the descent is over her feet, then in the armpit, or in the middle of the ribs.
And it is necessary to have the finger on the right hand, and pause the curvature of her at that place which is between the fingers of the left hand, and insert the hand with ease and place the finger in one of those places which we have said, until you achieve the desired result.
And accordingly, pause and place another finger or the third if necessary, in order to attract equality and not be stretched according to her rectitude only.
And thus it is good for all parts, in order that the emission of her may be alleviated as it is done in tooth for the eradication of her.
And it is necessary in her that which is between them to soften the extension; and if any part of her is retained, then the midwife should take some of her fingers with oil and insert them expertly and turn around with what is retained.
Therefore, if the part of the fetus is forgotten, then the fingers should be pushed into the place where it is higher; and make it so that the whole fetus is forgotten.
But if the hand is emerged before the other, and it is not possible to reduce it through the constriction of her, then it is necessary that a cloth be wrapped around it; and accordingly, extract it until all is forgotten, and insert it either at the junction of the hand or in the armpit.
And so it is necessary that you do the same on the other hand and both feet.
But if the head of the fetus is large, or there is constriction in the emission, or water is adjusted in the head of her, then it is necessary that you insert between the fingers, and break the head and extract the water, or use an instrument called "alundat", the form of which will be described with the forms of other instruments in the chapter which is appropriate to this.
And similarly do if the fetus has a large head by nature: and it is necessary that you insert it with a forceps, or take it with an alundat as we have said; and accordingly, extract the bones with forceps.
And if the head is emerged and constricted at the furcula, then it should be cut open until the humidity which is in the parts is poured out.
But if it is not complicated, nor obeys to emission, then you should insert the head as soon as possible according to what seems best to you.
And if the afterbirth of the womb is apostematic or in it there is hydroptic fluid, then it is necessary that you pierce it until the humidity which is in it flows out.
But if the fetus is on her feet, then the attraction of it is gentle and the direction of it to the mouth of the mother is gentle.
But if it is constricted at the belly and parts, then it is necessary that you extract it with cloth which you will wrap around your hand, and cut open the belly and parts until the water which is in them flows out.
But if the other members are stuck and return to the head, then place it with your left hand; but if the mouth of the mother is swollen, then insert your hand into the pomegranate, and seek out that head, and attract it with those fingers, and accordingly, enter one or two fingers, and draw it out through her mouth.
And if the mouth of the mother is constricted by an apostematic swelling which occurs to it, then it is necessary that you not trouble over it; but rather, administer effusion of humid and fatty causes. And administer poultices; and follow the patient with waters that soften and moisten.
And if the fetus is on her own ribs, then it is necessary that you insert it as much as possible; and administer water which we have said for a living fetus.
And if this is not possible, then insert it in the feet, and extract it.
And make sure that you do not leave any cause behind the second finger.
And when you have completed all your operation, then administer the water which we have said for the cure of apostematic swellings that occur in the mother.
And if bloody flux occurs, then let it flow into stiptic waters and administer another cure.
And I myself have seen a woman whose womb contained a dead fetus, and accordingly, on top of that fire another pregnancy was undertaken, and accordingly, the dead fetus is another. It happened to me a long time ago that an apostema occurred in my own umbilicus; and it swelled up until it became hot as fire, and I began to sweat.
And I was called to the cure of it, and medicated it for a long time, but the wound did not consolidate.
And then I wrapped it with some plaster of strong attraction, and drew out one bone, and accordingly passed several days, and drew out another bone; and I was greatly amazed, as there was no bone in the womb.
And then I thought that they were the bones of the dead fetus.
And then I examined the wound and drew out many bones from it, the woman existing in her own good disposition, and thus she lived in this way for a long time, recovering from a small part of the arm.
And I do not think it strange, but rather because in this is science and aid to that which the physician crafts with his hand for cure.
Of the forms of instruments that are necessary to extract the fetus.
The shape of the uterus which is open in the mother:
This is the shape of a strengthen in which are equalized the liberties, to which equalization are two vertebrae at two extremities of two feet. But however this vertebra must be more subtle than the strictor, and made of ebony or boxwood.
And the width of each staff should be two fingers and a half, and the margin of one side is equal to one finger, and the length of each is one palm and a half; and in the middle place between the two staffs there are two adjustments of those staffs which are already fixed, from which the length is most of one palm and a little more, and the width of each is two fingers or a little more.
And these two adjustments are inserted into the mouth of the mother so that they can be opened up with them when you rotate the two prescribed vertebrae.
Another similar form to that one, more subtle and lighter:
It is made of ebony or boxwood wood, according to the likeness of forceps. But however, at the end of it there are two additions like times, and the length of those additions is equal to one palm, and the width of each is two fingers.
And when you want to open her up with those, then you should cause the woman to lift herself on a lyre, and let her feet hang down, opening up what is between her ribs. And accordingly, work the instrument with your hand like you do with forceps, equalizing according to the quantity that you want of the appreciation of the mouth of the mother until she does what you want.
The shape of the uterus which they called "vertitge" in ancient times:
The shape of impulsion, with which the fetus is impelled:
The shape of amiability, with which the great head is contained:
And it is assembled like forceps with teeth at the end, just as times, and some times it is made long like forceps according to this form, just as times, with teeth like the teeth of a rasp which is inserted and contained. The shape of amiability few:
The shape of a finger having a spine:
The shape of a finger having two spines:
The shape of a spatula having two extremities at which the head is severed:
The shape of two broad spatulas:
All those instruments are exercised, and when the more species of them are multiplied and prepared by the artists, as it is lighter to their operation and higher in quantity.
And you should not neglect those instruments regardless of what, because the necessity of them is irrepressible.
On the extraction of the second finger:
When the second finger is retained during childbirth, then it is necessary that you command the patient to retain her breath, and accordingly, make her snort with condensation, and strengthen your hand on the mouth of her and on her nose, and if by this means it has been extracted outside, so be it.
And if not, then you should take a cloth and pierce a hole in the cover of it, and pause on that spot where the mouth of the mother is open, as with calamus and rue and anise and camomile and Arabian senna and cinnamon and St. John's Wort. All these herbs or some of them should be submerged in water in the cloth, and pause that on the fire.
And accordingly, place a reed cane in the mouth of the mother, and keep it there until the evaporation comes to the concavity of the mother.
And accordingly, make her snort as we have said, and the second finger is extracted quickly.
But if the cure remains and is not extracted, then you should command the midwife to submerge her left hand in sesame oil or in a poultice of althea, and accordingly, insert it into the canal and search for the second finger, and when you have found it, then take it and extract it little by little. But if it is annexed to the womb of the mother, then enter your hand according to what we have recommended, and when you have found the second finger, extract it little by little with rectitude so that the mother does not faint from the vehement attraction. But before all, it is necessary to be flexible on both right and left sides with ease.
And if the mouth of the mother is constricted, we have already recommended the cure with snorting and with medication from the cloth with herbs.
But if it is not extracted with all the causes that we have recommended, then beware that you do not fatigue yourself on that in iteration of abstraction, but rather, it is necessary that what has come out from there to the mouth of the mother lies at the end of the woman, and accordingly, crystallize that with a poultice and tetra-pharmaceutical; for that will make it putrid after some days and be dissolved and extracted.
But when it putrefies, it is lifted to the bad air of the head and stomach, and that leads the patient astray; and accordingly, it is necessary that sub-fumigations and conveniences are administered thereto.
But some of the Ancients have already experimented with sub-fumigation from Nazareth and dry figs.
The shape of an instrument by which the woman is sub-fumigated for the retention of menses and the second finger:
It is made of beryl or iron.
And it is placed with the subtle extremity in the canal and the broad extremity on the fire, and the sub-fumigation is placed on the arms of the fire.
And keep that there until that sub-fumigation is consumed and another iteration occurs.
On the cure of the child's unperforated navel:
Some children are born without a navel and their navels are not perforated, which already have a subtle and opaque cicatrix. Then it is necessary that the midwife pierces with her finger that cicatrix; and if not, then pierce it with a sharp spatula, and beware that she does not touch the lactating area.
And accordingly, place on it some wool soaked in wine and oil; and accordingly, cure that with a poultice until it is clean.
But if you fear that it may be opaque, then place a reed cane in the hole for several days, and stop when the child wants to pass.
And already an opacity of the navel occurs due to consolidation of the wound or apostematic swelling; therefore, it is necessary that this consolidation be inserted, and accordingly, cure it with the water we have said for the cure and with lead.
On the cure of fistulas that are left behind:
The fistulas that remain in the aftermath of childbirth, lower down near the navel and larger than those which remain by the anus outside or in the space of one part.
And it is a fistula or multiple fistulas.
And since that node is aged and flows with white or subtle pus-like liquid, and sometimes some of these fistulas are penetrated.
And those that are penetrated are known by the matter that is discharged from them through exit and windiness; and sometimes the patient uses a cathartic of exit, and very little is discharged from those red ones.
And some of those fistulas penetrate into the space of the bladder, and into the urethra of the penis; and some of those penetrating ones go into the junction of the womb and into the notch of the cervix.
And the way to know if a penetrating fistula goes into the anus and not into it is that you put your finger in the anus and enter a subtle probe of iron or steel into the fistula when there is no turbulence.
But if there is turbulence in that, then you should insert into it a subtle probe of lead or horsehair until you feel the probe or hair in your finger.
And if you do not feel that at all nor does any cause of exit or redness or windiness proceed from the hole, just as we have said, then you will know that it is not penetrating, and accordingly, go to the cure.
And when the fistula is penetrating into the bladder or into the urethra of the penis, then the significance of it is that urine will be discharged from it and prohibition of it to this effect that the place where medicine is consolidated.
But if it is penetrating into the junction of the womb or into the bone and causing pain in the circulation, then the signal of it is that the probe will pierce here if there is no turbulence in the bone, and causing pain in the circulation of the part; and that from this place there will be pus-like discharge always; and that it does not hold with that medicine, nor is consolidated with a poultice.
And in all those penetrating fistulas there is no complete cure, and the cure of these is the labor and vehemence of the foolish doctors over which I am fixed.
But in that which is not penetrating and not old, healing with iron is expected according to what you have recommended and what I have tried.
And it is that the patient lies between your knees on his back and lifts up his hips towards you, with his legs bent at the knees, so that his womb is inclined towards his belly, and accordingly, insert a probe of lead or iron into the fistula if there is turbulence in it, until you know the location where the probe penetrates.
And if that patient feels pain around the navel, then it is necessary that you insert your finger into the navel.
And if you feel with your finger that the probe has already entered and is penetrating, or if you feel between your finger and that siphac or flesh, then you will know certainly that it is penetrating; and accordingly, do not trouble yourself about it, as we have said.
But however, some may say that it is healed in certain men's hearts.
And the medicine by which healing is expected in it is that you apply a subtle cauterizing fire according to the size of the fistula, just as has been preceded, and insert that ignited substance into the fistula until it spreads around the navel; and accordingly, repeat that process two or three times until you know that all those fleshy tissues adjusted to the fistula are like the feathers of an owl.
And accordingly, cure that with calques wrapped in leather until all those fleshy tissues are healed; and accordingly, cure that with medicines generating and consolidating flesh, and if it is healed, so be it; and if not, then do not expect it to be healed at any time by another cure.
And if the probe enters and does not penetrate into the navel which is in the anus, but between that and the probe which is a veil of flesh or cicatrix, and sometimes the fistula is opened on the surface of the codon, then dry the codon from the beginning of the fistula, and you will see it dried with the probe, and it will be in the fistula until the drying reaches the location where the end of the probe comes out, and through the probe is liberated and cut.
And accordingly, purify those fleshy tissues fistulated which are gathered like the beak of an owl and do not remain any cause.
But if a flux of blood comes sometimes between you and your operation when you are purifying those fleshy tissues, then use the milch that is and the least painful instrument is cauterization with fire or with acute medicine, for cauterization with fire adjusts two good habits: so it is adjustment of those adjusted fleshy tissues, and abscission of blood from excessive moisture.
And accordingly, cure that with calques wrapped in leather or in three-fold cloth until the wound is fully closed, and accordingly, cure the wound with hard flesh generating and consolidating.
And such medicines in which there is dryness and excess; when accordingly it is restored, it is already healed and you do not fear relapse.
But if the fistula has already reached the perineum of the anus and is prolonged from the surface of the body, then insert your finger into the anus and inquire about it.
And therefore, if you find the probe and it enters between you and her, it is veiled by cicatrix or flesh, and it is prepared for penetration, then do not perform an operation there except according to the way of faith and hope.
The cause is to administer in that place one of three ways: either to cauterize it as we have said; or to dry it so that you can achieve the conquest of it and insert the probe into the cure prepared for it, and do not proceed with drying until you are sure that you will not cut into the lactating area containing the navel, and that nothing will happen to the patient except by his own consent; and accordingly, cure that with water as we have said, because very little is needed for healing; or to lengthen that veil and remove that pus which dries it up there in the anus, just as we have said, either with a probe or another instrument of sharp extremity, and accordingly, purify those fleshy tissues fistulated which are in the drying process until you can perform percrustation; and accordingly, strive to achieve the restoration of all the wound through drying, and if the orifice above is not consolidated, and the fistula remains open in the part of the anus, it will be easier for the patient. And in some cases the fistula is finished according to this method: when you insert the probe into the fistula, and it is on the edge of the anus around the surface of the body with the coden and at the margin of the anus, then take hold of a perforated extremity, which is like an awl preparing the vessels according to this form:
and insert into that faithful package wrapped in five fingers or around those, and accordingly, insert the probe with faith into the fistula until you achieve the conquest of it.
But if it is penetrating in the margin of the anus proper to the outside, then you extract the probe from that hole just as you insert your finger into the anus; and extract the extremity of the probe and adjust the two extremities together, and strengthen each one, and leave it so for a day or two, and when you more deeply insert the probe into the flesh, strengthen it well until those fleshy tissues are inserted between the two extremities of the probe which fall apart.
And accordingly, cure the wound so that it is consolidated and healed.
But if the orifice of the fistula is not penetrating, then make it penetrate, in whatever way you are prepared, but not in the perineum, because it is not your place to do so, lest you cut into the lactating area; and accordingly, make it heal until it is healed.
The form of the spatula with which the fistula is opened: its curvature is very sharp and the other part is non-sharp, so that you do not cut into what is not necessary, just as sometimes.
On the suturing of hemorrhoids in which blood flows during the incision of those.
Hemorrhoids are in two ways, because either they are between the anus like charcoal, or those that are like grass of rye. And some are small and large, and the blood flows from those at all times and is one, and many, and outside the anus, and in the extremities of it.
But however, those that are outside the anus are according to the months of little humidity, from which citrine water or a small amount of blood flows with the body continuing, and according to the color of the skin.
And the cure for that which is outside the anus is that you command the patient to settle and to press it in so that the anus opens and the hemorrhoids appear to you. Then you take hold of it and suspend from the hooks or what you have with your nail, and accordingly, cut those at their roots.
But if the hooks are not held in those due to their humidity and softness, then take them with a rough cloth or with a piece of leather or with wool floss, and extract them with your fingers, and accordingly, cut those and powder some powders over them, suitable for the incision, so that they may be applied to those as cauterizing; or cauterize those according to what is preceded in the chapter on cauterization. And accordingly, cure those with another cure until they are healed.
And if the anus does not obey evacuation, then anoint the patient with a cathartic in which there is a small biting, and wash it with that water which is in the anus, so that it may obey evacuation slightly when the patient has pressed.
But if the hemorrhoids are outside the anus, then the cause of theirs is slight, and it is that you take those with your nail or that you take those with hooks, and cut them, and accordingly, cure those with water as we have said until they are healed.
And the one who will make an incision should administer suturing of them according to this method: take a needle-wrapped probe and insert it into the awl and accordingly, extract the hemorrhoids at the upper parts, and make that penetrate with the awl in the root of the other part, and wrap the two extremities of the probe in the more distant part of the awl, and so laterally; and strengthen the hemorrhoid with strong stitching, and accordingly, remove the needle and awl.
And do this to all of them, and leave one and not sew it up, for that reason the superfluity of blood may flow from that.
And accordingly, pause over the anus with cloth dipped in red oil or cerate; and pause that over the anus and command the patient to rest. And accordingly, leave it so that it can heal; and when it is healed, cure those with ointment or another cure until they are well.
And when they are old and not suitable for that medicine, then you must cut those with the point of a spatula or with your nail until they are made moist and the scab above is prevented from forming, which prevents consolidation; and accordingly, cure those until they are consolidated.
Then you must cut those with a reason more vehement than the first, until there is much bleeding and they are exfoliated; and accordingly, cure those until they are healed.
Know that Almesmir is the key, and it's not just a notch red on the skin according to its color like the head of a clavicle, and it's made all over the body and most especially in the parts below the shoulders and above the elbows, and accordingly, by these pains, you must learn how to manage them.
And then it is necessary to cut out what is in the circle of the key, and hold it with forceps or hooks, and eradicate its root; and accordingly, cure that.
And if you wish, cauterize it according to what is preceded in the chapter on cauterization.
But truly, a verruga is a small, sharp, round fistula on the surface of the body, and many times they appear in children.
And the cure for it is that you stretch and cut it open, or that you strengthen it with a probe or a skin thread until it closes. And if you wish, cauterize it, as we have said, with fire or acute medicine.
But a formica is a small, fatty or fistula-like prominence on the surface of the body going forward, and when the pimple reaches it, it seems to be bitten by a formic insect, and it is made around the body.
And the cure for it is that you take a reed pen or a vulture's quill, and make it strong, and pause it over the formica until it contains the circle of the reed pen in the parts of it; and accordingly, revolve your hand with the reed pen around what is in the circuit of the formica, and pause it on the navel of the flesh, and that eradicates the formica from its root.
And if you wish, do this with an iron or steel reed, according to this form:
Be the upper part of the reed thin and subtle (not perforated), wrapped in such a way that when you apply it to the said area, it may be ablated and the revolution of it.
And if you wish, cauterize the formica according to what is said before in the chapter on cauterization of atheyl.
The form of the instruments that are administered to give catharsis.
Sometimes it is made cathartic of silver or lead or melted iron or malleted; and sometimes it is made from those small and large instruments according to those to which they are administered, for that which is administered in the cure of little children is small; and those whose buttocks are rough or sore should have their cathartics small.
The form of catharsis great and little.
The head of the reed pen above, to which the pouch is tied, should be broad according to this method; and there should be a distinction at the point where the pouch is tied in such a way as to resemble times.
And the extremity of it most distant, which is inserted into the anus, should be thick and dense like a lion's fur, going back to subtlety; and on one side of it there are two holes, and on the other side one hole, and the width of the hole should be according to the size of the rays and slightly thicker than small.
And the pouch should be in which medicines of animal bladder or sheep's wool are placed, and the root of it should be a palm.
And it should be perforated with many holes, just as it is revolved; and if the space between the holes is the largeness of that.
And accordingly, insert the strong needle into those holes, which is of ten needles or nearby them; and adjust the pouch with it; and when the pouch is placed in it, be tight at the head of the cathartic between two distinguished parts with strong constriction, and accordingly, cathartize each hole: But the quality of cathartizing is that you fill the pouch with medicine, which should be warmed according to the quantity of the tolerance of the patient; and take care not to make it too hot or too cold.
And accordingly, have the patient lie on their back with their knees bent and their feet flat on the floor, and place one leg over the other as if they are sitting on a stool; and accordingly, apply some oil or album of honey or mucilage of fenugreek to the extremity of the cathartic; and accordingly, insert it into the anus with ease, and have the assistant take the pouch and express it with two hands and many strokes with vehemence until everything in the cathartic is evacuated into the bedpan; and accordingly, remove the cathartic and have the patient lift their legs to the wall.
And if the medicine forces him to evacuate excessively, take as much as he can tolerate; and if he sleeps with it for the entire night, it is better in terms of purging.
But if you cathartize him in the diseases of intestinal flux and evacuation, then you must iterate the cathartic until he is cured.
And if there are hemorrhoids or apostemas (abnormal growths) in the anus, then you must make the cathartic very subtle and dense, like those used for children.
The cure for plagues.
And I have said in the division of the cure for plagues earlier that it is suitable for a free person, and I say so too, the cure for these with me and with medicines according to complement.
So I say that plagues are diversified according to how they are made and according to the place on which they are placed.
And the causes by which many times plagues are made are just like getting a blow from a peyra (a type of hammer), or an incision with a knife, or a piercing with a lance, or with a fist, or with an arrow, or similar to those many causes.
But the plagues that are on the parts of the body are just like those which appear on the head, or neck, or legs, or belly, or thigh, and similar to those of the members.
And I recommend the cure for some plagues, by which one paces this reasoning and rule on other plagues.
And I will start with the simple plagues of the head, for the memory of the complex ones will come at the beginning of the fourth chapter.
So I say that when a simple plague occurs on the head and it is not a fracture, then consider: if it is due to a blow from a peyra (a type of hammer) or similar, and the wound has already become large and there are concerns about impending apostema (abscess), then you must apply fleubotomia (cupping) to the cephalic area at once, without delay; and extract blood according to the quantity of virtue present in it, unless there is some other cause that prohibits cupping, especially if the blood that has flowed from the plague is little.
And the cupping should be done on the opposite side of the affected area; and take care to keep the patient from taking in excess food, drink, or heavy victuals.
But if any prohibited cause exists, then reduce the food and do not approach meat or wine.
And apply poultice to the wound, if an abscess is forming, using warm oil or wine that has been made stiptic.
But if it is certain that an abscess is forming, then apply poultice to the wound, if it is fresh with its own blood and the air has not yet changed that powder which I recommend you to use in small amount.
And if the air has already changed it, then apply poultice on a similar substance until it is healed.
But if the wound is large or caused by an incision with a knife and similar, and the lips of it are not adjusted for pus, then adjust those with suture according to what I recommend about the suture of them.
But if the wound is discovered on the bone and skin, and there is no retention of pus but only a small suppuration, then incise it and carefully cure the wound with medicines and restore the flesh to its natural state in that area, and command the patient to abstain from foods that are gross: heads and forms that resemble theirs, until they are composed.
And if you find putrefaction in the code (bone) and it does not adhere to the bone, then you should incise all that is putrid and remove it, and carefully cure what remains.
But if in these plagues there is an artery or vein from which blood can flow and it is not cut off by medicines, then you must inquire about the artery, and if you find that it is uncut, then you must cut it with a spatula or tie it; and if necessary, you must cause what we have said not to come together again, then you must cauterize until the blood is stopped.
And if these plagues are simple and small, then the cause of them is light; so that you can powder over them with this powder, since it has consolidated before the air changes those.
And the manner of the powder is this: take oil of sesame, one part; blood of dragon, two parts; and no-extinct cause, three parts; mix all together well and finely ground, and fill the wound with it; and construe it by good constriction so that it adheres well to the wound, and be coagulated with blood.
And apply the powder above it with pills and let it be, and do not remove it until it is like that and has not become abscessed, for the medicine is not absorbed from it until it is healed.
And sometimes it happens that this alone is sought out, when you do not have in your presence sesame and blood of dragon.
And already do this same operation in the great plagues when it is necessary to apply poultice over them and tighten, and so recent plagues with their own blood, which the air has not yet altered.
And if the air has altered them, and especially when it is in the time of summer, then do not think about the position of this powder, but instead cure those with what we have said, by applying a poultice made from alcus enguents (perhaps a type of mold) or by applying powdered wheat flour mixed with water and honey to create a poultice; and carefully cure them with another remedy until they are healed.
But if there is a fracture in the bone, and it is small, then you should extract that with gentle hands.
And you should say that the cure for fractures of the head is in this which is venomous.
Of the plagues of the neck.
But if the plague occurs in the neck, then there is no difference in medicine between that and a simple plague of the head.
But if the nerves of the neck are cut or an artery is injured, then if it is a nerve, do not intervene with surgery but rather avoid any cure that would cause violent stipticitat (drying or astringent properties), just like zinc and egg white which are like vitriol and similar to them that do not nourish the nerves and contract those. And do not apply any cause to the plague that is all frozen, for the substance of the nerves is frozen and its continuation is in the brain, which is the most noble part of all the members.
And if it is that which is cured by light medicines, just like is caused washed with sweet water, some time injected into warm or not-warm oil, and when it is washed with sweet water and the other small pieces are molded according to this manner, and moistened with gentle heat.
But if the plague is great, then administer suture, or tighten the edges of it, and carefully cure it with powder until it is healed.
But if the plague has depth or occurs in the lowest part of the poultice, then pierce it at the most depressed location.
But if the plague has already cut an artery and blood is flowing, then separate or dry it, or tie it off, or cauterize it if necessary, to prevent further bleeding.
But if the vertebrae of the neck or all have been injured and the veins of the neck are saved, then you should adjust the edges of the spine with sutures over the canal of the neck and do not touch that; instead, gently pull it and reduce it to its natural shape, and carefully strengthen it with decent stricture, and leave it for a few days; and carefully cure it with poultices in which there is stipticitat (drying) and excitatio (stimulation), until it is healed.
But if the plague has caused a fracture in the bone, then pierce it, and if there are fragments of bone, extract all those that you can from them; and what is not apparelled (perhaps referring to a type of splinter or fragment), leave it until the plague subsides, and be separated, and the excrescence (a type of swelling or protuberance) be alleviated.
And if the plague is recent, then powderize over it the powder which I have recommended. But if the plague has caused a fistula, then cure it with what will come in its own chapter.
If it is a blow from a lance or knife, and it has pierced to the depth, then consider whether there is ventosity (perhaps referring to an abscess or pus-filled cavity) in the plague when the patient complains; know that the plague is mortal.
And if there is no depth in it and the plague is recent with its own blood, then you should apply powder to it at first hour, and not strengthen it so that the blood does not become retained in the depth of it and returns to the heart and kills the patient, but rather pause on it attractive poultice, and remove it twice a day.
And if the poultice is not at your present, then you should pause in the orifice of the plague with a cloth well-wetted so that it sucks up what remains of the moisture; and make sure the patient sleeps over the plague so that water that is in it may be adjusted.
But if three days or more have passed since the plague began and there is no sign of spasms, tremors of the heart, nor constriction of the soul, and times the other good dispositions are present in him, then know that the plague is saved; and then cure it with gentle and another remedy until it is healed.
But if the healing of it is delayed, and all time has opened up, then know that a fistula has been made; cure it therefore by its own chapter.
And if the plague is due to incision by spatula or knife, and it is simple in the surface of the foot or hand, then cure it with what has been preceded by suture, if it is large, or with powder, if it is small.
But if it has caused a fracture in the bone, and there are fragments of bone that have been pierced, then you should twist the plague and pull out those fragments, if they are separated. But if they are not separated, then leave them inside until the plague subsides, as the extraction of them is alleviated.
And for the other plagues that occur in other members, the judgment in curing is the judgment of what we have said.
Of the plagues of the belly.
The indisposition which occurs in the belly is either great, or little, or middling.
And a small disruption is made difficult by another manner, and it seems that the reduction of theirs is more difficult, if you do not take care to insert their intrusion into its place soon, because it swells and becomes engrossed, making it difficult for the instrument to make an entry.
And therefore the best disruption is middling, because in that there is not difficulty in reducing the bowel, just as it is difficult in the two species mentioned earlier.
And you should know that the suture of the belly is according to four manners, but two sutures are common which apply to sutures of other plagues of the heart.
And two other sutures proper communicate with the other plagues, but however they are more proper in the suture of the belly.
And I recommend to you whatever exposition and declaration.
Therefore I say that when the plague is small and there is some cause of the bowel due to it, and it is made difficult to reduce that, then this is in one of two manners: or by the parvity of the disruption just as we have said, or when the bowel has come inflamed by the frigidness of the air.
And therefore when this is so, then it must be that you cut open that in such a way that you immerse a sponge or wet cloth in hot water only, or that you take in water of squinant, and cypress, and spike, and embrocate with that into the bowel until the inflammation is resolved.
And sometimes I have found that this has a drying effect (stipticitat), and it is better than plain water in resolving the inflammation.
And therefore when you see the inflammation to be resolved, then you should moisten the bowel with water in which is mixed a high and bitter altitude (malvas), because by this it is alleviated the instrument of it with little cause.
But if the instrument is excused from this treatment, then you should divide the disruption into small parts with an instrument to which they are inserted morrows.
And the first cure is better when it is proper and not too severe, and there is no occupation to cut too much because of necessity and faintness.
Of the instrument, see that its form is:
The one end of it is bent and acute, the other end not acute, the extremity is subtle, and not like the subtlety of a spatula, but rather obtuse by a little.
And therefore when the plague is amplified and extends outside the bowel, then it must be that its reduction should follow the form of nature in its own place, if possible above, because that is better.
But when the disruption is wide and is in the lower part of the belly, then it must be that you make the patient lie on their back, and elevate their hips higher than their head; and if it is in the upper part of the belly, then you should elevate the head and feet higher than the parts left.
And similarly, if the disruption is in one of the two parts of the belly, then you should pause your thought and consideration always so that the part where the plague is higher than the other.
And thus it is necessary that you administer this in great plagues and in middling plagues.
And in small plagues, pause this that is according to your preparation, and make it so that the minister be among your most trusted assistants, who has the entire disruption within his hand and adjusts the lips of it, and accordingly uncovers from there to there what sees the suture some other cause.
And this is the common method of suturing: take the needle, or count the needle according to the amount of the amplitude of the plague; and accordingly leave from the extremity of the disruption of the said ring finger, and strengthen the needle one, other than you do not put faith in both ends of the code, with two ends of the ciphac that is left over the code of the parts outside, until it makes it penetrate from that side; and you have already added two ends of the code and two ends of the ciphac, and so it has been made four orders.
And accordingly strengthen the thread with double faith in the circuit of the needle, and sometimes from two parts together, and accordingly add the two lips and the plague by decent addition; and accordingly leave the thickness of the finger and put another needle in that place, and accordingly tie that with thread as if it were a feast to the first needle; and do not stop doing this until there is no further need for needles until you have completed all the contraction of the plague.
And the needles should be middling between coarseness and subtlety, because fine needles barely touch the flesh; and thick ones are difficult to insert into the thread, and therefore it is necessary that they be middling in subtlety and thickness.
And it is not necessary that the needle be inserted in both ends of the thread at once, for fear that the flesh will not be incised gently and that the plague will heal before its consolidation.
And they should not be prolonged in their suture so that the plague may not be prohibited from consolidation.
And accordingly, cut off the ends of the needles so that they do not bother the patient to sleep on them; and pause above the suture with powdered powder from all parts, which have the ends of the needles; and leave those there until you know that the plague is already consolidated.
And these species of suture with needles in this manner are more suitable for small plagues, because they require only one needle or two or around those.
But the second suture is common: and it is that you administer with suture the four ends, of the thread and two ends of the ciphac, in one go, with a needle wrapped with faithful thread in subtlety and thickness.
And accordingly, when the needle has penetrated these four ends, withdraw it from that middle part where you began, so that the thread will retract to the most superior part of the plague, in order that the suture be according to a cloth-like suture with which the cloths are strengthened.
And pause between each suture the quantity of the thickness of the ring finger.
And this suture is known by men.
And with this suture, I healed the wound that was inflicted on a man in his belly which had been wounded by a cutlass, and it was the disruption of a larger wound, about the size of a palm, and it was situated around two palms from the navel and it was the disruption in the middle of the member; and then I reduced that after 24 hours since the bowel had been opened up.
And the wound was consolidated in the space of 15 days or thereabouts, and I cared for him and he recovered; and accordingly, this is what happened to him for many years, and it has been converted into his disposition.
And the other doctors had judged that he would not be healed; and by miracle, it was so, for you did not apply to him the common treatment, which is not found in any place or medicine, but rather you paused over the wound with a cloth twice a day and assiduous washing with water of honey until he was healed.
But you described two species of suture proper according to the narration of Paraula.
And it is that you began with the suture of the thread, and inserted the needle from the outer part to the inner part.
And then, as the needle pierces into the thread and meets the lacertz in accordance with rectitude and length of the entire body, and leaves the end of the ciphac in which you inserted the needle; and makes it penetrate to the other end, from the inner part to the outer part, in the other extremity of the mihat.
And then, when you have made that penetration, then you make it penetrate again in the same extremity of the mihat from the outer part to the inner part; and leave the end of the ciphac that is in this place, and make the needle penetrate into the other extremity of the inner part to the outer part.
And make it penetrate with your penetration, which you make it penetrate into the ciphac in the extremity of the mirror that is in the part of him until all that penetrates.
And accordingly, begin on this side of the meeting place and sew it with the extremity that is of the ciphac in the other side, and extract the needle from the thread which has penetrated, and accordingly reduce it to that thread and sew the extremity of the ciphac that is on the other side with this extremity of the mirror; and extract that from the thread which is of the part of him.
And do so once and another time, and do so again and again until you have sewn all that is outside according to that example.
And the sum of this manner of suture is that you sew with a suture of pellicies in which you sew the pels, so that you sew the ciphac once from the part of the extremity of the thread, and then leave it there until it is complete.
But the second proper species of suture that you describe as Gualia, and this is a sermon for him and by him recounted, is that you sew according to semilitut with which all medicants sew it, in such a way that they add every part to their corresponding part to what is convenient by nature; and they apply the extremity of one side and the extremity of the mirror to the other extremity of one side, and this is done as you have recommended.
It is necessary that you place the needle at the extremity of the mirror, at your own side from the outer part, and make it penetrate into the inner part in that same place; and leave two ends of the ciphac; and accordingly, turn back the needle and make it penetrate from outside to inside in the two ends of the ciphac.
And accordingly, turn back those same ones, and make them penetrate from the inner part to the outer part in two other extremities of the mirror that are on the opposite side.
And this manner of suture is better than the common light suture, and it is the suture that was previously remembered.
This is the sermon of Gualia.
And it was said to them, the suture of the belly is rectified with two needles, so that you insert into these two one thread, and begin with the introduction of a needle from what belongs to you, and make it penetrate into the other side according to the suture of those who sew the skins together.
And you should know that when a disruption is in the middle location of the belly, then the suture of it is more difficult than for other locations in the belly.
But the judgment of wound healing is a judgment of other wounds.
The reason is that when you achieve the recent wound and place it on your blood before it has altered that one, and reduce the bowels and sew it up and adjust it decently, then pause over that flesh-colored powder.
And if the air has already altered the wound, then pause over that certain herbs which are at your presence, until they will make a strong purgation and cut the threads, and be consolidated ciphac and mirror; and accordingly, care for it just as is the cure of other wounds, until it is healed.
But if you don't have the medicines present, then pause over that for now, because it begins to grow old, coto viel, and is exchanged twice a day, just as I teach you, until it is healed, since you won't need another medicine in many dispositions when wounds are simple.
But if you fear that the wound communicates to lesion in the main members, then it is necessary that you immerse linen cloth in quality oil of temperance, or in rose oil, and pause that over the circuit of the places that are between the armpits and leave them thus.
And if you feel pain or putrefaction in your own bowels, because many times this has happened, then anoint it with vinegar stiptic black tea, and most especially if the purulence is perforated in the bowel and is made exitura penetrating into the cavity of the belly.
And you should know that what is in the thick bowel is of lighter purification than what is in the subtle bowels.
And it is of difficult healing because the bowel that is called "gegunu" does not receive healing from a wound that breaks out in it entirely; and this is because of the great multitude of veins that are in it and because of its magnitude, and because of the subtlety of the body of that part, and because of its proximity to the nature of nerves.
But if that which proceeds from the wound is the thread, and you succeed in getting it recent, then reduce it according to your rightness with which you reduce the bowels equally.
But if it has passed into the space and is already made green or black, then you should strengthen that with thread over the location that is depreciated from there, so that the blood flow comes back, because in the thread are veins and arteries.
And accordingly, inscribe this that is another ligament, and pause two ends of the thread pending on the left side of the wound outside, so that over you may be alleviated the attraction to the wound of what belongs to it, namely the shedding of the thread and emission of the branch of the wound.
Remembrance of wounds when they occur in the belly.
When a disruption occurs in the belly and it is small, then it is possible that it may be restored in some people, for thus you see that one who was wounded in his own belly with a blow from a lance and had a wound on the right side of the stomach, and the wound was old and made a fistula, and there was much trouble and ventosity.
Then I applied the treatment to it, whether or not it was being confused in its healing, but instead, I subtletized it until it was made whole and the place was consolidated.
And I saw that the place was already consolidated, then I gave advice to the sick person who had been afflicted with an evil accident in their own belly; and did not advise them to eat or drink anything, but instead they remained in bed and was exercised in their usual activities.
And it will be said to some experienced ones that when a wound occurs in the belly and is small, then it is necessary to bind it according to this manner: you take a few pieces of great caps; and accordingly adjust the two lips of the wound and place one piece of those with an open mouth over the two lips of the wound; therefore, when you press upon them and strengthen your mouth, cut off the top of it, because they stick together and are not dissolved.
And accordingly, place another piece of fabric next to the first one, and do not stop doing this with pieces of fabric one after another according to the quantity of the entire wound.
And accordingly, reduce that and sew up the wound; and let those attached caps remain in the belly until the belly is healed; and there will not be any harm to the sick person.
And it is possible that the belly can be tied with a thin thread made from the belly of an animal attached to it, since it is more in need of stitching; and that you take the end of these threads from the belly, and is not completely desiccated, and accordingly tie the end of it with a thread of the same kind, wrapped around, and accordingly insert that thread into stitches and sew it to the belly, and reduce it in the disruption.
And this manner of suture with fabric is nothing but according to the way of faith and hope.
But if the wound is great and wide, especially if it is in one of the subtle bowels, for then it is not enough to simply subtletize, but rather it is a complete healing that is needed.
The treatment of ulcer and fistula.
Know that every wound and abscess when it becomes old and is made into an ulcer, and does not consolidate and grows a branch all the time and is not cut off, then, wherever it may be in any member, universally it is called fistula and we call it zuchem.
And fistula, according to truth, is a nodalized, hard, white substance with which there is no pain and into which is introduced just as it is introduced into the pain of a bird; and for this reason it is called "alcus rizatz", that is, "pain".
And it is in some people that the fistula is humid, which grows a branch; and the humidity is soon absorbed in a few hours. And at times this humidity is much, and it is little, and it is great, and it is subtle.
And now I have shown all those causes and their signs, and the cure for them with medicines in the division.
And it is necessary that you know the cure for fistula, which is made by way of operation with me.
And know that fistula occurs in all the members of the body; for among those are fistulas that penetrate to the great veins and arteries, or to the nerves, or to the ciphac, or to the belly, or to the bladder, or to some of the ribs, or to some of the vertebrae of the back, or to some of the joints composed by composition like that of the hand and foot; and among those are those that give proximity to the main member and similar things.
And therefore that one of these fistulas which is according to this manner is one of the difficult-to-heal diseases, and does not receive treatment, and occupation with it is labor and ignorance.
And if it is one of the fistulas that has a depth that does not reach to those places that I have said, and you wait and trust in the cure for it, and you want to come to knowledge of it, then take a tenta de eram or ferr, and if the fistula follows the natural course, and you will procure that one with it.
But if the fistula is twisted, then investigate it with a subtle lead tenta of plom, because lead with the lightness of its own body is alleviated and curved away from the twisting.
And if the fistula is accompanied by many horrible things, it is not possible for you to signify on it with a tenta.
Then close the orifice for its own orifices, because the humidity which you use to clean it goes through other orifices and flows out of them.
And accordingly, inquiring extremely carefully, according to which manner it is possible for you to know if there are bones or nerves here, and whether the fistula is distant or near, or whether this is a fistula with many orifices and situated above everything, by the sum of your strength, with your investigation, by which you investigate the sick person, and the invention of pain is due to your compression on the spot, and similar signs and causes that occur in the apostema.
And when you have stood on all those causes at your station, then go to the cure with confidence: and it is that you consider now whether the fistula is an apparent nearby one or in a salubrious place, distant from a joint, nerve, artery, vein, or one of the places which I have told you about.
And then you will seal the fistula according to what has been said before about its narration, and thus it is in that filtration and corruption of flesh, and that which is born from the orifice of the flesh, or from the heel and similar things, and cure it until it is healed.
But if the fistula is of great depth and follows its natural course, then you must incise it as deeply as possible, and accordingly cleanse it of all its corrupted flesh; and accordingly administer some wrapped in acute medicines, and introduce those into the conquest of the fistula, which you have comprehended with iron.
And then use this with that a few times until the acute medicine has eaten away all that remains in the conquest of the fistula from corruption.
And accordingly, restore that with gentle things which generate healthy flesh until it is healed.
But if it is not healed by this, then you must cauterize that according to what we have recounted.
But if the cause of fistula is bone and it is necessary for you to be certain about this, then you must inquire into it and seal it according to what we have recounted, if you do not prohibit any cause from a vein, nerve, or main member as we have said.
But if the bone is uncovered and there is some corruption and blackness in it, then you must remove that until all the corruption is gone; and accordingly, cure that with what lies within, until it is healed.
And if it is not healed and gives a branch as before, then you must know that you have not reached the total eradication of corruption; and accordingly, uncover over it again and make the reason of it and the cleansing of it with the last remaining force, and accordingly, restore that.
And thus if it is healed, good it is; and otherwise, then you must know that that corruption is in the profound depth of the body, which you have not succeeded in reaching, and accordingly, there is nothing for you to do but to leave it.
And if the corrupted bone is small, or it is possible for you to draw it in, then you must draw it with subtle forceps that are suitable for this.
And if there are many bones, then you must make the extraction of all those, and leave no cause with your strength.
But if some cause of the humors makes you contrariety, and in their incision there is no fear or error, then you must incise those ligaments or flesh if they are here, and deliver the bones.
But if you are not prepared to remove the bones of your hour, then pause over the wound that causes the wound to ache, and leave it until this is in the environs of those bones of flesh and ligaments, and guard the wound so that it is not consolidated, and be constrained by the section which you have incised in your operation.
If you fear, pause over it with a poultice submerged in sweet oil or a poultice submerged in Egyptian gentleness or some of the green poultices, for when those ligaments are loosened, and the bones are separated from their ablation, and that attraction is alleviated.
But if it is a great bone like the bone of camel or coyote or similar to those, and what is corrupted on its surface is only the face of it so far, then you must remove that with an instrument only at the back until that blackness and corruption is removed, and accordingly restore the wound.
But if what is corrupted on its surface is a great part, and the corruption has already reached the marrow of the bone, then it is necessary to close that and incise it entirely into the place where the corruption has occurred, and accordingly cure that until it is consolidated.
And I recommend to you that you find someone in your neighborhood who can help you with an example and assistant on your operation.
Find a young man of about xxx years old who has a pain in his shoulder, and the parts inside are swollen, which is on the matter inside the body until the matter reaches the shoulder, and it is matter of apostema with great apostema, and there is no external cause.
And then the time was extended with that error of the doctors until the apostema was hardened, and a collection of materials formed, and his cure was accordingly postponed until the camel's hump was fistulated, and it made its way out through the many orifices which were all pouring forth pus and the humors of the body.
And then the many doctors around two years, and there was no knowledge in them but in the art, until you were called.
And I saw the hump of his camel and the materials that were flowing from it through those orifices into a great body; and already the body of that man was entirely stabilized, and the color of him was citrine.
And then I introduced the tentacle into one of those orifices and brought the tentacle to the bone.
And accordingly, I examined all the orifices and found those that came from all parts of the hump.
And then I cut into and incised one of those orifices until I discovered a part of the bone, and found it corrupted, and already it was rotten and corrupted and denigrated; and already a part of the hump had penetrated into the marrow.
And then I prepared that which was discovered to me, and made ready the bone that was uncovered.
And I cut out that which was not in the bone, but was corruption which abscessed and hardened, and I had already drained it.
And accordingly, I paused the restoration of the wound with consolidative medicines for a long time, and it was not consolidated.
And accordingly, I iterated and discovered anew on the bone secondarily on the first discovery, and found continuous corruption in the bone.
And accordingly, I prepared what appeared to me from that corruption, and accordingly, I was forced to perform the cure and restoration, but it was not restored.
And then I discovered another way and did not cease to incise the small bone little by little, particularly, and forced the restoration of it, but it was not restored until I incised around a palm's width from it, and that extracted with its own marrow, and accordingly restored it with medicines, and it consolidated slightly and healed.
And it is not necessary to iterate in the operation of him and his section except for the disposition of the fool's foolishness and the scarcity of tolerance of him and fear of his death, because to him it occurs at all hours due to superfluous evacuation of bad syncopes.
And therefore, he is healed through entire healing, and nothing remains in the place of hard bone; and it has been made good the disposition of him within his own body, and returned to him the virtue of him; and he has been converted into his own dispositions, and did not do anything contrary to himself in movement or harm in any cause.
But if there is a prominent bone in the location of the body that has been injured, then you must cut it according to this method: take a ligament and strengthen it at the extremity of that prominent bone; command someone to extend it; pause the ligament of thicker wool than the first ligament; accordingly, tie it over the flesh that is left on the bone, and extend the extremity of it so that you attract the flesh to the parts left over, and then uncover the flesh above the location which you want to cut in order to prevent the cut from reaching the flesh.
And pause a fist or table left on the bone downwardly, because when you do this, it is not prohibited for the cut to not touch the corrupted flesh.
And it is necessary that the cut be made gradually over the location of corruption, because if it is in the concavity of the bone and does not appear in its appearance to the sense, and forcedly another way of cutting must be found.
And if the bone is corrupted and non-eminent, it is best to leave one part continuous with the other, and the corruption is in the middle location or in a part of it, then you must uncover the flesh from all parts entirely; and accordingly, pause fist below, and accordingly cut that from the first part where the corruption is located, until the cutting of the other part is continued.
And let the cut be according to the location of the corruption a little, as we have said.
And if the corruption is at the junction, incise that corrupted junction, and cut the bone where it continues from the other part.
And if the corruption is in the continuation of two joints, then it is not in proportion but rather an engine.
And if the corruption is in the pectoral area of the arm or the chest, it is very difficult; however, you must inquire into the corruption as to how it appears to you, and open up that, and remove it according to whatever disposition is possible for you, and with every engine be rectified to your advantage, when it does not cause contrariety to come forth or nerves.
And know what are the incisors and the cuts to cut these bones are many according to the situation of the bones, and their preparation, and their thickness, and subtlety, and grandeur, and smallness, and hardness, and their rarity; for which it is necessary that you prepare all kinds of instruments convenient for each operation.
And know that this operation means something to you about the type of instrument which you need; when with you is great study and long and deep knowledge of the ways of this art, and testimony of ways of diseases, for then already you have had them by your own experience, what is convenient for every disease.
And now I will give you the list of instruments which you will pause with as simple ones, and with which you will proceed to your prohibition which you will experience on others. Forma de serra:
