On the rupture that occurs in the groin.
Chapter 67.
When a rupture occurs in the groin, as we said, and the area swells, and nothing of the intestines descends to the testicles; and if something descends, it is little, and it returns every hour. But if time is prolonged with it, a tear is added in the membrane, until the intestines descend into the membrane.
And this happens from the extension of the membrane, which is in the groin, as we said.
That is, because the membrane is stretched: then it softens, the area swells, and it protrudes.
And its treatment is with cautery, as previously narrated.
And sometimes it is treated with surgery, in the following way: that the patient should lie on his back between your hands.
Then cut the swollen and protruding rupture site, with an incision across it the width of three fingers.
Then tie the membrane and what is under the skin, until the white membrane, which is under the skin that follows it, is revealed.
Then take a rod, and place it on the protruding area of the membrane, and press it to the depth of the abdomen.
Then sew the two protruding places over the end of the rod from the membrane, and connect one of them with the other using a suture: then withdraw the end of the rod.
And do not cut the membrane entirely, nor extend the testicle, nor anything else, as I explained to you in the treatment of intestinal ruptures.
Then treat it with wound care.
So when you cut the threads, clean it, and restore the wound until it is healed.
For the membrane contracts, and the protrusion of the rupture does not increase.
And cautery is better in this location because it is closer to healing.
