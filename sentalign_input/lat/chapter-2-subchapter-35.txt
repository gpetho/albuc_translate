On Removing a *Ranula* (Cyst) Beneath the Tongue.
Chapter 35.
Sometimes, a cyst resembling a small frog (called a *ranula*) forms beneath the tongue, hindering its natural movement and potentially enlarging enough to fill the mouth.
The procedure requires opening the patient's mouth in good light to examine the cyst.
If it appears dark brown or black, hard, and lacks sensation, do not touch it, as this could indicate cancer.
However, if it appears whitish and moist, insert a hook and incise it with a fine scalpel, freeing it from all sides.
If bleeding interferes with the procedure, apply powdered *zegi* to control it. Then resume the operation until the cyst is fully removed.
Afterward, rinse with vinegar and salt, and continue treatment with appropriate aftercare until it heals completely.
