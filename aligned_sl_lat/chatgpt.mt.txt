After I completed for you, O sons, this book, which is the final one in medical science, along with its supplements, and I reached its end with its explanations and clarifications, it seemed fitting to me to complete it for you with this Treatise, which is a part of practice, that is, surgery by hand.
Since the practice of manual surgery has fallen in our region, and in our time has been almost entirely lost, until perhaps the knowledge of it perished, and its traces were cut off. Only small descriptions of it remain in the books of the ancients, altered by other hands, where errors and confusion have arisen, until its purposes became closed off and its efficacy weakened. It seemed to me fitting to bring it back to life with the organization of this Treatise, following the way of exposition, clarification, and abbreviation, and to include the forms of the cautery tools and other instruments of the practice, with explanations added and with the necessary urgency.
The reason why a skilled practitioner in this art with his own hand is not found in our time is because the art of medicine is extensive, and its practitioner must first be trained in the science of anatomy, as described by Galen, until he knows the functions of the parts, their forms, and their connections and separations, and has knowledge of the bones, nerves, muscles, and their numbers and origins, as well as of the veins, both pulsating and still, and the places of their exits.
And because of this, Hippocrates said that name with name is plentiful, but with practice it is scarce, especially in the art of the hand.
We have already spoken of this in the introduction of this book.
For anyone who does not know what we have said about anatomy is not immune from error, an error by which people are killed, as I have seen many of those who are trained in this science and boast of it without knowledge and without experience.
For instance, I saw a foolish physician who cut into a scrofulous abscess on a woman’s neck and severed certain arteries in her neck, causing her blood to flow until she died in his hands.
And I saw another physician who presumed to extract a stone from an older man, and the stone was large.
He therefore reached the stone and extracted it along with a piece of the bladder.
Thus the man died on the third day.
And I had been called to extract the stone myself, but I saw from the size of the stone and the patient’s condition that he would die.
And I saw another physician who took payment from a certain Duke of our land for his practice, and a black eunuch under his care suffered a fracture in his leg near the heel. The physician, in his ignorance, rushed and bound the fracture over the wound with cushions and tight splints, not allowing the wound to breathe.
Then he discharged him according to his own wishes.
Afterwards, he left him for several days and instructed him not to loosen the bandage, and so it remained until his leg and foot became infected, resulting in ruin.
I was therefore called to him, and I hurried to loosen the bandage, and peace followed, and he was freed from his pains.
Nevertheless, the decay in the limb was already set in, and I could not halt it.
Thus, the decay ceased to spread through the limb until it perished.
And I saw another physician who pierced a cancerous abscess, and it became ulcerated after several days, until its malignancy grew along with the suffering of its owner.
This is because, when cancer is purely from a melancholic humor, it must never be treated with iron at all, unless it is in a limb that can endure having the entire affected area excised.
And therefore, O sons, it is necessary for you to know that manual operation is divided into two categories: namely, operations associated with safety, and operations that involve danger in many conditions. And I have already pointed out in every place in this book where there is an operation involving terror and fear.
Therefore, it is necessary for you to be cautious of such things and to avoid them, so that fools do not find a reason to speak and dishonor the profession.
Therefore, approach with care and protection, and treat your patients with gentleness and firmness, using the best method, guided by the grace of God toward health and praiseworthy outcomes; and avoid terrible illnesses that are difficult to heal; and keep your souls from things that cause you fear, lest hesitation should enter your faith and your practice. For this will be of greater benefit to your glory, and will elevate you more in this world, and ultimately increase your honor.
Galen has already said in certain of his teachings: Do not treat a malignant disease, lest you be called a poor physician.

¶ On the Benefit and Harm of Cautery, and for which temperaments it is suitable, and at what time: and whether with iron or with gold.
Chapter I.
But before I discuss the procedure with it, it is necessary to speak of its benefits and harms, and in what temperament it should be applied.
I say, then, that the discourse on the nature of the benefit and harm of cautery is a long and subtle matter, involving knowledge and hidden secrets.
Many wise men have spoken about it, and there has been disagreement on it; for me, a little of their discourse will suffice, as I wish to avoid length.
I say, then, that cautery is universally beneficial for all temperaments with or without matter, except for two temperaments: those that are hot without matter and dry without matter.
But in the case of the hot and dry temperament with matter, there is disagreement.
Some have said that cautery is beneficial in this case.
Others have said the opposite, namely that cautery is not suitable for an illness arising from heat and dryness, because the nature of fire is heat, and it is unsuitable to treat a hot and dry illness with something that is also hot and dry.
And the one who claims the opposite says that cautery provides relief in any hot and dry illness occurring in human bodies, because when you compare the human body and its moistures to the temperament of fire, you find the human body to be cold.
And I myself agree with his words because experience has already shown me this many times.
Nevertheless, no one should apply it except one who has already been proven and trained in the chapter on cautery, through complete practice, and who understands the diversity of human temperaments, the disposition of illnesses within themselves, their causes, their symptoms, and their timing.
As for the remaining temperaments, there is no fear upon you, especially in cold and moist illnesses. Indeed, all physicians have agreed on these, and they have not disagreed on the benefit of cautery in such cases.
And know, my sons, that one secret of curing with cautery by fire, and its superiority over cautery with burning medicine, is that fire is simple, and its effect reaches only the member being cauterized and does not harm other parts connected to it, except with minimal harm.
The action of burning medicines, however, spreads to the surrounding parts, and it may even cause a difficult-to-heal illness in the affected member, or it may even kill.
But fire, because of its subtlety and the quality of its substance, does not cause this unless it is excessive.
And indeed, this has become known to us through experience, due to prolonged service and study in the art, and dedication to the truth of things; because of this, I excuse myself from prolonging the discussion.
And know, my sons, that they disagree on the time when cautery is best performed, and they consider spring to be the best time.
But I say that cautery is suitable at any time because the harm occurring due to timing is outweighed by the benefit drawn from cautery.
Especially when cautery is needed for pains among the necessary pains—severe, sudden, and not tolerating delay—because it is feared that a greater harm may arise than the small harm brought by the timing.
And do not let it enter your minds, O sons, what only the common people and ignorant physicians believe, namely, that the illness cured by cautery never returns; they take this as certain, but it is not as they think. Cautery is no more than a substitute for medicine, which changes the temperament and dries the moistures that are the causes of pain.
Nevertheless, cautery surpasses medicine through the speed of its healing power, the strength of its action, and the intensity of its efficacy. And it is possible that the illness may return at some time, depending on the patient’s temperament, the location of his illness, and its strength, as well as what accumulates in his body from an aggregation of superfluities within it, and from what it acquires from foods and other similar causes—unless it is an illness for which cautery is applied. A subtle illness in a part of the body with few superfluities and humidities, as in the case of cautery of a tooth for pain, and similar instances, may indeed not return in that area with the same pain.
But this happens in few cases.
However, the common saying, again, that cautery is the final remedy, is a correct saying—not for the reason they assume in it, because they believe that there is no treatment that matches medicine, nor any other remedy after cautery has failed.
But the reality is the opposite of that, and the meaning of cautery as the final remedy is only that when we have applied all methods of treatment to some illness, and those medicines do not succeed, then we finally apply cautery, and it is effective; hence it is said that cautery is the final remedy—not with the intention understood by the common people and the multitude of ignorant physicians.
The ancients said that cautery with gold is better than cautery with iron; and they said this only because of the uniformity of gold and the excellence of its substance; and they said that the cauterized place does not produce pus. But this is not absolutely true, for I have already tested it and found that it does not do this in some bodies, while it does in others.
And cautery with gold is good and better than with iron, as they said.
Nevertheless, when you heat a gold cautery in the fire, it is not clear to you when it reaches the desired degree of heat because of the redness of the gold; and when it quickly cools, and if you add more heat, it melts in the fire and turns into thin layers.
Thus, the practitioner is inconvenienced by it, and for this reason, cautery with iron is faster and more accessible for us, being more straightforward in operation.
And I have indeed arranged this chapter on cautery according to topics, and I have ordered them from head to foot, so as to make it easier for the one who seeks what he wants from it. On the method of cauterizing the head at the coronal suture.
Chapter II.
This cauterization helps to control moisture and coldness over the brain: which are two causes of headaches, and excessive flow of humors from the head to the parts of the eyes and ears, and excess sleep, and tooth pain, and throat pain; and generally all illnesses that arise from cold, such as paralysis, headaches, epilepsy, apoplexy, and similar illnesses.
The method of cauterization is to instruct the patient: first to be purged with a cleansing medicine for the head over three or four nights, according to the strength, age, and usual condition of the patient.
Then instruct him to have his head shaved with a razor.
Then make him sit upright between your hands, so that he has already placed his hands on his chest.
Then place the base of your palm on the base of his nose between his eyes. Wherever your middle finger reaches, mark that place with ink. Then heat the olive-shaped cautery tool: which has this form. Then place it on the spot marked with ink, with a downward motion, gradually applying pressure with your hand, and rotate it.
Then lift your hand quickly, and examine the spot.
If you see that an area the size of an alkiel seed or a zeuherb seed has been exposed to the bone, then lift your hand.
If not, repeat the process with the same tool, or another one if it has cooled, until the bones I told you of are visible.
Then take some salt, dissolve it in water, soak a piece of cloth in it, and place it on the spot, and leave it there for three days.
Then place over it a cloth soaked in butter, and leave it on the spot until the burn scab is removed. Then treat it with tetrapharmacon ointment until it heals.
They have said that the longer the wound remains open, the more pus it discharges: thus it is better and more beneficial.
Some of them said to cauterize the skin down to the bone: and hold the cautery until some thickness of the bone is burnt.
Then shave off the part of the bone that has been burnt, then treat it.
Others say that it is necessary to go to the end with the cautery, so that it makes a strong impression on the bone, so that the bone falls away, forming something like the shape of a kirate, or like the instrument women use with small carved letters, believing that the head vapors escape from this spot, and the wound is left open for a long time.
Then treat it until it heals.
To me, however, these two forms of cautery do not seem advisable, except in certain people as a last resort.
In my view, leaving it as it is, is better for his well-being.
For the head is weakened by the disruption of its natural integrity, as we have observed in other limbs, especially when the head of the patient is naturally weak: and the first form of cautery is indeed safer and better in my opinion, and I use it; therefore, perform it with care for health.
On the method of cauterizing the head in cases of pain throughout the entire head.
Chapter III.
When chronic pain occurs in the whole head and persists in the patient, and he uses syrups, oils, head purgatives, and ointments.
And especially if it has already been cauterized with the cautery we have described, and none of these treatments help him, then consider the following.
For if the head of the patient is naturally strong and not weak, and he feels intense cold, then cauterize with another cautery slightly below that spot.
Then cauterize on each side of his head with a cautery, until it passes through the skin and exposes the amount of bone we have mentioned.
And cauterize him with one cautery on the back of his head, in the place called "vas," where the cup is applied; lift your hand in this, and do not expose the bone.
For the patient will feel intense pain from this, unlike the pain from the other head cauteries.
And I will describe this cautery in its place: and it is necessary that it is a cautery used for cauterizing the sides and back of the head, more finely than the cautery used on the center of the head.
And this is its form.
On the method of cauterizing in hemicrania, both with burning medicine and with iron.
Chapter IV.
When pain and headache occur in part of the head, or the pain extends to the eye, and the head is cleared with cleansing medicines, and the rest of the treatment I mentioned in the divisions of ailments is applied and still does not help: then cauterization is done in one of two ways: either with a sharp burning medicine, or with iron. The cauterization with sharp burning medicine involves taking one clove of garlic, peeling it, and cutting off its ends on both sides.
Then make an incision at the site of the pain with a broad lancet, until there is a place under the skin where the clove can fit.
Then insert it under the skin until it is hidden: next apply a pad with appropriate pressure over it, and leave it for about fifteen hours, then remove it, extract the garlic, and leave the wound for two or three days; afterward, place a cloth soaked in butter over it until the place produces pus; then treat it with ointment until it heals.
And if you wish, perform it with certain burning medicines that I wrote about in the twelfth treatise, on Burning Medicines.
The cauterization with iron is done in this way.
Heat the cautery tool, which has this form.
It is called the "Clauilis" because the shape of its head resembles a nail, with a slight curve, and in the middle of it is a small protrusion.
Then place it on the spot, hold your hand steady, and gradually rotate the iron with speed; let the amount burned from the skin thickness be about half of it.
And lift your hand so that the artery beneath is not burned, causing a flow of blood.
Then soak a cloth in salt water, place it on the spot, and leave it for three days; then place a cloth with butter on it; afterward treat with ointment until it heals. And if you wish, cauterize this hemicrania with the blade tip of the second cautery.
And be careful not to cut the artery in this hemicrania, as it is not a typical case.
On the method of cauterizing for an old hemicrania.
Chapter V.
When you treat hemicrania using the preceding treatment we mentioned and what we described in the divisions of ailments, and the treatment is ineffective, and you see from the illness that what we said about the initial cautery with medicine or with fire is not enough, then you should heat the knife-shaped cautery until it turns white, after marking the area of pain with a line about half a finger’s length or close to that; place your hand down once, and press it until you cut into the artery and reach the bone. However, it is necessary for you to avoid the area of the jaw joint, which moves during chewing, to avoid burning the side or the nerve that controls it, lest spasm result.
And be cautious and careful regarding the blood flow from the artery that is severed.
For there is danger in its cutting, especially for one who does not know what he is doing and is neither diligent nor experienced, and abandons the procedure at the first difficulty.
And I will address the regulation of blood flow that may occur from the artery in its own proper method and place in this book.
But if you see from the illness that this cautery is insufficient for him, and you see that the patient’s body can tolerate the cautery in the middle of the head, as we have described, treat the wound until it heals.
And if you wish, apply the cautery we described in the chapter on artery extraction, using a cautery with two blades.
For this cauterization is better than this one and more effective. On the method of cauterizing in cases of ear pain.
Chapter VI. When pain in the ear occurs due to cold, and it is treated with loosening agents and the remaining treatment mentioned in the division, and the pain does not subside, then heat the cautery, called "the Point," which has this shape.
Then, after heating it, use it to puncture around the entire ear, as it is revolved, or around both if there is pain in both ears at the same time.
And keep the cautery a little distance from the root of the ear after marking the locations with ink; let the amount of cautery be about ten points on each ear, or so.
Then treat the locations until they heal.
On the method of cauterizing in cases of Tortura.
Chapter VII.
The tortura treated with cauterization is only one of the conditions that arise from phlegm, as we said in the divisions of ailments. And avoid cauterizing the type that arises from dryness and nerve spasm.
When you treat this type of tortura with syrups, head purgatives, and gargles, and your treatment is ineffective, then you should cauterize the patient in three places: one at the root of the ear, the second a little lower near the temple, and the third at the junction of the two lips.
And place your cautery on the side opposite the weakened area.
For the relaxation does not occur except in the part that appears healthy.
And the procedure for cauterization is to cauterize him with the cautery directly below the upper end of the ear near the horn of the head a little; and another at the temple, the length of which is the length of a thumb.
And place your hand down with the cautery until half the thickness of the skin is burned.
And this is the form of the cautery, which is a type of knife, whose shape was previously shown; however, it is a bit less delicate, as you see, and it should be slightly thicker than necessary. Then treat the locations with the same treatment as before until they heal.
On the method of cauterizing in cases of chronic apoplexy.
Chapter VIII.
When apoplexy has become chronic, and you treat it as we have described, and your treatment is ineffective, and the patient does not have a fever, then cauterize him with four cauteries on each corner of his head, a cautery in the middle of the head as we have discussed, and a cautery at the back of the head, as previously outlined. The method for these cauteries should follow the previously described approach.
Additionally, apply a cautery over the pit of the stomach, which is the last step in this method.
Then treat the cauterized areas following the earlier instructions.
On the method of cauterizing for cases of memory loss.
Chapter IX.
To begin, the patient should be given a drink containing potent hyeerae and pills that purify the brain.
Then, shave the patient's entire head and apply a mustard plaster over the occiput, as described in the chapter on plasters, and repeat this application several times. This serves as a form of cautery, and perform it according to the sequence described in that section. If the patient is healed by this, it is well.
If not, then make three cauteries on the back of the head, extending from the top of the head down to the lower part of the eye, spacing each cautery a finger’s width apart.
Then treat the cauteries as previously instructed.
If you want to add more, and the patient can tolerate it, then make an additional cautery in the middle.
If further treatment is desired, then cauterize over the two horns of the head.
Then treat the patient until he is healed, using the olive-shaped cautery as previously described.
On the method of cauterizing in cases of paralysis and muscle relaxation.
Chapter X.
It is necessary to proceed with cleansing the head using hyeeras and according to the previously described methods.
Then shave the patient’s head; afterward, apply a cautery in the middle of the head, a cautery on each corner of the head, one on the back, and three on the vertebrae of the neck.
If the ailment requires more extensive muscle relaxation and the patient can tolerate it, and the ailment is severe, then apply four cauteries on the vertebrae of the back, with the last cautery burning deep into the skin until much of it is seared, then lift your hand.
Then treat him until he is healed, using the olive-shaped cautery in this manner.
On the method of cauterizing in cases of epilepsy.
Chapter XI.
Epileptics should only be cauterized if their condition is caused by phlegm. Thus, the brain must first be cleansed with hyeeras and other treatments mentioned in the section on disease division, especially if the patient is an adult or can tolerate medicines.
However, if the patient is a child and cannot tolerate medication, administer gargles and chewing agents that purify the brain over several days along with good dietary practices.
Then, shave his head, and apply one cautery in the middle of the head as previously outlined, one on the back of the head, and one on each corner of the head.
If the patient is strong and can tolerate it, apply cauteries as described for paralysis and body relaxation, along the cervical and dorsal vertebrae, using the olive-shaped cautery as previously described. For children, however, use a finer cautery, following this approach.
On the method of cauterizing in cases of melancholy.
Chapter XII.
When melancholy arises from corrupted humors and thick phlegm, apply cauteries as described for paralysis.
If melancholy is caused by an excess leading to melancholic conditions and the patient's body is moist, then give him a drink to purify the brain as described earlier; then shave his head and make a linen band like a small ring.
Place it on the center of the head, and have the patient sit in a stable, upright position held on all sides.
Next, prepare a liniment. This is best made from aged sheep’s butter.
Warm it gently over a fire to a temperature that a finger can comfortably withstand when dipped in.
Then pour it onto the middle of the head in the ring, and leave it until it cools.
Repeat this treatment once weekly, in combination with a proper regimen, until he is healed.
Alternatively, if desired, cauterize the patient by making numerous small punctures, carefully managing the cautery, ideally with a light touch.
This form of cautery moistens the brain beneficially.
Then apply a pad soaked in butter or chicken fat.
On the method of cauterizing for water descending to the eye.
Chapter XIII.
When signs of fluid accumulation in the eye become evident, as discussed in the disease divisions, begin by giving the patient something that will purify the head.
Keep the patient away from all sources of moisture, and have him sit in a steam bath while fasting for several days.
Then instruct him to shave his head, and apply a cautery to the middle of the head. Next, cauterize both temples if the fluid is affecting both eyes or on one side if it is in one eye, severing all veins and arteries under the skin with the cautery. These cauteries should extend along the temples' width; take care to avoid excessive blood flow.
If bleeding is observed, immediately cut it off with whatever means possible. I will elaborate further on artery extraction and cutting and ways to prevent excessive blood flow.
In some cases, two cauteries should be applied at the back of the neck, beneath the two bones, as a final step.
On the method of cauterizing in cases of chronic tearing.
Chapter 14.
When tears of the eyes are chronic, continuous, and located over the veins and arteries on the external surface of the head, it is confirmed that this is due to cold, phlegmatic excesses. Then cauterize with the same cautery I described at the beginning for descending fluid, with a cautery at the middle of the head, two cauteries over both temples, and two cauteries at the neck under the two bones.
And if you need to add more, then cauterize it on each side near the eye, on the tip of the eyebrow with a small cautery.
On the method of cauterizing in cases of nasal odor.
Chapter 15.
When you treat this with what we mentioned in the division, and the medication does not help, then hasten and give cochias in drink for three nights. Then shave his head, and cauterize it with a middle cautery, using an olive-shaped cautery.
Then cauterize it with a nail-shaped cautery with two cauteries, on both eyebrows just below the hairs.
And be careful of the artery, so you do not cut it.
And this is the form of the nail-shaped cautery.
On the method of cauterizing in the softening of the eyelid.
Chapter 16.
When the eyelid of the eye softens from disease or moisture, then cauterize the eyelid with a single cautery, using this crescent-shaped cautery.
And if you wish, cauterize it slightly over both eyebrows with two cauteries on each side, distancing them from the temples. And let each cautery’s length match the length of the eyebrow, and do not press your hand down with the cautery; rather, only cauterize about a third of the eyelid.
And this is the form of the cautery according to this crescent-shaped cautery method.
On the method of cauterizing the eyelid when inverted hairs prick the eye. Chapter 17.
The cautery for this is of two types: either cautery with fire or cautery with a burning medicine.
In cauterizing with fire, instruct the patient beforehand to let his hairs grow out, if he is one who trims them, until they are long and even. But if they prick him at their root, then bind his eyes with a band so that they do not move, until they grow.
When they grow out and are even, then place the patient’s head in your lap, then mark on his eyelid with ink in the shape of a myrtle leaf, starting the mark near the hairs.
Then place a cloth soaked in egg white or in psyllium mucilage over the eye.
Then heat the cautery, the form of which is this.
Then cauterize along the shape you marked gradually in many strokes, until the surface of the skin, shaped like the myrtle leaf, is properly burned entirely.
And the sign of success in your work is if you see the eyelid of the eye begin to contract and the hairs lift away from the puncture of the eye.
Then lift your hand and leave it alone for three days.
Then place a cloth with butter on it until the scab is removed.
Then treat it with ointment until it is healed.
But if some hairs return after a while, and the eyelid softens, then repeat the cauterization on that spot as you did the first time.
But if the hairs are in the lower part, then cauterize it until it is lifted to its natural position and leveled so that the hairs no longer prick the eye.
On the method of cauterizing with a burning medicine in the same case.
Chapter 18.
Instruct the patient to let his hairs grow until they are long and even.
Make a myrtle-leaf shape from a cloth paper.
Then take a known soap and unslaked lime, each in a weight of one ounce or close to that; then grind them together thoroughly, and do this quickly so it does not cool.
Then spread this mixture over the paper you made in the shape of a myrtle leaf, and place it on the eyelid of one or both eyes.
And place a cloth soaked in egg white under the eye, and the patient's head should rest in your lap.
Place your index finger on the medicine and press it gently.
Move it each time the patient feels the medicine’s stinging, as he perceives its sting like fire.
As long as he continues to feel the sting, leave the medicine in place and move it with your finger.
When the stinging stops, remove the medicine and wash the eye with water.
Then observe if the eyelid rises, as it would from contraction by fire or incision; if so, it is good. If not, reapply the medicine to the area where it did not take effect and did not darken, until your work is balanced and the eye contracts.
Then place a cloth with butter over it until the burned skin is removed.
Then treat it with diaphinicon ointment or another ointment until it heals.
During the procedure, you must exercise utmost care to ensure that none of the medicine falls into the eye.
If the eyelid softens after a few days and any hairs prick the eye, then repeat the medicine on the specific part of the eyelid that softened, as you did at first.
Then treat it until it heals.
And this is the shape of the myrtle leaf.
Know that human eyes vary in size and smallness.
Therefore, let your consideration be according to this, for the way of righteousness is not hidden from one dedicated to this art.
On the method of cauterizing in the case of a tear duct fistula.
Chapter 19.
When you treat a fistula using what we discussed in the divisions of diseases and your treatment is ineffective, then you should cauterize it according to this method.
Instruct the patient to place his head in your lap, and have an assistant hold his head in his hands so that it remains still and does not move.
Then place a cloth soaked in egg white or in a psillium mucilage over his eye; next, heat the cautery, which has this form.
It should be concave, like the shape of the tip of a vulture’s feather on one end, with which the cauterization is performed; and if you wish, it can be penetrating to the other end, and, if you prefer, it should be raised in this way.
However, this concave form is better for your work.
Then place on it the cautery, which has been heated very much.
And hold your hand steady on the cautery, positioned away from the eye towards the nose, so that your hand does not slip or the patient become disturbed; place the cautery on the fatty tissue of the eye and destroy it.
If with the beginning of your cauterization you reach the bone, it will be good.
If not, then repeat the cauterization once or twice as needed, and leave it for three days.
Then apply a cloth with butter and treat it with a drying ointment until it heals. If forty days pass and it does not heal, then apply a sharp, corrosive medicine until the bone is exposed, and scrape it as described in the relevant chapter.
There is another method of cauterizing a fistula that some early practitioners have described.
Direct your attention to the location of the fistula, split it open, and place a fine rod, that is, a thin tube, into the fissure, shaped like this.
Pour into it an amount of a drachma of molten lead, holding your hand steady on the tube with a good grip, and ensure the patient does not move at all, so that the lead does not flow or reach his eye.
It is essential to place a cloth soaked in egg white or water over the patient’s eye.
The lead burns the site of the fistula and heals it with remarkable efficacy.
If the fistula heals with the cautery and treatment as we described, it is good.
If not, then it is necessary to create an opening in the nose and redirect the fistula towards the nasal passage, as it naturally should be.
On the method of cauterizing in the fissures of the lips.
Chapter 20.
Frequently, fissures called “Pili” occur on the lip, especially on children’s lips.
When you treat these fissures using what we discussed in the divisions of diseases, and the treatment is ineffective, then heat a small, knife-shaped cautery to this form.
Its concavity should match the thinness of a knife.
Then treat it with wax ointment until it heals.
On the method of cauterizing an oral fistula.
Chapter 21.
When an abscess forms at the root of the gums, the palate, or the roots of the teeth, which produces pus, ruptures, and eventually ages, leading to a continual discharge of pus and the formation of a fistula, and if the treatment of it does not prove effective, then you must heat a cautery sized to fit the fistula.
Then insert the heated cautery into the opening of the fistula and hold your hand steady until the hot iron reaches the depth and end of the fistula. Do this once or twice as needed.
Then continue treating it afterward as we described in the treatment section until it is healed.
If the discharge ceases and it heals, it will be good.
But if it does not heal, then it is necessary to expose the area and remove the corrupted bone as described in the relevant chapter.
On the method of cauterizing softened gums and teeth.
Chapter 22.
When the gums are softened due to excess moisture, causing the teeth to loosen, and medicinal treatments are ineffective, place the patient's head in your lap.
Next, heat a cautery of the following form, place a small tube over the tooth, and quickly insert the heated cautery into the tube. Hold your hand steady for a moment until the patient feels the warmth of the heat reaching the root of the tooth.
Then lift your hand and repeat the cauterization several times as desired.
Then have the patient fill his mouth with saltwater and hold it there for an hour before spitting it out.
The loose tooth will firm up, the softened gums will tighten, and the excessive moisture will dry up.
Chapter 23.
When tooth pain is due to coldness or worms in the tooth, and medicinal treatments are ineffective, there are two methods of cauterization: cauterization with butter or with fire.
For cauterization with butter, take cow’s butter and boil it in an iron spoon or small vessel.
Then take a piece of cloth and wrap it around the tip of a probe.
Next, dip it into the boiling butter and quickly place it on the painful tooth, holding it there until it cools. Repeat this several times until the heat reaches the root of the tooth.
Alternatively, if you prefer, soak wool or cloth in cold butter, place it over the painful tooth, and then place heated iron over it until the heat reaches the depth of the tooth’s cavity.
For cauterization with fire, use a copper or iron tube. The body of the tube should be thick enough to prevent the intense heat from reaching the patient’s mouth.
Then heat the cautery in the specified form, place it over the tooth, and hold your hand steady until the cautery cools.
Repeat this several times; the pain will dissipate either that day or the next.
After applying the cautery, have the patient fill his mouth with good butter, hold it there for an hour, and then spit it out.
This is the form of the cautery.
Cauterize with whichever end of the instrument you find most suitable, and this is the form of the tube.
On the method of cauterizing in cases of strophulae.
Chapter 24.
When strophulae arise from phlegm and cold humors, and are not responsive to treatment with medicines, and you want their digestion to be quickened, then heat a concave cautery iron, in this shape.
Having two open ends so that smoke may escape from one end of the cautery iron, and place it, heated, upon the abscess once, and a second time, if needed, until it reaches the depth of the abscess.
If the abscess is small, then place the cautery iron according to the size of the abscess.
Then leave it for three days, and apply over it cotton soaked in butter, until what the fire has burned is removed.
Then treat it with dental ointment until it heals, forming a tube.
On the method of cauterizing for hoarseness of voice and shortness of breath.
Chapter 25.
When the humors overpower the canal of the lungs, especially when it is due to a cold temperament, then it is necessary to purge the patient first with laxative medicines.
Then cauterize him on the throat at the root of the gullet, in a depressed place, and be careful not to reach the throat itself with the cautery, nor penetrate the skin except a little.
Then cauterize him again with another cautery iron at the joint of the neck at its last vertebra, finishing the procedure; let the cautery be shaped like a nail, following the previous method.
Then treat him with what was used before, until he is healed.
On the method of cauterizing for lung ailments and cough.
Chapter 26.
When cough and lung disease arise from cold humors, and the patient has neither fever nor consumption, and the disease is chronic, then cauterize him with two cauteries above the fork of the collarbone, in soft, shallow, and empty places.
And with another cautery in the middle of the chest between the two nipples; let the cautery be tubular, following the previous form.
And if you wish your cauterization to be punctuated with a cautery called “the Point,” which was previously described in the cauterization of ear pain; let there be up to thirty points, almost reaching each other.
Then treat him with what was used before, until he is healed. And now let the cautery have three branches, in this shape.
Thus the cauterization is alleviated when you make with it three cauteries at once.
On the method of cauterizing in the shoulder joint, in dislocation of the shoulder.
Chapter 27.
When the head of the shoulder is dislocated due to humors and does not settle back in place upon its return from dislocation, until it becomes a habit of dislocation, and then it dislocates with slight movement, as we have witnessed before, then it is necessary to reduce the dislocation first.
Then lay the patient on his back, or on his healthy side.
Then lift the skin on the inner shoulder upward with the fingers of your left hand if the joint is dislocated inward.
Then heat a cautery iron with two prongs. In this shape.
Then cauterize the skin until it penetrates through to the other side, and the figure of the cauterization will appear with four cauteries.
Sometimes the cauterization is done with a cautery iron having three prongs, and thus the figure of the cauterization will have six cauterizations; the prongs are as thin as a stretched thread.
And this is the shape of the cautery iron with three prongs.
Sometimes one more is added to this method, so that there are eight cauteries.
Then apply crushed leeks with salt over the cauterized area.
Then keep the patient in stillness, so the limb does not move for a while, until it is strengthened.
And if the dislocation is upward, which rarely happens, then cauterize the shoulder with a nail-shaped cautery or with many puncturing cauteries.
For the joint is strengthened, the humor is removed, and the patient is healed.
On the method of cauterizing the stomach.
Chapter 28.
When cold and excessive humors occur in the stomach, to the extent that they disrupt its temperament, and phlegm increases, and regular treatments are ineffective, then the patient should be placed on his back, with his legs and arms extended.
Then cauterize with three cauteries: one under the breastbone the size of a single finger with a nail-shaped cautery, and two cauteries below on both sides of this cautery, until a triangular shape is formed by the cauteries.
And leave space between each so that they do not merge when they form pus. Let the depth of the cautery be two-thirds the thickness of the skin.
Let the shape of the cauteries be according to this form without addition; and if you wish, cauterize with a large cautery in the middle of the stomach in this form, and let the cautery be circular in shape.
The stomach can be cauterized by puncturing for those who fear this cautery: mark a point on the stomach according to the desired size with ink, then cauterize with a pointed cautery, then treat it with the previous remedy until healed.
On the method of cauterizing a cold liver.
Chapter 29.
When pain occurs in the liver due to cold and moisture, or from thick winds, disrupting its natural balance by excess, and treatment as prescribed does not help, then the patient should lie on his back, and mark with ink three cauteries in this shape and this same size below the hypochondria, at the point where the elbow meets: allow space between each cautery the width of a finger, and let the cautery be straight in the length of the body; do not press your hand too hard with the cautery.
Let the amount burned be half the thickness of the skin, not more; and let the patient be standing on his feet.
If he is not standing, then he should be lying down, with his legs extended and arms raised. This is the shape of the cautery.
Indeed, it is possible to perform these cauterizations with a knife-like cautery, provided you possess skill and precision in the art.
Be cautious not to go too deeply with the cauterization, so as not to burn the full thickness of the skin, for this would burn the entire body and reach the intestines, as the skin there is thin; know this well.
On the method of cauterizing liver abscesses.
Chapter 30.
When an abscess occurs and you wish to know if it is in the liver's flesh or its covering: if it is in the liver's flesh, the patient suffers dull pain and heaviness; if in the liver's covering, there is sharp, intense pain; and you see that its treatment has wearied the physicians.
Thus, the patient should lie on his back.
Then mark the site of the abscess with ink, and heat a cautery shaped like a ray.
And this is its shape.
Cauterize with it once, until the entire skin is burned and reaches the membrane, until all discharge is released; then treat it with the abscess remedy until healed.
And this type of cautery should not be used except by one experienced in the art of medicine and who has often encountered such illnesses; only then should he dare this procedure.
But truly, leaving it alone is, in my view, better.
On the method of cauterizing in cases of pleurisy.
Chapter 31.
The ancients said to use cautery with roots of aristolochia for cold pleurisy in the following manner.
Take a long, dry root of aristolochia, selecting the longest available, approximately the thickness of a finger.
Then immerse it in oil and ignite it in fire.
Then apply one cautery at the point where the furcula meets the neck, and two smaller cauteries slightly downward below the chin.
And also apply two cauteries between the fifth and sixth ribs, slanting slightly towards the back; one cautery at the center of the chest and another over the stomach.
And apply three cauteries on the back: one between the shoulder blades, and two on each side of the chest, below the cautery placed between the shoulder blades.
Do not press your hand too hard with the cautery; instead, it should only be obvious enough by the smell of the burning skin. Some of the ancients have said that certain practitioners use an iron cautery similar to a rod; they heat it, insert it between the ribs until it reaches the abscess, and let the discharge exit, as we mentioned in the case of a liver abscess.
But with this procedure there is a risk: either the patient dies immediately, or a fistula develops at the site, which is incurable.
On the method of cauterizing the spleen. Chapter 32.
When you treat a disease of the spleen with the treatments we discussed in the division of diseases, and it does not yield to these treatments, cautery can be used in three ways, all of which are effective.
One method is to create three or four cauteries in a line along the length of the spleen, in the same manner as the cauteries for the liver, as we previously described.
Let the space between each cautery be about the thickness of a finger, or a little more.
Let the method of the cautery be exactly as we described in cauterizing the liver.
Do not press your hand hard with the cautery, and have the patient lying on his back.
Another method of cauterization is to heat a double-pronged cautery, as we discussed in the chapter on shoulder dislocation; lift the skin directly over the spleen, where the patient’s left elbow reaches, lifting it along the body’s width, so the cauteries fall along the body’s length.
Then insert the two highly heated prongs until they pierce through to the other side of the skin; then remove the cautery, creating four cauteries. If you wish, you may cauterize with another cautery that has three prongs.
Then care for the cautery site, allowing it to discharge pus over many days, as it is more effective than other preceding treatments.
On the method of cauterizing for dropsy.
Chapter 33.
Cautery is only applied in cases of ascitic dropsy specifically.
When treating a dropsical patient with the previously described treatments and they prove ineffective, you should then cauterize with four cauteries around the navel, one cautery on the stomach, another over the liver, one on the spleen, two on the back between the vertebrae, one opposite the chest, and another opposite the stomach. The depth of the cautery should be close to the thickness of the skin.
Then leave the cautery site open so it may discharge pus over a long period.
And do not abandon treatment for the patient after the cautery; it is necessary to combine two aims, and healing will hasten with God’s help.
The shape of the cautery used for the abdomen should be nail-like, as previously described, and the one used for the back should be olive-shaped, as previously specified.
On the Method of Cauterizing Feet and Legs Chapter 34.
When swelling occurs in the dropsical person, and yellowish water fills the feet, it is necessary to cauterize the top of the foot, specifically on the area between the little toe and the ring toe. Raise your hand with the cautery tool, do not twist it, and then lift your hand; do not repeat the procedure at all.
This will cause the yellow water to sweat out, and the cautery should be applied as described.
Then, apply two cauteries on each leg. Use the blade-like end of the cautery tool, applying it lengthwise along the leg, one below the knee and the other slightly lower, around the middle of the leg. Apply two cauteries on each thigh. Leave the cautery sites open without treatment for an extended time so that water may exude from them. Afterward, treat the area with the remedies previously mentioned.
On the Method of Cauterizing for Looseness of the Bowels Chapter 35.
When there is looseness of the bowels due to cold and moisture, which weakens the stomach and intestinal retention and digestive functions, and if usual treatments fail, and the patient is strong enough to tolerate cauterization, apply a large cautery to the stomach, as previously described in stomach cauterization using a circular cautery. Apply four delicate cauteries around the navel, using a fine nail-like cautery tool, and another on the alcatin (just above the pubic bone), using a large cautery or two smaller ones.
If you see an excess of moisture and the patient can tolerate it, cauterize over the pubic area and over each iliac crest. You may add two small cauteries on the stomach, close to the larger one.
This treatment is effective, providing reliable relief.
On the Method of Cauterizing Hemorrhoids
Chapter 36.
When there are old, multiple hemorrhoids in the anus, or even a single one, caused by thick, cold humors or corrupt moisture, and treatments have proven ineffective, cauterize with three cauteries on the lower vertebra of the back just below the waist in a triangular shape, and one cautery just two finger-widths below the navel.
If you suspect the patient's stomach is chilled and food is undigested, and you notice swelling in the face, then cauterize over the stomach with a large cautery as previously described, and also over the liver and spleen using a nail-like cautery. Leave the cautery site open for a while, then treat it until healed.
On the Method of Cauterizing Althelul (Lesions or Ulcers) after Their Removal
Chapter 37.
When you remove althelul (lesions or ulcers), heat a cautery shaped like a rod.
Then insert the heated cautery into the cut althelul, pressing until it reaches the mouth of the vein from which blood flows; do this once or twice. If there are multiple althelul, cauterize each one as described.
Then treat them with appropriate ointments until they heal.
If you cauterize with a large cautery over the alcatin, this is the most beneficial method.
On the Method of Cauterizing a Fistula in the Anus
Chapter 38.
When a patient is unwilling to undergo surgery and the procedure we discussed earlier, and if they are afraid of it, perhaps they can be cured with cauterization.
When someone has a fistula that has persisted for a long time, and pus and corrupted humors flow from it.
First, it is necessary to examine the fistula carefully with a fine probe.
Then, assess its depth with the probe.
Afterward, heat a rod-like cautery.
Then insert the heated cautery into the fistula to the depth of the insertion mark. Repeat the cauterization over the affected area until all the corrupted tissue is burned, doing this once, twice, or thrice, depending on the need.
Be cautious not to burn any nerves, if present, or major veins. If the fistula is near the bladder or intestines, take care to avoid these areas entirely.
Only perform this procedure when the fistula is in fleshy tissue and you believe it does not penetrate deeply.
Then treat the area until it is fully healed.
If the area seals and discharges material for an extended period, this indicates complete healing.
If it fails to discharge material, then know that the fistula may be deep, possibly involving decayed bone or similar structures, which will be discussed later.
On the Method of Cauterizing the Kidneys
Chapter 39.
When kidney pain arises due to cold or thickened wind (gas), and this reduces the patient’s virility, it is necessary to cauterize over the kidneys on the area called the almethen. Apply a nail-shaped cautery to each kidney, as previously described.
You may also cauterize again on the lower back (almeidatu).
Thus, three linear cauterizations will be done.
This will provide the best therapeutic outcome.
On the Method of Cauterizing the Bladder
Chapter 40. When there is weakness and relaxation in the bladder due to cold and moisture, causing urinary incontinence, cauterize the lower part of the abdomen, above the bladder, where the pubic hair begins. Apply cauterization on both the right and left sides, with a length approximately that of the thumb joint. Additionally, cauterize the lower back, using one or two cauteries if necessary, following the nail-like cautery form previously described.
On the Method of Cauterizing the Uterus Chapter 41.
When cold and moisture affect the uterus, preventing conception, causing menstrual irregularities, delays, and pain upon menstruation, it is necessary to cauterize with three cauteries around the navel, as described in bladder cauterization. Apply an additional cautery over the pubic region below the back, or use two cauteries, and use the nail-shaped cautery.
On the Method of Cauterizing the Hip in Dislocation
Chapter 42.
When mucus-like humors flow into the hip socket, causing it to dislocate, one leg will appear longer than the other when compared, and there will be an empty space at the dislocation site.
It is necessary to cauterize the patient over the hip socket using a circular cautery. First, mark around the hip with ink, following its contour, so that the hip joint falls within the center of the circle.
Use the same cautery form as used for the stomach.
If this circular cautery is not available, then apply three cauteries using a large olive-shaped cautery, with a depth equal to the skin’s full thickness.
Then treat the area until it heals completely.
On the Method of Cauterizing for Sciatica Chapter 43
When pain occurs in the hip joint due to cold and moisture, and the patient has been treated with the methods described earlier, but no cure is achieved, and the pain becomes chronic, it is necessary to purge the patient of thick humors using fetid pills, artificial pills, or similar remedies.
Then proceed to cauterize the patient.
There are two methods for cauterization in this case: cauterization with caustic medicines or cauterization with fire.
Cauterization with fire can be done in several ways.
One method is to apply three triangular cauterizations over the hip joint, arranged in this form.
Make the cauterizations either deep or shallow, as necessary.
Allow a finger’s width of space between each cauterization, and use an olive-shaped cautery.
Sometimes, a single cauterization is also applied in the center over the head of the hip joint.
Thus, there will be four cauterizations in total.
If you prefer, you may use a circular cautery as described in the treatment for hip dislocation, forming a circle around the entire hip joint.
Burn through the entire thickness of the skin.
This is the method for cauterizing sciatica when the pain is localized in the hip and does not extend to the thigh or leg.
If the pain extends to the thigh and leg, apply two cauterizations on the thigh at the point indicated by the patient where the pain is located, and place another cautery on the ankle, about four fingers’ width toward the outside. Use a knife-shaped cautery. Ensure the cautery penetrates to the full thickness of the skin.
If the patient indicates that the pain extends to the toes, apply three, four, or more point cauterizations at the points indicated by the patient, if necessary.
If the patient points to pain below the knee toward the leg, apply a single knife-shaped cautery there.
In all cauterizations, be cautious not to apply the cautery too deeply to avoid burning any nerve or major artery, which could cause severe harm or lead to contraction in the patient.
I have witnessed cases where practitioners cauterized above the ankle and applied the cautery too deeply, causing the leg to swell until the swelling reached the foot, leading to the entire foot becoming perforated and necrotic; following this, the patient experienced abdominal distress and ultimately died.
If the pain is present on both sides simultaneously, cauterize each side in this manner.
Certain learned practitioners have suggested the following method for hip cauterization.
Create a cautery tool from iron resembling a double samium. Its diameter should be half a palm's width, with an opening about the width of a date stone, or slightly less. Within it, place a third samium.
Ensure there is a space between each samium about the size of a thumb joint. These sami should be open on both ends, with a height of about one or two thumb joints. Attach an iron handle suitably fitted to the sami.
This is the design of the cautery tool.
Then, heat it in the fire until it becomes red-hot and emits sparks. Place it on the hip joint of the patient while they lie on their healthy side.
Thus, cauterize with three round cauterizations in a single session.
Afterward, leave the wound undisturbed for three days.
Then apply a butter-based plaster and leave the wound open for several days.
Finally, treat the wound with ointment until it heals completely.
Albucasis says, "My son, we have rarely used this type of cautery because of the intimidating appearance and the lack of patients willing to undergo it."
Nevertheless, it is one of the most effective cauteries for those who can endure it and whose condition warrants its application.
For cauterization with caustic medicines, make two small devices with a perforated ring through which a pivot made of brass or iron passes, the length of which is about two thumb joints.
There should be a space between the devices approximately the width of a finger, and they should be open at the top and bottom, aligning in this arrangement.
Place this over the hip joint of the patient as they lie on the healthy side.
Press firmly over the hip joint with your hand.
Then, pour warm water heated over a flame between the two rings, maintaining the heat for about an hour. The patient will feel a biting pain like fire, which they must endure until it subsides.
Afterward, remove your hand and the device, wipe away the hot water with fresh water, and leave the area undisturbed for three days.
Apply butter to the area until the burned skin turns black, and allow it to rest for several days, during which pus will begin to flow.
This process provides the most lasting relief.
Then, treat it with ointments until it fully heals.
If the pain extends to the thigh or leg, perform the same procedure with the water application on that area as you did on the hip.
This is the method of using hot water, as I have detailed in my treatise on refining medical treatments.
Take equal parts of alkali and quicklime, grind them thoroughly, and place them in a new pot with a small hole at the bottom, just large enough for a rod to pass through. Place a glass vessel underneath, then pour fresh water over the alkali and lime to cover them by about a finger's width. Press down firmly with your hand and allow the liquid to drain into the glass vessel below.
Collect all this liquid, pour it over a new portion of lime, and filter it to renew its potency.
This solution will be highly caustic and suitable for many medical applications, including cauterizing other parts of the body.
It effectively replicates the action of fire.
Other medicinal substances used for cauterizing the hip include tesesi, cashew honey, and lime mixed with soap, all combined for maximum efficacy.
Galen, recounting the treatment of an ancient man cured of hip pain and sciatica, highly praised this method.
He said that the man needed no further treatment and was cured after a single session, even claiming that the patient entered the bath in pain and emerged fully healed. The treatment involves using fresh seitaragi (a specific medicinal plant), or, if unavailable, a dried, recent sample. Grind it thoroughly with some fat, apply it to the hip, leg, or thigh where the pain is located, then bind and leave it in place for about three hours or until the patient feels relief from the burning.
Then, have the patient enter a bath.
Once their body is perspiring, immerse them in a basin.
The pain will subside, and healing will occur.
Be aware that cauterization should not be combined with these treatments until the body has been purged.
Dioscorides stated that goat dung, when used to cauterize the sciatic vein, provides relief. The cautery is applied as follows:
Take some wool, soak it in old oil, and place it over the depression between the big toe and the arch, near the ankle.
Then take dried goat dung, ignite it in fire until it turns to charcoal.
Place this charcoal on the wool and let it burn out.
Repeat this process.
Continue this until the sensation extends along the pathway to the hip and the pain subsides.
This method is known as the "Cow Cautery."
On cauterization for back pain.
Chapter 44.
Sometimes pain occurs in the back from many causes, either from an accident, or from an impact, or excessive evacuation, and similar things, from the infusion of cold and moist matter: and in fact, cauterization is only used in this specific case, which results from the infusion of cold matter.
Therefore, after evacuating the patient with stinking pills, and similar treatments, three lines should be made on the back, where the pain is, according to the width of the affected area itself, marking five cauterizations on each line with ink, or more according to the patient’s ability to endure it: and the cauterization is to be performed with a pointed cautery.
And if you wish, cauterize with three cauteries, or four, with the middle key-shaped cautery, in this manner.
On the method of cauterizing in the initial stage of hunchback.
Chapter 45.
This disease often occurs in young children.
And the sign of its onset in children is that they suffer tightness in breathing upon lifting and movement: and you find at the end of the spine and its joints, that one part has already started to protrude above the other vertebrae.
When you see that, and wish to treat it, then cauterize it with a cautery shaped like a circle, in this manner.
And let the cautery take hold evenly on every part of the vertebra: and if you wish, cauterize around the vertebra with a pointed cautery in two lines, or three, with the points close together.
Then treat the area until it heals with what we have prescribed.
And be careful not to apply cautery to a hump caused by nerve spasm.
On the method of cauterizing for gout and joint pains. Chapter 46.
When joint pains result from cold humors that spread to various body parts, then when pain occurs in the feet, it is customary among doctors to specifically call it gout.
Therefore, when gout of a cold cause is treated with various methods, and the pains are not relieved, then cauterization removes them.
And this is done by cauterizing around the joints of the feet after evacuation, with multiple cauterizations: and the cautery should be olive-shaped.
This is its form.
And if you need to prick the surface of the foot, then do so with a pointed cautery.
If the pains extend up to the knees or other joints, as often happens, then cauterize each knee with three or four cauteries on all sides, with this same key-shaped cautery. And if more cauterizations with this cautery are necessary, then cauterize it. Do not sink your hand deeply with the cautery; rather, only to the thickness of the skin.
But if the pains rise to the knees and back, then apply what we mentioned in its section on cautery.
If the pains are in the hands only, then prick around the joints, as two lines are traced.
If any pain remains in the fingers, then prick each joint and along the ridge of the hand.
If the pains rise over time to the elbows or shoulders, then cauterize both from all sides.
And do not evacuate the patient if they follow a good regimen and receive medicines.
For if a good regimen is followed, and phlegm is evacuated, they will be healed by God’s help with this cautery.
On the method of cauterizing for hernias.
Chapter 47.
When a rupture occurs in the groin, and the intestine or fatty tissue descends to the testicle, and it is in the early stage, then you must instruct the patient to refrain from eating for a day.
And he should use laxatives, so that stool may pass from his abdomen.
Then let him sit on his back in your hands, and instruct him to hold his breath until the fatty tissue or intestine emerges or becomes visible.
Then, reduce it with your fingers, and mark under the rupture over the pubic bone with ink, using a symbol whose end resembles half a circle facing the upper body.
Then heat the cautery in the fire, in this shape, until it turns white and sparks.
Then return the intestine or fatty tissue to its cavity.
Then let the assistant place his hand over the area so the intestine does not exit: and now you spread the patient's legs, place a cushion under him, with one assistant holding his legs and another on his chest holding his hands.
Then place the cautery over the marked spot, holding your hand with the cautery upright.
And hold it there until you reach the bone with it; or repeat another time, if you have not reached the bone on the first attempt.
And carefully watch for the exit of the intestine at the time of your cauterization, lest you burn it, and cause either death or severe harm to the patient.
And know that if you do not reach the bone with the cautery, your procedure will not be effective.
And the cautery for children must be fine, according to their size.
Then treat it with other ointments, until it heals.
And the patient should lie on his back for forty days, until the wound is sealed.
And his nourishment should be regulated during his recovery period to keep his bowels soft, so the intestine does not exit during strain or evacuation.
Then, when he wishes to get up after forty days, apply a properly made bandage, and he should wear it for another forty days.
For when he follows this regimen, he will be healed completely.
But when ruptures occur in the rest of the abdomen, and are in the early stages, and you wish to prevent their growth, then cauterize the rupture with a round cautery according to its size: and let the area burned be about a third of it.
Then treat it with what we have mentioned, and it will not grow further.
And some of the ancients have said that the rupture should be cauterized with a triangular cautery, in this shape.
After marking it with ink, a line is drawn transversely on the upper side of the rupture, and another line below. And place your hand in the middle with a key-shaped cautery.
But the first cautery is easier and better. On the method of cauterizing for pains caused by a fall or blow.
Chapter 48.
When pain occurs in certain limbs from a fall or blow, and that pain persists for a long time, and treatment with medicines is ineffective: then it should be cauterized with a pointed cautery.
And the cautery for each limb should be sized according to its size, and its delicacy, weakness, strength, and the location of the twist and pain from it.
If it heals from the first cauterization, it is well.
If not, then repeat the cauterization.
Because it is customary with these pains that they shift from one limb to another nearby.
Therefore you should pursue them with cauterization until the patient is healed.
On the method of cauterizing for leprosy.
Chapter 49.
Leprosy patients are sometimes greatly aided by cauterization.
Especially the type of leprosy that arises due to the putrefaction of phlegm and melancholy; when you decide to cauterize, consider this.
If the leprosy is in the early stages, and you have treated it as we described in the section, but it does not spread or subside, and you fear it might affect the entire body, then cauterize him with five cauteries on the head: one in the center of the head at a marked point, a second lower towards the forehead at the hairline, two on either side of the temples, and one at the nape of the neck.
Hold your hand with the cautery for a brief moment, until it leaves a small mark on the bone and the scabs peel off, to ease the release of thick vapors from there; also cauterize over the spleen, as previously mentioned.
However, if leprosy has spread over the patient and is clearly visible, then apply the cauteries as we described on the head, one on the tip of the nose, two on each cheek, two on the vertebrae of the neck, six on the vertebrae of the back, a large one on the sacrum at the base of the spine, one just above it, two on the hips (one on each hip), two on the knees (one on each knee), two on the shoulders, two on the elbows, two on the softer parts of the chest; cauterize every joint, including the joints of the fingers of both hands and feet; also cauterize on every heel and the backs of the hands.
Be cautious of the nerves located at the back of the heel, so as not to burn them. Sometimes, cauterize over the pubic bone, another over the stomach, and another over the liver.
Know that the more cautery you apply, the more it will aid and contribute to healing.
And know that the patient does not feel pain from the cautery as healthy people do, because his body is already numbed.
The cauteries should be sized according to the limbs and joints, as was previously mentioned regarding the types of instruments.
Chapter 50.
When a limb is numb and has been treated with medicines, oils, and poultices without healing, then cauterize the numb limb with cauteries according to its size, whether large or small.
Let your cautery penetrate slightly into the thickness of the skin.
Then treat it with ointment until it heals.
Sometimes numbness in the hand or foot is treated by cauterizing at the vertebrae of the back, near the exit points of the nerves that control that limb, and the numbness is relieved.
However, only those who are knowledgeable in the anatomy of the body and the pathways of nerves controlling movement should attempt this.
On the method of cauterizing for vitiligo (white patches).
Chapter 51.
When vitiligo has persisted and no medical treatments have been effective, then cauterize the area with a slightly deep cautery, according to the thickness of the skin, until the whiteness is removed and the color changes.
Then treat it with an ointment made from herbal flour, lentils with rose oil, plantain leaves, dove's blood, and swallow's blood; take an equal part of each, mix them together, spread them on a cloth, and apply it to the area until it heals.
On the method of cauterizing for cancer.
Chapter 52.
When cancer is beginning, and you want to halt it, then cauterize around it with a circular cautery, following its circumference.
The wise have said that it should be cauterized with a final cautery in the center.
However, this does not seem advisable to me, as I fear it may ulcerate, and I have seen this happen several times. It is better to cauterize around it with a circular cautery as we mentioned, or with multiple cauteries. On the method of cauterizing an abscess or boil.
Chapter 53.
When someone has an abscess (Adubelati) that is slow to mature, either due to excess humor causing it, the patient's advanced age and low blood volume, or the season, and you wish to hasten its maturation, then apply multiple small cauterizations around its circumference by making tiny pricks.
Then leave it as it is.
This will cause it to mature more quickly.
If you wish to lance it with a cautery, then heat the cautery, shaped as described.
Apply it in the center of the abscess until it pierces the skin, and it should be done in a way that allows the pus to drain, relieving the patient.
Then treat the area until it heals.
On the method of cauterizing a corroding sore or ulcer. Chapter 54.
A corroding sore is essentially decay spreading through the flesh, eating it away like fire devours dry wood.
If you see a corroding sore in an area that can tolerate fire cautery, then apply several cauteries, both small and large, depending on the area affected by the sore.
Then cauterize it thoroughly from all sides until all the decayed tissue is eradicated, leaving no trace of it whatsoever. Leave the area for three days, and apply powdered sulfur mixed with oil over the cauterized spots, until all the scabs and decay are removed.
Afterward, treat the area with ointments that promote new flesh growth.
If, after three days, you see healthy new flesh growing without any decay, it is a good sign.
If not, then repeat the cauterization on any remaining decayed areas.
Sometimes, corroding sores are treated with strong medicines instead of cauterization.
Such a treatment acts in place of cautery.
However, fire cautery provides faster relief; I have already described the use of strong medicines in another section. Refer to it when you need that information.
On the method of cauterizing corns and warts. Chapter 55.
This condition often affects the lower parts of the feet and consists of thick, hardened growths that harm the foot. There are two methods for treating them: cauterization with fire or with hot water.
For fire cauterization, use a hollow cautery resembling a vulture's feather, made of iron, and sized to fit around the corn on all sides, with fine edges.
Then place the heated cautery over the corn. Rotate the cautery around the corn, allowing it to penetrate deeply; leave it for three days until it begins to discharge pus. Then apply a poultice of wild mallow crushed with salt and leave it on overnight. This will cause it to be uprooted from its roots.
Afterward, treat the area with an ointment that encourages flesh growth until it heals.
If the corns or warts are not recessed and occur on the body’s surface, particularly on the hands and feet, then apply cauterization with hot water. Use a metal tube made of bronze, iron, or a vulture’s feather, and place it over the corn or wart.
Pour a small amount of hot water into the tube, press it down and turn it slightly so that the tube’s edge presses into the root of the corn, allowing the hot water to reach the corn’s depth. Let the patient bear the hot water’s sensation for about an hour.
Afterward, release it, as the corn will be uprooted from its roots.
Proceed in this way, one by one, until you treat all the corns on the body.
Then, once removed, treat the areas with an ointment that promotes flesh growth.
On the method of cauterizing for tremor.
Chapter 56.
When someone experiences tremor due to cold affecting the nerves, quartan fever, or another cause, then apply four or five cauteries along the vertebrae of the back, between each vertebra, one on the chest, and one on the stomach.
Tremor is calmed by olive oil cauterization, and recovery from the cold illness is hastened. On the method of cauterizing pustules or boils known as Albathir.
Chapter 57.
Sometimes foul pustules, known as Albathir, appear on the body, caused by corrupted, thick humors.
It is necessary, when they first appear, to cauterize the top of each pustule with a fine cautery, such as a myrtle twig with a fire-heated tip.
Alternatively, use the root of long Aristolochia (birthwort).
Or, you may use a lenticular-shaped cautery. Sometimes, early cauterization of these pustules, following this method, prevents them from enlarging, breaks up the excess humor causing them, and brings about healing.
However, this procedure should be carried out after purging through bloodletting.
On the method of cauterizing arterial bleeding from a wound.
Chapter 58. Arterial bleeding often occurs from an artery cut by an external wound, the incision of an abscess, a limb cauterization, or similar injuries; stopping it can be very difficult.
When this happens, quickly place your index finger over the artery’s opening, press down firmly, and hold to stop blood from escaping. Then place several olive-sized cauteries, both small and large, in the fire and fan them until they are extremely hot.
Choose a cautery that suits the size and location of the wound, place it over the artery after quickly lifting your finger, and hold it in place until the bleeding stops.
If bleeding resumes when you lift your finger or extinguish the cautery, immediately use another cautery from those prepared in the fire. Continue using cauteries one after another until the bleeding is stopped.
Take care not to burn any nearby nerve, as this could cause additional harm to the patient. Know that arterial bleeding, especially from a large artery, cannot be controlled except by one of four methods:
With cautery, as described.
By extraction, if it has not yet been removed. When it is extracted, the ends contract, stopping the bleeding.
When it is extracted, the ends contract, stopping the bleeding. Or by tightly tying it with a thread.
Or apply medicines with properties to halt bleeding, combined with firm compression using a suitable cushion.
Using ligatures, cloth pressure, or applying burning substances seldom offers lasting relief and may not be effective.
If a person is alone without a physician or medical supplies, they should place their index finger over the artery’s opening, pressing firmly to prevent blood flow from the wound above and the artery itself, as previously described.
Do not remove the finger, but continuously pour very cold water over the area to thicken and freeze the blood, stopping the bleeding. During this process, assess whether further treatment with cautery or medicine is needed.
End of the First Part.
The Surgical Book of Albucasis, Part II. On Incision, Perforation, and Bloodletting in wounds, and such matters.
We have already discussed in the First Chapter, every condition in which cautery with fire and burning medicine is suitable, and its reasons, causes, instruments, and forms of cauteries. And I arranged there the chapters from head to foot.
And I will proceed in this chapter by the same method: so that the inquiry may be made easier for the seeker. And before I begin it, it is necessary for you to learn, my sons, that in this chapter there is as much terror as there is in the first chapter on cauterization.
And because of this, caution must be greater in it, since in the operation described in this chapter, there often occurs an evacuation with blood, upon which life depends in the opening of a vein, or the incision over a swelling, or the opening of an abscess, or the treatment of a wound, or the extraction of an arrow, or the incision over a stone, and similar actions: from all of which are associated tremor, fear, and in many cases, death.
And I advise you, lest that which involves hesitation fall upon you, for sometimes types of people come to you in this art with various kinds of sicknesses.
For among them is one who becomes angry with his illness, and death seems of little concern to him, due to the severity of what he experiences from his sickness and its prolonged malice.
And with sickness, there is a fear which signifies death.
And among them is one who offers you his support and enriches you with it, hoping for healing, and his sickness is dangerous. Therefore, you should not agree with one of those who come to you in this way, whose nature is such.
And let your caution be greater than your greed and your rapacity.
And do not presume upon any of this, except after certain knowledge, which verifies to you that which achieves a commendable outcome.
And in the treatment of all your patients, use prognosis and guidance concerning what is most suitable for their health.
For in this lies for you help toward the acquisition of fame and glory, and memory and praise.
May God inspire in you, my sons, His understanding, and may He not take away from you direction and inspiration, for that is in His hand.
And indeed, I have arranged this Chapter by dividing it into sections, as was done in the chapter on Cautery, from the neck to the feet: so that what you seek from it, and what you need, may be made easier for you.
On the treatment of Water that gathers in the heads of children.
Chapter I.
Know that this condition often occurs in children at birth: or when the midwife presses the child’s head too harshly.
And sometimes it also occurs from a hidden cause which is not known.
And indeed, I have not seen this illness in anyone other than children: and for each one I saw, death came quickly: because of this, it seemed to me best to avoid operating on it.
And I indeed saw a child among them, whose head was filled with water, and the head increased in size each day, until he could no longer sit up because of the size of his head: and the moisture continued to increase, until he died.
And this moisture indeed either gathers between the skin and the bone, or gathers under the bone over the membrane.
And the procedure in this case, if the moisture is between the skin and the bone and the swelling is small, is to make one incision in the middle of the head across: and let the length of the incision be about two knots, until the moisture flows out.
And this is the form of the spatula.
If the moisture is more increased, and the swelling is larger, then make two incisions, according to this form.
And if the moisture is under the bone, the sign of it is that you see the sutures of the head open on every side: and the water is displaced when you press it inward with your hand, and it does not hide from you: then you must make three incisions in the middle of the head, in this manner.
And after the incision, remove all the moisture.
Then bathe it from above with wine and oil until the fifth day.
Then loosen the bandage, and treat the wound with ointments and compresses.
And do not stop binding the head evenly.
And feed the patient only dry food with little moisture, until the part is strengthened and healed.
And another method of incision is to observe where the swelling is most prominent and where the water has collected.
For sometimes it is more in the back of the head, or in the forehead, or on the right side, or on the left side.
Then make the incision where the swelling and fullness of water appear to you: and cut it as far as is possible for you.
And be careful not to cut an artery, and a flow of blood occurs, and the patient dies from that flow along with the evacuation of moisture.
On the incision of the Arteries which are behind the ears.
Chapter II.
When a person suffers from cataracts affecting the eyes or chest, and it becomes chronic, and medical treatment does not help: then the ultimate treatment is the incision of these two arteries.
Therefore, when you wish to incise them, the patient must shave his head.
Then rub the area with a rough cloth, so that the arteries become visible.
Then the patient should bind his neck with any cloth he has.
Then observe where the vein pulses.
And the locations of each are the depressed areas behind the ears: and it is rarely hidden, except in certain people.
Then mark both with ink: and incise each one with a spatula sharpened on both sides, cutting down to the bone: and let it be done across the width of the head.
And if you wish, insert the spatula under the artery, and cut it upward with the incision.
And let the length of the incision be about two fingers joined together.
For when the vein is cut, blood exits in a pulsating flow, which leaps inward with frequent spurting.
But if the artery is not perceptible to the touch, then you must measure from the ear the space of three fingers.
Then mark with ink, and cut down to the bone.
And the amount of blood that should be let out is six ounces, though perhaps you may release more or less of it. All of this is according to the quantity you perceive from the strength of the patient and the fullness of his artery.
Then examine the wound.
Then if any membrane remains on the bone, cut it so that a hot swelling does not occur: then bind the wound with strips of linen cloth.
Then treat it with ointment until it heals.
On the extraction of the arteries that are in the temples.
Chapter III.
When a person suffers from chronic hemicrania (migraine), or acute catarrh due to sharp humors, and there is warmth in the muscles of the temples, or they have old and severe conditions like this, and medical treatments do not bring relief: then we have tried in such cases either the extraction of the arteries from the temples or their cauterization, as we have previously described.
The procedure for extracting them is as follows: the patient should shave the hair on the temples, then focus on the artery that appears in the temple.
This artery will show itself to you by its pulse, and it is rarely hidden except in a few people or due to extreme cold.
If it is hidden, then the patient should bind their head with any cloth available, and then rub the area with a rough cloth.
Or, steam the area with warm water until it becomes clearly visible. Then take the spatula that I have previously described. Then peel back the skin gently with it until you reach the artery.
Next, insert a hook into it and pull it upwards, lifting it out of the skin, and free it from the membranes surrounding it on all sides.
If the artery is thin, then wrap it with the end of the hook.
Then cut off a portion of it to the extent that the ends will retract and contract, and blood flow does not occur.
For if it is not incised and if it is not cut off, blood will not fully drain. Then evacuate from it about six ounces of blood, down to three.
If the artery is large, then you should tie it in two places with a strong double thread, either silk or cotton threads, so that decay does not reach it before the wound heals, and blood does not flow.
Then cut the excess portion that lies between the two ligatures.
Do this at that moment, or an hour later. And if you wish, cauterize it down to the bone with a knife-shaped cautery iron: until the ends are seared, which will hold in place by the same procedure.
This is a better procedure, unless the patient has a fever or a hot temperament.
For the cautery is among those things that help to stop moistures.
Therefore, it is the better assistance.
And after the extraction of the arteries, the site should be filled with old cotton, and neatly made compresses should be placed over it.
And after the dressing is removed, it should be treated with dry medicines that promote flesh growth, and with linen cloths, until it heals.
If during the operation a flow of blood occurs from the artery, quickly stop it with a cautery or fill the area with lint; press your hand until the bleeding stops.
If none of these are at hand, place your finger over the area until the blood clots.
Then bathe the area with very cold water until the intensity subsides, and bind it as needed.
And a simpler and easier alternative to artery extraction is to cauterize the vein with this cautery, which has two blades: the sharpness of both blades should be like almagdatem (almagda stone).
However, they are far less sharp than two knives.
For if they are as sharp as two knives, both become cold quickly and do not cut flesh swiftly.
Since they have some thickness, they retain the heat of the fire and cut flesh swiftly; therefore, this method is better, lighter, and easier than any other.
Let the space between the two blades be about the thickness of a finger, after marking two spots with ink: then place both very hot blades until they reach the bone, cutting the vein in two places, so that it lengthens between the ends.
For they do not heal completely with this cautery.
And this is the shape of the cautery.
On the treatment of continuous, sharp tears from the eyes.
Chapter IV.
When there are continuous tears, and their flow comes from the veins that are on the outside of the skull of the head: and no medical treatment is effective with medicines, and you see the face of the patient already reddened, and he feels movement in his forehead, like the movement of ants: and his eyes are weakened, moist, so that the hairs of them are already corroded with erosion: and his eyelids are heated from the sharpness of the tears: then the ancients used this procedure in their treatment, and they called it the treatment "with the Knife."
And it is, that you instruct the patient to shave the hairs that are on his forehead.
Then cut three parallel incisions in the forehead along the length of the forehead: and let the length of each incision be about two fingers, and let one incision be aligned with the length of the nose in the middle of the forehead, and the second along the length slightly away from the movement of the muscles, and the third on the other side: and beware of cutting the arteries that are on both sides: and keep your hand away from the connection of the two jaws, and let the space of each incision be the width of three joined fingers: and have a piece of sponge prepared for yourself, or many dry cloths, with which you may dry the blood.
Then insert the "spatumile" with two sharp ends, whose form follows immediately.
From the incision that is on the side of the temple, up to the second incision: and strip with it all the skin that is between the two incisions, with a tool, which is above the bone. Then do the same also from the middle incision up to the second incision.
Then remove this "spatumile," and insert into the first incision again another instrument, which is called the "sharp cutter," sharp on one side, not sharp on the other side.
And this is its form.
And place its sharp side toward the flesh attached to the skin, and its smooth side toward the bone: and push it until it reaches the middle incision: and cut with it all the vessels that descend from the head to the eyes: except that the incision should continue up to what is visible of the skin.
Then do the same in the middle incision up to the other incision.
And after an equal quantity of blood flows, squeeze the places of the clots of coagulated blood. Then place in each incision a strip of old cotton, and place over them cushions soaked in wine, oil, or vinegar.
And see to it that no hot swelling occurs.
And on the third day, loosen the bandage, and apply a generous infusion with warm water.
Then treat it with basilicon ointment and the other things by which wounds are treated: until it heals.
On the treatment of sharp tears and catarrhs to the eyes from the inner parts of the head.
Chapter V.
When sharp, intense, continuous catarrhs happen to someone: and you see his eyes weakened, small, and already their vision has been impaired: and the eyelids are ulcerated, and hairs fall from them, and in the depth of the head there is a sharp, damaging pain, and subsequent sneezing: then you may conclude from these symptoms, that these matters, and catarrhs, come only from many veins.
And the best treatment for them is this.
And it is, that you instruct the patient to shave his forehead.
Then make a single incision in the middle of the forehead, or slightly on one side, across the width, and begin the incision from the left temple to the right temple: and let the incision go down to the bone: and keep your hand away from the muscles of the temples, which move during chewing: until when the bone is revealed: and you will dry all the blood with a sponge.
Then separate the two edges of the incision with old cotton, or with linen strips.
Then compress from above with cushions: and soak the cushions with wine and oil, so that hot swelling does not occur.
And when you loosen it, and you see that the hot swelling is already reduced: then it is necessary to rub the bone, until flesh begins to grow on it.
Then treat it with a drying regimen that makes flesh grow, as if you take two parts of wheat flour and four parts of colophony, and prepare a plaster from them, and apply it to stimulate flesh growth in these wounds.
On the treatment of something that falls into the ear. Chapter VI. Everything that falls into the ear is one of four types: either a mineral stone, or something similar to a stone, like iron and glass; or it is from a plant, like chickpea and beans; or it is a flowing substance, like water, and vinegar, and similar things; or it is some kind of animal.
When a stone or a type of stone that does not dissolve or grow in the ear falls into the ear, expose the ear to sunlight; if you then see the stone, drip some violet oil or sesame oil into the ear.
Then administer its extraction, and make the person sneeze with condisi, and plug the nostrils at the moment of the sneeze, after placing pieces of cloth or wool around the ear, and pull the ear upwards.
For it often comes out with this treatment.
If it does not come out, then administer its extraction with Gesti, that is, with fine tweezers: their shape is this.
If it then comes out with the tweezers, it is good.
And if not, then administer its extraction with a fine, blunt hook with a slight bend. If it does not come out with this, then make a tube of brass, and insert the end of the tube deep into the ear canal, and seal the area around the tube with wax softened with oil, so that no air passes except through the tube; then use your breath to extract it with a strong suction. For it often comes out with this procedure we have described.
If it does not come out this way, then take a little bit of helkalimbat or birdlime, that is, prepared glue with which birds are caught; place it on the end of a rod after you wrap it with a cloth nicely arranged around it; then insert it gently into the ear after drying the ear from moisture.
If it does not come out with all the methods we have described, then proceed to cutting, before a warm abscess or spasm occurs.
The method of incision is to first perform phlebotomy on the patient in the cephalic vein and remove an amount of blood according to his strength.
Then make the patient sit between your hands, turn his ear upwards, and make a small incision at the base of the ear near the fat in the recessed area there; let the incision be in a crescent shape until you reach the stone; then remove it with whatever instruments you have available.
Then sew up the incision as soon as possible and treat it until it heals.
If the object that fell into the ear is one of the seeds that grow and swell, then administer its extraction.
If it does not respond to exit, then take a fine, thin spatumile in this shape.
And use it to cut away that kind of seed that falls into the ear, but do not do this if you think the seed has already become moist from the ear’s vapor, until you divide it into many pieces; then extract them with hooks, or with fine tweezers, or with suction as we described, for the extraction becomes easier.
As for water that enters the ear, the patient should first use sneezing induced by condisi, and then fill his ear with a bit of old cotton; he should lie on the ear in which the water is.
If it comes out by this, it is good.
If it does not, then take several stones, finger-length, thin, smooth, and heat them briefly with fire, and let the patient insert one into the ear opening; he should jump on the foot on that side and strike with another stone on the stone that is in the ear.
He should continue doing this with stone after stone until all the water comes out.
The water can also come out by taking a piece of papyrus or reed, inserting one end into the ear, and lighting the other end with fire, until most of it burns.
Then repeat with another reed, and do this many times until all the water comes out; and extract it with a tube as described earlier with the stone.
In the extraction of an animal that has entered the ear, if it is small in body, like a flea or something similar, treat it as I described in the section on divisions.
But if it is of large body, such that it can be sensed, then administer its extraction with tweezers and hooks: and its removal is easier than all other objects lodged in the ear.
In the extraction of a worm generated in the ear, when you treat it as we mentioned in the division and in the section on distillations, and your treatment does not help, then you must examine the ear in the sunlight.
If something appears there from the worms, then extract it with tweezers or with fine hooks.
If nothing appears there, then take a tube shaped with a narrow lower end and a wide upper end: insert the thin end into the ear as much as the patient can tolerate, then use it to perform strong suction.
Do this many times until all the worms come out.
If they do not respond to exit, then seal the area around the tube with wax, as I described in the case of the stone.
If they do not come out with what we have described, then administer distillations that the ancients already tested for killing worms; you will find this in the section on distillations.
And let your infusion of oils and medicines into the ear be done with this instrument, whose shape is depicted here.
As you see, make it of silver or brass, narrow at the bottom with a small hole, wide at the top.
Let the plunger that goes into the hollow of the tube be properly made of brass.
And if you wish, take a rod and wrap a piece of cotton neatly around its end; then pour oil, juice, or any of the medicines you wish into the tube, which should be in the ear: then insert the rod with the cotton on top, and press it with your hand with gentle compression, until the oil is pushed into the ear canal, and the patient feels it inside: and what is poured into the ear should be slightly warmed with fire; and beware that the substance you distill into it is not too cold, as the medicines do not tolerate it.
On the treatment of blockage occurring in the ear.
Chapter VII.
Sometimes certain infants come forth from the wombs of their mothers without having open ear canals.
And it also happens that some people develop a blockage in the ear canal from a wound or flesh that grows there.
And this blockage sometimes occurs deep in the ear canal, which cannot be seen; and sometimes it happens near the outer opening, and it can be seen.
Thus, the one that occurs deep in the ear and cannot be reached by sight is, in most cases, difficult to cure.
And in the one that can be seen, you should place the patient’s ear in the sunlight, and examine it: then if you see an apparent blockage, open it with a fine spatula, whose form is as follows, with an end that has a slight width, one part of which is sharp: and let the rest of the spatula have two smooth sides, so as not to harm the ear.
If the blockage is from flesh that has grown in the ear canal, then hold it with a fine hook, and cut it carefully but forcefully, until all the flesh is removed.
But if the blockage is deep in the ear, then take a fine, smooth rod, and heat it briefly with fire; then insert it into the ear canal.
If you then feel the blockage with it, and the patient experiences impaired hearing, attempt to open it gently; and be careful not to injure the ear nerves.
Then place a small wick in the ear, according to the width of the opening, which you have wrapped in Egyptian ointment: do this for several days until you are sure of the wound's healing.
Or take a wick, soak it in rose water, sprinkle finely ground sage on it, and use it.
If you see the ear beginning to abscess, then you must remove the wick and replace it with another wick, which you wrap in a poultice made with rose oil, until the warm abscess subsides: then treat it until it heals.
If bleeding occurs, then soak a sponge or cloths in cold water, and place it over the ear: and use the other treatments mentioned in the section on distillations to stop the bleeding.
¶ On the Treatment of Altheli of the Eyelids.
Chapter VIII. The "Altheli" that occur on the eyelids sometimes are moist, and sometimes they are dry.
Therefore, you should hold them with tweezers or a hook and cut them out with a spatula from their roots.
Then apply finely ground sage to the affected areas.
If they bleed, then cauterize them with a fine lenticular cautery.
It is better to cauterize them after incision.
For they often return when some of their roots remain.
And when they are cauterized with fire, those roots are burned, and they do not return.
¶ On the Treatment of Hailstones of the Eyelids of the Eye.
Chapter IX.
Often something occurs on the eyelids that resembles a "Grando" in its hardness and strength, and because of this, it is named "Grando"; it is an accumulation of thick moisture in the upper or lower eyelid.
The procedure, therefore, is to examine if the Grando has emerged such that it is visible on the eyelid, and can move in every direction, in which case, the treatment is simple.
Make an incision across it horizontally.
Then peel it from all sides gently until it is removed.
Next, lift it with a hook and cut it out.
If you cannot fully prepare it for excision without cutting slightly into the eyelid, then it may cause some discomfort to the patient.
If the incision is large, then close it with a suture and care for it until it heals.
If it is small, no harm will come from it.
An ointment will restore it and help it to heal.
If the Grando is inclined inward toward the inner surface of the eyelid, then invert the eyelid, lift the Grando with a hook without needing to incise, and press it from all sides.
If the eyelid stretches due to the incision, it does not harm it in any way.
Then wash the eye after the incision of the Grando with saltwater, and treat the area with something that promotes healing until the patient is cured.
¶ On the Treatment of Axirnath of the Eyelids.
Chapter X.
"Axirnath" is a type of fat that develops in the membranes of the upper eyelid. It often occurs in children, weighing on their eyes, causing morning discharge, making them unable to look at sunlight, and inducing tears to flow, due to which they frequently lie on their faces and sleep on them. Their eyelids are moist under their eyebrows, covered by swelling, and the swelling of the Axirnath is visible, and when you press on the area with your fingers, you can feel the Axirnath between them.
The procedure is for the patient to place their head in your lap.
Then take a linen cloth, prepare a small bandage in it, and make a ring from this bandage according to the size that covers the Axirnath on all sides.
Place it over the area, and press with your fingers from all sides so that the Axirnath is gathered in the middle of the ring.
Then make a shallow cut across the middle of that moist area with a spatula, creating small incisions horizontally, no deeper than a vein incision.
Or you may need to cut through the entire skin until you reach the Axirnath, as in many cases, the Axirnath will come out from the incision in the form of a piece of white fat.
Then extract it with a cloth, which you hold between your fingers toward the outside; turn your hand to the right and left until it comes loose; and be careful not to deepen the incision, so that you do not reach the eye with the spatula and injure it.
If the Axirnath does not appear at the start of the incision, slightly deepen the incision gently until the Axirnath emerges.
Then extract it as we have described.
Then soak cloths in vinegar and water, place them over the area, and bind it with compresses.
Some people grind salt and place it in the hollow of the incision, so that any remaining moisture is dissolved.
Then treat it until it heals.
If a warm abscess forms in the area, then treat it with soothing plasters until it heals.
On the methods of treating Ataxmir of the eye, that is, when the eyelid of the eye becomes softened, causing it to wrinkle as it should not.
Chapter XI.
When additional hairs grow on the eyelids of the eye beyond the usual course under the natural hairs, and they grow in abundance: then they harm the eye, causing various ailments, such as constant tearing, softening of the eyelids, and whiteness, until it becomes a cause of destruction to the eye.
And indeed, Ataxmir of the eye is treated in four ways. Either by cautery with fire.
Or with a sharp medicine, as mentioned previously in the chapter on cautery.
Or Ataxmir is treated by incision and suture.
Or by means of reeds, as I shall explain.
It is necessary to place the patient's head in your lap.
Then turn the eyelid of the eye with your left hand.
If it turns, then it is good.
If not: insert a needle into it, with a thread from the lower part of the eyelid, and make the needle with the thread penetrate from above, and let it be near the hairs themselves, that is, near the margin of the eyelid where the hairs grow: and pull the thread upwards with the eyelid, and turn it with a rod.
Then make an incision on the inner part of the eyelid under the additional hairs with a thin blade, cutting from the greater lacrimal duct to the lesser lacrimal duct.
Then remove the thread, and place a small cushion of cotton or cloth under the eyelid: then mark on the eyelid with ink a shape like that of a myrtle leaf.
However, it is necessary that the shape corresponds to the size and elevation of the eyelid, as it varies among people.
For there are those who require a large portion to be cut from the eyelid, depending on the amount that is softened in the eyelid. Then, with a thin blade, make an incision along the two lines you marked, starting from the greater lacrimal duct to the lesser lacrimal duct, and let there be one cut close to the natural hairs, like the thickness of a rod.
Then insert a hook into one of the two corners of the skin. Then remove all of it. Then, join the two edges with a suture, using a needle and fine wool thread: and wipe away the blood, and make the excess thread adhere to the two eyebrows with some adhesive substances if you wish to do so: and if not, do not concern yourself with it.
Then leave the suture and thread in place for three or four days: afterwards, treat it. And if you wish, leave the wound without a suture, and treat it with something that dries and constricts.
For the eyelid will elevate upon sealing and joining of the wound: but it will be better in the future.
This method of treating Ataxmir was taught by the ancients.
However, it requires careful attention to the patient, it is a skilled procedure, and there is no fear in it.
And there is another method for Ataxmir as well: it is to mark on the eyelid a shape like that of a myrtle leaf, as we have described.
Then lift the eyelid with three separate or combined hooks, according to the following shape, then cut the excess with small scissors, following this shape, with equal incision.
But if it is not possible for you to hold the hook, and it does not align, then take a needle with a thread, and insert it into the middle of the shape: and insert another thread near the greater lacrimal duct, and a second thread near the lesser lacrimal duct: and join the threads with equal tension between your fingers.
Then raise your hand evenly: and lift the skin on which the mark is made, as we have described.
Then join the two edges of the wound with a suture: and treat it until it heals.
But if an abscess occurs at your incision or fissure, soothe that abscess with cerate and similar ointments that relieve it.
And sometimes it also happens that the hairs of the eyelid turn inward.
On the treatment of Ataxmir with reeds.
And it is that you turn the eyelid and make an incision on the inner side, as I have described.
Then skillfully make two reeds or two thin pieces of wood: their length should match the length of the eyelid, and their width should be less than the width of a thin blade: and you have already cut into each end on both sides where you hold the threads.
Then gently place each one over the excess part of the eyelid of the eye, and bind the two reeds tightly on both sides, and leave it for several days. For the tightened skin will die, darken, and decay, until it falls off on its own.
If it takes too long, then cut it with scissors.
Then treat it until it heals.
When it has healed, the eyelid is raised: and the hairs no longer prick.
And this is the shape of the two reeds, which you will make according to this figure and in this length and width.
On the removal of hairs pricking the eye with a needle.
Chapter XII.
The procedure is this: take a fine needle and insert a fine, smooth silk thread into it. Then join its ends and knot both very finely: let the length of the threads be one palm.
Then add another fine thread below in Alinxotati, and tie its ends if you wish.
Then let the patient place his head in your lap, near the sunlight to make the operation clear, for it is a delicate or fine procedure.
Then insert the needle with the alinxotati at the root of the eyelid, and make it penetrate the eyelid quickly, until you draw it out above the natural hair.
Then pull the hair up above the alinxotati: and insert that hair into the alinxotati: if there is one, or two, or three, but not more.
Then pull your hand with it, until the hair emerges with the alinxotati in the eyelid with the natural hair.
If the alinxotati is pulled and the hair does not come out with it, pull the alinxotati downward with the thread you have arranged in it, until the alinxotati exits from the upper opening, and you can see it with your eye: then you will pull the alinxotati and the thread, and remove both, and close the eye: and leave it closed for two or three days, until the hair adheres in its place and flesh grows over it.
If the hair is short, then either attach to it a long hair from the natural hairs, and it will be raised with it: or leave it until it lengthens over time, and then lift it.
On the treatment of Alxatrati, which occurs in the upper eyelid.
Chapter XIII.
When this Alxatrati occurs in the eye, it is called Leporina.
And this Alxatrati is either natural or accidental.
Accidental, then, results from the healing of a wound, or a cut, or cautery, and similar things.
And the procedure for it is to split that healed area, separate its edges, and place between them a small strip of linen, and bind it until it heals.
And it is not necessary to use drying and constricting substances in its treatment: for if you do so, the Alxatrati will return worse than it was: rather, use softening agents, such as fenugreek: and bathe with water in which althea and flaxseed have been cooked: and dyaquilon ointment, melted with some oil: and wrap with linen, and treat with it.
And the treasure of your treatment is to strive by every skill to ensure it does not heal in the form it was at first.
And indeed, this procedure we have described is only a kind of correction of Alxatrati, so that the form of the place does not return exactly as it was. On the treatment of Alxatrati occurring in the lower eyelid, which is a wrinkling or contraction upward to the right and left.
Chapter XIV.
This Alxatrati, which occurs below, is what is truly called Alxatrati.
And it can be either natural or accidental.
Accidental Alxatrati results from a wound, a cut, cauterization, and similar causes.
The procedure for treating it is to take a needle with a double-thread and insert it into the flesh, passing it from the left tear duct to the right tear duct until the thread reaches both ends of the flesh.
Then, stretch the flesh upward with the needle and make an incision with a broad spatula.
If the shape of the eyelid returns to what it should be, this is good.
If not, take a thin rod, insert it into the fissure, and rotate the eyelid with it. Then make two slits on the inner side of the eyelid, with the ends of these two slits meeting at the two corners of the incision until they converge to form an angle. When they come together, they should form a shape like the Greek letter lambda.
Then remove that portion of flesh that is beneath the sharp edge of the eyelid.
Then bring the separated parts together and sew them with a wool thread.
Then treat the area with the softening medicines mentioned before, and with linen strips, until it heals.
If Alxatrati results from a fissure, suture, or cauterization, you should make a shallow incision beneath the eyelashes, as previously described.
Then separate the two edges with a linen strip, as we have explained.
In summary, the treatment of Alxatrati, whether it is above or below, involves a procedure tailored to the shape of the Alxatrati.
For it presents in many different forms, and the skilled practitioner will prepare the technique in whatever way possible to restore the shape to its natural form, or as close as possible, taking into account the patient's specific needs, operation, and the tools available in many different situations.
On the adhesion of the eyelid to the conjunctiva or cornea.
Chapter XV.
Sometimes this adhesion occurs in many people, causing the upper eyelid to adhere to the white of the eye, thus preventing it from functioning naturally.
Therefore, you should insert the end of a thin rod beneath the eyelid and lift it upward, or stretch it with a hook. Then, cut the adhesion with a fine spatula that should not have a sharp edge but should be slightly blunt so that it does not cause discomfort to the patient during the procedure, and so that the spatula does not damage the eye with its sharpness. Make the incision as if you are gently peeling away the adhesion until the eyelid returns to its natural shape and the adhesion is fully healed.
Then pour salty water into the eye, rinse it with this water, or instill a solution of sief made from dissolved ziniar.
Next, place a linen strip between the eyelid and the eye, and place over the eye wool soaked in egg white. After the third day, apply sief and consolidating agents until it heals.
On the incision of the ungula (growth) and the fleshy prominence near the tear duct.
Chapter XVI.
You should know that the ungula (growth) presents in two forms. Either it is fibrous, resembling hard, thin tissue.
Or it is non-fibrous, similar to a white, frozen moisture, which, when touched with an instrument or hook, breaks off and does not hold the hook.
Both types typically begin at the larger tear duct and gradually extend until they cover the vision, blocking light and eye movement.
The procedure for incising it is to have the patient rest their head on your lap.
Then, open their eyes and lift the eyelid with your hand.
Next, grasp the growth with a hook that has a slight curve, and lift it upwards.
Then take a needle, and insert a strong thread made of horsehair, ox, or cow hair. Bend the tip of the needle slightly, then embed it in the center of the ungula. Push the needle through the ungula, then secure the thread around it and stretch it upwards. Use the thread to scrape along the side of the ungula nearest to the pupil, as though you were sawing it with the thread until reaching its end.
Next, cut away the remainder near the tear duct’s root using a fine spatula or small scissors, preserving the natural flesh around the tear duct to prevent a continuous flow of tears.
Sometimes the ungula can be extended with only the hook or the thread, as previously described.
Then, scrape it off gently with a soft spatula, shaped as described.
Be careful not to let the spatula touch the corneal layer, as it could rupture and puncture the pupil.
After the incision, apply crushed salt or a solution made from ziniar (possibly a type of mineral or medicinal compound) to the eye, and leave it until the next day.
Then treat it with the appropriate remedies until it heals. If the ungula is non-fibrous and neither the needle nor the hook can hold onto it, this type is often treated with medicines and heals as described previously.
If you wish to cut it, open the patient’s eye and take a fine, smooth spatula with a slight edge, shaped as indicated.
Gently shave off the ungula from the top with precise scraping.
If you observe that the ungula is thinning and fragmenting, and the scraping is effective, then apply a few drops of your solution made from ziniar or red sief, or crushed salt, and cover the eye until the next day.
Then repeat the procedure on it until the entire ungula is removed.
Unless you are faced with a warm abscess in the eye; in that case, leave the ungula alone and treat the abscess until it heals. Then repeat the procedure with the scraping until it heals.
If the fleshy prominence near the tear duct causes significant discomfort in the eye, lift it with a hook and cut away a portion of it, but avoid excessive cutting to prevent continuous tearing.
Then apply red sief or a ziniar-based solution to the tear duct until it heals. On the incision of Alguardenic and the flesh that has grown in the eye.
Chapter 17.
Sometimes, in certain people's eyes, a reddish flesh grows or accumulates until it covers the pupil or approaches, or presses upon the eyelids, and it may even turn the eyelids outward; and it resembles the pomegranate flower.
And the procedure for this is also for the patient to place his head in your lap.
Then open his eyes, and gather all that flesh with hooks suitable for it: and hold it with one forceps, or fingers.
Then cut into the flesh at first, until it is fully removed with the scalpel.
And beware of the eye, so that you do not injure it during the operation: and make your incision, either with the spatumili, as we described in the incision of the nail, or with small scissors, with which asebel is gathered, as will be explained in the following chapter.
When your incision is complete and the entire alguardenici is removed, then fill the eye with crushed salt, or sprinkle it with red powder, or similar corrosive medicines; and place a cotton pad over the eye with egg white, so that it is protected from a hot swelling.
If anything remains of the alguardenici, and warm blood overpowers you, and you fear a hot swelling, then leave the eye, and treat it with what calms the swelling.
Then repeat the procedure on it until it is healed.
And do likewise with any additional flesh that grows in the eye of this kind.
However, it is necessary that you avoid treatment of any weak eye by natural or incidental means when operating with a blade: and do not place your hand in any of these operations until you see that the part is able to withstand that procedure.
On the removal of Sebel from the eye.
Chapter 18. Sebel are red veins that cover the eye and obstruct its vision: and they weaken the eye over time.
It is therefore necessary for you, first of all, to consider if the eye in which the Sebel is present is strong and has no other illness besides the Sebel: then remove its Sebel.
And instruct the patient to place his head in your lap.
Then raise those veins with one hook, or two, according to your judgment: and let the hook be fine and double-pointed, in this form, or let there be two hooks arranged on one body, in this form.
Then gather those veins delicately with fine scissors, and wipe away the blood from time to time, until you see those veins are removed from the eye, and they dissolve: and beware not to harm the eye with the tips of the spatumili.
Let your operation be at midday in the presence of sunlight, and be very steady in your work: so that you do not cut anything except those veins.
And when you are finished, then sprinkle the eye with green powder, or red, so that its sharpness may corrode what remains of the sebel.
If it is not possible for you to remove all of it in that time, then apply a plaster to the eye with something that soothes its pain: and leave it for several days, until its pain subsides and it is protected from a hot swelling: then repeat the procedure in the same way until it is healed.
And this is the form of the scissors.
On the reduction of Arissati to the nose.
Chapter 19.
The physicians call Arissati a fistula, which you treat with cautery, or with a sharp, burning medicine, as was previously described.
And if it does not heal, then there is no further recourse except to cut open the swelling at its origin and extract all the moisture and pus within it, until the bone is exposed.
When the bone is thus exposed, and you see decay or blackening on it, then scrape it with a tool of this shape.
It is called Asperi capitis.
It should be made of Indian iron, and its head should be round like azir, marked with fine notches made by a file or by a precise aliskilfer marking, and place it on the decayed part of the bone. Then rotate it between your fingers, and press your hand lightly, until you know that the decay has been scraped away; do this several times.
Then rotate it between your fingers, and press your hand lightly, until you know that the decay has been scraped away; do this several times. Then restore the area with drying, astringent medicines.
If the area thus heals, flesh grows in it, and the discharge stops; if it remains for forty days without recurrence, swelling, or complications, then you know it is healed.
If not, then there is no remedy except to redirect the fistula to the nasal opening, following this procedure.
And it is done by exposing the secondary bone with a blade or sharp medicine; and when the bone is exposed, take a drill in this shape, with a triangular iron end, and its wooden handle tapered to a point, as you see.
Then place it on the bone itself, near the lacrimal gland; and extend your hand slightly away from the eye.
Then rotate your hand with the drill until it penetrates the bone, and the patient can feel it, as he notices air escaping from it when he holds his hand over his nose.
Then restore the area with drying, astringent medicines, as I have taught you.
When flesh thus grows, and the area hardens, then the matter that was discharging externally will return to the nose; this will be easier for the patient.
On the reduction of the protrusion of the eye. Chapter 20.
When the eye protrudes fully, and there is no damage to vision or decrease in it, then it is necessary to calm the patient, then bleed him, and next place cups on his neck without incisions, but with suction.
Then place a liniment on the eye made from acacia, aloe, frankincense, and sarcocolla.
Then compress the eye with multiple cloth pads over the poultice.
The method for the pads is this: take many soft cloths and fold each one in four; make many of them, then place them one on top of the other, according to the size needed for the eye; then press firmly over them with a strong, coarse cloth.
And repeat the cupping with suction, without incisions.
Then remove the cups, and leave the eye bound day and night.
If the bandage becomes loose again, then it must be tightened greatly; then remove the bandage after a day and a night, as we have said.
If you see that the eye has now returned to the layer of the uvea, it is good; if not, then repeat the poultice, pads, compression, and cupping until it is healed.
On the incision of the uveal layer.
Chapter 21.
When a rupture occurs in the uveal layer, then it protrudes and extends outside the eyelids like a grape, disfiguring the person's appearance because of it, and if you wish to cut it: the procedure is as follows, as I describe: insert a needle into the root of the uvea from the lower to the upper part.
Then insert another needle with a double thread on the side of the lacrimal gland, and make it penetrate: and leave the first needle in its place.
Next, cut at the spot of the double thread, and tie with it the part of the uvea around the needle: and tighten it firmly.
Then remove the needle, and place wool soaked in egg white on the eye: and leave it, until the thread falls off with the uvea.
Then treat the eye with something that strengthens it, until the wound heals.
And sometimes the uvea is compressed all around with a cloth band, until the eye gains a large prominence.
Then it should be pierced with a fine spatula that reaches the depth of the eye, allowing the whitish fluid to flow, and the eye will lower and immediately return inside: then compress it, until it heals.
On the treatment of Alcomnati.
Chapter 22.
This condition called Alcomnati is merely pus that collects in the eye, resembling descending water, but it is not actually that.
And the method of treating it is to have the patient sit on a prepared or straightened seat.
Then take his head in your hands from both sides, and move it until you see the pus descending to the lower part before your eyes.
Then let it settle, and not descend further, and the vision will clear: and the patient will see things as he saw them before: if it does not descend downward, know that it is water.
If, however, the descent of the pus is not achieved with the method we mentioned, then have the patient sit between your hands. Then take a fine spatula, and make a small incision with it above the corneal membrane near the junction of the conjunctiva with the corneal layer at the top, until the pus flows out.
When it flows out, then instill in the eye warm water mixed with honey: or water in which you have already boiled fenugreek and honey: then treat it with the remaining treatment until it is healed.
On the treatment of water that descends into the eye, or cataract.
Chapter 23.
We have already explained the types of water in the division, and what is suitable for perforation with explanatory words, so take that same understanding according to its health benefit.
Then you should make the patient sit squarely between your hands, facing the light, near the sun: and bind his healthy eye, tightening it firmly: then hold the eyelid of his eye with your right hand if the eye with water is the left eye, or with your left hand if it is the right eye.
Then take the almagda in your right hand if it is the left eye, or in your left hand if it is the right eye.
Then place the end of the almagda near the coronal area by the thickness of the radius in the white of the eye visible in the lesser lacrimal region: then press the almagda forcefully, rotating your hand along with it until it penetrates into the white of the eye: and you feel that the almagda has reached an empty space.
And the depth reached by the almagda should be the same measure as the space from the pupil to the edge of the dark area: which is the coronal area of the eye.
For you will see it in the pupil itself with the vision of the eye, due to the clarity of the corneal layer.
Then place the almagda to the spot where the water is located.
Then press it downward repeatedly, one time after another.
If the water descends immediately, then the patient will immediately see what he opens his sight to, and the almagda in his eye.
Then rest briefly.
If the water descends, then lower it a second time, except for removing the almagda.
When it is fixed and does not rise up: then extract the almagda carefully, while gradually rotating your hand. Then dissolve some clear rock salt in water: and wash the eye internally with it.
Then place over the entire eye some tow or wool soaked in rose oil and egg white: and bind it over the healthy eye.
However, we and those of our time place ground cumin with egg white over it.
If the almagda does not enter the eye because of its hardness, as there are people whose eye is very hard: then you must take a spatula called the Alberid, which has this form.
Therefore, pierce only the conjunctiva with it, and do not push your hand deeply into the hole: this is only to create a path for the almagda in a narrow area.
Then insert the almagda as we have described.
At the completion of your procedure, prepare a properly arranged sleeping area for the patient, where he will lie on his back in a dark room: and he should be prohibited from all movements, and from coughing: provide food that calms his nature: and he should not move his head to the right or left at all.
And let the bandage remain in place until the third day. Then remove it in that dark room, and test his vision: and let him see things.
Then reapply the bandage until the seventh day.
And he should not do it at the time of treatment, nor immediately after the incision: rather, you should remove it, because the water ascends quickly with intense vision.
If a warm abscess appears: then you should release the eye before the seventh day: treat it with something that reduces the abscess, until it subsides: then expose his sight, and place a covering on his face to moderate his vision for several days, while he remains in that dark room.
Then he may gradually leave the house and move about in his dwelling.
And know that in zaltea a student is not exempt from sight sometimes: then indeed he may dare to proceed with the operation.
And indeed we have heard from some of those from Alayrach, who said that in Alayrach there was an almagda with a perforation by which the water is drawn.
However, I have not seen anyone in your land who has done this: nor have I read it in any of the ancient books: and it is possible that it is something new.
And these are the forms of the different types of almagda, so that it may be understood by those who are unfamiliar with it.
They should be properly made of metal: with their ends finely shaped in a triangular form, and the tip should be sharp.
Forms of the almagda.
On the treatment of flesh growths in the nose.
Chapter 24.
Sometimes various fleshy growths appear in the nose, some of which resemble a many-legged scorpion, some of which are cancerous, stony, and dark-colored; others are soft flesh, not dark-colored.
For those growths that are soft, benign, and non-cancerous, have the patient sit between your hands, facing the sun, and open his nostrils. Insert a hook into the growths, then pull them outward and cut away what you have hooked with a slender, sharp spatula on one side until you know that all the flesh has been removed.
If any remains that cannot be cut, scrape it gently with a fine instrument until nothing is left.
If there is excessive bleeding or a hot abscess occurs, then treat it with appropriate measures. If it is one of the malignant abscesses, immediately cauterize it until the bleeding stops, and all flesh is removed.
Then, after the incision, pour vinegar, water, or wine into the nose.
If the nose opens and moisture reaches down to the palate, then you know it is healed.
However, if the moisture does not penetrate as it should, then know that there is flesh growing in the upper bones of the nose, where the instrument cannot reach with incision.
Then you should insert a linen thread of moderate thickness with multiple knots spaced about a finger's width apart. The patient should inhale in a way that allows one end of the thread to enter his nose using a rod or whatever tool is feasible, as long as it resembles a hook. The patient should continue inhaling until the thread reaches the back of the throat and exits near the throat.
Many times, young students accomplish similar things with small objects in schools, so this is an easy task for someone willing.
Next, place both ends of the thread—one that comes out over the nose and the other that remains in the nose.
Then administer the cutting of flesh with the knots along the thread. Do this until you know that the flesh is held by the knots of the thread.
Then remove the thread and place in the nose, after the blood is wiped away, a piece of cotton soaked in Egyptian ointment. Do this for three days or more, until the ointment erodes all remaining flesh.
Then, as the final step, place a lead tube in the nose for several days until it heals.
If a drying treatment is needed, apply it.
For head-cleansing, to distill oils and other medicines into the nose, make a tool from silver or copper resembling a small lamp, open like a shell, with similar passageways.
And if you wish, make a closed tube, like a reed.
And let the shell of the head-cleansing instrument be full and open, with a handle at the back, so that you may hold it when you heat oil or whatever juices or flowing substances you wish in it.
And this is the form of the instrument. On the treatment of *thelul* (small nasal tumor) in the nose.
Chapter 25.
Often a small tumor (*thelul*) grows at the tip of the nose, enlarges, and increases over time, eventually becoming unsightly.
For this reason, you should cut it as soon as it appears and completely remove it from the root.
Then apply either cautery or a burning medicine to the area to heal it.
If the incision is delayed until it enlarges, then consider if it is stony, hard, dark-colored, and with little sensation. In this case, do not touch it with iron, as it is a cancerous tumor.
I have often seen cases where one cuts such a cancerous tumor, leading to great harm to the person who has it.
If the tumor is soft to the touch, not dark-colored, and you see that a complete incision is possible, then drain the patient and cut it without fear or worry. Treat the area with drying and astringent remedies until it heals.
On the suturing of the nose, lip, and ear.
Chapter 26.
Be aware that when a separation occurs in the continuity of one of these cartilages, treatment is only sometimes effective, depending on the person.
Therefore, when an injury like this occurs, assess whether it is a fresh wound with blood present. If so, bring the two edges of the wound together with a suture, and then treat it until it heals.
If the edges of the wound have already separated and each part has healed, you must abrade each side until it bleeds.
Then bring the two edges together with a suture, tighten them, and sprinkle ground dragon’s blood and frankincense onto the wound. Apply a piece of diafinicon plaster or another healing plaster over the powders, and leave it bound for two or three days.
Then unbind it and change the medicine; leave it until the stitches fall out on their own. Finally, treat it with ointment until it heals.
The method of suturing is to bring the parts together either with needles, as we described in suturing the abdomen, or with thread, as I have taught you.
On the extraction of nodules from the lips.
Chapter 27. Many people develop hard nodules within their lips that resemble small herb seeds, with some larger and others smaller.
You must turn the lip inside out, cut over each nodule, suspend it with a hook, and cut it from all sides.
Then fill the incision site with ground alum until the bleeding stops.
Afterward, rinse with vinegar and treat the area with a styptic until the wounds heal.
On the incision of flesh growing on the gums.
Chapter 28. Often a fleshy growth, called *abuluss* by the ancients, appears on the gums.
You should suspend it with a hook or hold it with forceps, cut it at its root, and allow pus or blood to flow.
Then apply ground alum or other styptic, drying powders to the area.
If the growth returns after treatment, as it often does, then cut it again and cauterize it, for it will not return after cauterization.
On the scraping of teeth with iron.
Chapter 29.
Sometimes rough, unsightly crusts accumulate on the surfaces of teeth, both on the inner and outer parts, and between the gums. The teeth may become dark, yellow, or green, and this decay can spread to the gums, making the teeth unsightly.
You should have the patient sit between your hands with his head in your lap and scrape the molars and any other teeth where you see crusts or sand-like substances until nothing remains. Do the same for the discoloration—black, green, yellow, and others—until the teeth are clean.
If you remove what is there on the first scraping, that is good. If not, repeat the scraping on another day, a second time and a third, until you achieve the desired result.
Be aware that teeth require scrapers of various forms and shapes, according to the needs of your work. For instance, the scraper used for the lower part of a tooth differs from that used between teeth, in other forms.
And you should have these forms of scrapers prepared and ready, as you can observe.
On the Extraction of Tooth Pain.
Chapter 30.
You must treat a painful tooth with every possible means and delay its extraction if possible.
Nothing truly substitutes for a tooth once it is extracted, as it is an exalted substance. Therefore, only when there is no alternative should extraction be considered. In that case, confirm thoroughly with the patient that the aching tooth itself is the one requiring extraction.
Often, pain can deceive the patient, who may mistakenly believe the pain is in a healthy tooth and has it extracted, only for the pain to persist until the actual diseased tooth is removed.
We have seen this occur frequently in the work of inexperienced phlebotomists.
Once you have confirmed the aching tooth, it is necessary to scarify around it with a pointed tool possessing adequate strength until the gum loosens completely. Then, gradually move the tooth with your fingers or with fine forceps until you sufficiently shake it.
Next, position large forceps correctly on the tooth, and place the patient’s head firmly between your knees to hold it steady. Then, pull the tooth straight out to avoid breaking it.
If the tooth does not come out, take one of your tools and gently insert it beneath the tooth on all sides, moving it as you did initially.
If the tooth is perforated or decayed, you should fill the cavity with a piece of cloth, then secure it with the end of a thin rod to prevent it from breaking when you grip it with forceps.
Be diligent in scarifying around the gum on all sides.
Control your strength to avoid breaking the tooth and leaving part of it, which could result in complications worse than the initial pain.
Be cautious not to act like inexperienced phlebotomists, who in their haste and boldness during extractions, ignore the guidance we have provided.
For, as we have often observed, they cause patients serious harm, breaking the tooth and leaving its roots or even pulling part of the jawbone. After extraction, rinse the site with wine or with vinegar and salt. If bleeding occurs at the site (which often happens), grind some alum and apply it to the area. If alum is ineffective, cauterize it.
The fine forceps for initially loosening the tooth should have long ends and a short, thick handle, so they do not bend under pressure. The handles should be strong enough to avoid bending or folding when gripped. They should have short, straight ends made from high-quality iron or sturdy steel, with interlocking teeth at the tips for a firm, even grip.
Sometimes the ends are shaped like the beak of a bird called the stork, providing a very strong grip.
On Tooth Extraction and Removal of Fractured Jaw Bones.
Chapter 31.
If a part of the tooth breaks and remains after extraction, place a poultice with butter on the site for one or two days until it softens. Then, insert a tool, such as an algast or forceps, whose tips resemble the beak of a bird known as the stork.
This is the form of the forceps.
The tips should have an inner surface like a file or like aliskilfegi (a type of file or rough surface).
If the tooth does not respond and come out with these forceps, then you must carefully work around the root, exposing all surrounding tissue, and insert an instrument known as the “small lever,” which has this form.
It should have a short, somewhat thick end and should not be too fine, to avoid breaking.
If the root comes out this way, that is ideal. If not, use other tools, which have the following shapes.
The first instrument has a triangular tip with some thickness.
Another is a triangular but finer tip.
Another useful instrument has two branches and this shape. These tools, along with those previously described for tooth scraping, can be of great assistance.
A further helpful tool resembles a large hook with a twisted, triangular tip of substantial thickness to prevent breakage; it should not be too fine.
Know that there are many dental instruments, and countless other tools as well. A skilled practitioner, clever in their craft, often discovers suitable tools themselves based on the needs of the operation and the specific ailments.
There are some conditions for which the ancients did not provide specific instruments due to the varied nature of such cases.
If a jaw bone or another bone of the mouth fractures or decays, carefully explore the area with the appropriate instruments and forceps mentioned for root extraction, and use a tool called “gesti,” shaped as follows.
The “gesti” should gradually narrow, allowing a firm grip on the bone so it does not slip or move, ensuring complete removal. Then, treat the area with suitable medications.
If there is minor decay in the bone, scrape away the rot and treat the bone until it heals.
On Filing Teeth that Protrude Over Others.
Chapter 32.
When teeth protrude unnaturally, they mar the appearance, especially in women and girls, particularly those who are in public view.
If a tooth has emerged behind another and is misaligned, such that neither filing nor grinding is possible, then extract it. If it is attached to another tooth, cut it using this instrument, which has the following shape.
It resembles a small beak and is made from Indian iron, with a very sharp tip.
Make this cut gradually over several days due to the hardness of the tooth, ensuring it does not disturb adjacent teeth.
If the protruding tooth can be filed down, use an iron file, shaped as follows.
The file should be entirely of iron, with a handle covered in small points, similar to a file used for making needles. Gradually file down the tooth over several days, working gently to avoid loosening the tooth and causing it to fall out. Finally, smooth the tooth with a fine razor.
If part of a tooth breaks off and injures the tongue, file it down until the roughness is removed, leveling and smoothing it so it no longer harms the tongue or impedes speech.
On Stabilizing Loose Teeth with Gold Wire.
Chapter 33.
When the front teeth are shaken or loosened due to an impact or fall, and the patient cannot bite down properly without risking tooth loss, and you have attempted to treat them with astringent medications without success, the best approach is to stabilize the teeth using gold wire. This is because silver turns green and corrodes over time, while gold remains unchanged.
The wire should be of moderate thickness and fineness, appropriate to fit securely between the teeth.
The procedure for stabilization involves taking the wire, doubling it, and threading it between two healthy teeth. Then, weave the two ends of the wire between the loose teeth—whether one or multiple—until you reach a healthy tooth on the other side.
Next, weave the wire back to where you started, tightening it with precision and skill until the loose teeth are entirely stable. The constriction should be close to the roots to prevent movement.
Cut off the excess ends of the wire with scissors, twist the two ends together with forceps, and conceal them between a healthy tooth and a loose one to avoid irritating the tongue. Then leave it in place until the teeth are secure.
If the wire loosens or breaks, replace it with a new one, and it will hold in place over time.
This is the form and arrangement of the teeth in stabilizing two healthy teeth and two loose teeth, as shown.
Sometimes, one or two teeth can return to their original positions after such stabilization and will stay in place, but only a skilled and experienced practitioner can accomplish this.
In some cases, a piece of cow bone may be shaped like a tooth and placed in the gap, securing the tooth as described. This placement is stable and can last a long time.
On Cutting the Lingual Frenulum that Limits Speech.
Chapter 34.
If there is a hardening or nodule caused by scar tissue, insert a small hook and cut across it until the frenulum is divided and the nodule released.
If bleeding occurs, apply powdered *zegi* (a hemostatic agent) to the site. If the bleeding persists, cauterize the area with a suitable gentle cautery. Then treat the wound with appropriate care until it heals. On Removing a *Ranula* (Cyst) Beneath the Tongue.
Chapter 35.
Sometimes, a cyst resembling a small frog (called a *ranula*) forms beneath the tongue, hindering its natural movement and potentially enlarging enough to fill the mouth.
If it appears dark brown or black, hard, and lacks sensation, do not touch it, as this could indicate cancer.
However, if it appears whitish and moist, insert a hook and incise it with a fine scalpel, freeing it from all sides.
If bleeding interferes with the procedure, apply powdered *zegi* to control it. Then resume the operation until the cyst is fully removed.
Afterward, rinse with vinegar and salt, and continue treatment with appropriate aftercare until it heals completely.
On the treatment of abscess of the two tonsils.
Chapter 36.
And then you will either pierce it, or it will rupture on its own.
And if it is white in color, round, and its root is thin: then it is necessary to incise it.
And the procedure for it is, that you consider before the operation, if its abscess has quietly completed its warm inflammation, or if it has decreased to a certain extent: then make the patient sit in front of the sun, and his head should rest in your lap: open his mouth, and let an assistant hold it between his hands, and press down his tongue with an instrument, which has this shape. Let it be made of silver or bronze, and be thin like a small knife.
Then, when you press the tongue down with it, and the abscess is revealed to you, and your gaze falls upon it: then take a hook, and fix it into the tonsil, and pull it outward as much as you can, without pulling with it any of the membranes.
Then cut it with an instrument, which has the following shape.
It resembles scissors: however, the ends of it should be curved, so that the opening of each is directly sharp towards the other: take care that it is made of Indian steel, or imbued with alfuled.
If, however, this instrument is not present, then cut it with a spatumil, which has this shape.
It should be sharp on one side, not sharp on the other side.
And after you cut one tonsil, cut the other according to this same kind of incision.
Then after the incision, let the patient gargle with cold water, or with vinegar and water.
If, however, there occurs a flow of blood, let him gargle with water in which pomegranate rinds have been boiled, or myrtle leaves, and similar astringents, until the flow of blood stops: then treat it until it heals.
And sometimes other abscesses arise in the throat, besides the two tonsils.
Therefore cut them according to what I said in the incision of the two tonsils equally.
And I indeed once treated a woman with an abscess, which had arisen between her throat, which had taken on a dark color, with little sensation, which had almost closed her throat: and the woman breathed with difficulty through a narrow passage, and it had already prevented her from eating and drinking water: and she had already reached the point of death, if she had remained one or two more days.
And the abscess had grown so much that it had sent out two branches, which extended over the two nostrils.
So I hurried quickly, and fixed a hook into one of them.
Then I pulled it, and a large portion was extracted from it.
Then I cut it off, where it extended from the nasal cavity.
Then I did the same for the one that extended from the other nostril.
Then I opened her mouth, pressed down her tongue: and then I fixed the hook into the abscess: then I cut a portion from it, and only a little blood flowed: the woman’s throat was thus freed, and she immediately began to drink water, and then took some food.
Therefore, I did not cease cutting from that abscess many times over a long period: and the abscess kept returning in the place where I had incised it, until it became very extended with her.
So I took a risk, and cauterized the abscess within the throat.
Then it ceased to increase: then I departed, and I did not know what God did with her after me.
On the incision of an abscess of the uvula.
Chapter 37.
When phlegm descends to the uvula, and it becomes swollen, and is elongated, then it is called a pendant: and if it is thick and round at the lower part, then it is called a grape.
When it is treated with what we mentioned in the division, and the treatment is not effective, and you see that the warm abscess has subsided from it, and it is thin: then it is necessary to incise it.
And if it is gathered, round, without length, and is reddish, dark, or black, and has no sensation: then it is necessary to avoid its incision.
For in this there is a risk to the patient.
Therefore, when you see it as I have described in whiteness and length, you should make the patient sit facing the sun: press down his tongue with the instrument previously described: then fix a hook in the uvula, pull it downward, and cut it with one of the two instruments I mentioned for the incision of the two tonsils.
And you should not cut from it except that which exceeds the natural boundary without excess.
For if you cut more than that, you will harm the voice and speech.
Then after the incision, use what we mentioned in the incision of the two tonsils: and treat it until it heals.
But if the patient is frightened of the incision: then it is necessary to use ingenuity in cauterizing it without fear or dread.
And the method of cauterization in it is only with sharp water: which is done by placing the patient’s head in your lap.
Then press down his tongue with the instrument we mentioned.
Then take from the water I mentioned to you in the chapter on cauterization, and prepare with it unslaked lime, and apply it in a way that is not thick nor thin, and fill the hollow of this instrument, whose shape is as follows.
Let the end where the medicine is placed be concave, like the concavity of a spoon’s ray.
And place the instrument with the medicine over the uvula itself: and let the patient lie on his side, so that saliva runs from his mouth due to the internal medicine, so that nothing descends from it to his throat and harms it.
Then hold your hand with the medicine.
And you should apply it to the uvula for about half an hour, until you see it has turned dark, and the sting of the medicine has subsided.
And if you wish, you may take a piece of cotton, wrap it around the tip of a probe, soak the cotton in the medicine, and insert the probe with the cotton into a tube from above, until the cotton adheres to the uvula. Do this many times, until you achieve the desired cauterization of the uvula.
Then leave it: for it will dry out and fall off after three or four days.
If you need to repeat the medicine, repeat it: and after the cauterization, wipe around the uvula with cotton soaked in butter, and clean with it what is around it from the medicine: and rinse with cold water.
And treat externally with poultices, and internally with gargles, until it heals.
This method of treatment is therefore safer than incision and more distant from fear.
And sometimes the uvula is treated with something even gentler than cauterization and incision: it is treated with fumigation, in this manner.
Take calamint, hyssop, oregano, rue, sseah, chamomile, southernwood, and similar herbs: and combine them all, or some of them in a pot, and submerge them in vinegar, and let them boil: and let the pot be sealed properly with clay: and in the middle of the pot, let there be an opening, over which is placed a hollow instrument in this manner.
Let it be made of silver or bronze: and let the end, which has a perforation, be inserted into the patient’s mouth, until the vapor rises to the uvula over the tube, until the uvula becomes very discolored.
Then repeat over it many times, until it dries out.
And beware, do not perform this treatment at the onset of the abscess.
For often it will increase the abscess: and you should not do it unless at the decline of its hot abscess.
If, however, you do not have this instrument at hand, then take a reed and place an eggshell at its end, so that the patient's mouth is not burned, for the eggshell prevents the vapor from burning the mouth, and this is a good treatment for healing.
On the extraction of thorns and bones from the throat.
Chapter 38.
Often, a bone, a fish spine, or something else adheres in the throat.
Therefore, it is necessary to extract whatever is visible, upon which your sight falls, after pressing the tongue down with an instrument in the sunlight, and it will become clear to you what is in the throat.
And if something does not appear to you and is hidden in the throat, you must induce the patient to vomit before the food is digested in the stomach.
For perhaps the attached object will be expelled by vomiting.
Or let the patient swallow a piece of turnip, or a lettuce root, or a small morsel of dry bread; or take a piece of soft, dried sea sponge, tie it with a thread, and then let him swallow it.
Then, when it reaches the place where the spines or the bone are, it will be extracted and come out. If it does not come out with what we have mentioned, then use a lead instrument in this shape.
Let it be slightly thicker than a rod, and at its end, let there be a curve, which is easily inserted into the throat, and let the patient keep his head elevated.
And let him avoid touching his epiglottis to prevent coughing, and let him press with it against the bone or spine, or the physician may insert it with his own hand.
But it is better if the patient inserts it himself, since he knows the location of the attached object, and he should push it downward or pull his hand with the instrument upward, in the amount prepared for him, until it is expelled.
On the extraction of a leech.
Chapter 39.
When a leech is treated with what I mentioned in the section on medicinal treatments and it does not work, then examine the patient's throat in the sunlight, either directly or by sunlight, after pressing his tongue with the instrument I told you about.
If your sight then falls upon the leech, extract it with a small hook or carefully with fine forceps.
If it is not possible with those, then take a hollow tube, insert it into the patient’s throat near the throat, then insert heated iron with fire into the hollow of the tube.
Do this repeatedly, and let the patient abstain from water for the whole day.
Then let him take a glass full of cold water, open his mouth in it, rinse his mouth with it without swallowing any, and move the water with his hand every hour.
For the leech will immediately fall when it senses the water.
If it still does not come out with what we have mentioned, then fumigate the patient with bedbugs or with asa using the instrument I described for fumigating the uvula.
Do this repeatedly, for it will fall.
The method for fumigation is to take a pot containing live coals with fire; let the pot be covered with a lid that has a hole in its center, and place the end of the instrument in that hole.
Then, let the fumigation enter, and let the patient place his mouth on the end of the tube, and close his mouth so that the fumigation does not escape, until you know that the fumigation has reached the leech.
For the leech will immediately fall.
If it does not fall, then repeat the fumigation many times.
And let the patient endure thirst, eat salty food and garlic, and not drink water. It is thus necessary that it be expelled with this treatment.
And this is the shape of the instrument with which the leech is extracted from the throat, when it comes into view.
It is similar to forceps, as you see, except that it has this curve, which is inserted into the throat.
And its end is like the beak of the bird called a stork, with a roughness like a file; when it grasps something, it does not let it go at all.
On the opening of abscesses, and their incision and treatment in general.
Chapter 40.
There are many types of abscesses, of many kinds, as has been remembered here, namely one by one in this book; and they differ in their perforation and incision according to two methods.
One of these is according to the type of abscess itself and what it holds in terms of humors.
And the second method is according to the location in the body where it occurs.
For an abscess occurring in the head is different from an abscess occurring in the anus; and an abscess occurring in a fleshy place is different from an abscess occurring in the joints, and each one of them has its own treatment according to its procedure.
And of the abscesses, there are those that should not be perforated until the pus has matured in them and reached completion, and of these, there are those that must be perforated while they are still raw and do not mature fully.
Like abscesses that are close to the joints.
For when an abscess occurs near a joint and is prolonged until the surrounding tissue rots, the ligaments or nerves of that joint may become damaged, which is a cause of contraction in that limb.
Or the abscess is near a principal organ: for if you delay perforation until it matures, it will harm either that organ or the primary member near it.
Or if it is near the anus, perforate it while it is immature; it is not necessary to perforate an immature abscess that has not fully digested except when it is near the anus, so that the depth does not rot and extend to the interior of the anus, creating a fistula or leading to a condition that cannot heal. You should know the proper time for perforating an abscess that has matured fully, which is when pain subsides, fever decreases, and redness, pulsation, and the sharpness of the abscess's head lessen, along with other signs. And you must make this perforation at the lower part of the abscess and the area of greatest prominence; and the perforation should follow the length of the body if the abscesses are in the parts of the hands and feet, and in the places of muscles, tendons, nerves, and arteries, and ultimately in all smooth areas without bends.
In those that bend, however, make the perforation according to that limb.
But when an abscess is in fleshy places, then it is better to delay its perforation until its digestion is fully confirmed, as we have mentioned.
For if you perforate it before this, the flow of fluid will prolong, and there will be much filth and discharge, and perhaps its edges and depth will harden.
And certain abscesses are perforated across the width of the body as necessary, or according to the needs of the limb.
And you must administer a small perforation in small abscesses and a large perforation in large abscesses, or make multiple incisions proportional to the size of the abscess.
And there are abscesses where the skin must be hollowed out and incised when it has become like a cloth and has reached a stage where it is dead tissue, as often happens with boils and swellings.
And some of them are cut with an incision having three angles.
And some are incised in the shape of a myrtle leaf.
Such as an inguinal abscess.
And some have a round incision, a crescent incision, and similar types of cuts.
As for those without a head, such as mild, superficial abscesses, you should perforate them with a superficial or flat perforation only.
And it is necessary, when an abscess is large and has collected much pus, and you perforate it, not to rush and extract all the pus at once; rather, extract part of it.
Then cover the abscess until the next day.
Then draw out some of the pus again.
Do this gradually, repeatedly, until it is expelled, especially if the patient is of weak strength, a pregnant woman, a small child, or an elderly person; for the animal spirit often dissipates with the release of pus, and the patient may die without you realizing it.
Therefore, handle this matter with great caution.
And after your perforation, with which you pierce these abscesses, it is necessary to clean the wound and observe it.
If the wound of the abscess is small, or the incision is flat, then apply lint from linen or old cotton.
And if the abscess is large and there are many fissures from the perforation, then you must insert lint into each fissure until they meet each other.
And if you have cut away part of the skin from the abscess or hollowed it out around the edges, then it is necessary to fill it with old cotton, or as cloth is woven, or with lint from linen without moisture; and secure it until the third day.
Then remove it, and treat it with the appropriate ointment until it heals.
If bleeding occurs during your procedure, then apply cold water and vinegar, after soaking a cloth in them, and place it over the site of the bleeding multiple times.
If the bleeding persists, then you must apply the regimen, treatment, and powders that I have described in many places in this book and in the separate sections.
If it is in winter and the site of the abscess has many nerves, then it is necessary to soak pads with warm wine and oil and place them on the area.
And if it is summer and the areas are fleshy, then you should place pads soaked in water and oil, or in wine and oil, and make sure everything is cool.
Until, when the third day comes, as we have said, it is then necessary to loosen the abscess, clean it, and administer treatment appropriate to it until it heals.
This is what is necessary for knowledge of the general treatment of abscesses.
Following the path of distinction, I have already described each abscess, how its treatment proceeds step by step individually.
On the incision of abscesses that occur on the scalp.
Chapter 41.
Small abscesses occur on the scalp, and they are of the types of nodes, which are encased in membranes that act as sacs, as if they were the gizzards of chickens.
And there are many types of them.
Some of them are fatty; some contain moisture like mud; some contain moisture similar to curds and porridge and things like that; and some are stone-hard.
And in making incisions in all of them and extracting them, there is no cause for fear, as long as no artery interferes with the incision.
And the procedure for incising them is that you explore them with an instrument, the shape of which follows here, called the Intromittor, until you know what it contains.
For if it is one that contains moisture, then cut it with a superficial incision along its length, in this shape.
And begin the incision from line b to line g. When the moisture is drained, then strip away the cyst that contains this moisture, and do not leave any part of it behind at all.
For it often returns if any of it is left behind. Then soak a piece of cotton in Egyptian ointment, if it is available; if not, in water and salt; and fill the wound with it, and leave it until the next day.
For it will erode whatever remains of the cyst. Then repeat the application of the cotton with Egyptian ointment a second and third time, and as needed, until you are confident that nothing remains of the cyst; then treat the wound with ointment until it heals.
But if the abscess contains a fatty node, then cut it in the shape of a cross, and insert hooks between the two lips of the incision, and peel it away on all sides, and apply your skill in extracting the membrane that encloses it.
If an artery obstructs you, then do what I will describe to you later.
And do the same in the case of an abscess if it is stone-hard, with the same incision and treatment as we have described. And making an incision in a stone-hard abscess is easier, as there is little blood and moisture.
And sometimes there are certain abscesses on the scalp in certain people which contain no moisture at all.
Or place the perforation always at the lower part of them, so that the flow of pus is directed downward.
Then treat them with the remedy that is suitable for them.
On the incision of strophulas (small, often cystic or glandular swellings) in the neck.
Chapter 42.
These abscesses often appear in the neck, under the armpits, and in the groin; sometimes they appear in other parts of the body as well.
And among those that appear in the neck, they may be single or multiple and often arise one after another. Each strophula is contained within its own membrane, much like the nodes and abscesses of the scalp, as we have previously described.
And there are many types of these strophulas.
Some of them are stone-hard; others contain fluid; still others are malignant and resist treatment.
For those among them that appear to have a healthy constitution when touched—clearly close to the color of the skin, mobile in all directions, and not attached to the neck’s nerves, major blood vessels, or arteries, and not deeply embedded—you should incise it superficially from the upper part to the lower part of the body along line b to line g. Strip it away completely, and use hooks or multiple hooks, as needed, to pull back the edges of the skin as we described in the case of scalp abscesses, and gradually extract it.
And take extra care not to cut any vein or nerve.
Use a rounded, not too sharp spatula so that it does not add pressure with your hand during the incision, or cause unnecessary discomfort to the patient, nor lead you to cut beyond what is necessary.
If you cut a vein or artery or it obstructs your work, then apply powdered alum (zegi) or some other styptic powders to the wound to staunch the bleeding, bandage the wound, and leave it alone until the swelling of the abscess subsides, and the wound softens or starts to suppurate.
Once the bleeding stops, return to your work and continue until the procedure is complete.
Then tend to it.
If the entire strophula is incised, then you should bring the two edges of the wound together and suture it immediately, as soon as you are certain that there is no remaining excess.
If you see that some excess remains due to the size of the strophula, then you must focus on cutting its root and extracting it, and then apply the sutures as we discussed.
For those strophulas that contain fluid, make a superficial incision to reveal the location of its ripening, and place the incision at the lower part to allow drainage downward, as we have described.
Then, after the incision, apply lint with ointment or similar substances to corrode any remaining infection until you see that the wound is thoroughly cleansed. At that point, treat it with a flesh-regenerating ointment until it heals.
On the cutting of the epiglottis from an abscess occurring within the throat.
Chapter 43.
The ancients mentioned this incision in the epiglottis, and I have not seen anyone in our land who has done it: and this is the written account of their discourse.
In those with quinsy, the cutting of the epiglottis should be avoided: since no benefit comes from it, because all the veins and the lung are weak.
In those, however, who have a hot abscess in the mouth, or throat, or on both tonsils, when there is no disease in the channel, the cutting of the epiglottis should be used to avoid the harm that results from choking. Therefore, when we wish to perform this, we should cut the epiglottis under three or four circles of the epiglottis, making a small transverse cut in the area between two circles, so that the cut is in the membrane, not in the cartilage: and indeed this place is suitable for cutting, since it is devoid of flesh, and the blood vessels are distant from it.
If the physician is fearful, then the skin of the throat should be stretched with a hook.
Then let him split the skin until he reaches the channel: avoid any blood vessels if any are seen.
Then let him cut the membrane as we described: and over the cut of the channel there appears phlegm that comes out from it, along with its rupture, and loss of voice.
And leave the wound open for a time.
Then, when the time of feared choking has passed, join the two lips of the skin wound and sew it alone without the cartilage.
Then administer medicines that help flesh to grow, until it heals.
Albucasis says.
The essence of this discourse which we have narrated is not intended, except when they see that one of these abscesses has already blocked the throat of the patient, and the patient is elevated near death, and desires for his breath to be interrupted: they proceed to cut the epiglottis, so that the patient may breathe over the site of the wound with a certain respiration, and be saved from death: and for this reason, they ordered to leave the wound open until the evil of the illness is consumed, which takes three days, approximately: then they ordered to sew the wound, and treat it, until it heals.
And what I myself saw is that a servant girl took a knife and put it in her throat, and cut with it part of her lung’s channel.
I was called to her treatment, and I found her groaning, like the groaning of the dying.
Therefore, I examined the wound, and I found little blood that had come out from the wound.
I was confident, therefore, that she had not cut a vein, nor harmed herself seriously: and air was coming out from the wound.
I hurried, therefore, and sewed the wound, and treated it until it healed: and nothing happened to the servant girl except hoarseness in her voice: and after some days she returned to a better state of health.
Hence, I say that in the cutting of the epiglottis there is no fear.
On the cutting of a throat hernia.
Chapter 44.
This abscess called a throat hernia is a large abscess, matching the color of the body: and it is found much in women.
And it occurs in two types: it is either natural or accidental. Certainly, in the natural type there is no remedy.
The accidental type, however, has two forms: one of which is similar to fatty nodes.
The other form is similar to an abscess that arises from the swelling of an artery.
And in it there is danger, and one should not presume to treat it with a knife, unless it is small: and you should test it, and investigate it with a probe.
If you find it similar to a fatty node, and it is not connected to any veins, then cut it as nodes are cut: and remove it with whatever it contains from a cyst, if it is in a cyst: and if not, then inspect it fully.
Then treat the area with what is required for healing, until it is cured.
On the cutting of various types of nodes.
Chapter 45. There are many types of nodes, and I have already described all their types in the division: and it is fitting to relate here the difference between a node and an exudation, as it causes confusion. I say, therefore, that with an exudation, there is heat, fever, and intense pain, until the boiling of excess fluid subsides and putrefaction is complete: then, the fever and heat subside.
With a node, however, there is no heat, nor fever, nor pain, and they are contained in a membrane, which is their own sac, and is the color of the body: and they begin the size of a chickpea and grow like a watermelon, both larger and smaller.
And they are of two types: either fatty or containing fluid.
And the colors of the fluid are various, as I mentioned in the division. Therefore, when you come to treat a node, you must examine it, and first investigate it with the instrument called an intromissum, according to the method that will appear in the chapter that follows this.
And the method of examining abscesses and all nodes is that you take this instrument and insert it into the wetter area you find in the abscess: and you move your fingers with it gradually, until you know that the instrument has penetrated the skin.
Then measure the extent of your hand according to the size of the abscess.
Then remove the intromissum, and observe what comes out in its trace.
If a flowing fluid emerges, whatever its color: then cut it with a superficial incision, as I have described in the other abscesses.
And if no fluid comes out at the trace of the intromissum, then know that it is fatty: therefore, cut it with an incision in the shape of a cross, following this shape, as I have taught you: suspend it with hooks, and peel the skin from all sides gently: and if possible, preserve the sac around it so that you may remove it intact with the node.
However, if the sac bursts during the operation and it is not possible to remove it intact, as often happens, then extract it piece by piece, until none of it remains.
For if any amount of it, large or small, remains, the node will usually return.
But if you are defeated and a small part remains: then fill the wound upon completion with certain sharp corrosive powders: and close the wound, and apply over it a warm abscess dressing, and treat it with the remaining steps of the treatment until it heals.
If the node is large, then sew its two lips, and treat it with something that generates flesh. If, however, there is a pulsating or non-pulsating vein in your way: then act quickly, and fill the place with powdered zegi, and leave it compressed for two or three days, until the wound putrefies and the bubbling of the blood subsides: then return to cut what remains of the node.
On the external instruments for cutting and perforation.
Chapter 46.
Among them are the shapes of intromissa, and there are three types.
For among them is a large one, a medium one, and a small one.
They should be made of polished iron with square ends to ease their entry into abscesses.
And these are the forms of Experientia, or perforating tools: one of them is called beris, that is, a perforator, and there are three types.
For among them is a large, a medium, and a small one.
They are suitable for probing abscesses, exudations, fistulas, and buboes in areas where bones are involved.
And others are made round, smooth, and polished, like large needles used to stitch cushions, and are made of brass, or copper, or iron, or silver. And the best of them are those made from brass.
Experientia are also made from black lead, which are suitable for examining fistulas, which, with their curves, allow a gentle retraction.
And there are again three types. For among them are long, medium, and short ones, according to the width and narrowness of the fistula. The form of hooks, and they are of many types. For among them are simple ones, that is, with one curve: and they are of three types as you see, large, medium, and small.
And among them are blunt hooks: and they are of three types.
And among them are hooks with two curves, and they are of three types: and among them are hooks with three curves, and they are of three types: and all these are necessary in their respective places.
And these are the forms of scalpels, with which nodes and abscesses are cut and scraped: and there are three types: among them are large, medium, and small.
Their ends for cutting are sharp, while the other ends are not sharp: and they are designed this way to assist in scraping nodes when there is a risk of cutting a vein or nerve: and so that the patient may heal and find some relief from the cauterization encountered during the scraping of an abscess.
These are Magda, and they are of three types.
They are made of copper, and they resemble a probe, with which alcohol is made: and at the broad end, there is a hidden pointed Spatumilis: and it moves inward and outward when you wish, as you see.
The form of Spatumilia that are hidden between the fingers during the perforation of abscesses: and the patients do not notice them: and there are three types, large, medium, and small.
The forms of cups used for cutting off the flow of blood: and there are three types, large, medium, and small.
They are made of brass or copper, round, slightly elongated, as you see: and they should be delicate.
And it is necessary for you to have these types of cups, both large and small: so that you may quickly cut off the blood flow in an emergency, and when medicine is not present.
However, do not use them for cutting blood flow in every part of the body, and use them only in fleshy areas: such as the calves, thighs, arms, breasts, abdomen, and groin, and similar areas, which are fleshy and moist.
And sometimes they are made as small instruments, similar to the shape of pistachio shells: by which blood is cut off when it flows from a place of phlebotomy, or at the incision of a vein or artery: and sometimes they are made round in this shape.
On the treatment of men's nipples that resemble women's breasts.
Chapter 47.
Sometimes the nipples of certain men become swollen at the end of sleep (that is, when they begin to be affected in sleep), until they resemble women's breasts, and they remain disgustingly infected.
Therefore, he who detests this must cut over the nipples with a crescent-shaped incision, in the form from line b. to line g. Then scrape off all the fat.
Next, fill the wound with healing medication.
Then bring together the two edges of the wound with a suture, and care for it until it heals.
If, however, the nipple sags downward and becomes softened due to its size, as happens to women: then it must be split on its two upper sides with two incisions similar in shape to a crescent, each one connected to the other at their ends, until the larger line contains the smaller, in the form from line b. to line g. Then, scrape off the skin between the two edges, remove the fat, and apply what we have mentioned about suturing and powders, as necessary for healing, until it recovers.
If, however, you do not complete the incision as needed due to the patient’s restlessness or excessive blood flow: then you must fill the wound with cotton soaked in corrosive ointment, and leave it until it eats away the remaining fat.
Then care for it until it heals.
On the perforation of abscesses occurring beneath the Titillicus.
Chapter 48. These abscesses that occur beneath the Titillicus are of the hard types of Strophulas, which contain cysts, and some of them contain fluids.
Those among them that contain fluids must therefore be cut with a crescent-shaped incision, in this form, from line b. to line g. Then, when everything within the abscess is drained of infection, fill it with old cotton and leave it until the next day.
Then remove the cotton, and treat it with suitable ointment until it heals.
But if the abscess is of the type of Strophula nodes, then incise it above, as we have said in the section on Strophulas.
If, however, the wound extends so that it releases pus, then apply cautery to it, as we have discussed previously.
On the incision of an abscess that occurs because of an artery or a vein.
Chapter 49.
When an artery bursts, and the skin above it heals, an abscess often occurs there; the same also happens to a vein, where an abscess and swelling occur in it.
The signs by which it is known that an abscess and swelling are due to an artery or vein are as follows: when an abscess is caused by an artery, it is long and deep within the body; and when you press the abscess with your fingers, you feel as though it has a creaking sensation.
And that which is due to a vein is round and visible on the body.
And an incision on this type of abscess is an error, especially one located under the armpits, in the groin, on the neck, and in many areas of the body, and it is very large.
Therefore, treatment with a blade should be avoided, and anything in the extremities or on the head should also be avoided.
On any of these caused by the swelling of an artery’s opening, make a lengthwise incision in the skin.
Then open the incision with hooks, and expose the artery: and free it from its coverings until it is revealed.
Next, insert a needle beneath it, passing it through to the other side, and tie the artery with double thread in two places, as I have taught you in the extraction of the two arteries located in the temples.
Then puncture the area between the two ligatures with a small scalpel until all the blood contained within flows out, and the abscess is relieved.
Then administer a treatment that promotes pus formation, until the ligatures fall off: afterward, treat it with suitable ointments until it heals.
But if the abscess is due to the incision of a vein, then you should hold as much of the abscess and skin as possible with your hand.
Then insert a needle under the place you held with your hand and make it penetrate, and let it have a double thread until you pull it out from the other side.
Then tie the abscess tightly with the thread, as I have told you with the grape ligature, on both sides with the two ends of the thread. If you are worried that the thread might come loose, then insert another needle with another thread beneath the entire abscess near the needle’s incision; press and tie your threads in four places.
Then cut the abscess in the middle until its contents come out; then remove the excess skin, leaving the tied part.
Then place on it a small compress soaked in wine and oil.
Then apply treatment with linen and ointments until it heals.
On abscesses that occur from twisting of the nerves.
Chapter 50.
Just as abscesses occur in arteries and veins, so too they occur in nerves: caused by a blow, or from excessive labor, or similar reasons; and most commonly they appear in the armpits, or the heel, and in every place where joints move: and it is a serious abscess. Its color resembles that of the surrounding body, and it usually lacks pain; and when pressed hard, the patient feels a numbness similar to stupor.
And it is not a deep-seated abscess within the body; rather, it is beneath the skin, moves in all directions, and does not extend forward or backward.
Therefore, those found in the joints should not be attacked with a blade.
For contraction may indeed occur.
In those cases found on the head or forehead, make an incision in the skin with a small scalpel.
If it is a small abscess, then hold it with forceps and cut it off at the root.
And if it is large, then suspend it with a hook, scrape it off, then remove it, bring the wound together with sutures, and care for it until it heals.
On the incision of abscesses occurring in the abdomen.
Chapter 51. In the abdomen and elsewhere on their bodies, certain men frequently develop thelils, which are called Fungalia, due to their resemblance to mushrooms.
Their roots are thin, their heads are thick, and their edges are turned inward.
Some are small, and some become quite large.
Indeed, I have seen a man with two thelils in his abdomen, which resembled mushrooms more than anything else: there was no difference between them, they were white, with thin roots, and their edges turned inward, were split, and constantly oozed moisture.
I incised them, and found one to weigh about eighteen ounces and the other about six ounces. In the procedure for incising them, you must consider whether the patient is of moist constitution and the thelil is white, moist, with a thin root: in that case, incise it with a broad scalpel, and have the cautery ready in the fire.
For frequently much blood is expelled upon incision; therefore, act quickly if the bleeding overwhelms you, then cauterize it.
If the patient appears fearful and anxious about incision with a blade, then take a thread of well-made lead and tie it around the athelul as we described, and leave it for two days.
Then increase the tightness of the lead.
Continue tightening the lead each time it presses into the thelil, until it is severed and falls off on its own without effort.
If, however, the thelil has a thick root, then there is indeed some fear and dread in its incision, especially in the abdomen.
However, it is possible to incise half of it.
Then cauterize it to prevent its return.
Then care for it until the wound heals.
And beware of attempting to incise any thelil that is dark-colored, insensate, and foul-looking, for it is a cancerous abscess, and I shall address Cancer further after this.
On the treatment of umbilical protrusion.
Chapter 52
An umbilical protrusion can arise from various causes.
It may be due to fissures in the abdominal membrane, allowing a part of the intestines or abdominal tissue to push out, as can occur in other types of hernias.
Or it may result from blood flowing from a vein or artery, as previously mentioned.
Or it could be caused by trapped gas in that area.
If the cause is a fissure in the membrane with a protruding mass, the abscess’s color resembles that of the surrounding skin. It is soft, painless, and appears in different locations.
If the cause is the protrusion of the intestine, it will display a more pronounced difference, as previously described.
When you press it with your fingers, it recedes but then reappears and might make a sound. It becomes more pronounced in the bath or with intense activity.
If it’s due to excess moisture, it is soft and does not recede or expand when pressed with your hand.
If it’s due to blood, then the abscess appears with dark discoloration in addition to these signs.
If it’s caused by excess tissue growth, then the abscess is serious, thick, hard, and has a consistent size.
If it’s due to gas, it has a soft feel to the touch. The procedure requires assessing if the umbilical protrusion is due to an arterial or venous blood issue, or to trapped gas; in such cases, you should refrain from attempting treatment.
In such cases, fear and danger are involved, as I explained in the chapter on abscesses related to arteries and veins.
If the umbilical protrusion is due to the intestine or tissue, instruct the patient to hold their breath and stand up straight.
Then mark around the entire umbilicus with ink.
Next, instruct the patient to lie down on their back with you supporting them.
Then use a broad spatula to press around the umbilicus in the area you marked with ink.
Afterward, lift the center of the abscess upward with a large hook.
Then secure it firmly in a circular manner with a strong thread or silk cord, tying a tight knot.
Next, open the extended middle of the abscess above the tied area.
If you find that it is caught by the ligature, remove the knot, insert your index finger, and push the intestine back into the abdomen. If tissue is present, grasp it with a hook and cut off any excess.
If you encounter an artery or vein, work carefully around it.
Then continue with your procedure.
Take two needles threaded with strong thread, and insert them around the abscess in a cross pattern, making sure they penetrate.
Then, tighten the abscess in four places over the needles. If you wish, remove the needles and leave it until the stretched tissue rots and falls off naturally, or cut it off once it becomes thin and decomposed.
Then treat it with the necessary ointments until it heals.
If the umbilical protrusion is due to excess tissue or moisture, then hollow out the abscess as we have described.
And remove any blood or moisture that you find inside.
Then treat it with something that will harden and stabilize the area.
On the treatment of cancer. Chapter 53.
For I could not cure anyone of it, nor have I seen anyone before me who succeeded in doing so.
And the procedure, when it is situated as we mentioned, is to first cleanse the patient several times of black bile.
Then perform bloodletting on him if you find him obviously full.
Then prepare the patient with a preparation suitable for the operation.
Then apply hooks to the cancer that suit it.
Afterward, hollow it out from every part along with the skin, according to examination, until nothing of its roots remains: and allow the blood to flow, and do not cut it off quickly; rather, press the places and wipe away all thick blood by hand, or with any possible instrument.
But if the flow of thick blood from the incision of an artery or vein causes you trouble, then cauterize the vein until the bleeding stops.
Then treat it with the remaining remedies, until it heals.
On the treatment of dropsy.
Chapter 54.
We have already discussed the types of dropsy, and how water accumulates: the signs of each type, and its treatment with medicines.
And the type that is treated with the knife is only ascites: one does not approach the type tympanites with the knife, nor the type hyposarca at all, for that is fatal.
When you have already treated this type of dropsy, tympanites, with medicines, and your treatment has not worked, then consider.
For if the patient has already become weakened, or if there is another illness along with the dropsy, such as a cough or loose bowels, and similar issues, then beware of treating him with the knife, for there is danger in it.
But if you see that the patient is of robust strength, and there is no illness with him other than the dropsy alone, and he is neither a child nor an old man, then the method of operation is to lift the patient, standing between your hands, while an assistant behind him presses his abdomen, pushing the water down toward the lower part of the abdomen.
Then take a pointed spatula, in this form.
Let it be of two sharp parts, long, with a sharp point like a spatula.
However, let there be some gradual shortness in it, so that you do not go too far with it during the operation, and injure the intestine.
Then consider.
For if the dropsy is due to an issue with the intestines, then make the incision about three finger-breadths below the navel, in a straight line above the pubic area.
But if the dropsy is caused by a liver condition, then make your incision three finger-breadths to the left of the navel.
And if it is caused by a spleen condition, then make the incision on the right side: and it is not advisable to make the incision on the side on which the patient prefers to lie, so that discharges do not flow toward that weak area.
Then pierce the whole skin with the instrument.
Then insert it into the incision, and raise your hand with the spatula between the skin and the membrane, as though you are flaying it: and the amount to be flayed should be the size of a fingernail, or thereabouts.
Then pierce the membrane until the spatula reaches the empty space: which is the location of the water.
Then withdraw it, and insert into the hole an instrument of the following form.
And it is like a tube: made from silver, or brass, or bronze, smooth, polished: at its lower part, there is a small opening, and on its sides, three holes, two on one side and one on the other: its tip is cut like the shape of a reed, as you see, and at its upper end, there is a small ring.
For when the instrument reaches the water, it immediately flows down upon the instrument, so empty half of the water at once.
For if you empty more than is appropriate at once, the patient might die immediately from the collapse of his vital spirit, or he may suffer a fainting spell approaching death.
But empty it according to his strength, and as the condition of the patient indicates to you, based on the strength of his pulse and his well-being.
Then remove the instrument, and retain the water.
This is because it is immediately retained by the skin that seals the hole which is over the membrane, about which I have spoken, so that you pierce it in that manner.
Then repeat the use of the instrument on the following day, if you see that the patient can tolerate it, and also draw off a small amount of water. Do this for several days without fear, and guard yourself from error, until only a little water remains.
But if you fear for the patient and leave much of the water, then treat him with burial in warm sand, intense sweating in the bath and sun, and let him endure thirst; treat him with drying medicines until he is healed, and cauterize over the stomach, liver, and spleen after the water extraction, as I described previously.
On the treatment of infants who are born with unperforated urinary passages.
Chapter 55. When one of the infants is born from his mother’s womb, and the head of his penis is unperforated, or the opening is narrow, or in an improper place.
It is necessary to assist by making an opening immediately after birth with a very fine spatula, in this form.
Then place a slender lead nail in the opening and tie it in place, and leave it for three or four days.
Then, when he wishes to urinate, remove it, and let him urinate.
Then reinsert it.
And if you do not insert the lead, it is possible that the urine which flows over the area will not allow it to close.
The one whose opening is narrow is treated with lead, as we have described, for many days, until it widens.
Those in whom the opening is in an improper place are harmed.
This is because, in some of those who are born, the opening is at the end of the penis head, so he cannot urinate forward until he lifts the penis upward by hand. Nor can he procreate, because semen cannot reach the womb in a straight manner, and it is a very serious defect.
The procedure for this is to lay the patient on his back.
Then stretch the head of his penis with your left hand with a strong extension, and cut the head of the penis at the location of the glans, with a sharp point or a fine spatula: like cutting a reed, or as though you are scraping something, so that the middle forms like the head of the penis, and the hole falls properly in the middle.
And take care during your procedure to avoid the flow of blood.
For this often happens.
So counter it with whatever stops bleeding, and treat the wound until it heals.
On Albather, which occurs in the foreskin and head of the penis, and on decay, discoloration, and adhesion.
Chapter 56.
Often, these Albather occur on the penis, and it is a growth of foul flesh.
And of these, some are malignant, and others are not malignant.
Therefore, for the non-malignant one, it is necessary to suspend it with a fine hook and cut it off until you completely remove it.
Then place a piece of cloth soaked in Egyptian ointment over it. Then treat it afterward with dyafinicon ointment until it heals.
But if the Albather is malignant and of foul color, then it is necessary to apply cautery to it after its incision and scraping.
However, if the Albather is in the foreskin of a captive, not circumcised, and part of the Albather is within the foreskin and part outside: then it is necessary to remove the Albather that is inside first, so that when it heals, then you treat the outside; for if you treat it all at once, the foreskin will not be secured without being perforated.
And discoloration and decay also occur in the testicles and foreskin.
Therefore, it is necessary for you to scoop out everything that is discolored and is decaying or has already decayed.
Then rub over it afterward with honey that has been mixed with the flour of pomegranate peels and sifted ground herbs.
Then treat it with the remaining treatments until it heals.
But if bleeding occurs, then apply cautery with a lunar cautery, in this manner.
Cautery is indeed helpful for two conditions at once, namely, for bleeding and when a wound is decaying.
But if the head of the penis is corroded and completely destroyed quickly, then it is necessary to insert a lead tube into the urethra so the patient can urinate through it.
In the adhesion of the foreskin to the head of the penis, and this adhesion occurs only in someone whose foreskin is intact and who does not require circumcision, and sometimes adhesion occurs due to a wound or ulcer: it is therefore necessary to scrape it with a blunt spatula until the connection is released and the head of the penis is freed from all sides.
If it is difficult to separate them precisely, then it is necessary to scrape a bit from the head of the penis and from the foreskin.
This is because when the foreskin is thin, it may easily be perforated due to its delicacy.
Then separate the foreskin and head of the penis with a thin linen cloth that has been soaked in cold water, so they do not adhere again.
Then treat it with astringent wine until it is healed. On the cleansing of infants and the treatment of any mishap occurring to them.
Chapter 57.
Circumcision is not a breaking of continuity like other wounds; however, since it is done by our action, by our will, and its use is specifically for children, it is necessary for us to designate the best procedure in it, and the easiest way that leads to health.
I say, therefore, that the ancients did not mention circumcision in any of their books, because they do not practice it in their laws, and it is only something we have acquired through experience.
This is because I found that most craftsmen and phlebotomists use cleansing, circumcising with a razor and scissors; and they use compression, and binding with thread, and incision with a claw.
And indeed, I have tried all these methods, and I found no better cleansing than with scissors and binding with thread.
For with cleansing done by razor, the skin often escapes.
Since the skin of the foreskin has two layers, the upper skin may therefore be cut while the lower layer remains; thus, a further incision to cut the other layer is required, causing future pain.
And with the cleansing done by compression, that is, the digital clamp used by suturers, the incision of the tip of the male member is not assured, because it may possibly enter its opening.
However, in cleansing with a claw, the instrument may slip and spoil your procedure: and indeed, the skin of a boy is naturally short, and many are born such that they do not need cleansing, as I have already observed.
But the cleansing with scissors and thread binding has shown me good results: for the scissors are proportionate in their incision; therefore, the sharpness that is above is like the sharpness that is below.
Thus, when you press your hand, the two sharp edges are aligned and cut as a single action in one moment; and a similar shape of compression occurs, holding the skin of the penis from all sides, with which no error occurs at all.
And the proper procedure is to make the boy believe, especially if he is one who understands a little, that you are only tying thread around his penis; and you leave it until the next day.
Then make him happy and delighted in every way possible, given what his understanding can receive.
Then place your hand on his penis, blow on the skin, and pull it upward until the head of the penis emerges.
Then cleanse it of any dirt that has gathered on it.
Then tie the marked spot with double thread.
Afterward, tie a second ligature slightly below it. Then hold the place of the lower ligature firmly with your index finger and thumb, and cut between the two ligatures.
Then lift the skin upward quickly and expose the head of the penis.
Then let the blood flow gradually (for it is better), and apply powder on top; and over the powder, place a cloth spread with egg yolk cooked in rose water, shaken with fresh good rose oil: and leave it on until the next day, and treat it with the remaining remedies until it heals.
Now, the form of the scissors for cleansing is as follows.
The two ends should be blunt and cutting; let there be no branching pin between them, and the length of the two blades should be the same as the length of the two handles.
The error that occurs in cleansing is this: that perhaps the inner skin may entirely escape, or part of it at the incision. Therefore, it is necessary to stretch it immediately with your nail before the formation of an abscess in the area, and cut it evenly.
If you cannot hold it with your nail, then draw it out with a hook and cut it.
But if three days have passed, and what is beneath the penis remains swollen, forming an abscess: then leave it until the warm abscess settles, and scrape it gently, and cut it according to what you have prepared for yourself; and take care around the head of the penis.
For that will not harm him.
Therefore, treat it with something that heals the wound using powders, which we have described in the treatise on powders; and if the cut goes beyond the skin or extends upward, that also will not harm him.
Therefore, treat it with what we have said, until it heals.
On the extraction of urine retained in the bladder.
Chapter 58.
Retention of urine in the bladder occurs due to obstruction caused by a stone, congealed blood, pus, flesh growth, and similar conditions among those we have discussed in the methods of treatment in this section.
And if the urine is not released, and you see that its retention is due to a stone lodged in the neck of the bladder, then the patient should be bent over on their knees.
Then position his feet upon his back, and let him stretch his belly above his back, and let the patient hold his breath as much as he can.
Thus, pressure is applied on the neck of the bladder to force the stone backward, and the urine is released.
But if this method does not work, and the condition is severe for the patient, then extraction must be administered using an instrument called a syringe, the design of which is as follows. It should be made of silver, and be slender, smooth, and hollow like the quill of a bird's feather in thinness, and about one and a half palms in length, with a thin tube at its tip.
The method for releasing urine through this instrument is to take a doubled thread, tie wool or cotton securely to its end, and insert the thread’s end into the lower part of the syringe; and if there is excess wool, trim it with scissors, then insert it into the tube with firmness, like an insertion tool.
Then anoint the syringe with oil, or with butter, and egg white; and make the patient sit upon a seat, apply warm oils to the bladder and his penis, with olive oil and warm water.
Then insert the syringe into the penis gently, until it reaches the base of the penis.
Then bend it above towards the direction of the navel. Then push the syringe further in until it reaches the bladder, and the patient will feel that it has reached an empty space: this is done in this manner only because the passage it travels through has a curve.
Then gradually draw out the thread with the wool.
For the urine will follow the wool.
Then remove it, and allow the urine to flow through the urinary passage; repeat the use of the syringe, and continue doing this until the bladder is emptied and the patient finds relief. On the nature of the irrigation of the bladder with the clepsydra.
Chapter 59.
It is deaf, that is, closed.
And it has three openings, two on one side, and one on the other, as you see.
And the hollow chamber, where the plunger is, should be of a size that fits without excess, so that when it is drawn, moisture is sucked in; and when pushed, it expels to a distance, as with the clepsydra used to project naphtha, or "Greek fire," in battles of Mars.
So when you wish to project moisture into the bladder, insert the end of the clepsydra into the moisture, and draw up with the plunger; the moisture is drawn into the hollow chamber of the clepsydra. Then insert its end into the penis, as we described with the syringe.
Then push the moisture with the plunger, so that this moisture reaches the bladder immediately, and the patient feels it. The form of the slender irrigator by which the bladder is irrigated.
Then insert a strong thread into those holes, as they go around. Then join the circle, as the "alsofrat" is joined: after you place in it whatever you want from moistures, oils, and waters.
Then bind it to the instrument: and use it as you did with the bladder, by squeezing it with your hand, until the moisture reaches the bladder.
On the extraction of the stone.
Chapter 60. I have already spoken in detail of the types of stones and their treatment with medicines: and I have explained the difference between a stone formed in the kidneys and one in the bladder, and all its signs: and I have mentioned the stone upon which surgery and incision fall: it is the stone specifically formed in the bladder, and also that which is lodged in the penis: and I am narrating this with a clear explanation and in a concise manner.
I say, therefore, that a stone formed in the bladder occurs mostly in boys.
And one of its signs is that the urine flows out from the bladder, similar to water in its thinness: white sand appears in it, and the patient rubs his penis, struggles with it, and often it becomes erect. Then it rises, and the anus protrudes with it in many of them.
And healing is easy in children, up to the time when they reach fourteen years.
And it is difficult in the elderly.
In young people, it is intermediate, between the two: and for the one whose stone is larger, treatment is easier; and if it is small, it is the opposite in treatment.
Therefore, when we proceed to the treatment, it is necessary first to cleanse the patient with an enema, which will remove all the feces in his intestines: for sometimes this obstructs the detection of the stone during the examination. Then the patient should be taken by his feet, shaken, and moved downwards: so that the stone descends to the bottom of the bladder, or jumps from a high place at times.
Then make him sit, positioned between your hands, with his hands under his hips, so that the entire bladder is inclined downwards.
Then examine him, and touch him externally.
If then you feel the stone in the space, proceed immediately with the incision upon it.
But if it does not fall entirely under your touch, then you should anoint the index finger of your left hand with oil if the patient is a boy, or the middle finger if he is a grown youth: and insert it into his anus, and search for the stone, until it is under your finger: and gradually move it towards the neck of the bladder.
Then press on it with your finger, and push it outward toward the area where you wish to make the incision: instruct an assistant to press the bladder with his hand, and instruct another assistant to extend the testicles upwards with his right hand, and with his other hand to pull back the skin below the testicles in the area away from where the incision will be made.
Then introduce the cutting Spatumile, which has this shape.
And make the incision in the area between the anus and the testicles, not in the middle, but to the left side of the buttocks: and let the incision be upon the stone itself, with your finger in the anus: and make a transverse incision, so that the outer part is wide and the inner part is narrow, according to a size that allows the stone to pass through, but no larger.
For sometimes the finger, which is in the anus, compresses the stone at the incision, and it exits without difficulty.
And know that some stones have corners and edges, which makes their passage difficult for this reason.
And some stones are smooth, similar to a gland, and round: and their passage is easy.
For the one with corners and edges, enlarge the cut.
But if it does not exit this way, then you must use ingenuity on it: either press on it appropriately with a tool whose end is shaped like the moon, to grip the stone, so that it does not escape from it; or insert beneath it a slender instrument with a curved end.
But if you are still unable to reach it, then enlarge the opening a little.
But if some bleeding overwhelms you, cut it with a zegi.
But if there is more than one stone, then first push the larger one towards the mouth of the bladder.
Then cut over it.
Afterwards, push the smaller one after it: and do the same if there are more than two.
But if it is very large, it is unwise to cut over it with a large incision.
For one of two things happens to the patient: either he dies, or he suffers from a constant dribbling of urine, because the place does not heal completely.
Rather, aid its expulsion until it exits: or use ingenuity in breaking it with forceps, until you extract it piece by piece.
When you have completed your operation, then fill the wound with frankincense, aloe, and dragon’s blood: bind it, and place over it a cloth soaked in oil and wine, or in rose oil and cold water, to calm the warm swelling.
Then lay the patient back on his neck, and do not loosen the bandage until the third day.
When you loosen it, then wash the area with water and plenty of oil.
Then treat it with dyafinicon ointment and basilicon ointment until it heals.
If, however, a hot swelling occurs in the wound, along with corrosion and similar issues: such as when blood clots in the bladder and obstructs the urine: and this is recognized by the passage of blood with the urine.
Then insert your finger into the wound, and extract that blood.
For if it remains, it causes the bladder to decay and rot.
Then wash the wound with vinegar, water, and salt: and apply every kind of treatment suitable until it is healed.
And during all treatment times, you must bind the two thighs and bring them together, to keep the medicines in place over the area.
If the stone is small, lodged in the urethra, and blocks the exit of urine, then treat it with what I am telling you before you resort to incision.
Many times you can avoid incision by using this treatment, as I have already proven. And it involves taking a perforator made of iron from alfaric, in this form, with a triangular, sharp end fixed in wood.
Then take a thread and tie it around the penis below the stone so it does not return to the bladder.
Then insert the perforating iron into the penis gently, until the perforator reaches the stone itself: and slowly rotate the perforator on the stone with your hand: and try to perforate it, until you make it pass through to the other side.
Then the urine flows out immediately.
Then press your hand over what remains of the stone on the outer part of the penis.
For it breaks, exits with the urine, and the patient is healed.
But if this treatment cannot be prepared for you due to some obstruction, then tie a thread below the stone and another above it. Then cut over the stone in the penis itself, between the two ties.
Then extract it.
Afterwards, untie the binding and clean the clotted blood that has formed in the wound.
And the thread binding below the stone is only necessary to prevent it from returning to the bladder, and the upper thread binding is only necessary so that when the thread is loosened after the stone’s removal, the skin returns to its place and covers the wound: and for this, it is necessary when you tie the upper thread to lift the skin upward, so that it returns in its completion and covers the wound, as we have said.
On the extraction of the stone in women.
Chapter 61.
A stone rarely forms in women.
But if one of them develops a stone, the treatment is difficult and is hindered for several reasons.
One of these is that the woman may be a virgin. The second is that you may not find a woman willing to expose herself to a doctor if she is chaste or married.
The third is that you may not find a woman well-versed in this art, especially in manual procedures.
And the fourth is the distance from the location of the stone, which requires a deep incision, and this carries risks.
If necessity calls for it, then you should find a female doctor who is skilled, though such are rare.
If you cannot find her, then seek a chaste, skilled doctor, and bring along a midwife well-versed in women's matters, or a woman familiar with this part of the art; make her present and instruct her to follow all your directions in examining the stone. First, she should determine if the woman is a virgin: if so, she must insert her finger into the anus and search for the stone.
If she finds it, she should press it beneath her finger, and then instruct the midwife to insert her finger into the patient’s vulva and examine the stone, after placing her left hand over the bladder and applying firm pressure. If she finds the stone, she should then gradually move it from the opening of the bladder downward with all her strength, until it reaches the base of the thigh.
Then make an incision over it at the midpoint of the vulva near the base of the thigh, on whichever side it is positioned and where she feels the stone: her finger should not move from the stone, pressing under it, and the initial incision should be small.
Then she should insert the probe into that incision.
If she feels the stone, then enlarge the incision by a proportionate amount so that the stone can pass through it.
And know that there are many types of stones. Among them are small and large, smooth and rough, long, and round ones with branches.
Therefore, know its type, so that you are better informed on what to expect.
If bleeding overwhelms you, then apply powdered zegi to the area, and hold it there for an hour until the bleeding stops.
But if bleeding overcomes you and you know that the bleeding is from a severed artery, then apply powder to the area, compress it with pads of appropriate tightness, and do not change it: and leave the stone alone, do not extract it.
For the sick woman might die.
Then treat the wound.
When the intensity of the bleeding subsides after a few days, and the area has softened, then return to your operation until the stone exits.
On the incision for a watery hernia.
Chapter 62.
A watery swelling is nothing but an accumulation of moisture in the white membrane, which is under the skin of the testicle containing the egg, and it is called "sifac." And sometimes it is in its own membrane, which nature has prepared for it in part of the egg, until it ripens; this is another egg, and the skin of the testicle is between it and the white membrane we mentioned, though this is rare.
And indeed the generation of this swelling comes from a weakness that happens to the testicles, wherefore this matter is discharged to them.
And sometimes it happens from a blow to the testicles.
And this moisture has many colors. For its color is either inclined to yellowness, or it is blood-red, or it is muddy black, or it is watery white, and this is the most common.
For if it is in the white membrane we mentioned, then the swelling is round and somewhat elongated like the shape of an egg, and the testicle does not appear, because the moisture surrounds it on all sides.
And if the moisture is in its own membrane, then the swelling is round with part of the egg, and for this reason a person thinks it is another egg.
And if the moisture is between the skin of the testicles and the white membrane, then it falls under sensation.
Therefore, when you wish to know the color of the moisture, then test the color of the moisture in the swelling with a square introducer, the form of which was previously described.
Thus, according to what appears in the track of the introducer, judge concerning that which is within it.
Therefore, when we come to the cure with the knife, it is necessary that you instruct the patient to be bled if possible for him, and you observe that his body is full.
Then he should be laid on his back on a somewhat elevated surface, and place many cloths under him.
Then sit on his left side, and instruct the assistant to sit on his right side, who will stretch his member to one of the two sides of the skin of the testicles, and towards the part of the abdomen.
Then take a wide spatula and cut the skin of the testicles from the middle along the length, up to near the pubic hair; and let the incision be made in the straight line that divides the skin of the testicles, until it reaches the white membrane encompassing it; and flay it and observe, or take care lest you cut it; and let the flaying by which you strip it be from the part that is more suspended with the egg; and carefully examine with the stripping to the extent that is possible for you.
Then pierce the white membrane full of water with a wide perforation, and draw out all the water. Then separate the two lips of the incision with hooks, and stretch the white membrane upwards, and do not touch the skin enclosing the testicles; and cut the white membrane however it is possible for you to cut it, either in its entirety, or in pieces, especially its thinner side.
For if you do not examine closely, security is not achieved in its incision, lest the water returns.
However, if the egg protrudes outward from its skin at the time of your operation, then when you complete the incision of the white membrane, return it.
Then join the two lips of the skin of the testicles with a suture.
Then care for it as with other wounds, until it heals.
But if you find the egg corrupted by some blackness, then you must tie the vessels, which are the suspensory structures, fearing the flow of blood.
Then cut off the testicle with the suspensory, and extract the egg; afterwards treat it with what we have mentioned.
But if the water is accumulated in two parts, then know that there are two swellings; therefore cut the other part as you did the first one, equally.
And if it is manageable for you to make it one operation, then do it; then wipe away the blood.
And insert into the incisions wool soaked in oil or in rose oil; and on the outside, place other wool soaked in wine and oil, and spread it over both testicles and the lower abdomen; and place doubled cloths on top, which are cushions; and bind them above with a bandage, which has six according to this pattern.
Then take two cloths, and sew them, and fill them with carded wool, according to this model: and make ends with which it is pressed with cotton or wet wool; and gather them with tightness in the waistband of the trousers; and one end reaches over the anus to the back, and the second reaches to the area of the groin; and two ends over the two thighs below, and the other two ends over the two groins, and the whole tightness is gathered in the waistband of the trousers.
And, sometimes this swelling is treated artificially with cautery instead of incision with a knife: and it is done by taking a thin knife-like cautery, and cutting the skin of the testicles with it; and it is heated, as we have described: until when the white membrane containing water is exposed; then take the cautery, in this shape.
It resembles a Greek letter.
Then pierce that white membrane with it while it is heated, until all the moisture exits.
Then stretch the white membrane with hooks, and strip it with a fine heated cautery, and cut it as much as is possible for you, until you eradicate it entirely.
And be careful of the egg, so that the fire does not touch it.
And know that this operation is safer, and further from blood flow, and better than the operation with incision.
But if any resistance occurs at the time of incision, or at the time of cautery, a hot swelling, or blood flow, or something else, then it is necessary to treat what resists you with the treatment that is appropriate for it, as was previously mentioned.
But if the patient is fearful, and cannot endure this operation because of its terrifying nature, then perform the puncture as I describe it: and it is.
When it is confirmed to you by what we have said about the signs, that the swelling is watery, then it is necessary to make the patient sit on an elevated seat.
Then pierce the swelling at its lower part with a wide spatula: and make the puncture along the length of the body, and let the opening be wide, until all the water flows out.
Then place cotton on the area, and bind it, and leave it so that the remaining water flows out: then treat it, until the wound heals.
But if there is resistance to the flow of water at the time when you pierce it, and this is only because the white membrane causes resistance in the wound opening, and prevents the water from exiting, then you must insert a feather into the wound, or an instrument by which water is extracted from dropsical patients, the shape of which was previously described; or modify the wound operation slightly.
And know that the water returns, and accumulates after six months, or around that time.
When it accumulates again, then it should be pierced in the same way, and the patient will pass his days.
On the treatment of fleshy swelling.
Chapter 63.
Know that in cutting for this swelling, there is danger that leads to harm in many cases.
Therefore, it seems to me that leaving it alone is safer for it.
And I am recalling the operation for it, and the types of swelling.
I say, therefore, that many swellings occur in the bodies that make up the testicles, and it happens from many causes, namely. Either from an acute or sharp excess, which flows to the testicles.
Or from a blow.
And the color of the swelling is like the color of the body, and it is not painful: and it is a hard swelling.
And perhaps it is a stone-like swelling, whose color is dark, and it has no sensation.
And sometimes it arises from the twisting of the arteries and their swelling, as has already been mentioned, or from the swelling of the veins.
Therefore, what comes from the swelling of the arteries is recognized by the appearance of the swelling when you press it with your fingers.
And it is not necessary that you touch it at all.
But that which arises from the swelling of the veins does not disperse at all when compressed with the fingers. And now it is possible that an incision be made on this type and on the surrounding flesh: and so, you must cut the skin of the testicles.
Then, pull the testicle upwards and remove it with a white cloth; free the suspensory ligament from the vessels, tie the vessels, and cut the suspensory ligament after you have freed it from every part of the testicle.
If, therefore, the testicle is joined with those growing tissues, then it is necessary to draw out the testicle and cut it. And if there is an adhesion between any part of the membrane or between the vessels, then you must free all that adhesion and cut it with a circular incision.
But if there is a growth of flesh at the site of adhesion behind it, then you must cut all of it and remove the testicle as we have described. When your operation is complete, then fill the wound with wool soaked in rose oil and wine; then treat it with the remaining care until it heals.
On the treatment of Varicocele, which occurs with a swelling.
Chapter 64.
The swelling is an abscess enveloped in a certain layer, resembling a cluster of grapes, along with the softening of the testicles, and it makes movement, exercise, and walking difficult for the patient.
And in the treatment of this condition, there is a need for caution due to what has been previously mentioned.
But it is necessary that we describe the operation as the ancients performed it. I say, therefore, that you must make the patient sit on an elevated seat.
Then cut with a broad, sharp blade, making a transverse incision in line with the vessels until the vessels are exposed.
Then strip away from every part, as we described to you in the extraction of the arteries in the temples.
Then cut them in the middle with a straight incision along the body's length and extract the accumulated foul and corrupted fluids.
Then treat the wound with the same treatment as for other wounds where you wish to produce suppuration so that the vessels which nourish one of the testicles are severed.
For it is not harmful because of this.
But if the swelling affects all the vessels, then it is necessary to remove the testicles along with the vessels, so that the testicle is not deprived of nourishment, which would cause it to waste away, or dry up, and there would be no benefit in keeping them.
On the treatment of intestinal rupture. Chapter 65.
Therefore, the intestines descend from that rupture to one of the testicles.
And this rupture is either from the membrane or its extension.
And these two types happen for many reasons: either from a blow, a jump, a shout, lifting a heavy object, and similar causes.
And the sign, when it is from the extension of the membrane.
Is that it happens gradually over a long time, and does not happen suddenly: and it is a swelling equally towards the depth, because the membrane compresses the intestine.
And the sign of it when it is from a cut in the membrane is that it causes intense pain suddenly from its beginning: and it is a swelling, irregular, appearing close under the skin: and this is due to the exit of the intestine, and its movement to the exterior of the membrane.
And sometimes a zirbum comes out with the intestine: and this is called an intestinal rupture and zirbia: and sometimes it occurs with wind.
And sometimes feces move into the intestine and are retained there: and with this is harm to the patient, since it causes severe pain, especially when pressed.
And in the treatment of this type of illness with surgery, there is danger; therefore, it is necessary to be cautious of complications in it.
And the method of operation is that you instruct the patient to return the intestine with his hand to the interior of its cavity, if it will respond to being returned.
Then he is to be laid back on his neck between your hands, and his legs are lifted.
Then stretch the skin that follows the skin upwards, and cut the entire skin of the testicles along its length.
Then fix hooks into the two lips of the incision, as you need to open the incision with them; and let the incision be to such a size that it is possible for an egg to come out of it.
Then scrape away the membrane, and what is under the skin of the testicles, until the white membrane is revealed, hard on all sides; then insert your index finger into the area that follows the testicle, in that which is between the white membrane under the skin of the egg and the second membrane, and release with it the adhesion which is on the back part of the egg.
Then move with your right hand the skin of the testicles inward; and with this, extend the white membrane upward with your left hand: and lift the egg with the membrane toward the side of the incision: and instruct your assistant to extend the egg upward: and you release the adhesion, which is at the back, with complete separation.
And check with your fingers that there is nothing there from the intestine wrapped in the hard white membrane.
If, however, you find anything of it, then push it back towards the lower abdomen.
Then take a needle, in which there is a thick thread, made of linen from ten threads: and insert it at the base of the membrane, that is, the tunic which is under the skin of the testicles that follows the incision: then cut the ends that extend from the thread, until there are four threads.
Then arrange some of them over others in a shape like a cross: and tie the membrane, of which we spoke, that is under the skin of the testicles with a strong ligature, so that none of the vessels that nourish them can send anything to them, so that a warm swelling does not occur from there.
And again place a second ligature outside the first ligature, two fingers away from it.
And after these two ligatures, leave a portion of the membrane under the skin of the testicles, the size of a finger’s breadth, and cut the rest completely around, and remove the egg from it.
Then cut in the lower part of the skin of the testicles at the incision, from which blood and serum flow, as we described in what was previously stated.
Then apply wool soaked in oil, and place it on the wound: and apply the bandage which we described.
And sometimes the white membrane, as we said, is cauterized after its incision to prevent blood flow.
For it often happens.
And leave the bandage until it falls off on its own.
If it takes too long to fall off, then bathe it with warm water: and place on it what we said, until it falls.
Then treat the wound with the remaining treatment for wounds, until it is healed.
On a windy rupture.
Chapter 66.
In this rupture, I have not seen anyone who dared to treat it with surgery.
And the first ones indeed said that it is done as we described in the rupture that involves the scrotum.
That is, to tie the vessels below the section with ease: then cut in the middle, and finally treat it with what opens it until the vessels fall away: and treat the wound, as we said, until it is healed.
On the rupture that occurs in the groin.
Chapter 67.
When a rupture occurs in the groin, as we said, and the area swells, and nothing of the intestines descends to the testicles; and if something descends, it is little, and it returns every hour. But if time is prolonged with it, a tear is added in the membrane, until the intestines descend into the membrane.
And this happens from the extension of the membrane, which is in the groin, as we said.
That is, because the membrane is stretched: then it softens, the area swells, and it protrudes.
And its treatment is with cautery, as previously narrated.
And sometimes it is treated with surgery, in the following way: that the patient should lie on his back between your hands.
Then cut the swollen and protruding rupture site, with an incision across it the width of three fingers.
Then tie the membrane and what is under the skin, until the white membrane, which is under the skin that follows it, is revealed.
Then take a rod, and place it on the protruding area of the membrane, and press it to the depth of the abdomen.
Then sew the two protruding places over the end of the rod from the membrane, and connect one of them with the other using a suture: then withdraw the end of the rod.
And do not cut the membrane entirely, nor extend the testicle, nor anything else, as I explained to you in the treatment of intestinal ruptures. Then treat it with wound care.
So when you cut the threads, clean it, and restore the wound until it is healed.
For the membrane contracts, and the protrusion of the rupture does not increase.
And cautery is better in this location because it is closer to healing.
On the softening of the skin of the testicles.
Chapter 68.
Often the skin of the testicles becomes softened in some men, whereby the flesh between them is softened, and its appearance is disfigured.
Therefore, it is necessary for the one who is asked to treat it, to have the patient lie on his back, and to cut all the softened skin above the natural skin. Then join the two edges with suturing: and if you wish, sew the excess of the softened skin at first with three or four stitches, and secure the suture.
Then treat it with the care for other wounds, until it is healed and the threads fall out.
On Castration.
Chapter 69.
Know that castration is condemned in our law: and because of that, it would be permissible for me to not mention it in this book of mine: and mentioning it is not necessary, except for two reasons.
One of which is so that it is in the knowledge of the physician when he is asked about it: and so that he knows the treatment of one to whom it happens.
And the other reason is that we often need to castrate certain animals for our benefit through it, such as rams, goats, cats, and similar animals.
I say, therefore, that castration is done in two ways. Either by rubbing.
Or by splitting and cutting.
In that which is done by rubbing, the method of operation is: that we make the animal sit in warm water, until its testicles are softened, relaxed, and hang down: then rub them with your hand, until they are dissolved and do not appear under touch.
In castration by splitting and cutting, however, it is necessary to restrain the animal, and press the skin of its testicles with your left hand.
And this method of castration is better than the one done by rubbing: because rubbing may perhaps leave something of the testicles, which causes the animal to desire mating.
Then treat the wound until it is healed.
On the treatment of two types of hermaphroditism.
Chapter 70.
Hermaphroditism among males occurs in two forms.
One form appears as a space or in the skin of the testicles, between the two testicles, resembling the shape of a woman’s vulva, with hair present; and sometimes urine flows from the area in the skin of the testicles.
In women, there is one form where the vulva is located on the pubic area, resembling the small testicles of a male, slightly protruding outward: one part resembles a male penis, and two parts resemble two testicles.
The treatment for these three types—two forms in males and one form in females—is to cut away the excess flesh until its impression disappears.
Then, treat them with the usual wound care until healed.
For the second type in men, where urine flows from the skin of the testicles, there is no operation or treatment whatsoever.
On the excision of swelling and protruding flesh in the vulvas of women.
Chapter 71.
Swelling sometimes enlarges beyond the natural state, becoming disfigured and unsightly; in some women, it may grow to the extent that it expands like a male organ and becomes capable of sexual intercourse.
Therefore, you should hold the excessive swelling with your hand or with a hook and cut it away; however, do not go too deep with the incision, especially at the base, to avoid bleeding.
Then treat the area with regular wound care until it heals.
Overgrown flesh may grow within the opening of the uterus until it fills the space; it may even protrude outward in a tail-like manner. Because of this, some early scholars called this ailment "caudate illness."
Thus, we should excise it as we do for swelling, and treat it until it is healed.
On the treatment of Alratica, the condition of an imperforate vulva in women.
Chapter 72.
Alratica is a condition where a woman’s vulva is either imperforate or has a very small opening.
It is either congenital or acquired.
The acquired form results from a previous ailment and may occur due to excess flesh growth or a membrane that is thin or thick; it may occur deep within the womb, on its sides, at its upper part, or lower part, and it obstructs intercourse, impregnation, and childbirth, and sometimes even menstruation.
Diagnosis is made by a midwife’s examination if the obstruction is visible and close.
If it is not visible, then seek it out with your fingers or with a probe.
If the obstruction is due to a thin membrane and is close to the labia, then proceed quickly and rupture it.
This is done by placing small cushions on both labia.
Then place the index fingers of both hands together, while the woman lies on her back with her legs spread.
Then extend the two labia firmly until the thin membrane is ruptured and the obstruction is opened.
Next, take some wool, soak it in oil, and place it on the area; let the woman have intercourse daily to prevent the site from sealing again.
If the membrane is thick and dense, then you must cut it with a broad spatula shaped like a myrtle leaf.
If the obstruction is due to excess flesh growth, suspend it with hooks and cut it away, and have on hand medicines that stop bleeding without causing irritation, such as acacia, dragon’s blood, and frankincense mixed with egg white.
Then insert a broad lead tube to prevent the wound from closing too quickly, leaving it in place for a few days; apply a wick made from dry linen, then proceed with usual wound care until it heals.
Sometimes, new flesh growths arise in the womb. These must be excised as described here, provided there is no cancerous abscess; for a cancerous abscess in the womb, surgery with iron should not be performed at all.
On the treatment of hemorrhoids, athehelil, and red bothor in the vulvae of women.
Chapter 73.
Hemorrhoids are indeed the opening of the orifices of veins, until much blood flows continually from them.
When hemorrhoids persist, they become thelil; and I have already explained the types of these, and their signs; and I will say here which of them receive treatment, and which do not.
Therefore, I say that hemorrhoids that are in the orifice of the uterus and are not apparent to the senses: then they are not treated with a surgical instrument.
However, those that are in the orifice of the uterus and are perceived by touch are the ones that are treated.
Therefore, it is necessary to place the woman in a cool room.
Then stretch out the athehelil with scissors, or with a rough cloth, and cut them from their roots.
Then sprinkle over them, where the blood flows, some powders of incision that do not cause stinging: such as acacia, dragon’s blood, frankincense, and similar substances.
Then have her press her feet against the wall for one hour.
Afterwards, place her in cold water.
If the blood flow persists, then make her sit in a decoction of sumac, pomegranate rind, galls, and similar ingredients.
Then take barley flour, mix it with honey and vinegar, and make a plaster with it to place on her back.
If the bleeding stops with this, it is good; if not, apply suction cups to her back and breasts, without cutting the skin.
Then take wool, and soak it in the juice of tarathit, or the juice of plantain, or the juice of alaulat branches, that is, wild rose, with Pontic wine, and apply it to the area.
When the swelling subsides, then treat the area with ointments until it heals.
The red albarth is similar to the heads of alhaasse and has a rough appearance.
Therefore, it is necessary to cut away what appears of it, as I have explained with the thelil, and treat it until it heals.
On perforation of an ulcer occurring in the uterus.
Chapter 74.
Many types of swellings occur in the uterus, such as cancer, stone-like swellings, ulcers, adubelati, alekilati, that is, herpes, aestiomemus, fistulas, hemorrhoids, fissures, thelil, and hot swellings.
And indeed, I have already discussed all these afflictions, their types, their signs, and their treatments in the division; but it is necessary in this treatise to speak of the hot swelling that occurs in the uterus, when it is one of the swellings that collects pus, and you want to know how its opening is made with a surgical instrument.
Therefore, it is necessary for you to observe.
Then, if the pain of the swelling is sharp at its beginning, with throbbing, heat, and fever, and you see it redden, and if it is sensitive to the touch, then do not rush to perforate it; treat it with what helps bring it to maturation until the sharpness of the symptoms subsides.
Then it is necessary to make the woman sit on a seat with two benches, and have her lean back or support herself on her back, bringing her feet toward the lower part of her abdomen; her hips should be spread, her arms placed under her knees, and each tied with a suitable binding for this.
Then the midwife sits on her right side and uses the instrument that opens the orifice of the uterus.
The form of this instrument is shown in the following illustrations.
And when you wish to use this instrument, you must affix the end of the probe in the depth of the woman’s uterus, so that what enters from the instrument does not go deeper than the depth of the uterus and harm the patient.
If, however, the instrument is longer than necessary, you must place cushions over the covering of the depth of the uterus, to prevent the instrument from entering fully into the depth of the uterus; and the turning screw, which runs in the instrument, should be on the upper side, so the assistant holds the instrument and turns the screw until the depth of the uterus is opened.
When the ulcer appears, can be touched by hand, and is smooth and soft, it is necessary to cut it at its head with a broad spatula.
When the pus is thus evacuated, you must place in the wound a linen cloth soaked in rose oil or green oil with a certain astringency; place the linen cloth and draw the section into the depth of the uterus.
Then place on the outside over the uterus and pubic area clean wool soaked in water in which mallows have been boiled.
Then, after two days, treat it with an ointment suited to this purpose, until it heals.
And at times the uterus and the wound are washed, so that it is rinsed with water and honey; then with water in which lily root or long aristolochia has been boiled; then return to using the ointment.
If the wound is hidden within the uterus, then you must refrain from treating it with an instrument; rather, treat it with what we have discussed in the division.
Teachings for Midwives, on how to treat live embryos, when they emerge in an unnatural position.
Chapter 75.
It is necessary for the midwife first to know the form of natural birth.
Among the signs of this is that when you see the woman bearing down, and she desires to smell fresh air, and the pressure from labor lessens over her, and the embryo's exit hastens, then you know that this birth is according to the natural form, and its exit is head-first with the afterbirth, either attached or hanging from the umbilical cord. When you see these signs, it is then necessary to press on her abdomen so that the embryo descends quickly.
But any other birth than this is unnatural and unfavorable.
For sometimes the fetus emerges feet-first, or its body exits before its head, with one foot or hand, or one foot alone; or its head and hand emerge; or its abdomen appears; and perhaps it turns on its neck, and other such unfavorable presentations.
Therefore, it is necessary for the midwife to be wise, precise in all these matters, and cautious of error and deception; and I am showing every one of these forms and how to manage each, and it shall be explained and demonstrated.
When the fetus emerges head-first in its natural exit, and this becomes intense for the woman, and the birth becomes difficult for her, and you see her strength already weakened: then have her sit on a seat, or have other women hold her, and steam her vulva with a fenugreek decoction and moist oils.
Then let the midwife insert between her fingers a small spatula and split the afterbirth with it, cutting it with her fingernail until the moisture contained within flows out; and press the woman's abdomen until the fetus descends.
If it does not descend, then the woman must be given an enema of fenugreek mucilage with sesame oil.
Then instruct her after the enema to bear down; and make her sneeze with condiments, and hold her mouth and nose for an hour.
The fetus will then emerge immediately.
But if the two hands of the fetus emerge first, then it is necessary to gently and gradually push them back.
If it does not go back easily, then place the woman on a seat and lift her feet upwards; then shake the seat over the ground, and hold the woman so she does not fall during the shaking.
If, however, the hands do not come out and the fetus dies, then cut them off and extract the rest of the fetus; bind its hand with cloth and draw it out steadily, and it will emerge.
_When the fetus emerges feet-first_
When the fetus emerges feet-first, it is necessary to push the feet upward, then gradually turn the fetus, and then adjust its position.
Then take one of its feet and extend it gradually.
When the fetus emerges up to the hips, instruct the woman to bear down, and make her sneeze with a condiment; then the fetus will emerge, God willing.
If the fetus does not emerge with this approach, then gradually push it back until it is in the natural position.
Then it will emerge easily.
But if it is still prevented from emerging with all that we have described, then take marshmallow mucilage, sesame oil, and dissolved gum; pound everything thoroughly in a mortar, then apply it to the woman’s vulva and lower abdomen.
Next, have her sit in warm water until her lower abdomen relaxes.
When you see that her lower parts are now warmed, then prepare a suppository of myrrh and place it.
When she has held the suppository for an hour, then have her sit on a seat.
Next, make her sneeze, and gently press her mouth and nose, and apply gentle pressure on her lower abdomen.
The fetus will then emerge immediately.
_When the fetus emerges on its knees and hands_
When the fetus emerges in this way, she must carefully insert her hands gradually.
Then the woman should be laid back on her neck, with her legs hanging down, lying on the bed with her hands folded.
Then gently press on her abdomen.
Then remove what is beneath her feet from the cushions, so that she is prepared at the lower part.
If the fetus does not emerge, take its feet and shake them with firm motion.
Next, press gradually above the lower abdomen until the fetus moves upward.
Then insert her hands, gradually aligning the fetus, and instruct the woman to bear down until the fetus emerges.
_When the fetus is hanging laterally by its arms_
Carefully attempt to reposition its hand.
If this is not possible, then lift the woman and have her walk.
If she cannot walk, then lay her on the bed and shake her legs firmly.
Next, apply the liniment prepared from mucilage.
If labor seizes her, then have her sit on a seat.
Then work on repositioning its hand and align the fetus in the natural position, and make the woman sneeze, instructing her to bear down until the fetus emerges.
_When the fetus emerges head-down, with arms extended, and its face toward the mother's back_
The midwife must hold the fetus’s hand, then turn it gently and adjust it with ease.
When it is properly aligned, then apply the mixture of oil and mucilage on her vulva as we described.
Then instruct her to move gradually.
When you have done this, have her sit on a seat and instruct her to lean to her right side.
Then instruct her to bear down and make her sneeze with condiments.
_When the fetus is positioned sideways_
When the fetus descends to the mouth of the uterus in this manner with the afterbirth, then cut the afterbirth with your fingernail until the moisture is released.
If it then hangs over the face and neck of the fetus, cut it from the umbilical cord, so it does not hold it back and cause death.
Then push the fetus back inward until it is in the appropriate position, and instruct the woman to bear down several times; then it will emerge with ease.
The exit of twins, or of many fetuses.
Know that twins are often born, and sometimes three or four are born.
However, that is unusual and rarely happens.
But five is something unnatural, and they do not survive at all; even if they are multiple, they are contained in one membrane, and are separated by a membrane, distinguishing between them a ligament in each of their umbilici.
And sometimes they emerge as one fetus does, with a natural, easy exit; and they emerge with a difficult exit, as we have described. But if any of them are difficult at birth, and they come to the situation we mentioned with unnatural positions, then care for them as we have described, and let the midwife be skillful, and let her act with ease and patience, and use her ingenuity in every position with what is prepared for her, guided toward safety.
Sometimes one is formed in the womb, or two, or three, or four, or five, or six, or seven, or more, up to ten; and it has been verified by me that a woman in aborting expelled seven, and another fifteen, all fully formed.
Which was accomplished by the measurement of a glorious sage.
Therefore, all this must be in the knowledge of the midwife. For perhaps something similar to that may come to her; let her, therefore, apply to it whatever is necessary.
On the extraction of a dead fetus.
When you treat a dead fetus with what I have discussed in the section on medication, and it does not emerge, and you are forced to use manual intervention, then you must consider.
If the woman is of sound strength and does not have any conditions that would threaten her life, then the woman should be laid on her back on a bed, with her head inclined downward and her legs elevated; an assistant should hold her from both sides, or she should be bound to the bed, so that her body is not pulled during the fetus's extraction.
Then moisten the mouth of the uterus with softening oils made with the mucilage of mallow, fenugreek, and flaxseed. Then the midwife should anoint her hand with these oils and mucilages, and then insert it into the uterus gently.
Then she should look with her hand for a place where she can secure hooks into the fetus, and find suitable locations for this.
Therefore, if the fetus is positioned to descend head first, then place the hooks in its eyes, or its neck, or its mouth, or its palate, or under its chin, or its breastbone, or in locations near the ribs and under the hypochondria.
If, however, it descends feet first, then in its groin and middle ribs.
She should hold the hook with her right hand and place its curve between the fingers of her left hand; then insert it with ease and secure the hook in one of those locations mentioned, until she reaches an empty space.
Then pull with equal force, not only in a straight line, but move it in all directions, to ease its exit, as is done with a tooth during extraction.
And it is necessary that, in between these actions, the extension is softened.
If a part is held back, then the midwife should anoint some of her fingers with oil and insert them from the side, to rotate what is being held.
If a part of the fetus emerges, then shift the hooks to a higher location; do this until the entire fetus exits.
If a hand emerges before the others, and it is impossible to push it back due to its restriction, then it should be wrapped in a cloth.
Then pull it until it fully exits, and cut it either at the wrist or elbow; do likewise with the other hand and both feet.
If, however, the fetus's head is large, or it is restricted in the exit, or there is fluid accumulated in its head, then it is necessary to insert between the fingers a thorny spatumile, and split the head with it to extract the fluid, or rupture it with an instrument called an Almisdac, the form of which appears with the other instrument forms in the chapter after this one.
Similarly, if the fetus has a naturally large head, then it is necessary to cut it with the algengematu or extract it with the misdach, as we have described.
Then pull out the bones with forceps.
If the head emerges but becomes restricted at the breastbone, then it should be split until the moisture in the chest is released.
If it does not fold or permit exit, then cut the head into pieces as much as is possible for you.
If there is an abscess in the lower abdomen, or if there is dropsy in it, then it is necessary to pierce it until the fluid flows out.
If the fetus is on its feet, then its extraction is easy, and its direction toward the mouth of the uterus is smooth.
If it becomes restricted at the abdomen or chest, then it is necessary to extract it with a cloth wrapped around your hand, and split the abdomen or chest until the contents flow out.
If the other limbs have been removed and the head remains, then the midwife should insert her left hand. If the mouth of the uterus is open, then she should insert her hand deep into the uterus, search for the head with it, and draw it toward the mouth of the uterus with her fingers; then insert one hook or two into it and pull it out with them.
If the mouth of the uterus is restricted due to a warm abscess that has occurred, then it is not necessary to work on it; rather, it is necessary to apply moist, fatty substances, apply poultices, and have her sit in waters that soften and moisten.
If the fetus is on its side, then it is possible to straighten it; then apply the same treatment that we discussed for a live fetus.
If that is not possible, then it should be cut into pieces and extracted.
And it is necessary not to leave any part of the afterbirth inside at all.
When you have completed your operation, then administer what we mentioned regarding warm abscesses that occur in the uterus.
If bleeding occurs, then let her sit in astringent waters and administer the remaining treatment.
I myself have seen a woman in whose womb a fetus had died; she then became pregnant again over it, and afterward that fetus also died.
After a long time, an abscess developed in her navel, and it swelled until it opened and began to discharge pus.
I was called to treat her, and I treated her for a long time, but the wound did not heal.
So I applied to it some poultices with strong drawing power, and a bone came out of the place.
Then, after a few days, another bone emerged.
I was amazed at this, since there are no bones in the womb.
So I thought that they were bones of the dead fetus.
I therefore explored the wound and extracted many bones, the woman being in better health, and she continued to live in this condition for a long time, discharging a small amount of pus from the place.
I record this unusual case here only because it contains knowledge and assistance for what the skillful physician accomplishes by hand in treatment.
On the forms of instruments necessary for the extraction of the fetus.
Chapter 77.
Below is the form of the press, by which books are aligned, having two equal pivots at the two ends of two wooden pieces.
However, this pivot should be finer than the press and should be made either of ebony or boxwood.
The width of each piece of wood should be about two fingers, with each side margin being about one finger, and the length of each piece is a palm and a half. In the middle of the two wooden pieces are two additional parts made of the same kind of wood, already fixed to each side, with a length of half a palm and slightly more, and the width of each is about two fingers, or a little more.
These two additional parts are inserted into the mouth of the womb, to open it when you turn the two pivots.
The form of the pivot with which the womb is opened.
Another form similar to it, finer and lighter.
It should be made from ebony or boxwood, in the likeness of forceps.
However, at its end should be two additional parts, as you see above; the length of each part is about a palm, and the width of each is two fingers.
Therefore, when you wish to open the womb with it, have the woman sit on a bed with her feet hanging down and the area between her legs exposed.
Then insert the two joined additional parts into the womb, holding the instrument's end below between her thighs.
Then open your hand with the instrument, as you would with scissors, according to the amount you wish to open the mouth of the womb, until the midwife achieves what she wants.
The form of another pivot which the ancients called the form of the pusher, with which the fetus is pushed.
The form of the Almisdac with which a small head is crushed. The form of the hook with one spine.
The form of the hook with two spines.
The form of forceps with serrated teeth, with which the head of the fetus is crushed.
The form of the Spatumilis with two ends for cutting off the head.
The form of two wide Spatumilia.
All these instruments are used, and the more their types are multiplied and prepared by the craftsman, the quicker they are for the operation and more esteemed by people, due to their quantity.
Therefore, do not disregard any of these instruments; have them prepared with you.
For their necessity is undeniable.
On the extraction of the afterbirth.
Chapter 78.
When the afterbirth is retained during childbirth, then you should instruct the patient to hold her breath.
Then make her sneeze with a condiment, and press your hand over her mouth and nose.
If it comes out as a result, it is good.
If not, then take a pot and perforate a hole in the cover, and place in it herbs that open the mouth of the womb, like calamint, rue, dill, chamomile, sseha, cinnamon, and centaury; take all these herbs, or some of them, and submerge them in water, and place them on the fire.
Then place a reed tube over the hole in the cover of the pot, and place the other end in the mouth of the womb; let her hold it until the vapor reaches the cavity of the womb.
Then make her sneeze, as we have said.
For the afterbirth will come out with ease.
If it remains after this treatment and does not come out, then instruct the midwife to dip her hand in sesame oil or marshmallow mucilage. Then she should insert her hand into the vulva and search for the afterbirth with it.
When she finds it, then she should take hold of it and gently stretch it out little by little.
But if it is attached deep within the womb, she should insert her hand, as we have described, until she finds the afterbirth, and pull it out gradually in a straight line, so the womb does not fall due to forceful traction; rather, it should be moved gently to the right and left sides, then more traction may be applied as needed.
Then it yields, is freed, and escapes from its adherence.
If the mouth of the womb is constricted, as we have already described, treat her with sneezing and the medication from the pot with herbs.
If it does not come out with everything we have described, then be careful not to exhaust her with repeated extractions.
Instead, it is proper to tie what comes out at the mouth of the womb to the woman's hip.
Then administer a clyster with tetrapharmacon ointment.
For this will cause it to decay over days, dissolve, and come out.
However, when it decays, a foul odor will rise from it to her stomach and head, harming the patient.
Therefore, suitable fumigations should be administered for this.
Some of the ancients have tried fumigations with watercress and dried figs.
The form of the instrument with which a woman is fumigated for retention of the afterbirth and menstruation.
It should be made of glass similar to alcama, or from bronze; place the wide end over the fire, and the fumigation is placed on the embers; she should hold it until the fumigation is consumed, and repeat another.
On the treatment of an imperforate anus.
Chapter 79.
Many children are born with their anuses not perforated, which a delicate membrane has obstructed.
Therefore, the midwife should perforate that membrane with her finger; if not, she should perforate it with a sharp Spatumili and be careful not to touch the muscle.
Then place wool soaked in wine and oil over it.
Then treat it with ointments until it heals.
If you fear it may become obstructed, place a lead tube in the opening for many days, and remove it when the child wants to evacuate.
Sometimes obstruction of the anus also occurs due to wound healing or an abscess.
Therefore, that hardened area should be cut, then treated as we described, with healing and lead. On the treatment of fistulas occurring in the lower part.
Chapter 80.
Fistulas that occur in the lower area are knotted growths and thicknesses that appear near the outside of the anus or in the space of one of the parts, and there may be one fistula or several.
When this knotty growth becomes old, it opens, and a watery white moisture or thin pus flows from it.
And sometimes these fistulas are penetrating.
Some fistulas, when they are in a certain position, penetrate as far as the bladder and to the urethra.
Some penetrate as far as the hip joint and to the coccygeal junction.
To determine if a fistula penetrates to the anus, as opposed to a non-penetrating one, insert your index finger into the anus and a thin probe of brass or iron into the fistula when it is not twisted.
If there is a twist in it, then insert a thin lead probe into it, or a strand of horsehair, until you feel the probe or hair with your finger.
If you do not feel it at all, nor does anything exit from the opening with stool, nor gas, nor worms as I mentioned, then know that it is non-penetrating; proceed, therefore, with the treatment.
When the fistula penetrates to the bladder or the urinary tract, this is indicated by urine exiting from it, and it will resist healing with medication.
If, however, it penetrates as far as the hip joint or the hip bone, the sign is that the probe reaches there without twisting, pain is felt around the area, pus constantly discharges from it, and it does not respond to medication or heal with ointments.
For all these penetrating fistulas, there is absolutely no cure, and treatment is merely labor and futility at the hands of foolish physicians who attempt it. For a fistula that is non-penetrating and not old, healing may be hoped for with a cautery, as I describe to you, having tested it myself. The patient should lie in your arms on his back, with his legs raised above his hips, and his hips bent toward his abdomen.
Then, insert a lead or brass probe if there is twisting in the fistula, so you can determine how far the probe reaches.
If the patient feels it near the anus, then you should insert your index finger into the anus.
If you feel the probe with your finger, penetrating by itself, but sense a membrane or flesh between your finger and it, then know for certain that it is penetrating. Therefore, do not waste effort on it, as there is no cure, as we have said.
However, it has been said that, in some people, tissue may heal, and a helpful treatment would be to heat a thin cautery to fit the width of the fistula as previously described, and insert the heated cautery into the fistula until it reaches near the anus.
Then repeat this process two or three times until you know that all the added, fibrous tissues, which resemble a bird’s feather quill, have been burned.
Then treat it with wicks soaked in butter until the burned tissues are expelled, then treat it with ointments that generate and consolidate new flesh.
If it heals, that is good.
If it does not heal, then it will never heal with any other treatment.
If the probe exits but does not reach your finger in the anus, and there is a thick membrane of flesh or a membrane between the probe and your finger, and you see the fistula near the skin's surface, then cut the skin from the fistula's start, cutting alongside the probe in the fistula until the incision reaches the probe’s end, freeing it to fall.
Then clean out those fibrous tissues that resemble the hollow shaft of a bird’s feather so that nothing remains.
If blood overwhelms you and disrupts your operation to cut away these tissues, then it is better and faster to cauterize it with fire or with a sharp medicine.
For cautery with fire gathers beneficial conditions: burning away the added tissues, stopping bleeding, and drying up moisture.
Then treat it with wicks soaked in butter or mashed cabbage until the area discharges pus and the burned tissues are expelled as pus.
Then treat the wound with consolidating ointments that generate firm flesh; these are medicines with astringency and drying properties.
For once they are restored, the wound is healed, and you need not fear recurrence. If the fistula has already reached deep into the anus and extends far within the body, then insert your finger into the anus and examine with it.
If you feel the probe, and there is a membrane or flesh between you and it, and it is close to penetration, then there is no further operation except to proceed with hope and trust.
This means that one of three methods can be applied: either cauterize it, as we have said; or cut it until you reach its cavity, making it possible for you to insert wicks and administer treatment closely.
Do not proceed too far with the incision, so as not to cut the muscle that holds the anus, which could result in involuntary discharge for the patient. Then treat it with the methods we have described. Perhaps it may heal, or you may cut away this membrane and clean it after making an incision near the anus, as we described, either with a probe or with another instrument with a sharp tip.
Then clean out those fibrous tissues that are in the incision, probing as far as you are able.
Next, attempt the restoration of the entire wound by keeping the incision and upper opening where it can consolidate, leaving the fistula open in the inner part of the anus, which will ease the burden on the patient.
Sometimes, the fistula is sutured according to this method: insert a probe into the fistula, which is located along the side of the anus near the body surface with skin and edge of the anus. Then take a probe with a perforated tip, similar to an awl used for leatherworking, shaped as described here.
Then insert into it a thread wrapped from five strands, and secure it around the probe.
Then insert the probe with the thread into the fistula until it reaches its cavity.
If the fistula penetrates close to the inner edge of the anus, then extract the thread from that opening by inserting your finger into the anus and pulling out the end of the thread. Tie the two ends together, tighten them, and leave it for one or two days. As the thread cuts further into the flesh, tighten it well until the tissue between the two ends of the thread is cut through and falls away. Then treat the wound until it is consolidated and healed.
If it reaches the muscle, you must take care not to cut into it.
Then proceed as we have described until it is healed.
This is the form of the spined spatumilis used for splitting the fistula, with one end sharply curved, while the other end is blunt to avoid cutting unnecessarily, as you see.
On the suture of hemorrhoids, from which blood flows after their incision: and on the treatment of fissures.
Chapter 81.
Hemorrhoids exist in two forms.
They are either inside the anus, resembling blisters of charcoal or embers, or as if they were like grapes.
And among them are small and large ones; blood flows from them constantly, and there is one, or there are many.
And they are outside the anus, and on its edges.
However, those that are outside the anus usually have little moisture, from which yellowish fluid or a small amount of blood flows steadily, and they are the same color as the body.
And the treatment for those inside the anus is to instruct the patient to sit; then press, until the anus emerges, and the hemorrhoids appear to you.
Therefore, suspend them with hooks, or hold them with your fingernail.
Then cut them at their roots.
If the hooks do not hold them, due to their moisture and softening, then grasp them with a rough cloth or woolen fabric, and extract them with your fingers.
Then cut them, and sprinkle some warm powders on them after the incision, so they act as a substitute for cauterization.
Or cauterize them as described previously in the chapter on cauterization.
Then treat them with the remaining treatment until they heal.
If the anus does not yield to egress, then administer an enema with a mild irritant to cleanse the anus, and so that it yields to egress quickly when the patient presses.
If the hemorrhoids are outside the anus, then their treatment is light, easy: just grasp them with your fingernail or a hook and cut them.
Then treat them as described, until they heal.
And if someone shuns incision with iron, then it is necessary to perform their suture according to this method.
Take a twisted thread and insert it into a needle.
Then pull the hemorrhoid upwards, and make the needle penetrate at its root from the other side; wrap the two ends of the thread at the lower part of the needle, laying them crosswise, and tie the hemorrhoid tightly.
Then knot the thread and remove the needle.
Do this with all the hemorrhoids, but leave one unsutured so that excess blood may flow from it.
Then place a cloth soaked in rose oil or carrot oil on the anus, and instruct the patient to rest.
Then leave it alone until it falls off.
When the hemorrhoids fall off, treat them with ointments and the remaining care until they heal.
On the treatment of fissures.
They often occur due to the drying of stool and the constriction of nature.
When they become chronic and medicine has no effect, it is necessary to scrape them with the point of a Spatumila, or with your fingernail, until they become moist, and the upper crust that prevents them from healing is removed.
Then treat them until they heal properly.
If they do not heal, then repeat the scraping more vigorously than the first time until they bleed significantly and the surface is removed; then treat them until they heal.
On the treatment of inward and outward Almirmar, and of dry Athelil, and of Formica.
Then treat it; and if you wish, cauterize it as was previously discussed in its chapter.
As for dry Athelil, it is a small, rough, filtered, round prominence on the surface of the body.
And it often occurs on the hands of children.
The treatment for it is to stretch the Athelil and cut it, or to tie it with a silk thread or hair until it falls off.
And if you wish, cauterize it as mentioned before, either with fire or with sharp medicine; and now both inward and outward Athelil are eradicated with the instrument I will describe. Formica is also a small, thick, filtered prominence on the surface of the body, going very deep; and when cold reaches it, it feels like an ant's bite, appearing all over the body, especially on the hands.
The treatment for it is to take a tube from a goose feather or a strong vulture feather, and place that tube over the Formica until the tube's circle encloses it.
Then twist your hand with the tube until you cut around the Formica; insert it deep into the flesh and remove the Formica from its root. And if you wish, do this with a tube of brass or iron, in this manner.
Let the top of the tube have a raised and rounded cover so that handling and twisting it over the finger is eased.
And if you wish, cauterize the Formica as previously discussed in the cauterization of Athelil in the chapter on cautery.
On the forms of instruments used for enemas in illnesses of the anus, diarrhea, and colic.
Chapter 83.
Sometimes the enema device is made of silver, or brass, or cast or hammered bronze.
And sometimes these instruments are made small or large, depending on the patient for whom they are administered.
Therefore, that which is administered in treating small children should be small, and for those whose anus is weak or painful, so should be their enema devices.
Large enema.
Small enema.
Its tube, that is, the upper part to which the reservoir is tied, should be wide in this way, with a separation so that the reservoir can be fastened as you see, and its lower end, which is inserted into the anus, should be blunt, that is, not open, very smooth, tapering to a thin point; and on one side, it should have two holes, and on the other side, one hole.
The diameter of the holes should be about the thickness of spokes, and slightly thicker, and the reservoir in which the medicines are placed should be made from the bladder of an animal or from egg parchment, shaped like a small bag, with a base of one palm in length.
When the reservoir is placed on it, tie it tightly at the top of the enema device between the two separations.
Then administer the enema with it.
And this is the form of the reservoir's circle and the holes depicted here. The method of administering the enema with it is to fill the reservoir or bladder with medicine, warmed to the tolerance level of the patient; and be careful that it is not too hot or too cold.
Then the patient should lie on their back and raise their legs upward, and place beneath them a pad, that is, leather on which people lie, or a cloth.
Then anoint the end of the enema device with oil, egg white, fenugreek mucilage, or similar substances.
Then gently insert it into the anus.
Then the assistant should take the reservoir with both hands and squeeze it forcefully until it empties everything from the device into the intestine. Then remove the enema device, and the patient should raise their legs against the wall. If the medicine urges him to expel, he should hold it as much as he can.
And if he sleeps with it the entire night, it is most beneficial.
If you administer an enema for diarrhea, and he hurries to expel it, then repeat the enema until he is healed.
If there are hemorrhoids or painful abscesses in the anus, then use a very thin, gentle enema device, like those used for children.
And this is the form of the thin enema device with a tightly wrapped covering.
On the treatment of head wounds without fracture of the bone.
Chapter 84.
I have already spoken in the section on wound treatment which pertains to the book, and here I will describe their treatment manually and with medicines in full.
I say, therefore, that wounds vary depending on what causes them and the place where the wound occurs.
Thus, the objects that often cause wounds are things like the throw of a stone, the cut of a sword or knife, or a blow with a spear, wood, arrow, and similar objects.
Wounds that occur in different parts of the body include wounds on the head, neck, chest, abdomen, liver, and similar parts.
And I will narrate the treatments of certain wounds, to establish a rationale and rule for other wounds.
And I will begin with simple head wounds, as the mention of complex wounds will come at the beginning of the third chapter.
I say, therefore.
When a simple head wound occurs and there is no fracture of the bone, consider then if it is from the throw of a stone or something similar, and it has only broken the skin: if the wound is large and you fear a hot abscess forming, then proceed quickly and perform a cephalic phlebotomy immediately; do not delay this, and extract blood according to the patient's strength, if there is no contraindication to phlebotomy, especially if there is little blood coming from the wound.
And let the phlebotomy be done on the side opposite to the wounded area.
And the patient should avoid overeating, wine, and heavy foods.
If there is something preventing bloodletting, then reduce the food intake, and avoid meat and wine.
And if a hot abscess forms on the wound, apply a cooked compress soaked in rose oil alone or with wine containing astringency.
If you are free from concern about a hot abscess, then apply to the wound, if it is fresh with its blood and has not yet been affected by the air, a powder I will describe shortly; if the air has already altered it, then apply certain ointments until it heals.
If the wound is large or caused by a sword cut or similar, and its edges do not come together with compresses, then bring them together with sutures, as I will describe in the treatment of abdominal wounds.
If the wound is already exposed to the bone, is hanging, and only held in place by a small attachment, then cut it off.
Then treat the wound with medicines and restore hard flesh in place of the skin, and instruct the patient to eat foods with substantial nourishment, such as heads and cooked wheat, until it is like porridge, and similar foods.
If you find putrefaction in the skin and it does not adhere to the bone, then cut off all the rotten part and remove it; then treat it.
If in these wounds there is an artery or vein from which blood flows and it cannot be stopped by medicines, then locate the artery.
If you find it unsevered, then cut it with a Spatumili or tie it.
If necessity demands when what we mentioned does not work, then cauterize it until the bleeding stops.
The Method of the Healing Powder.
Take one part frankincense, two parts dragon's blood, and three parts unslaked lime; grind it all thoroughly and sieve it. Fill the wound with this powder and bind it tightly until it adheres well and coagulates with the blood.
Then bind it over with compresses and leave it undisturbed, not loosening it while it remains, so that it does not form an abscess.
For the medicine should not be removed until it is healed.
Then continue with the remaining treatment until they are healed.
On Wounds of the Neck.
Chapter 85.
If a wound occurs in the neck, there is no difference in its treatment and the treatment of a simple head wound.
But if a nerve or artery in the neck has been cut, and it is a nerve, there is no clever solution other than to avoid treating it with anything that strongly contracts, like ziniar, zegi, and similar substances.
For they harm the nerves and contract them.
And do not place anything cold at all on the wound, because the nature of the nerves is cold and connected with the brain, which is the most elevated of the organs; the treatment should be gentle, using medicines such as washed lime in sweet water, sometimes infused with oil or rose oil, and tutty washed also in sweet water, and other minerals treated in this way, along with moist ointments.
If the wound is large, then administer sutures or draw its edges together with compresses.
Then treat it until it is healed.
If the wound is deep or has formed a cavity in its lower part where pus has accumulated, then pierce it at the most depressed part.
If an artery is cut in the wound and blood flows, then separate it, cut it, and tie it; or cauterize it if necessity demands.
If the vertebrae of the throat or all of it are cut, and the respiratory passage is intact, then bring the edges of the skin together with sutures over the windpipe, do not touch the throat; instead, align it and restore it to its natural shape.
Then bind it with an appropriate bandage and leave it for several days.
Then treat it with ointments that have astringency and drying properties until it is healed.
If the wound has already made an impression on the bone, then examine it; if there are bone fragments, extract all of them or as many as you can, and leave what cannot be removed until the wound becomes purulent and the fragments separate and come out easily.
If the wound is fresh, then sprinkle over it the powder I described.
If bone is visible in the wound and a fistula forms, then treat it with the method mentioned in its own chapter.
Chapter 86.
If, therefore, air comes out of the wound when the patient breathes from it, then know that the wound is mortal.
But if it does not have depth, and it is fresh with its blood, then do not apply powder in the first hour, nor tighten it, so that blood is not retained in its depth and returns to the heart, killing the patient. Instead, put drawing ointment on it and open it twice a day.
If, however, ointment is not available, then place old cotton at the mouth of the wound to draw out the moisture, and have the patient sleep on the wound so that what collects in it flows out.
If three or more days have passed for the wound, and the patient has not had spasms, no bad heart tremor, nor difficulty in breathing, and you see that the rest of his condition is good, then know that the wound is safe.
Therefore, treat it with linen cloths and other treatments until it is healed.
If its healing is delayed and it now remains open, then know that it has become a fistula.
Therefore, treat it according to its type.
And if the wound is from a sword or knife cut and is simple on the surface of the chest or back, then treat it as previously mentioned, with sutures if it is large, or with powder if it is small.
But if it has made an impression on the bone and fragments have broken off, then examine the wound and hasten to extract those fragments if they are separate.
If they are not separate, then leave them until the wound putrefies, for extraction will be easier.
For other wounds occurring in other members, the treatment is as we have discussed.
On wounds of the belly and the emergence of the intestines and their exit.
Chapter 87.
The rupture that happens to the belly is great, moderate, or small.
From a great rupture, sometimes the intestine or a number of intestines comes out.
Therefore, their reinsertion and suturing become more forceful and difficult.
And a small rupture also becomes difficult in another way.
It follows, then, that their reinsertion becomes more difficult if you do not immediately replace them in their place, for they swell, open, and enlarge, making reentry difficult.
Because of this, a moderate rupture is better, for with it the reinsertion of the intestine is not as difficult as in these two other types.
Know that suturing of the belly is done in four ways.
Two common sutures are suitable for suturing the belly and other wounds of the body; two other sutures specifically pertain to other wounds.
However, they are more proper for the suturing of the belly; I will describe each with explanation and clarification. I say, therefore, that when the wound is small and something of the intestine comes out of it, making it difficult to replace, this is due to one of two reasons.
Either because of the small size of the rupture, as we have said, or because of swelling in the intestine due to the cold air.
When it is so, then it is necessary to warm it, by immersing a sponge or damp cloth in warm water alone.
Or boil squinant, cyperus, and spike in water, and bathe the intestine with it until the swelling subsides.
Sometimes wine with astringency achieves this, and it is better than plain water for reducing swelling.
When you see the swelling subsiding, then moisten the intestine with water in which marshmallow or mallow has been boiled.
For by this, its entry is eased with little difficulty.
If, however, its return is delayed after this treatment, then make a small incision in the rupture with the instrument used to cut hemorrhoids.
And the initial treatment is better when prepared than cutting, so that there is no compulsion to cut after necessity and lack of instrument.
Let one part of it be twisted, sharp, and the other part not sharp, and the fine end should not be as fine as a needle but rather slightly blunt, resembling the cauda, as you see.
When, therefore, the wound is widened and the intestine enters, then it is necessary that it be returned to its natural form in its proper place if possible, for that is better.
But when the rupture is large in the lower part of the belly, then the patient must lie on their back, with their legs elevated higher than their head.
And if it is in the upper part of the belly, then place his head and chest higher than his lower parts.
And similarly, if there is a rupture in one of the two sides of the belly, then always set your attention and consideration on this, that the part with the wound is higher than the other part.
And so you must handle it in this way in large wounds and in moderate wounds.
However, in small wounds, place it as it has been prepared for you.
Then make sure you have a diligent assistant present who will hold the entire rupture with his hand and bring its edges together.
Then uncover it for the one who follows with the suturing, little by little; this is the method of one common suture.
And it is to take a needle, or a number of needles, according to the size of the wound.
Then leave a space the width of a ring finger, that is, a physician’s finger, from the edge of the rupture, and place one needle by inserting the thread into the two edges of the skin, with the two edges of the tissue beneath the skin from the inside, until it penetrates from the other side, and now you have joined the two edges of the skin and the two edges of the tissue, forming four layers.
Then bind with double thread around the needle several times from both sides together, until the two edges of the wound are decently joined.
Then leave the width of a finger again, and insert another needle into them; afterward, stitch it with thread as you did with the first needle.
Do not cease doing this with the necessary needles until you complete the entire constriction of the wound.
And let the needles be of medium thickness and fineness, for very fine needles cut the flesh quickly, and thick ones are difficult to insert into the skin; therefore, they should be medium in fineness and thickness.
It should not happen that the needle is placed too close in the two edges of the skin so that the flesh is not cut quickly and the wound does not open before it consolidates; nor should it be too far apart, so that the wound is not hindered from consolidating.
Then cut off the ends of the needles, so they do not harm the patient while sleeping; and place small cloth pads around them to hold the ends of the needles, and leave them until you know that the wound is now consolidated.
And this type of suturing with needles in this way is more suitable for small wounds.
For it is sufficient to use one or two needles in the suturing of these.
The second common suture, however, is to join with suturing the four edges: two edges of the skin and two edges of the tissue at once, with a needle that has an even thread in fineness and thickness.
Then, when you have penetrated with the needle through these four edges, return the needle to the side where you began so that the thread lies across the top part of the wound, so that the suture resembles the stitch of a garment that binds fabric, and place between each suture the width of a little finger.
And men know this suture.
And with this suture, I closed a wound that had happened to a man in his belly, who had been wounded with a knife, and the rupture of the wound was larger than a palm, and about two palms of his intestine had come out from the middle intestine, and the rupture was in the middle of the belly.
I therefore returned it after his intestine had remained outside the wound for 24 hours.
The wound thus healed in a span of about 15 days; I treated him, and he was healed, and he lived many years afterward, going about his daily affairs.
And the physicians had judged that he would not recover.
And it was miraculous that I did not treat it with ointment.
For I was in a place where no ointment or any medicines were available.
Therefore, I placed old cotton over the wound twice a day and regularly washed it with honey water until it was healed.
Now I will describe two types of specific sutures according to the narrative.
And it is that you begin with a sharp suture and insert the needle from the outside to the inside.
When the needle penetrates the skin and goes into the muscle along the length and width of the whole body, leave the end of the tissue on the side where you inserted the needle and make it penetrate the other end from the inside to the outside on the opposite side of the muscle.
Then, once you have made it penetrate, make it penetrate again in the same way, in the same end of the muscle from the outside to the inside; leave the tissue end on this side, and insert the needle into the other end from the inside to the outside, making it penetrate as you pass it through the tissue at the muscle end on that side until it penetrates it fully.
Then start again from this same side and stitch it with the tissue end that is on the other side, and pull the needle out of the skin it penetrated.
Then return it to that skin and sew the tissue end on the other side with this end of the muscle, and pull it out of the skin on that side, and do this turn by turn, one after another, until you have stitched the entire external part according to that pattern.
And the essence of this suture is that it resembles the stitch of leatherworkers when they stitch hides, so that you stitch the tissue in one turn on one edge of the skin and leave it on the other side in the next turn until complete.
The second type of specific suture, which Galen described.
This instruction was narrated as stitching it in the way some physicians do, joining each part to its naturally fitting counterpart, applying each tissue end to its corresponding end and each muscle end to its opposite end.
And that is done as I am telling you.
You should insert the needle into the closest muscle end from the outside and make it penetrate inward in that area alone, leaving both tissue ends.
Then turn the needle and make it penetrate from the outside to the inside through both tissue ends on both sides.
Then turn both again, making both ends penetrate from the inside to the outside in the two other muscle ends on the opposite side.
And this method of suturing is better than the common simple suture, and it is the one previously mentioned.
This is thus also Galen’s instruction.
And some have said.
The belly suture is done with two needles.
This means inserting a single thread into both needles, beginning by inserting the needle from the side closest to you and making it penetrate to the other side, as in the suture of those who sew leather evenly.
And know that when the rupture is in the middle of the belly, then its suture is more difficult than in other parts of the belly.
And the judgment of treating the wound is the same as for other wounds.
This is because, when you reach a fresh wound with its blood, before the air alters it, and you return the intestine, sew it, and position it, then apply a healing powder over it.
But if the air has already altered the wound, then place some ointments over it, those available to you, until they produce pus, the threads fall off, and the tissue and muscle consolidate.
Then treat it as you would treat other wounds, until it is healed.
If you do not have medicines available, then immediately place old cotton over it once it starts emitting pus, and change it twice a day, as I taught you, until it heals.
But if you fear that the wound might spread to the principal members with injury, then it is necessary to soak soft wool in moderately warm oil or rose oil, and place it around the areas between the groin and under the armpits.
If he feels pain, pricks, or rotting in his intestines (for this often happens), then administer an enema with astringent, dark, warm wine, especially if the rot has already reached the intestine, and an exit wound has formed penetrating to its cavity.
And know that a wound in the large intestine heals more easily, while one in the small intestine is more difficult to heal.
The intestine called the jejunum does not heal at all from a wound that happens to it; this is because of its numerous veins, their size, the thinness of its structure, and its proximity to the nature of the nerves.
But if what emerges from the wound is the omentum, and you encounter it fresh, return it in the same manner by which you return intestines evenly.
But if time has passed and it has turned green or black, then you must tie it with thread above the area that has darkened, to prevent blood flow.
For in the omentum there are veins and arteries.
Then cut off what is beyond that ligature, and leave two ends of the thread hanging from the lower part of the wound outside it, so that the drawing and extraction of it at the point of the omentum can be eased for you, along with the discharge of pus from the wound.
¶ Recollection of a wound that happened in the intestine.
When a rupture happens in the intestine and is small, it is possible for it to be restored in some people; I saw a man who was wounded in his belly with a lance blow, and the wound was on the right side of his stomach, and the wound became chronic and formed a fistula, from which waste and air escaped.
I therefore applied treatment, though I was not confident in his healing; I did not stop attending to him until he was healed and the place was consolidated.
After I saw the place was consolidated, I feared for the patient that something bad might happen in his belly, but no bad event befell him.
And he remained in good condition, eating, drinking, engaging in intercourse, entering the bath, and exercising in his diet.
And some practitioners have said that when there is a wound in the intestine, and it is small, it should be tied in this way.
And it is to take ants with large heads.
Then bring the two edges of the wound together, and place one of these ants, which has its jaws open, over the two edges of the wound.
When it bites down and closes its jaws, cut off its head, for it adheres and does not release.
Then place another ant close to the first, and continue doing this ant after ant according to the length of the entire wound.
Then return it and sew the wound.
For those heads remain attached in the intestine until the intestine nourishes itself and heals, and no harm whatsoever comes to the patient. And it is possible to tie the intestine even with a fine thread, which is derived from an animal intestine, attached to it after it is inserted into a needle.
And it is to take the end of this thread from the intestine and thoroughly remove the flesh.
Then tie a fine linen thread wrapped around its end.
Then insert that thread into the needle and sew the intestine with it.
Then return it to the rupture. And this method of suturing with ants and intestine is only a matter of trust and hope.
Know that a wound that is large and wide, especially if it is in one of the small intestines, has no solution except attentive care, nor can it be healed at all.
On the treatment of Zuchemen and Fistulas.
Chapter 88.
Know that every wound or swelling, when it becomes chronic and aged, and turns into an ulcer, and does not heal, continually discharges pus, and is not closed: then it is universally called a fistula, wherever it is on the body, and we call it Zuchemen.
And a fistula is indeed, in truth, a knotted, filtered, hard, white formation: without pain, having the hollowness of a bird's feather: and for that reason, some call it Risati, which means feather.
And at certain times it is moist, discharging pus.
And sometimes the moisture is drained at certain times.
And sometimes this moisture is abundant, sometimes scant; it is thick, or it is thin.
And I have already explained in the section on wounds that every ulcer that does not heal, nor grows flesh within, is due to one of nine causes.
One of these causes is either the body's lack of blood, or its malignancy; or because there is hard flesh between it and above its edges, preventing the growth of flesh; or because there is much filth and foulness; or because the ulcer itself is putrid, and the substance discharged into it is of poor quality; or because the medicine is unsuitable for its healing; or because a type of pestilence has fallen upon the area; or due to a regional property, as occurs in Zaragoza, where the digestion of ailments is difficult, and the healing of swellings is delayed by nature; or because there is a bone or several bones in it.
And I have already shown all these causes and their signs, and their treatments with medicines in the section; here, I shall make you aware of the treatment of the fistula and Zuken, which is performed by surgical operation.
Know, therefore, that a fistula can occur in all parts of the body.
For among them are fistulas that reach the large veins and arteries, or nerves, or tendons; or to the intestine, or the bladder, or one of the ribs; or to one of the vertebrae of the back, or to one of the compound joints, like those of the hand and foot; and among them are those that approach the proximity of a principal organ, and similar.
Therefore, those among these fistulas in this manner are illnesses difficult to heal, and do not accept treatment; engaging with them is laborious and uncertain.
But if there is a fistula whose depth does not reach these places I have mentioned, and you hope and trust in its healing, and wish to investigate it, then take a probe of copper or iron, if the fistula extends straight, and examine it with that.
If, however, there is twisting in the fistula, then investigate it with a probe of fine lead.
For lead, with its softness, adapts and bends around the twists.
If the fistula has multiple openings, it is not possible to investigate it with a probe.
Therefore, inject from one of its openings into the others.
For the moisture with which you inject it travels toward the other openings and flows from them.
Then carefully investigate in any way possible, so that you may recognize whether there is a bone, or a nerve, and whether the fistula’s cavity is deep or shallow; or if it is a single fistula with multiple openings. Consider all of this with the utmost diligence, by questioning the patient, by detecting pain when pressing your hand upon the location, and through other signs and causes related to the swelling.
When you have confirmed all of this precisely, then proceed confidently with the treatment: if the fistula is close and visible, or in a safe location distant from a joint, nerve, artery, vein, or one of the areas I have described, then cut the fistula as I have previously explained, and remove from it any impurities or corrupted flesh, which grows at its opening from flesh or callus, and similar matter; and treat it until it heals.
If, however, the fistula is of great depth and is straight, then you must cut it as deeply as possible.
Then cleanse it thoroughly of all corrupted flesh.
Next, apply wicks wrapped in sharp medicines, and insert them into the cavity of the fistula, which you have explored with iron; repeat this several times until the sharp medicine corrodes all that remains in the cavity of the fistula from corruption.
Then restore it with ointments that generate healthy flesh until it heals.
If it does not heal through that method, then cauterize it as we have described.
If the cause of the fistula is a bone, and you are certain of this, then locate it and cut it as I have explained, unless something such as a vein, nerve, or principal organ prevents you, as we have said.
If, then, you uncover a bone, and there is some corruption or blackness in it, then scrape it until all the corruption is removed.
Then treat it with what generates flesh until it heals.
If it does not heal and continues to discharge pus as before, then know that you have not completely eradicated the corruption.
Therefore, expose it again and perform a careful scraping and cleansing with your utmost diligence.
Then restore it.
If it heals, that is good; but if not, then know that the corruption is in a deep part of the body, which you have not reached.
Therefore, you have no recourse but to leave it to nature.
But if the affected bone is small and you are able, extract it with delicate forceps suited to it.
If there are multiple bones, then carefully extract all of them, leaving none behind, using all your strength.
If any moisture obstructs you, and there is no risk or error in cutting it, then incise the moisture and flesh, if they are there, and free the bones.
If you are not prepared to remove the bones immediately, then place on the wound something that will cause it to decay, and leave it until the flesh and moisture around those bones putrefy.
And keep the wound from closing.
And tighten the incision that you made in your operation.
Indeed, if you fear, place over it a cloth soaked in powdered sulfur with oil, or a cloth soaked in Egyptian ointment, or some green ointment.
For when those moistures putrefy and the bones separate from them, their removal and extraction is eased.
If it is a single large bone, such as the shin bone, or hip bone, or similar, and a large part of it is affected, then scrape it thoroughly until all blackness and corruption are removed.
Then restore the wound.
But if the affected part is large, and the corruption has already reached the bone marrow, then it is necessary to saw it and cut it completely up to the place where the corruption has reached; then treat it until it heals. And I will tell you about a case of zuken that affected a man’s leg, so that you may use it as an example and aid in your operation.
There was a young man, about thirty years old, who experienced pain in his leg due to a cause originating within his body, that is, from internal sources, until the matter reached his leg, and a large swelling formed: and there was no external cause.
Thus, a long time passed with the errors of the physicians, until the swelling was opened, and much matter collected in it.
And his treatment was delayed until his leg developed fistulas, and many openings formed in it, all of which discharged pus and bodily moisture.
Thus, many physicians treated him for about two years, but there was no skilled practitioner, until I was called, and I saw his leg and the matter flowing abundantly from those openings; the man’s whole body had already wasted away, and his complexion was yellowish.
So I inserted a probe into one of the openings, and the probe reached the bone.
Then I examined all the openings, and found them connecting with each other from all parts of the leg. So I hastened and cut over one of those openings until I exposed part of the bone, and found it corrupted; it was already eaten away, blackened, rotten, and perforated, extending even into the marrow.
Therefore, I sawed off what I had uncovered, the corrupted part of the bone.
And I determined that there was no other corruption in the bone except that which I had cut and sawed off.
And I had already eradicated it.
Then I applied a restorative treatment to the wound with consolidating medicines for a long time.
But it did not heal.
Then I attempted to restore it.
But it was not restored.
Then I restored it with medicines, and it healed quickly and was cured; this repetition in his operation and cutting was necessary only because of the patient’s weakness, his limited tolerance, and my fear for his life, for he frequently suffered fainting spells from excessive drainage.
Thus, he was completely healed; hard flesh grew in the place of the bone, his body was restored to good condition, his strength returned, and he resumed his regular activities; walking posed no difficulty for him at all.
But if a prominent bone in a part of the body is already fractured, then you must saw it as follows: take a band, and tie it at the end of the prominent bone, instruct someone to pull it upward, and place another band made of wool, thicker than the first band. Then tie it over the flesh beneath the bone, and extend its end to draw the flesh downward; and you expose the flesh over the area you wish to saw, so that the saw does not injure the flesh.
Place a piece of wood or a board properly beneath the lower part of the bone, for when you do this, it prevents the saw from cutting the decayed flesh.
The sawing must be slightly above the corrupted area, so that no corruption remains within the hollow of the bone; and nothing should be visible to indicate the need for further sawing. But if the bone is corrupted and is not protruding, rather it continues from one part to another, and the corruption is in the middle or in a part of it, then expose all the flesh from all sides.
Then place a piece of wood beneath it.
Afterward, saw it from the first part where the corruption is, until the sawing continues to the other side; and let the sawing be slightly beyond the length of the corruption, as we have said.
But if the corruption is in a joint, cut through that corrupted joint and saw the bone where it connects to the other side.
If the corruption is in the continuation of two joints, then the only solution is to abrade it.
If the corruption is in the palm of the hand or the sole of the foot, then the matter is exceedingly difficult.
However, you must examine how the corruption appears to you.
And abrade it, and clean it by any method possible to you, and with whatever skill is appropriate for you, provided that no vein or nerve obstructs you.
And know that the cutting instruments and saws for cutting these bones are many, depending on the position of the bones, their preparation, their thickness, their fineness, their size, their smallness, their hardness, and their sparseness.
Therefore, you must prepare a suitable instrument for each type of operation.
And know that these operations reveal to you the kind of instrument you need, when you engage in prolonged study.
And knowledge of the methods of this art, through experience with various ailments, will enable you to find on your own the appropriate instrument for every affliction.
Form of the saw.
Form of another saw.
Form of yet another saw.
Form of yet another saw.
This form of the saw is depicted, let it be made properly. Let its upper arc be made, with sharpness from iron; its handle from boxwood, and let it be shaped like a pyramid, made properly.
Form of a joint scraper.
Let the head of this scraper be shaped like the head of a star-shaped nail, and its points like the points of an elischetfegi.
And it is not suitable except for rubbing the heads of joints when they are corrupted, or when the bone is large and broad.
Form of a larger scraper.
Form of a medium scraper.
Form of a broad scraper.
Form of a scraper with a hollow.
Form of another fine scraper.
Form of another scraper with a curved end.
Form of a small, fine probe scraper.
Form of the scraper with which bones are incised.
Form of a large scraper as well.
This is similar to a spoke, and the end is like a saw; it is displayed in many locations for bone scraping.
Form of the scraper suited for scraping perforated bones.
Its end is triangular, with sharp points.
It is made from Indian steel.
And similarly, all the scrapers, cutters, and saws we have mentioned should be made accordingly.
On the cutting of extremities and the sawing of bones.
Chapter 89.
Extremities decay either from an external or internal cause.
Therefore, when you have treated that corruption with medicines and the treatment does not help, and you see the corruption affecting a limb, which nothing repels, then it is necessary to cut that limb up to the point where the corruption has spread, so that the patient may escape death or a greater harm than the loss of the limb.
The sign of this condition is that the limb blackens and putrefies, as if burned by fire, or decays after turning black; and this decay continues until it is cut to the point beyond the limb, and it spreads throughout the whole body.
Therefore, hasten to cut it, especially if the cause of the corruption is from the sting of certain venomous creatures, like the sea scorpion, viper, or rutella, and the like.
If the corruption or injury is in the tip of a finger, then cut off the finger, and do not give the corruption room to spread to the rest of the hand.
And likewise, if it occurs in the hand, then cut it off from the root of the wrist, and do not allow the corruption to spread until it reaches the joint of the arm.
If it invades further, then cut the arm at the elbow at its joint. But if the corruption spreads beyond, and you see it around the elbow, then that is where the patient’s death lies.
To apply treatment beyond this is a matter of strength.
Likewise, do the same with the foot; when the corruption invades a toe, then cut it at one of the joints; and if it reaches the sole of the foot, then cut off the whole foot.
If it reaches the knee, then cut the leg at the knee joint.
But if the corruption has already spread above the knee, then there is no remedy other than to leave the patient to die.
The method of cutting or sawing a limb is to tie a band below the area you wish to cut, and another band above the place.
Let an assistant pull one band downward, and another assistant pull the upper band upward.
And you separate the flesh between the two bands with a wide spatula until all the flesh is exposed.
Then it is to be cut or sawed.
It is necessary to place linen cloth all around, so that the saw does not touch the healthy area, which could cause the patient additional injury and a hot swelling.
If there is internal bleeding during the operation, then cauterize the area quickly, or place on it some powders that stop bleeding.
Then return to your treatment until it is complete.
Then bind the wounded limb with a suitable bandage, and treat it until it heals.
And I will tell you what happened to a man’s foot, an instance of this same condition I am telling you about.
It happened that his foot became blackened, with a burning similar to that of fire; and at first the corruption affected his toe, until it affected the whole foot.
The man hastened on his own, after seeing the corruption affecting his limb with such intensity, feeling it in the pain and burning; he cut it at the joint, and he was healed.
After a long time had passed, the same corruption occurred in his index finger. He came to me, and I tried to remove the excess with medicines I applied to his hand after cleansing his body; but the excess was not repelled, and it began to spread to another finger, until the corruption began to affect the hand.
He then called me to cut off his hand, but I did not want to, hoping that I could still repel the excess; and I also feared for his life at the thought of cutting off his hand.
For the man’s strength was nearly spent.
After he lost hope in me, he returned to his own land; and I received word that he hastened and cut off his entire hand, and he was healed.
I have recounted this story only so that it may serve as a guide for cases of this kind of illness, and as an example to follow and act upon accordingly.
On the treatment of sinuses, and the nature of enemas with medicines.
Chapter 90.
When an abscess occurs in certain fleshy members, and the duration of the abscess extends until it collects pus: then it bursts or is pierced, and what is inside it comes out as pus, and a hollow space remains as if it were a vessel: and the skin that is over it is like a cloth that has already been thinned, and it does not reach the deepest corruption, nor does it press on bone, nerve, or ligament: it deserves to be called a sinus and is not called a fistula: however, if its space extends until the corruption reaches one of these parts, then it is called a fistula or zuken.
And its treatment is to cut all that skin as it is unfolded, especially when it has thinned and become like a cloth: and you are assured that it is not adhering to the place due to its corruption.
If, however, you hope that the skin will adhere, and it does not result in that final corruption in consequence, and if there is thickness from flesh in the skin, then treat it with a clyster, and consider the sinus.
Then if it is large, and the pus discharged from it has a foul odor, then cleanse it with an Egyptian medicine, which is made of vinegar, oil, and ziniar, taking equal parts, placed in a vessel, and boiled over fire until the medicine becomes red and thickens like honey.
Then take from it what you need, and dissolve it with water and honey, and cleanse the sinus with it; tighten its opening, and leave the medicine in it for about two hours.
Then extract it with pressure; do this for as many days as necessary until the sinus is cleansed, and the foul odor is removed.
And sometimes it is cleansed with ash water when this medicine is not available; take ash from vine wood or holm oak wood, and throw it over the water.
Then strain it, and cleanse with it until you are confident that the sinus is now washed.
If the patient cannot tolerate Egyptian medicine or ash water, then cleanse it with water and honey mixed with some crushed ziniar.
Or cleanse it with honey and wine mixed together, since honey has the property of cleansing and washing, and wine helps the sinus adhere, especially when the wine has an excess of astringency and dryness.
When you have done this several times, and are confident that the corruption in the sinus is now removed, then cleanse it with something that promotes flesh growth in it.
This means you should take dyafinicon plaster and dissolve it with rose oil and astringent wine; or cleanse it with certain medicines and other ointments, the properties of which I have written in the treatise on ointments.
If the opening of the sinus is narrow and does not admit the clyster tube, then enlarge it slightly with an iron tool; or place a linen strip soaked in Egyptian ointment or basilicon ointment in it, until it expands.
Similarly, if the opening is too wide, then draw its lips together with a suture, and leave enough space for the clyster to enter without any further addition.
Likewise, if the opening from which pus flows is elevated above, then cut it at a lower point so that the pus flows downward, since pus, when confined in the depth of the sinus, prevents flesh from growing in it.
If it is not possible for you to cut the sinus lower as you desire, then attempt to prepare the limb in a way that allows pus to flow from it easily according to your preparation.
Ensure that no pus at all is retained in it; and take healing medicines that are applied over the wound, appropriate for what you intend.
And spread them over a linen cloth.
And let the cloth be of such size that it covers the entire sinus.
Then cut a hole with scissors directly at the opening of the sinus, slightly larger than the sinus opening.
Then spread mild ointments over another cloth, according to the size of the hole, and place it over the area, keeping it slightly away from the sinus opening, to ease the exit of pus from it; and do not remove the large cloth except once after a few days.
But the one that is on the sinus opening is the one you remove every hour, to allow the pus that accumulates in it to flow out; and so you may know whether the discharge is copious or scant, digested or undigested.
And with this, again consider the location of the sinus, whether its owner feels pain in it or there is no pain, and whether there is an abscess in it or not.
Therefore, when your treatment progresses in this manner, and you see material emerging from the sinus opening, then know that the sinus is already adhering or is close to adherence; then, release it in the morning or on the third day, and when you uncover the wound, replace the cloth and renew the ointment. However, if thin discharge comes out from the sinus after a long interval, then do not despair of its adhesion, for its healing is approaching, since among people, there are those who are slow in generating flesh in their wounds, and others who act contrary to this.
But if undigested pus emerges from the sinus after many days, then know that the sinus is not adhering.
Therefore, if the adhesion of the sinus is delayed and its matter is prolonged, then increase the drying quality of the medicines; let physicians make the medicines moist in substance but dry in their effect, like dyafinicon ointment, when an excess of zegi is added to it.
And among the more final treatments, take dyafinicon ointment, dissolve it with rose oil, and sprinkle it with old wine in equal measure.
Then prepare it with this and use it.
And similar to this procedure, when dyafinicon ointment is not available, is honey, when you boil it until it thickens, and use it.
Or take myrrh, aloe, and frankincense; grind it all, and sprinkle it over honey while it is over the fire.
Then spread it on a cloth and bind it over the sinus; also spread it with the honey you boiled until thickened, sprinkle spices over it, place it on a cloth, and bind it.
And sometimes long aristolochia, and the roots of heavenly lily, which is a lily, and herb flour, and centaury are applied to it.
Use them simply or combined, grind them, sift them, and sprinkle them over the honey as I mentioned, and use it.
But if the matter of the sinus is prolonged and it is not healed by this treatment, then know that there is corruption in its depth, or it is already affecting the bones, or the other hard parts, or ligaments; then treat it with the cure for fistulas, as previously mentioned. On the care of panaritium, injured nail, and incision of an extra finger, and section.
Chapter 91.
Panaritium is an abscess that forms under the nail of the thumb of the hand or foot, and perhaps it occurs on other fingers.
When its condition is prolonged, and treatment is neglected, it becomes a warm abscess or decays and releases pus, until it corrodes the nail root; it may destroy it entirely, and sometimes the decay reaches the bone, producing a foul odor, and the tip of the finger becomes swollen and dark-colored.
When you are treating it as we described in the previous section, and your treatment is not effective, then you must cut away with an iron all the excess that remains of the nail.
Then cauterize the wound afterward.
For cauterization is very helpful.
If, however, the bone is sound and the nail is also healthy, and the empty extensions of the nail press the flesh inward, begin to prick it, and injure it, then you should place a thin stick under the angle of the nail that pricks the flesh and push it upward; cut away the flesh with ease, and apply burning or corrosive medicines to what remains of the flesh until all of it is removed.
Then treat it with ointments until it heals.
But if the decay has already affected the bone, then you must cut away that bone and remove it, for it will never heal as long as the corrupted bone remains.
If you see the corrosion and decay spreading into the finger, then cut it at one of the joints, as previously described.
Then treat it until it heals.
If the nail is damaged or struck, causing intense pain, then first it is necessary to perform phlebotomy on the patient.
Then cut the nail with a sharp spatula in a transverse incision from above toward the visible part.
Be careful not to let the incision reach the flesh under the nail, for you would cause intense pain for the patient and lead to the growth of extra flesh in that spot.
Then treat the area with something that soothes pain.
An extra finger, which appears in some people's hands, may be entirely fleshy, or in some cases contain bones, or may even have a nail; and some grow from the root of a joint or originate at certain joints of the finger.
One that grows at certain finger joints is immobile, while one that grows near a finger joint may be mobile.
Thus, the section of those that are fleshy is easy.
That is, to cut it at its root with a broad spatula.
However, the treatment of one that originates at the root of a joint is difficult.
Therefore, refrain from incising it.
But for one that grows on the finger near the last joint, you should first cut its flesh in a circular incision down to the bone.
Then saw the bone with one of those saws suited for it.
Then treat it until it heals.
Fusion of the fingers, which often occurs either by birth — that is, they are born with it — or by the healing of a wound, or by burning with fire, and similar causes.
It is necessary, therefore, to cut that fusion until the fingers return to their natural shape.
Then place linen strips or cloths soaked in rose oil between them, so they do not fuse again quickly, and keep them separated; or place a thin lead sheet between them until the area consolidates as needed.
Similarly, if some fingers are fused with the palm, then cut that fusion according to what is prepared and suited to the shape of the limb.
On the incision of the disease.
Chapter 92.
Veins are twisted, thick, and full of melancholic superfluities that appear in various parts of the body: and mostly, they occur in the legs, especially in those who travel, labor, and carry loads.
Therefore, it is necessary to administer an expulsion of black bile from the body with a strong expulsion at times.
Then perform a phlebotomy on the basilic vein of the patient.
Their treatment with iron is in two ways.
One of these is that they should be cut, and black blood should be extracted.
The other way is to elevate the vein and remove it entirely.
The cutting of it is in this manner.
First, soak the leg with a lot of hot water until the thick, foul blood is dissolved.
Then bind the patient's leg from the upper part of the thigh down to the lower part of the knee with a band.
Then cut the vein in one, two, or three places with a wide incision.
Then cut down to the nail until an amount of blood comes out that you see as sufficient and within the tolerance of the patient's strength.
Afterward, bind it, and instruct the patient to abstain from foods that generate black bile: and repeat the evacuation and phlebotomy when the veins are filled, and this harms the patient.
Its elevation is in this way.
Shave the patient’s leg if there are many hairs on it.
Then immerse it in a bath, or bathe it with hot water on the leg until it reddens and the veins swell, or have the patient engage in vigorous exercise if a bath is not available until the limb is heated.
Then cut the skin along the vein in a longitudinal section, either at its end near the knee or in its lower part near the heel.
Then open the skin with hooks and strip the vein on all sides until it becomes visible to touch: and upon its appearance, you see it red with a blackish tint.
When it thus goes out from the skin, you see it white as if it were a cord.
Then insert a probe beneath it, so that when it is elevated and exits the skin, suspend it with a gentle, blunt hook.
Then make another incision near that incision, three fingers apart.
Then strip the skin from the upper part of the vein until it becomes visible.
Then elevate it with probes as you did before and suspend it with another hook as you did initially.
Then cut another incision, or several incisions, if needed.
Then elevate and cut it with a final incision near the heel.
Then draw it out to the section that is above it.
And do this until you extract it from the section that is higher, or from all the incisions, until it is fully drawn out: then cut it.
But if it does not respond to extraction and elevation, then insert a needle with a strong doubled thread, tie it, and pull it out, or insert a probe beneath it, and turn your hand to every side until it comes out.
And be careful not to cut it.
For if it is cut, it becomes very difficult to elevate, and it causes harm to the patient.
When you have extracted it entirely, place wool soaked in wine and rose oil, or oil, over the wounds, and treat the patient until healed.
But if the vein is contracted, having twists and bends, and is not as we have said in a straight line, then it is necessary to cut it over each twist and bend.
Then suspend it with hooks until you elevate it entirely, and be careful near your incision on it not to cut or injure the vein, for it will become difficult for you to elevate or extract it.
Therefore, maintain your caution.
The form of the incision by which the vein is healed.
The form of the blunt hook.
It does not have the curve like other hooks, nor a sharp end, so as not to wound the vein; it is thick and smooth, for if it were slender, it would cut the vein by its thinness; indeed, let it have extra thickness, as we have said.
On the extraction of the vein of the leg. Chapter 93.
This vein forms in the legs in hot lands, like Alizegi, the land of the Arabs, and in dry, hot lands with little tenderness, that is, where no grass or trees grow.
And it may perhaps form in other places of the body besides the legs.
Its formation indeed is due to decay that occurs beneath the skin, similar to how serpents and ascarid worms occur within bodies and worms form between the skin and flesh.
The sign of the beginning of this vein’s formation is that a violent inflammation occurs in the leg.
Then the area becomes blistered.
Then the vein begins to emerge from the site of that blistering, as if it were the root of a plant or an animal.
When its end appears, you must wrap around it a piece of lead weighing from one to two drachmas, and knot it, letting the lead hang from the leg.
Thus, whenever something from it comes outward, wrap it in lead and knot it.
If it becomes too long, then cut part of it and wrap the remainder.
And do not cut it at the root before it is entirely extracted.
For if you cut it, it contracts and goes into the flesh, causing an abscess, decay in the area, and a bad ulcer.
Therefore, it must be handled gently and extracted gradually until its very end is reached, leaving nothing of it in the body; in some people, this vein emerges with a length of five and ten palms.
It has even been reported to me that it came out twenty palms long in one man.
If it is cut during your treatment, then insert a probe into its hole, pierce it with a long opening, along with the body, until all the matter within is evacuated, and treat the decay in the area with medicines for a few days. Then treat it as you would for abscesses.
This vein sometimes has many branches, especially when it appears at the joint of the foot or in the foot itself, and it has many openings, with a branch emerging from each opening.
Therefore, treat it as we have described in the section, and with what has been previously stated.
On the incision for worms generated under the skin, called the "Bovine Disease."
Chapter 94.
This disease is called the "Bovine Disease" in a certain land among us, because it often occurs in cattle, and it is a small worm that forms between the skin and flesh.
And it moves throughout the whole body, ascending and descending, and becomes perceptible as it moves from one limb to another, until it eventually breaks through the skin and emerges wherever it ruptures.
Its formation is due to the decay of certain humors.
Just as worms and serpents, that is, roundworms and ascarids, occur in the belly.
It is feared for its malignancy.
For when it moves through the body and rises to the head, and reaches a place, it may rupture there, emerge, and destroy the eye; this happens frequently.
Therefore, when you wish to treat and remove it, this can only be done when it is moving and visible to the senses.
You must therefore bind tightly above and below it with a constricting band.
Then make an incision over it and extract it.
But if it is deep in the flesh and cannot be found, then apply a cautery with fire over the area until it dies.
The greatest fear is its corruption, by which it destroys the eye, as we have mentioned. If you see it has already reached the head near the eye, then bind tightly beneath it with a strong constriction on the eyebrow.
Then make an incision over it and extract it.
The patient must cleanse their body with medicines that dissolve foul, putrid humors.
And they should avoid foods that cause decay.
On the incision for the disease Nakir.
Chapter 95.
This disease is called Nakir in our land, and it is a pain that occurs in certain limbs, then shifts from one limb to another.
And I have indeed seen it, as I will tell you.
I was called to an ailing woman in a certain village.
She uncovered her arm, and I saw a small swelling in the vein of the arm cord.
After remaining there for an hour, I saw a swelling moving along like a worm, ascending to her shoulder faster than can be believed, like quicksilver running from one place to another.
The pain then left that area and became fixed in the shoulder.
Then, after sitting for another hour, it ran into the rest of the body, until it reached the other arm.
Then she told me that it moved throughout her whole body, as I had seen.
I was amazed at the speed of its movement from one limb to another.
I had not seen this illness with my own eyes in such a manner before.
However, I have seen many who experience pain moving from limb to limb, though I had not seen it with my eyes as I did in this woman.
And I do not think this is the case unless it is because the woman was from those villages of people with dry bodies and exposed veins; thus, this shifting windiness appears to the senses.
And it is necessary that this does not appear in those who are indulgent, with moist bodies and hidden veins.
Therefore, when you wish to treat it and the patient feels the pain, if it is visible to you, as we have said, then bind tightly above and below it quickly; make an incision over it until the confined windiness exits, and cauterize the area.
But if it is not visible to your eyes, then treat it with body evacuation, and with what expels windiness, and soothes it with foul-smelling pills and pills of serapinum, and the like.
On the extraction of arrows.
Chapter 96. Arrows vary according to their types and according to the places in the body where they lodge.
Their diversity is as follows: for among them are those that have large and small points, and those that are concave and deaf.
And among them are those that have three edges.
And among them are those with tongues.
And among them are those with stars.
Those that lodge in certain parts of the body fall into two categories.
Either they are in the principal hollow organs, such as the brain, heart, liver, lungs, kidneys, intestines, bladder, and similar parts.
Therefore, when it lodges in any of these parts, and signs of death appear to you, which I will tell you later, you must avoid extracting that arrow from them, for death follows in most cases.
And when these evil signs do not appear to you, and the arrow is not hidden in the depth of the part, then extract it and treat the wound.
Among the signs of the brain when an arrow lodges there, and it penetrates the bone, and the membrane over the brain emerges, are these: sudden seizures, dizziness, vertigo, redness in the eyes, swelling, redness of the tongue, spasms, mental confusion, and vomiting of bile.
And sometimes blood comes out from the nose or ears.
And sometimes speech is cut off, and the voice is destroyed.
And a white moisture similar to porridge comes out of the wound site.
And something similar to the watery discharge of flesh exits from it.
If these signs appear to you, then refrain from treatment, and extract the arrow if it does not come out.
The signs of an arrow when it lodges in the heart are that it is near the left nipple, and it feels as if it is fixed in a hard object, not in an empty one.
And sometimes the movement of the arrow resembles the beat of a pulse, and black blood flows from the wound.
And coldness of the extremities follows, along with cold sweat and fainting.
Know, therefore, that death approaches without a doubt.
The sign of an arrow wounding the lung is foamy blood coming from the wound, and the vessels following the neck become inflamed, and the patient's color changes.
And he breathes a deep, high breath, and seeks the attraction of cold air.
But if the arrow lodges in the membrane in the chest, then it is near the small ribs, and there is great shortness of breath with intense pain, with sighing, and all the muscles of the shoulders move.
And if the arrow lodges in the stomach, then perhaps something undigested exits from the wound.
And if the arrow lodges in the abdomen and sticks there, something of feces exits from the wound, or bile, or intestine that is already ruptured.
Therefore, there is no hope in curing it, nor in extracting the arrow.
But if the arrow lodges in the bladder and urine comes out, and something proceeds from it to the outside, and the pain is stronger over the afflicted, then know that it is fatal.
However, the remaining parts, such as the face, neck, throat, shoulder, auxiliary part, spinal vertebrae, clavicle, hip, leg, and similar parts of the body are preserved in most cases, as long as the arrow does not hit an artery or nerve and is not poisonous.
And I tell you what I have observed concerning these arrows, so that you may apply it in your practice.
For instance, an arrow fell into a man’s tear duct at the root of his nose.
I therefore extracted it for him from the other side, under the fat of his ear, and he was healed, and no harm occurred to his eye.
And I extracted another arrow for a Jew, which had lodged in the fat of his eye beneath the lower eyelid, and the arrow was already hidden, and I only managed to reach a small part of it, where it was fixed in its wooden shaft, and it was a large arrow from the Turkish bows, with a smooth iron head, without barbs.
Thus the Jew was healed, and no bad incident occurred to his eye. And I extracted another arrow from the throat of a Christian.
And it was an Arabic arrow, one that has barbs.
I therefore made an incision over it between the two guidegi, for it was already embedded in his throat.
So I proceeded delicately with it until I extracted it, and the Christian was healed.
And I extracted another arrow from a man, which had fallen into his abdomen, and we thought he would die from it.
But after thirty days had passed, and nothing in his condition had changed, I made an incision over the arrow, maneuvered skillfully, extracted it, and he was healed, with no bad incident occurring.
And I saw a man into whose back an arrow had fallen, and the wound had healed over it.
Then, seven years later, the arrow emerged at the base of his hip.
And I saw a woman into whose abdomen an arrow had fallen, and the wound healed over it, and the arrow remained inside her, yet none of her bodily functions were affected, and she experienced no harm in any of her natural operations.
And I saw another man into whose face an arrow had fallen; the wound healed, and it remained without causing him much pain, and many other similar cases.
And I extracted an arrow from a man among the King’s nobles, which had fallen into the middle of his nose and had shifted slightly to the right; the entire arrow was concealed.
Thus I was called to treat him three days after the arrow had fallen.
I found the arrow wound very tight.
I therefore probed it with a thin probe, and did not feel it, but he did feel a prick and pain under his right ear.
I then suspected that this prick was from the arrow’s tip.
So I applied a plaster to the area with attracting and digesting properties, confident that the area would become inflamed, and the sign of the arrow would appear for me to cut over it; yet no indication showed that the arrow had reached that spot.
So I continued applying the plaster over him for many days; no incident occurred, and the wound healed in the meantime, and he remained untroubled by the extraction for a period of days until one day he felt the arrow inside his nose.
And he told me about it.
I then applied a sharp, corrosive medicine over the wound for many days until it opened, and I probed it and felt the thin tip of the arrow where it adhered to the wood.
Then I continued to open the wound with that sharp medicine until the tip of the arrow became visible to us, and approximately four months passed with him.
Then, after the wound had widened enough, and it was possible for me to insert forceps into it and move it, though it did not yield to extraction, I did not stop refining and devising methods over it until one day I started on it with forceps properly made, as their form will appear at the end of the chapter, until I extracted it.
Then I restored the wound.
And indeed, doctors judge that the cartilage of the nose cannot be restored.
Nevertheless, I restored it, and the wound healed, and the patient recovered fully, with no harm done to him at all.
And I tell you the manner of extracting certain arrows so that you may use it as a rule and guide over what I have not described.
For the parts of this art and their distinctions are not fully conveyed in narration, nor does a book cover it all, and a skilled craftsman compares the small over the large, and what is present over what is absent, and finds a new procedure and new instrument in the context of extraordinary occurrences in this art when they happen.
Therefore, I say that arrows do not exit from the parts in which they are fixed except in two ways. Either by drawing it out from the place where it entered.
Or through the opposite side.
And the one that exits from where it entered, or is an arrow lodged in a fleshy area, can be drawn out and extracted.
But if it does not yield to exit at the time it falls, then you should leave it for a few days, until the flesh around it begins to decompose, and the extraction and removal become easier.
Similarly, if it is lodged in the bone and does not yield to you for removal, then leave it also for a few days, and try again each day with traction and movement until it exits.
But if it still does not yield to exit after days, then you must drill around the arrow in the bone from all sides with a fine drill, until the area for the arrow is widened.
Then pull it and extract it.
If, however, the arrow is fixed in the bone of the head and has already entered one of the brain’s ventricles, and some of the symptoms I mentioned appear in the patient, then refrain from pulling the arrow and leave it, until the condition stabilizes after some days.
For if the arrow reaches the membrane (sifach), then death is not delayed for him.
But if the arrow is only fixed in the bone itself, and does not penetrate to the membrane, and the patient remains stable for some days without any of those symptoms occurring, then proceed with ingenuity in pulling and extracting the arrow.
If it is firmly fixed and does not yield to traction, then use drills around the arrow as I told you, and then treat the area until it heals.
If the arrow is already hidden in a part of the body and is concealed and out of reach, then locate it with a probe.
If you feel it, then pull it with certain instruments suitable for its extraction.
If you cannot reach it because of the tightness of the wound and the depth of the arrow, and if there is no bone, nerve, or vein there, then make an incision over it, widening the wound until it becomes possible to extract the arrow.
If it has barbs to hold it, then free the flesh lodged in them on all sides with every skill you can manage, and proceed carefully if the flesh cannot yield to the breaking of the barbs or their twisting, until it is freed.
And when you are performing the extraction of an arrow, wherever it is, use the twisting of your hand with forceps in all directions until you make it emerge, handling it with the utmost delicacy so that the arrow does not break, making its extraction more difficult for you.
If you cannot manage it in one attempt, then leave it for several days, until the surrounding tissues begin to decay.
Then try again, as it will be easier. If, however, bleeding hinders you, then administer the treatment I mentioned in its chapter, and take care to avoid cutting any vein, nerve, or tendon.
And use every skill you can in freeing the arrow, with ease, calm, or slowness, and firmness, as I have told you.
And it is necessary that when you pull the arrow, the patient is positioned as he was at the moment the arrow struck him.
For it is more beneficial.
But if that is not possible, then use whatever positions are available to you.
Now, for an arrow that exits through the opposite side, either part of it is already protruding externally, or its tip creates a bulge felt under the nearby surface of the skin, and you see it protruding; make an incision over it large enough to accommodate the forceps.
Then pull it, for it will be easy to remove.
But if it is retained in the bone, then twist your hand in a circular motion until the arrow is set in the bone and enlarges itself: then pull it out.
And if not: leave it for a few days, then try again until it comes out.
But if the shaft of the arrow is within it, then push it with it.
But if the shaft has fallen, and you wish to apply pressure, then insert into it a hollow instrument so that its concavity enters the tail of the arrow: then push it with it.
But if the arrow is hollow, then push it with an instrument that enters it.
For the arrow is eased by that.
But if the arrow is poisoned, then it is necessary to hollow out all the flesh in which the poison is, if that is possible for you.
Then treat it with what is suitable for it.
But if the arrow has fallen into the chest, or in the belly, or in the bladder, or in the side, and it is near enough that you can touch it with the probe, and it is possible for you to cut above it: then cut, and beware of cutting a vein or nerve, and extract it.
Then suture the wound if you see fit, and treat it until it heals.
And this is the form of the forceps by which arrows are extracted.
Let the tips be like a bird’s beak, which are made like iron: when they grip the arrow, they do not let go.
And many types are made from them, large, small, and medium, according to the size of the arrow and its slenderness, the breadth of the wound, and its narrowness.
The shape of the hollow pusher.
And the shape of the blunt pusher.
This is of a blunt end like a spoke, so that its entry into the hollow arrow is eased and it is pushed with it.
The tip of this hollow pusher is hollow like a bird's feather, so that the entry of the arrow into it is eased, as is its pushing.
On the bloodletting of veins.
Chapter 97. The veins to be bloodlet, which are customary in the body, are thirty.
Of these, sixteen are in the head: two pulsating veins behind the ears, called the two "Herbs"; two arteries visible in the temples; two veins in the tear ducts of the two eyes, called "Lookers"; a vein situated in the middle of the forehead; and a vein at the tip of the nose.
And two "Guidegi" veins in the neck.
And two veins on the upper lip of the mouth.
And two veins on the lower lip.
And these are the veins called "Algecherich."
And two veins under the tongue.
However, in the arms, there are five veins in each arm to be bloodlet.
One of them is the Cephalic, located on the outer side; the common people call it the "head vein."
And the Dark vein.
And there is the Middle vein, formed from a branch of the Basilic and a branch of the Cephalic; the common people call it the "body vein."
And the Basilic, positioned on the inner side, also called "Titillicaris."
And the common people call it the "belly vein."
And the Cord of the arm, positioned above the elbow joint; this is the one bloodlet, visible above the thumb with clear appearance.
And the Salvatic vein, located between the ring finger and the little finger, with two branches.
In the leg and foot, there are three veins.
One of these is located under the arch of the big toe on the outer side.
The second is the Saphenous, located near the heel on the inner side.
And the Nesse vein, located near the heel on the outer side.
And in the other leg, there are three veins similar to these.
On the bloodletting of the two veins behind the ears.
Bloodletting of the two veins behind the ears is beneficial for chronic catarrh, migraines, "sahafati," and old sores of the head.
And the method of bloodletting it is as I will describe.
The patient’s head is to be shaved, and the occiput is rubbed at the location of the two veins with a rough cloth, rubbing well.
Then the patient should tightly bind his neck with a band until the two veins appear.
Their locations are behind the ears in two sunken spots of the head.
Therefore, locate them with your finger, and where you feel their pulse under your finger, mark the spot with ink.
Then take the lancet knife, called the "Incisor."
Then insert it under the vein in the skin until the lancet reaches the bone.
Then lift your hand with the vein and skin upwards, and cut the vein along with the skin with a cutting incision.
The length of the incision should be about the width of two joined fingers, or around that; let as much blood flow as you desire.
Then compress it with pads, and leave it until it heals.
And their incision and cauterization were already covered at the beginning of the book.
On the bloodletting of the two arteries in the temples.
Bloodletting of the two arteries in the temples is beneficial for chronic migraines, a persistent throbbing, continuous eye pain, and the flow of excessive discharges to the eyes. And the method of bloodletting them is as I will describe to you.
The patient should tightly bind his neck until the two veins become clearly visible to the touch, and their pulse is felt under your finger.
Then mark them with ink.
Then lift the skin above the vein upward with your index finger, insert the cutting lancet underneath, and raise the vein upwards.
And cut it as you did with the other two veins, allowing the blood to flow according to your need. Then release the patient’s binding and press your finger over the vein for an hour.
Afterward, place a dressing and pads on it, and bind it tightly from above; leave it until it heals.
And their mention, incision, and extraction were already covered at the beginning of the book.
On the bloodletting of the frontal vein after the bloodletting of the Cephalic.
The benefit of bloodletting the frontal vein after the bloodletting of the Cephalic is for old ailments of the face, for migraines, redness, and foul ulcers.
And the method of its bloodletting is as I will tell you.
The patient should tightly bind his neck with a band until the vein appears.
Then take the instrument called the "Digger."
Whose shape is as follows.
Place the pointed tip that is on the head of the Digger over the vein, and strike it with a comb or something similar, and let the blood flow according to the quantity you desire.
Then release the perforation of the patient, and press it until it heals.
Sometimes it is opened with a broad lancet.
However, it is not necessary for the lancet to have a sharp end like other lancets; rather, it should have a broad end.
And bloodlet it across, since the bone is close, and perhaps the lancet might break in it if it is fine.
On the bloodletting of the veins in the two tear ducts.
The benefit of the two veins in the two tear ducts of the eyes is for the eye suffering from scabies and redness, and "sebel" in the eye, and ailments of the face.
The method of their bloodletting is for the patient to tightly bind his neck with a band.
Then bloodlet them while you stand above his head.
And the bloodletting should be done horizontally in a short length, with a small lancet, somewhat broad, as there is no flesh in that place.
If the lancet has a fine end, it may break.
Then let as much blood flow as you need.
And place a dressing on them, bind them for one night, then release them.
On the bloodletting of the nasal veins.
The bloodletting of the nasal veins is helpful for acute fever, severe throbbing, and ailments of the face, like migraines and redness that appears in the face, especially when it is old.
The method of its bloodletting is for the patient to tightly bind his neck.
Then hold his nose with your left hand, take a fine, long lancet, and fix it in the middle of the cartilage, between what divides the nose straight down.
For the vein is not felt there, and because the blood begins to flow immediately.
And it is necessary to hold your hand with the lancet for a short time, and let the blood flow according to your need.
Then bind it for one night.
For it heals quickly.
On the bloodletting of the Guidegi veins.
The benefit of bloodletting the two Guidegi veins is for constriction of breath, the onset of leprosy, melancholic ailments, impetigo, foul ulcers, and corrosive conditions, that is, scaly herpes.
The method of their bloodletting is for the patient to bind under both in his neck with a strap, and for the practitioner to stand above the patient’s head while the patient sits on a seat.
Then bloodlet the vein in a somewhat large length.
Then extract a moderate amount of blood, or according to what you see is needed.
Then do likewise with the other vein.
Afterward, release the binding and press the two veins with moderate pressure so that the patient is not suffocated.
And leave it until morning.
For the wound heals.
On the bloodletting of the Algeberich veins.
The benefit of bloodletting the Algeberich veins is that it helps with the ulcerations in the mouth, the corruption of the gums, foul ulcers, cracks in the lips, and even foul ulcers in and around the nose.
The method of bloodletting them is to have the patient sit before you and to bind his neck with a band.
Then turn his lip, and look at the two veins, one on the right side of the lip and the other on the left, both identified by their dark color.
And that is true, as around them are tiny, dark veins.
Then make an incision in each one. But if you are in doubt and do not know which one, then focus on the incision of the larger and more visible one.
Similarly, do the same with the two veins in the upper lip; this is often customary, and incise the two veins in the lower lip.
On the bloodletting of the vein under the tongue after the Cephalic bloodletting.
The benefit of bloodletting the two veins under the tongue is that the Cephalic bloodletting helps with obstructions in the throat, ailments of the uvula, and diseases of the mouth.
The method of bloodletting them is to have the patient sit between your hands facing the sun, lift his tongue, and look under the tongue for a vein on each side, both with a darkish color.
Therefore, bloodlet each one, and take care not to press your hand too much in bloodletting them.
For beneath them are arteries, and there may be a blood flow from those arteries.
On the three veins in the elbow.
The three veins in the elbow that are bloodlet are commonly treated in all people.
Their bloodletting is done in two ways.
Either by pricking with a broad myrtle-shaped lancet, or an olive-shaped one with a fine edge, or by cutting with a knife-shaped lancet, called "Alnesil."
And this is its shape.
Thus, the Alnesil is suitable for incisions.
And among them are types that are broad and fine, according to the width of the veins and their narrowness. The shape of the myrtle-shaped lancet should be broad, as you see.
And it is suitable for opening hollow, full, projecting, visible, thick veins that contain thick, turbid blood.
And this lancet is of lesser width and a finer tip.
And it is suitable for the bloodletting of fine veins that contain thin, yellowish blood.
On the bloodletting of the Basilica vein.
The bloodletting of the Basilica vein, which is one of these three veins, is beneficial. It draws blood from ailments that are below the throat and neck, following down to the chest and abdomen. The bloodletter must be cautious when bloodletting it, as there is an artery beneath it.
If an error is made, and too much force is applied in the lancet puncture, it will cut that artery, resulting in a blood flow.
Therefore, it is necessary not to use a puncturing lancet but rather to cut with the Alnesil.
If the Basilica is not clearly visible, then it is necessary to change to another vein or seek one of its branches, or instead bloodlet the Cord of the arm.
The Cord of the arm is clearly visible, so cut it with the Alnesil, as we mentioned.
If you wish to bloodlet the Basilica itself, you should press the arm beforehand to feel for the pulse location.
Then mark the spot with ink, bind the arm, and cut the vein with a concave incision using the Alnesil, as we described.
Be cautious not to let the cut fall near the artery.
And if you see an inflation at the marked spot when you bind it, that inflation is from the artery; therefore, avoid it.
If you see the blood spurting at the bloodletting site like a child’s urine, and it is thin, red blood, then know that it is from the artery.
Then act quickly and place your finger on it for a long moment, then remove your finger.
If the blood flow stops (for it often stops), then bind the arm, and let it be, advising the patient to refrain from moving it and to be cautious.
And he should not move it for a few days until it heals.
But if the blood does not stop and overwhelms you, and no remedy is at hand, then cut the artery if you can see it.
For its ends will contract, stopping the blood.
Or take the bark of a pistachio tree, split it, take one half, and bind it over the vein with appropriate pressure using a band and pads until the next day.
Then if the blood stops, it is good.
And if not, then treat it with what has previously been mentioned from the location of the powders that stop blood flow; stopping its blood is not difficult in most cases due to the small wound and the possibility of binding from the arm.
On the bloodletting of the Fusca vein.
The bloodletting of the Fusca vein is beneficial as it draws blood from the upper part of the head and the lower part of the body, due to its composition from a branch of the Basilica and a branch of the Cephalic, as we mentioned.
The bloodletter should exercise caution in bloodletting it, as there is a nerve beneath it.
If too much force is applied in the lancet puncture and the nerve is struck, numbness will occur, and healing will be difficult, perhaps even incomplete.
This nerve is often felt.
If it is hidden in some people and is fine and not visible, then it is necessary to position your bloodletting with the Alnesil and avoid the nerve with caution.
If the vein lies between two nerves, then split the vein lengthwise.
On the Cephalic vein.
The bloodletting of the Cephalic vein is beneficial as it draws blood from the head and helps with ailments of the eyes.
And it is appropriate with this vein, if you wish, to bloodlet it by pricking with an olive-shaped or myrtle-shaped lancet, as it is the safest of all veins, as there is no artery or nerve beneath it. However, in bloodletting, it is best to avoid only the head of the upper arm and seek a softer spot; and it does no harm if it is not found on the first try, allowing for several attempts. However, some people may develop a small abscess if it is not bloodlet on the first try, but this abscess does not harm them in any way.
On the usefulness of bloodletting, and the precautions to observe in it.
The nature of bloodletting and its complications, about which you must think to correct.
Firstly, you must know that bloodletting is only practiced for the preservation of health, its persistence, and as a precaution against the onset of diseases.
And so that bloodletting may be done on one of the three veins in the elbow, namely the Cephalic, the Dark, and the Basilic.
And so that bloodletting may be done at the start of Spring before fasting, in spring and summer, and in autumn and winter after eating, when signs of fullness appear.
And let bloodletting be done on the first or third day, after three hours have passed since daybreak.
However, bloodletting practiced in illnesses does not have a fixed hour; rather, when convenience and necessity call for it, it may be done at night, or day, and at any hour, and at any time.
And children should not be bled until they have reached fourteen years of age.
Nor should a pregnant woman be bled, except from the fourth to the seventh month.
Nor should the elderly, who have already passed sixty years, be bled.
Therefore, when anyone wants to be bled for any reason, they should cleanse their intestines before bloodletting with a gentle enema, if much stool is retained, so that the veins do not draw from the intestines putrid superfluities that harm the principal organs during bloodletting.
Nor should a person suffering from toctina, that is, a nauseating fullness, nor a gluttonous one, nor one recovering from drunkenness, be bled until these conditions are cleared from them.
Nor should a person sick with dropsy.
And bloodletting should also be avoided after an episode of colic, vomiting, diarrhea, excessive intercourse, labor, exercise, wakefulness, fasting, and anything that depletes strength from the body or mind.
Then consider the subtlety of the humors beforehand, if the blood is thick from foods, drinks, and medicines: if that is possible for him.
Then let him enter the bath, if nothing prevents it; or engage in some exercise, to make the blood more fluid.
And place his bloodletting in the chest, around the third hour of the day, as we said: and strive so that his chest may be cleared that day of all harmful emotional occurrences, such as distress, anger, and fear; and of all physical events, such as labor, pain, excessive intercourse, and similar things.
And let him have present at his seat things with which people are accustomed to use, such as spices, perfumes, music, and similar items, as much as possible.
Then let the bloodletter sit on a cushion that is higher than the cushion of the one being bled; afterward, extend his arm, and the bloodletter should rub it with his hand two or three times.
Then let him bind the ligament with a strap, and wrap it twice.
And let the binding be moderate, for when the binding is uneven, or too tight, it then hinders the flow of blood; or if too loose, it also hinders the flow of blood.
Then, after binding, the one to be bled should rub his hands together until the veins are engorged and visible to the touch.
Then the bloodletter should wipe the lancet with a little aged oil.
Then he should place the index finger of his left hand slightly on the vein itself below the spot where he intends the bloodletting, so that the vein does not slip away and the incision misses.
For among the veins there are some that you find to flee like a string during bloodletting: and among them are those full of air, and when you place the lancet over it, it contracts under the lancet, deceiving the bloodletter, who then does not open the vein; and even if he does open it, it is narrow. Therefore, the bloodletter must be steady and careful in all these things.
Then he should put down the lancet.
And if not, then repeat it with another attempt a little below or above that spot, with quickness, unless the area becomes inflamed.
But if the area becomes inflamed, or the patient grows fearful, then leave him for a day or two, and do not tie the binding.
For it may draw a warm inflammation.
Nor should he enter a bath.
Then let him repeat the bloodletting, if he wishes.
But if the opening is small, or the blood flows subtly, and you fear the desired amount may not exit, then insert the lancet again in the same opening straightly and add a bit to the procedure.
And do this quickly, before the area becomes inflamed, for in many people, a small procedure leads to an inflamed area.
If you see that it is already inflamed, then do not repeat on it at all, for nothing excuses it to you. And place something of the oil sediment on it, for it alleviates the flow of blood.
And it is better in this case than oil itself or other oils.
Similarly, use oil sediment in all your bloodlettings, in which you treat veins with a restriction on blood flow: alfarach antidote and sagzenea do this when one of them is placed on the area.
For the blood is thinned and dissolved when it is thick.
But if a large inflammation occurs at the site of bloodletting, as often happens, especially to one who has only been bled that time, or if the vein opening is small, then quickly place a sponge soaked in water and salt, slightly heated, on the area, and press it for an hour, for it will dissolve.
And you should do this after the blood has exited from that vein fully, or from another vein.
And indeed, often inflammations and swellings occur with bloodletting of the Basilic vein.
Therefore, place your hand on it, and if you find softness upon your pressing it, then that swelling is bad.
Be careful, then, not to place on it anything from what we have mentioned.
For blood from the artery may flow from it.
But make a plaster for it with something astringent, so that the area becomes firm.
Then treat it with the remaining treatment until it heals.
And you must extract blood from every person according to the measure of his strength.
And from what appears as the dominant color in the blood.
For if the blood is black, then let it flow out until it becomes red; similarly, if you see it thick, then let it flow until it becomes thinner; and similarly if it is sharp, until its sharpness is removed.
And if someone is full, strong, and requires blood extraction all at once, the bloodletting incision should be widened, and the lancet should be broad; and for someone who is weak, the opposite should be done.
And it should be drawn out in stages, and the opening should be narrow: the best method in venous bloodletting is a transverse cut, not a puncture.
And this method of bloodletting is safe from excessive blood flow and from cutting a nerve: it is more praiseworthy and safer than bloodletting along the width or length.
For one who is accustomed to experiencing fainting during bloodletting, it is necessary to feed him before bloodletting a small amount of bread soaked in water with pomegranate juice, or secaniabin if he is warm; and draw blood from him in three or four sessions.
If his constitution is cold, then he should take before the bloodletting bread soaked in syrup of quince, or in syrup of honey aromatized with spices, or in a fragrant aromatic syrup.
But if fainting occurs during bloodletting, and it is due to excessive blood loss, he should then drink meat broth and a fine, fragrant syrup, use aromatics with musk, anoint his chest with it, and use the other remedies we have discussed in the section on fainting from evacuation.
For one who wishes to let his arm breathe and release blood a second time: if the bloodletting is for significant evacuation and he has weak strength, he should release blood gradually according to his strength over continuous days.
However, if he wishes to let his arm breathe and release blood a second time and he is strong, then he should do so after seven or nine hours from his first bloodletting.
For one who wishes to draw blood from his body opposite to the side where it tends to accumulate, it should be let on the second or third day.
But if there is much blood in his body that has already become warm and sharp, causing fever, blood must exit in one session, and a large quantity should be drawn, with the incision widened until fainting occurs, all while observing all the conditions of bloodletting. Place your hand on his pulse during the blood flow, so that death does not occur in place of fainting.
For this often happens when the bloodletter is ignorant, and negligence occurs.
And it is not appropriate, when you wish to release the arm and draw blood a second time, with the vein's orifice now closed and the blood's exit becoming difficult, to press on it forcefully and to quickly extend it after bending.
For this is very harmful; instead, leave it until it can be bloodlet a second time.
Or carefully remove what has coagulated from the blood in the vein’s opening, and place on it something of salt dissolved in water.
And place on it something from alfaroch or sagzenea, applying it with gentle compression until the blood exits.
But if the vein is already inflamed, then leave it and do not cover it until the inflammation subsides.
If necessity demands releasing blood a second time and there is no excuse, then either bloodlet above that spot or on the other arm in a different vein.
The cord of the arm is bloodlet at the location of the Fusca and Basilic veins, when they cannot be found and are hidden, as it is formed from them.
And the manner of this bloodletting is that the patient should place his hand in warm water until the palm reddens, and the vein becomes clearly visible.
Then it should be lightly bound over the vein with moderate constriction.
Then, bloodlet it gradually across, not horizontally nor lengthwise; the opening should be wide, and your incision for bloodletting should be slightly above the wrist joint.
And indeed, the flow of blood is most often placed in warm water during winter.
Bloodletting from this vein is safer than from all other veins, as there is no pulsating vein or nerve beneath it.
Bloodletting from the Salvatella vein of the right hand is beneficial for liver ailments.
The manner of this bloodletting is to bind the mahason of the hand with a band or your own hand, after immersing it in warm water until the vein swells and becomes easily palpable.
Then, bloodlet it by making a transverse incision.
And if you cut it entirely, it will cause no harm at all.
Take care not to apply excessive pressure with your hand when using the bloodletting instrument.
For beneath it lie the finger nerves, exposed without much flesh.
Then, immerse the hand in warm water again and allow the blood to flow into it.
If you do not immerse it again in warm water, the blood coagulates in the vein’s opening, blocking the flow.
Once you have drawn the necessary amount of blood, apply oil and salt to the vein to prevent rapid closure.
And you should do likewise with any narrow branch vein.
The benefit of bloodletting from the left hand is that it aids ailments of the spleen; perform this bloodletting in the same way as for the right hand.
Bloodletting from the saphenous vein is beneficial for ailments in the lower body, such as uterine conditions, menstrual retention, kidney ailments, chronic ulcers on the hips and legs, and similar conditions.
The manner of bloodletting from this vein is for the patient to place his foot in warm water and rub it until the veins swell, then bind it above the ankle with a strap.
The location of the vein is near the heel, appearing toward the big toe, and it branches out with many branches over the surface of the foot.
Bloodlet from a larger branch of it, or at its cluster near the heel, as this is better and safer.
If you bloodlet it from the top of the foot, take care to avoid the nerves that lie beneath the surface.
And position your incision for bloodletting transversely, as if you intend to cut it; the incision should be Nesil.
If the blood flow is restricted, immerse the foot in warm water again and let the blood flow into it until evacuated.
If the bloodletter misses the vein on the first try, then retry slightly above, as the area is safe, and there is no need to worry about harm if you avoid the nerves as instructed.
Do likewise for the saphenous vein of the other foot.
The location of the sciatic vein, as we have said, is near the heel on the outer side.
Bloodletting from it relieves hip pain when caused by hot blood.
The manner of bloodletting is for the patient to enter a bath and hurry, then tie his leg from the side of the hip down to above the heel with a long, narrow band four fingers wide, as it is not visible otherwise.
When it becomes visible, bloodlet it in whatever way you find possible, or transversely, which is better, or by making a cut or incision.
Its location is safer, and in most people, it is very concealed.
If you cannot find it and it is entirely hidden to the senses, then bloodlet from one of its branches, namely the one that appears on the top of the foot toward the little toe; avoid the nerves, and allow the desired amount of blood to flow.
Then loosen the binding, place leather over the bloodletting site, and bind the area.
It will heal quickly.
On Cupping and the nature of its use.
Chapter 98.
Cups are made from horns, metal, and glass.
And cupping is indeed done in two ways.
With scarification and blood extraction; and the other is cupping without scarification. And this cupping, which is without scarification, is also done in two ways.
For it is either with fire.
Or it is without fire.
And there are fourteen places on the body where cupping is applied with scarification and blood extraction.
One of these is the cupping of Alnocrati, which is at the back of the head; and Alkehel, which is at the middle of the neck; and the cupping of Alhagdahim, which is on the two sides of the neck at the two blades; and the cupping of the chin, which is below the jaw at the lower part of the mouth; and the cupping of the two shoulder blades; and the cupping of Alachosos above the end of the tail; and the cupping of the two elbows, which is the middle of the two arms; and the cupping of the two thighs; and the cupping of the two ankles.
And indeed, cupping does not draw blood from the small veins scattered in the flesh, and therefore the strength does not diminish from them, as it does in phlebotomy.
Nor is it appropriate to administer cupping, either with fire or without fire, for any illness caused by fullness, until the entire body is evacuated.
But if a need for cupping arises due to illness or habit, we administer it at any time, at the beginning of the month, at its end, and in its middle, and at any other time.
For there are people in whom, when blood multiplies to the extent that cupping extraction is needed, they experience heaviness and dizziness in their head.
And some of them feel fullness and redness in their face, head, and neck.
And some of them experience itching in their face and forehead, dimness, and dullness in their eyes.
And some of them scratch the place of their cupping. And some of them experience an increase in laughter.
And some of them taste blood in their mouth; or their tongue swells, and they spit blood.
And some of them experience an increase in sleep.
And some of them see blood and redness, the dead, wounds, and similar things in their dreams. When, therefore, we observe any of these signs, particularly if it is in the middle third of the month, we then order cupping to be performed after two or three hours of the day have passed. The benefit of cupping the nape is that it relieves heaviness in the head and benefits the eyes.
