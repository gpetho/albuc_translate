On the incision of the abscess that occurs on the outside of the throat, and is called hernia of the throat.
This abscess called hernia of the throat is a large abscess according to the color of the body, and it is common in women.
And it is according to two ways, for it is either natural or accidental.
And the natural one is not a cause for treatment.
And the accidental one is according to two ways, one of which is similar to fatty nodules, and the other way is similar to an abscess caused by the obstruction of an artery, and in that there is danger.
And it is not appropriate to make any attempt on it with iron except in that which is small.
And you test it and investigate it with your finger, and if you find it similar to a fatty nodule, and it is not attached to any veins, then you incise it as with the nodes, and extract it with what contains it from the skin and sac; if not, then its whole being is examined, and then treat the site with what is appropriate for healing until it is healed.
