Chapter Ten:
On the Cauterization of Epilepsy.
Epileptics are not to be cauterized unless the epilepsy is caused by phlegm.
Initially, you should cleanse their brain with cups and other treatments mentioned in the division if the patient is an adult and can tolerate the use of medicines.
If it is a child who cannot endure the medicines, administer fumigations and chewing substances that cleanse the brain for several days before the procedure, combined with suitable food.
Then shave the patient's head and cauterize the middle of the head following the previously described method, and another cautery on the back of the head, and on each horn of the head.
If the patient is strong and can endure it, cauterize them as described for paralysis and softening of the body, on the cervical and dorsal vertebrae.
Use olive cautery as described before.
But if the patient is a child, use a subtler cautery.
