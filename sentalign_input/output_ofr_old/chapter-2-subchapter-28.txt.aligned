Many times, attached flesh grows on the gums, which the ancients call "albulus"; you must then hold it with forceps, and cut it at its root, and let the pus or blood flow; then place ground vitriol on the area, or other constricting and drying powders; and if that flesh returns after the incision, as often happens, then cut it a second time, and cauterize it: it will not return after the cautery; and these are the forms of the instruments for cutting.	There often grows on the gum superfluous flesh which the Ancients call 'epulis'. You should take it up with a hook or grasp it with forceps and cut it at its root and let the pus or blood flow out. Then put on the place either pounded vitriol or one of the absorbent styptic powders. And if the growth returns after treatment—for they often return—excise a second time and cauterize; it will not come back after cauterization.	0.8678473
