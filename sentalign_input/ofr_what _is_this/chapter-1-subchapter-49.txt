of white leprosy (or vitiligo)
When the disease called "albaras" is chronic, and medical remedies are of no use, then cauterize it with a somewhat deep cautery, according to the thickness of the flesh, until the whiteness is removed, and its color is changed; then treat it with vetch flour and lentil flour with rose oil and plantain leaves, and dove's blood and lark's blood, one part of each; and let it all be mixed together, and bound with a cloth, and applied to the area until it is healed.
