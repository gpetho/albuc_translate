Chapter Fourteen on the Reduction of a Femur Fracture
The femur bone often breaks and is perceptible to the senses because it turns forward and backward.
Its mending is done by tightening a bandage above the fracture and another bandage below the fracture, while the patient is lying on his face.
Then an assistant stretches each bandage to its side moderately, if the fracture is in the middle of the bone.
But if it is close to the origin of the femur, it is necessary to tighten a soft bandage, either from wool or similar, at the origin of the femur towards the pubis, so that the stretching is upwards, and the other bandage below the fracture.
Similarly, if the fracture is near the knee, let the bandage be near the knee so that the stretching is downwards.
Then the physician straightens the bone with both hands until he restores it to its natural form, and the bone unites well.
Then it is necessary to apply the bandage and tightening if no hot swelling occurs to the limb.
If swelling occurs in it, leave it for a few days until the hot swelling subsides, then return to its treatment.
As for its tightening, it is necessary to twist a solid, wide turban over the fracture two or three times, and whatever is left over remains.
Then twist the leg until the heel is at the origin of the buttock, and insert a long thread between the thigh and the leg near the knee from below, and the ends of the thread become from above on both sides.
Then wrap what is left of the turban around the leg and thigh.
Then place the splints on the thigh at the fracture site itself, and place one of them on the leg bone.
Then fill the gap between the thigh and the leg with soft cloths to level the tightening.
Then start with strong tightening from the middle over the fracture site, three or four turns, and the further you move the bandage from the fracture site, let your tightening be less, softer, and looser.
Then go to the ends of the thread that you had inserted between the thigh and the leg, and tie with it the adjacent splints from above, then pass the ends of the thread down until you reach the man's ankle, and tighten with them also the ends of the splints from the other side so that the bandage does not move from its place.
Then leave the tightening on it as long as no erosion, swelling, inflammation, or the like occurs to the limb.
If any of this happens, immediately loosen it and fix what has happened according to what we have mentioned repeatedly.
If there is a splinter in the bone that pricks, it is necessary to straighten it if you can, otherwise cut on it and remove it, and treat the wound as mentioned earlier until it heals.
This fracture of the femur may be tightened without adding the leg to the splints, as we mentioned in the humerus and forearm.
Except that its mending in this way does not cause lameness to the patient, and if it is mended alone without adding the leg to it, its owner will inevitably limp forever.
And know that the femur heals in fifty days, or a little more or a little less, all according to the difference in temperaments and other conditions.
