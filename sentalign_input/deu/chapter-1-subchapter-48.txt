Chapter Forty-Eight:
On the cauterization for stupor.
When any limb is numb or asleep and has been treated with medicines, oils, and plasters but is not healed, then you must cauterize the numb limb with cauteries according to its size and importance.
And let your cautery penetrate the thickness of the skin a little.
Then treat it with ointment until it heals.
Sometimes numbness that affects the hands and feet, the vertebrae of the back, and the emergence of the nerves that move the limb is cauterized, and the numbness is removed.
But only someone knowledgeable in the anatomy of the limbs and the emergence of the nerves moving the whole body should perform this.
