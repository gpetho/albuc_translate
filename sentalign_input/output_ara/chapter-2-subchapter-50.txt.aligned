On the swelling that appears from the twisting of a nerve.	On the tumour arising from the twisting of a tendon.	0.81943905
Just as swelling occurs in the artery and vein, swelling also occurs in the nerve if it receives a blow or results from excessive fatigue or the like and this is most common in the wrists and heels.	As a tumour arises on an artery or a vein, so may it also come in a tendon when it has been bruised; or it may arise from excessive fatigue, or such causes. This occurs mostly at the wrists, at the heel, and at all sites of articular movement.	0.8143963
And in every place where the joints move, it is a protruding swelling, similar in color to the rest of the body, and in most cases without pain, and if pressed hard, the patient feels a kind of numbness, and the swelling is not deep in the body.	This occurs mostly at the wrists, at the heel, and at all sites of articular movement. It is a hard tumour of the same colour as the rest of the body, and is generally painless, and when strong pressure is put upon it the patient has a numb feeling in it.	0.7166527
Rather it is under the skin, and it moves in every direction, and it does not go forward or backward. So whatever of it is in the joints, it should not be exposed to iron, for it may cause chronicity, and whatever of it is in the head or in the forehead...	It is a tumour that does not form in the deeper tissues but is subcutaneous. It is freely movable laterally, but will not go forward or backward. Those that are situated on joints should certainly not be tackled with the knife, for that often causes palsy.	0.68164945
Incise the skin with a scalpel. If the swelling is small, grasp it with forceps and cut it from the root. And if it is large, suspend it with a hook and peel it off, then remove it. Close the wound with sutures and treat it until it heals.	Incise the skin of those occurring on the head or forehead, and if the tumour be small take hold of it with the forceps and cut it away by the root. But if it be large, catch it up with a hook and dissect it away and remove it; and sew up the incision and dress until healed.	0.8034328
