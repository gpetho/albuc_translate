Of the arrows
Arrow wounds are diverse, according to their appearances and the places on the body where they fall.
The diversity among them is that some have large points, small, barbed, and welded;
and some have two angles, and others that are long, and some with pieces;
and those that fall in any member do so in two ways: either in a principal member,
such as brain, heart, liver, lungs, kidneys, intestines, bladder, and similar members.
When it falls in any place of these members, and the signs of death, which I will tell you hereafter, appear to you:
it is necessary to avoid extracting this arrow, for death comes afterward in many ways;
and when these bad signs do not appear to you, and the arrow is not deep, then draw it, and treat the wound.
And the signs of the brain when the arrow falls there and pierces the bone, and the membrane over the brain comes out,
are when there is dizziness and sudden pain and redness in the eyes, and inflammation and redness of the tongue, and spasm and confusion of mind, and vomiting of bile;
and sometimes blood comes out of the nostrils, or the ears; and sometimes speech and voice are lost;
and white moisture resembling pus comes out of the wound, and also a spray of flesh;
and if these signs appear to you, avoid the cure, and draw the arrow if it is not inside.
The signs of the arrow when it falls in the heart are that it is near the left breast, and feels as if it is stuck in something hard, not empty;
and sometimes the arrow moves like the pulse, and black blood flows, and coldness and cold sweat come, and syncope:
know then without doubt that death is coming.
And the signs of the arrow that injures the lung are that blood full of foam comes from the wound, the throat swells, the patient changes color, and breathes heavily and seeks cool air.
And if the arrow falls in the covering of the chest, it is near the small ribs; and causes heavy breathing and great pain and sighing; and all the shoulder muscles move.
And if the arrow falls in the stomach, sometimes some undigested food comes out of the wound.
And if the arrow falls in the abdomen, and feces come out through the torn intestine, there is no hope in the cure, nor in the extraction of the arrow.
And if the arrow falls in the bladder, and urine flows out and comes externally, and the patient feels great pain: know that the wound is fatal.
The other members, such as the face, neck, throat, shoulder, auxiliary muscles, spine, buttocks, thigh, and legs, and similar members, are safe according to many conditions.
When the arrow is in the nerve or artery, and it is not venomous, as I will tell you what happened to me, so that you may do the same.
It happened to a man that an arrow fell into the tear duct at the root of the nose:
I probed it, and drew it from the other side under the fat of the ear, and he was healed without harm.
And I drew an arrow from a man whose arrow fell into the fat of the eye under the lower eyelid,
and the arrow was embedded, and I could only reach the point towards the shaft,
and the arrow was large from a Turkish bow, with a light iron head without barbs; the man was healed, and no bad accidents occurred.
And I drew an arrow from the throat of a Christian, and the arrow was Arabic with barbs:
I sawed off the barbs, and worked carefully until I drew it, and the Christian was healed.
And I drew an arrow from a man, who had it fall into his abdomen, and I thought he would die;
and after he had passed thirty days, his condition did not change;
I cut above the arrow, and manipulated it, and drew it out, and no bad accident occurred.
And I saw a man whose arrow fell into his back, and the wound was sealed over;
and the arrow remained inside him, and did not change his natural dispositions,
and found no harm in any of his natural functions.
And I saw another man, whose arrow fell into his face, and the wound was sealed over;
and it remained thus without great pain; and many other similar cases.
And I drew an arrow from one of the king's princes, which had fallen into the middle of his nose,
and was slightly inclined to the right side; and the arrow was fully embedded
I was called to the treatment after it had fallen for three days. I found the wound very narrow.
I probed it with a fine probe, and did not feel it;
and he felt pricking and pain under his right ear.
I thought it was from the point of the arrow
I applied a drawing and digesting plaster on the place, so that it would not swell;
and the place of the arrow appeared.
I applied the plaster for several days, and the wound healed again, and the patient remained thus for a long time,
until he felt the arrow one day in his nose; and he told me.
I applied corrosive liquid medicine on the wound for several days, until it was open,
and I probed it, and felt the head of the arrow that was stuck in the place;
then I added the liquid medicine in the opening of the wound, until the head of the arrow appeared visibly;
and about four months passed,
and then the wound widened enough that I inserted the forceps, and moved it one way and the other, and it could not come out;
then I did not stop working carefully and manipulating with various instruments, until one day I took it with well-made forceps,
according to its shape that will come at the end of this chapter, until I drew it out, and restored the wound.
And the doctors judge that the cartilage of the nose cannot be restored:
I restored it then, and the wound was sealed, and the patient was completely healed.
Now I have told you the quality of extracting some arrows,
so that you apply your treatment to what I do not say, for the book cannot encompass everything;
but the wise master can infer great things from very little, and from what is present and lacking,
find new works, and new instruments, to deal with strange things that happen in this art.
I say that arrows do not come out of the members where they are stuck except in two ways:
either through the place where they enter, or through another part;
and the one that comes out through where it enters is an arrow entering fleshy places, and sometimes comes out immediately.
And if it does not come out immediately, leave it until the flesh around it rots, and the exit is easier;
and also if it is stuck in the bone, and it cannot come out, leave it thus for some days, and move it each day;
and then it will come out, and if it does not, pierce around it with a fine drill, until the place around it is widened, and then draw it.
And if the arrow is stuck in the bone of the head, and goes to one of the ventricles of the brain,
and any of the accidents I have mentioned appear to the patient: do not draw it, but leave it until it is smooth after some days,
because if the arrow reaches the membrane, it is death.
And if the arrow is stuck only in the bone, and does not reach the membrane,
and the patient remains for some days without bad accidents, then manipulate it to draw it.
And if it is deeply stuck and cannot come out, administer drills around it, as I have said; then treat the place until it is healed.
And if the arrow is embedded in a place of the body where it cannot be seen, probe for it with a probe;
and if you feel it, draw it with an appropriate instrument;
and if you cannot because of the tightness of the wound, and the depth of the arrow,
and there is no bone or nerve or vein, cut it until the wound is large;
and draw the arrow if you can, and if the arrow has barbs by which it holds,
remove the flesh that is stuck on both sides as much as you can,
and then break or bend the barbs of the arrow, until you can draw it;
and work carefully not to break the arrow, or it will be much harder to draw it.
And if you cannot at once, leave it until the place around is rotten, then draw it, because the extraction will be easier.
And if the blood flow hinders you, administer what we have said about treatment in its chapter;
and beware of cutting the nerve and the vein, and devise how you can draw the arrow without danger,
whether quickly or slowly, or firmly or gently; and place the patient as he was when the arrow fell into him,
for that is the greatest help, and if you cannot, place him according to what the signs show you.
The arrow that comes out the other way, where something of it appears, or the skin is swollen in the place so that it can be seen or felt clearly:
cut above it then, until the forceps can take hold, and then draw it: so it comes out immediately.
And if it is held in the bone, rotate your hand roundly, until it enters the bone, and widen the bone, then draw it.
And if it cannot come out, leave it again, and then restart the extraction until it comes out;
and if the shaft of the arrow is there, push it with the shaft;
and if the shaft falls, and you want to administer pushing, use an instrument with a barbed point,
so that the point of the arrow enters the barb of the instrument; then push out,
and if the arrow is barbed, insert an instrument with a point inside, to ease the extraction.
And if the arrow is poisoned, it is necessary to cut all the flesh around where the venom is, if you can,
then treat the wound as necessary.
And if the arrow falls in the chest or abdomen or bladder or side, and it is near, and you can cut above, then cut there;
and beware of cutting the vein and the nerve, then draw it, and then sew the wound, if necessary;
and treat it until it is healed.
The shape of the forceps used to draw arrows is like a bird's beak, and here is the shape:
And there are many kinds: large, medium, and small, according to the size of the arrow.
The shape of the pushing barb is like the feather of a bird,
to push at the point of the arrow, as here is the shape:
the shape of the forceps for pushing and pulling is here:
