Chapter seventy-fifth in teaching midwives how to treat living fetuses if they come out in an unnatural form.	CHAPTER SEVENTY-FIVE. On the training of midwives in how to treat living foetuses when not brought forth in the natural manner.	0.8561455
The midwife should first know the form of a natural birth, and its signs are: if you see the woman pushing downwards and longing to smell the air, and her labor pains become easier for her, and the exit of the fetus is quick, then know that this birth will be in the natural form, and its exit will be headfirst, and the placenta with it or hanging from its umbilical cord.	To begin with, the midwife must know the manner of normal labour. Among the signs of it are these. If you see the woman strain her abdomen and desire to breathe more air, and the pangs come easily to her and she hastens to deliver the child, by this you may know that the labour will follow a natural course and that the presentation will be vertex with the afterbirth, either together with the child or hanging by the umbilical cord.	0.8465899
So if you see these signs, it is appropriate to press her abdomen so that the fetus comes out quickly, because if it descends headfirst, the placenta descends with it and she cleanses well from those excesses.	And when you observe these signs it will be necessary to put pressure upon the abdomen to bring forth the foetus quickly. For when it presents the vertex the afterbirth comes down with it and she is thoroughly cleansed of those superfluities.	0.7923167
And other than this birth, it is unnatural and undesirable because the fetus may come out on its feet, or its hands may come out before its head and feet, or one hand or one foot may come out, or its head and hand may come out, or it may come out folded, and perhaps it turns on its back, and similar undesirable forms.	But a delivery that is contrary to this is unnatural and wrong. Sometimes the infant is delivered by its feet; or by its hands before either head or feet; or a single hand or foot; or the head comes out together with a foot. Or it comes out all twisted, often with the nape of the neck first; or in other wrong positions.	0.7783786
So it is appropriate for the midwife to be skillful and gentle in all these things and to beware of slips and errors, and I am explaining each form of them and the proper technique for it so that you may be guided by that and understand it.	So the midwife must have wisdom and dexterity and be skilled in all these cases and beware of failures and mistakes. I shall explain the technique in these modes of delivery so that she may be instructed and may be acquainted with them all.	0.8570323
If the fetus comes out headfirst, the natural exit, and that is difficult for the woman, and labor is difficult for her, and you see that her strength has weakened, then sit her on a chair and order women to hold her, and apply a poultice to her uterus with cooked fenugreek and moist ointments.	When the foetus comes out by the vertex in the normal manner and yet the delivery is with great difficulty for the woman and you see that her strength is getting exhausted, then make her sit on a seat and have her held firmly, and foment her womb in a decoction of fenugreek and in bland oils.	0.82400286
Then the midwife inserts a small lancet between her fingers and cuts the placenta with it or cuts it with her fingernail until the moisture in it flows out, and presses the woman's abdomen until the fetus descends.	Then the midwife should take between two fingers a little scalpel and make an incision in the foetal membrane or open it with the finger nail, to allow the contained waters to flow out; and put pressure upon the woman's abdomen until the foetus comes down.	0.8177771
If it does not descend, then it is appropriate to inject the woman with fenugreek mucilage with oil of euphorbia, then after the injection, order her to push and make her sneeze with hellebore and hold her mouth and nose, for the fetus will come out immediately.	But if it will not come down then the woman should have an enema of mucilage of fenugreek with oil of sesame. Then bid her bear down after the enema, and with ptarmica stimulate her to sneeze; and close her mouth and nose for a while and the foetus will quickly come out.	0.765216
If the fetus's hand comes out first, it is appropriate to push them back gently little by little, if they do not go in, then place the woman on a platform and raise her legs upwards, then shake the platform on the ground and the woman holds on so that she does not fall when shaking, if the hands do not go in and the fetus dies, then cut them off and pull the rest of the fetus or tie its hands with a cloth and pull them moderately, for it will come out. Exit of the fetus on its feet.	If the hands of the foetus present, you should slowly and gently push them back; and if they will not go back then place the woman upon a seat, have her feet raised and meanwhile shake the seat; but the woman should be held lest the shaking cause her to fall off. But if the two hands will not go back and the foetus is dead cut them off and draw out the remains. Or tie tapes to the hands and pull on them evenly and it will come out.	0.84090567
Exit of the fetus on its feet. If the fetus comes out on its feet, it is appropriate to push them upwards, then turn the fetus little by little until you straighten it, then take one of its legs and extend it little by little, and if they come out to the thighs, then order her to push and make her sneeze with hellebore, for it will come out.	Foot presentation: when the foetus presents feet first you should raise them both; then you should very gently turn the foetus so as to straighten it. Then take one of its feet and stretch it gently. When they come down as far as the hips, bid her bear down, make her sneeze with ptarmica, and it will come out.	0.8137466
If it does not come out as we described, then return the fetus little by little until you put it in the natural form, then it will come out smoothly.	But if it will not come out with these means we have described, you should return the foetus gently until you have placed it in the natural position; then it will come out easily.	0.78154355
If it resists with all that we described, then take marshmallow mucilage, fenugreek mucilage, oil of euphorbia, and dissolved gum, and grind all of them in a mortar well, then anoint with it the woman's vulva and lower abdomen, then sit her in lukewarm water until it reaches the thighs.	But if it defies all that we have described, take mucilage of marsh mallow and fenugreek and oil of sesame and dissolved gum, and pound them all well together in the mortar and anoint the woman's pudenda and lower abdomen; then make her sit down in warm water reaching to the costal margin.	0.8596871
So if you see that her lower part has softened, then make for her a suppository of myrrh and let her bear it, and if she holds the suppository for an hour, then sit her on the chair, then make her sneeze and close her mouth and nose, and gently press her lower abdomen, for the fetus will come out immediately. Exit of the fetus on its knees and hands.	And when you see the lower parts are softened, make a suppository of myrrh and let her introduce it; and when she has had the suppository in for a while make her sneeze, stopping her nose and mouth; and press gently upon the abdomen; then will the foetus immediately emerge.	0.81822205
Exit of the fetus on its knees and hands. If it comes out in this manner, strive to insert its hands little by little, then the woman lies on her back and hangs her hips downwards while lying on a bed and clasps her hands, then press above her abdomen little by little, then remove what is under her legs from the pillows until her lower part is elevated, if the fetus does not come out, then take both of her legs and move them vigorously, then press above the thighs little by little until the fetus ascends upwards, then the midwife inserts her hand and straightens the fetus little by little and orders the woman to push until the fetus comes out. Exit of the fetus transversely, hanging one of its hands. Strive to return its hand, if you are unable to return it, then make the woman stand and make her walk, if she is unable to walk, then let her lie on her bed and shake her legs vigorously, then use the poultice that I described from the mucilages, if labor pains take her, then sit her on a chair, then work on returning the hand and straightening the fetus to the natural form, and make the woman sneeze and order her to push until it comes out.	Presentation of the foetus by knees and hands : when it comes out after this manner you should seek to introduce the hands slowly; then let the woman lie back on her shoulders with her feet hanging down, reclining on a couch with her hands clasped together; then very gently put pressure upon the abdomen; then take away the pillows from under her feet until her lower parts are vertical ; and if the foetus does not come out then, take both her feet and shake them violently ; then press upon her costal margin until the foetus ascends ; then let the midwife insert her hand and put the foetus in the right position, very gently, and bid the woman bear down, until the infant is born. Presentation by the side with one hand hanging down: attempt to man≈ìuvre the hand back again; but if you cannot reduce it then make the woman stand up and walk. But if she cannot walk then have her lie on a couch, and agitate her feet violently. Then employ the ointment which I described among the mucilages.	0.921725
Exit of the fetus on its back, extending its hands, and its face is towards its mother's back.	Presentation on the back, with hands outstretched and face towards the mother's back: the midwife should take the infant's hand and then turn him very slowly, and gently rectify his position.	0.5643801
It is appropriate for the midwife to hold the fetus's hand, then turn it little by little and straighten it gently, and when it is straightened, apply to her vulva what we described of ointment and mucilages, then order her to move little by little, and if she does that, then sit her on the chair and order her to lean to the right side, then order her to push and make her sneeze with hellebore, for it will come out. Exit of the fetus upright on its side.	Then when he is in the correct position apply to the maternal passage the oil and mucilage prescribed. Then bid the woman move gently and when she has done so make her sit down upon a seat and bid her lean over to her right side; then bid her bear down, and with ptarmica make her sneeze ; then the foetus will come forth. The foetus presenting laterally, doubled up : when it presents at the os in this manner together with the membrane, open the membrane with your finger nail and let out the waters.	0.80275095
Exit of the fetus upright on its side. If it descends to the cervix in this manner with the placenta, then cut the placenta with your fingernail until it is emptied of moisture, and if it is attached to the fetus's face and neck, cut it from the umbilical cord so that it does not choke and die, then push the fetus inwards until you put it as it should be, and order the woman to push several times, for it will come out easily.	The foetus presenting laterally, doubled up : when it presents at the os in this manner together with the membrane, open the membrane with your finger nail and let out the waters. And if it adhere over the infant's face and neck, cut it away from the umbilicus lest he be strangled and die. Then push the foetus back till it is in the proper position, and bid the woman bear down a few times until the foetus comes forth.	0.84585357
Exit of twins or many fetuses. Know that twins are often born, and three or four may be born and live, except that is rare, as for five, it is something outside of nature, they do not live at all.	The birth of twin or multiple foetuses: you should know that it is a common occurrence for twins to be born alive, and sometimes three or four infants, but this is a rarity; while five after this manner is altogether unnatural and they never live.	0.8330817
And one placenta surrounds them, even if they are many, and they are separated by a dividing membrane between them connected to the umbilical cord of each one of them.	Although they may be more than one, they are enveloped in a single membrane but separated one from the other by a dividing membrane joined to the umbilicus of each one.	0.7541411
And they may come out as a single fetus comes out, a natural, easy exit, and they may come out in an undesirable exit as we described, so if some of them have difficulty at birth and become in what we mentioned of unnatural forms, then treat it as we described.	And when they are born they may come in the natural easy manner of a single foetus; or by any abnormal presentation such as we have described. And if one of them be born with difficulty, presenting in some unnatural manner as described, the treatment is also as described.	0.87137306
And let the midwife be gentle and do what she does with gentleness and patience, and use strategies for each form with what is available to her of techniques leading to safety.	Let the midwife be delicate and do whatever she does gently and calmly, adopting in each case whatever technique it demands that will conduce to a safe result.	0.7677903
Mention of what is conceived in the uterus of fetuses and then they are miscarried.	A note on the foetuses that may be formed in the womb and abort.	0.6844804
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, and more than ten may be conceived in the uterus, and it has been confirmed to me that a woman miscarried seven and another fifteen, all of them conceived, that is by the decree of the Mighty, the Knowing.	Sometimes in the womb there may form one or two or three or four or five or six or seven or more than ten. And I can vouch that one woman had an abortion of seven foetuses and another woman of fifteen, all of them formed. This is by the decree of the Almighty, the Wise.	0.8522726
So all of this should be in the knowledge of the midwife, perhaps something like that will happen to her one day, so she addresses it as appropriate.	And all this should be part of the midwife's knowledge, for one day she may meet such a case and she must deal with it in the proper way.	0.79066813
