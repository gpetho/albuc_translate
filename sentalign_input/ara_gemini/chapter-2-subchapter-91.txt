Chapter ninety-one on phthisis of the civilized perspiration.
This vein is generated in the legs in hot countries like the Hijaz and the countries of the Arabs, and in hot, dry, and infertile countries.
And perhaps it is generated in other places of the body other than the legs.
And its generation is from putrefaction that occurs under the skin, as it occurs inside living bodies, worms, bottle gourds, and the worms generated between the skin and the flesh.
And the sign of the beginning of the occurrence of this vein is that severe inflammation occurs in the leg.
Then the place blisters.
Then the vein begins to come out from the place of that blister as if it were the root of a plant or an animal.
So when its tip appears, it should be wrapped around a small piece of lead, whose weight is from one dirham to two dirhams.
And tie it and leave the lead hanging from the leg.
So whenever something comes out of it, wrap it in the lead and tie it.
If it becomes very long, cut some of it and wrap the rest.
And do not cut it from its origin before all of it comes out, because if you cut it, it will shrink and enter the flesh, so it will cause swelling and putrefaction in the place and a bad ulcer.
Therefore, it should be handled gently and pulled little by little until it comes out completely and nothing of it remains in the body.
And from this vein, in some people, may come out what is five cubits and ten in length.
And it has reached me that it came out for a man twenty cubits.
If it breaks for you while you are treating it, insert a probe into its hole.
And push it slowly and for a long time with the body until all the matter in it is emptied.
And try to disinfect the place with medicines for days.
Then treat it with the treatment for swellings.
And this vein may have many branches, especially if it appears in the joint of the leg or in the leg itself.
So it will have many mouths, and a branch comes out of each mouth.
So treat it as we mentioned in the division and with what preceded.
