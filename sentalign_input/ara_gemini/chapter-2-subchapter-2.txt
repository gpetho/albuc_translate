The second chapter on cutting the two arteries that are behind the ears, known as the throbbing arteries.
When someone experiences acute episodes affecting the eyes or chest, and this becomes chronic, and medication does not work, then the most effective treatment is to cut these two arteries.
Therefore, if you intend to cut them, you should shave the patient's head with a razor, then rub the area with a rough cloth so that the artery appears, then tie the patient's neck with the excess of his garment, then look where the vein pulsates, and their locations are the two lowered places behind the ears, and they are rarely hidden except in some people, then mark them with ink, then cut them with a sharp scalpel down to the bone, and this should be across the width of the head.
And if you wish, you can insert the scalpel from under the artery and lift it upwards while cutting, and the length of the cut should be about two closed fingers, because when the vein is cut, the blood will come out in a pulsating flow, leaping forward in successive spurts.
If the artery is not apparent to the touch, then you should measure from the ear a distance of about three fingers, then mark it with ink and incise down to the bone.
It is advisable to let out six ounces of blood on average, and sometimes you may let out more or less, all depending on the patient's strength and the fullness of his arteries as it appears to you.
Then look at the wound, and if any membrane remains on the bone, cut it so that a hot swelling does not occur, then tie the wound with a wick of linen cloth, then treat it with ointments until it heals.
