Chapter 34.
On the treatment of dislocated toes.
A dislocated toe should be gently realigned without much effort; this is usually easy to do.
But if the dislocation is in some of the joints of the foot, have the patient sit with their foot on an even surface or table, as if they were standing.
Then stand and place your foot over the dislocated joints, pressing down firmly until they return to place, ensuring they are aligned and no swelling appears.
Then place a board under the sole of the foot to support it completely, securing it with a tight and firm bandage for three days; then remove the bandage and have the patient rest without walking for many days until it is stable and the reduction is confirmed.
