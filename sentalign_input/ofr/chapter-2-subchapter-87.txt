of fire
The head rots either because of an internal cause, or because of an external one; and when you have treated this corrosion with the cure of medicines, and they are of no use, then it is necessary to cut off that limb up to the place where the corrosion comes, so that the patient escapes death by this, or by the greater harm, the loss of the limb; and the sign is that the limb becomes black, so that it looks like it is burned by fire, and rots after the blackness, then this corrosion goes from limb to limb, and takes over the whole body; so hurry to cut, and if it is from the bite of some venomous beast, such as a sea scorpion and viper and the like, if the corrosion is at the tip of the finger, cut it off, and do not give it space to come up to the hand.
And if it comes up to the hand, cut it off at the joint, so that the corrosion does not reach the arm; and if it comes to the arm, cut it off at the elbow; and if it passes the elbow, it is death, and no external treatment is of any use except for the strength of its virtue; and do the same when the corrosion comes in the foot: if it comes to the first joint, cut it after the next joint; and if it comes to the foot, cut off the whole foot; and if it goes up the leg, cut at the knee joint; and if it comes above the knee, there is no other solution than to leave the patient to die; and the way to cut or scrape the limb is that you tie it above and below, and one assistant stretches one of the cloths downwards, and another assistant stretches the other cloth upwards, and you separate the flesh that is between the two cloths to a width of a spatula, so that the bone is uncovered; then cut or scrape it, and put a linen cloth on each side, so that the scraping does not touch the healthy place, and cause the patient further injury and hot abscess.
And if bleeding occurs when you operate, cauterize the place quickly, or put on some astringent powders; then return to your treatment until it is completed, then tie the wounded limb with a suitable bandage, and treat it until it is healed; and I will tell you what happened to a man in his foot: a blackness appeared on it that looked like a burn, and this corrosion first came to his toe, until it took over the whole foot; and when the man saw the corrosion, he hastened to cut off his foot, and was healed; and a long time afterwards the corrosion returned to his finger, and he came to me, and I put on repercussive things after cleansing the body, and the corrosion could not be stopped; and he wanted me to cut off his hand, and I did not want to, because I had hoped to repel the matter; and I also feared that if I cut off his hand, he would die, because the man's strength was weak; and he despaired completely, and returned to his land, and hastened to cut off his hand, and was healed; and I have only told this so that others may do the same, if they need to.
