of the flesh of the gums
Many times, extra flesh grows on the gums, which the ancients call "albulus";
so you must hold it with tongs, and cut it at its root, and let the pus or blood flow;
then put on the area crushed vitriol, or other astringent and drying powders;
and if this flesh returns after the incision, and it often does, then cut it a second time and cauterize it:
thus it will not return after cauterization;
and these are the shapes of the instruments for cutting.
