Chapter Thirty-Eight.
On Cauterizing the Bladder.
If weakness and relaxation occur in the bladder due to cold and humidity, so that the patient cannot hold urine, cauterize him with a cautery below the navel, over the bladder where the pubic hair begins, and a cautery to the right of the navel, and another to its left.
And the distance after cauterization from each side should be about the width of a thumb joint. Cauterize him with a cautery at the bottom of the back, or two cauteries if needed, and the cautery iron should be nail-shaped, as mentioned before.
