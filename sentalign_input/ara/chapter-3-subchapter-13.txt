Chapter Thirteen.
On the treatment of fractures of the hand and fingers.
Fractures of the metacarpus and phalanges of the fingers rarely occur, but contusions frequently do. So, whenever a fracture or contusion happens to the handâ€¦
The patient should sit cross-legged with a chair of equal height in front of him.
Then he places his hand on it, extended. Then an assistant extends the broken bones and the physician sets them until they are well aligned.  Then the bandage and the splint should be applied if a hot swelling does not occur. Then a splint is applied over the area, according to the location.
I inserted it into a soft cloth. If the fracture is downwards towards the palm of the hand, make a ball-like shape from a cloth and order the patient to grasp it with his fractured hand. Then it is bandaged with a long cloth.
The splint should be made of soft leather so that the leather conforms to the curvature of the entire hand, and you bandage it as needed. If the fracture is outwards, then you should place a splint on top and another splint underneath in the palm so that the hand is open and straight.
Then the bandaging is carried as the hand turns, and it is interlocked between the fingers with the bandage. If the fracture occurs in one of the phalanges of the fingers, if it is the thumb, it should be straightened as needed, then bandaged with the hand.  And if you wish, make a small, straight splint to support the fracture.
And it should not move. If the fracture is to the other fingers, such as the middle, index, little, or ring finger, straighten them and bandage them with the adjacent healthy finger, or bandage them all together in sequence, which is better, or place a small, straight splint on them.
As we said regarding the thumb, monitor during and after your reduction for hot swelling. Address it as needed whenever something like this occurs, as described repeatedly.
