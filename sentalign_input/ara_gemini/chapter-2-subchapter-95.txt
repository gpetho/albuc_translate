Chapter Ninety-Five on Phlebotomy
The veins that are customarily phlebotomized in the body are thirty veins, of which sixteen are in the head.
The two pulsating veins behind the ears, known as the Hasisayn, and the two arteries that are in the temples, the apparent ones, and the two veins that are in the corners of the eyes, known as the Nazirin, and the vein erected in the middle of the forehead, and the vein that is at the tip of the nose, and the two jugular veins that are in the neck, and the two veins that are in the upper lip of the mouth, and the two veins that are in the lower lip, and these veins are known as the Jahark, and the two veins that are under the tongue.
As for the veins that are phlebotomized in the arm and hand, they are five veins: one of them is the Cephalic, and it is from the lateral side, and the common people call it the vein of the head; and the Akhal, and it is the middle vein, and it is composed of a branch of the Basilic and a branch of the Cephalic, and the common people call it the vein of the body; and the Basilic, and it is located on the medial side, and it is also called the Axillary, and the common people call it the vein of the abdomen; and the ligament of the arm, which is located on the ulna, and it is the one that adheres to it, and it is the one that appears clearly above the thumb; and the Aslim, and it is the vein that is between the little finger and the ring finger, it has two branches.
And in the leg and foot are three veins: one of them is the one under the hollow of the knee from the lateral side; and the second is the Saphenous, and its place is at the ankle from the medial side; and the Sciatic vein, and its place is at the heel from the lateral side.
And in the other leg are three veins like it.
As for the two veins that are behind the ears, the benefit of their phlebotomy is for chronic colds, migraine, ringworm, and chronic malignant head ulcers.
And the way to phlebotomize them is as I describe: that you shave the head of the sick person and rub its back in the place of the two veins with a rough cloth, rubbing it well, then the sick person strangles his neck with a turban until the two veins appear, and their place is behind the ears in the two low places of the head, so you search for them with your finger, and where you feel their pulse under your finger, there mark with ink, then you take a scalpel, which is known as the Nashal, then you insert it under the vein in the skin until the scalpel reaches the bone, then you raise your hand with the vein and skin upwards and cut the vein with the skin, a severed cut, and the length of the cut is the extent of two closed fingers or so, and you let out the amount of blood that you want, then you tie them with bandages and leave them until they heal.
And their cutting and cauterization have been mentioned at the beginning of the book.
As for the two arteries that are in the temples, the benefit of their phlebotomy is for chronic migraine, severe headache, constant ophthalmia, and the flow of acute humors pouring into the eyes.
And the way to phlebotomize them is as I describe to you: the sick person tightens his neck with a turban until the two veins appear clearly to the touch, and their pulse becomes clear under your finger, then you mark with ink, then you lift the skin from above the vein up with your index finger, and you insert the Nashal scalpel from below, and you lift the vein upwards and sever it as you did with the other two veins, and you let out the blood according to your need, then you loosen the sick person's strangulation and place your finger on the vein for an hour, then you put cotton and a bandage on it and tie it tightly from above and leave it until it heals.
And their mention, cutting, and scraping have been mentioned at the beginning of the book.
As for the phlebotomy of the forehead vein, its benefit after the phlebotomy of the Cephalic is for chronic facial ailments such as ringworm, ulcers, and unsightly redness.
And the way to phlebotomize it is as I describe to you: the sick person strangles his neck with a turban until the vein appears, then you take the instrument called the Axe, and this is its picture:
You place the projecting fork that is at the head of the axe on the vein itself and strike from above with a comb or something similar in its manner, and you let the blood flow to the extent that you desire, then you loosen the tourniquet of the sick person and tighten it until he recovers. And it may be opened with a wide lancet, except that it is not appropriate for the lancet to be sharp-tipped like other lancets, but rather be slightly wide-tipped, and you bleed it obliquely because the bone is near, so perhaps the lancet might break in it if it is thin.
As for the two veins that are in the corners of the eyes, their benefit is for eye ailments like scabies, redness, eyelashes, and diseases of the face.
And as for the way of bleeding them, it is that the sick person tightens his neck with a turban, then you bleed them while you are standing at his head, and let the bleeding be slightly obliquely lengthwise with a small, slightly wide lancet, for the place has no flesh, so if the lancet is thin-tipped, perhaps it might break.
Then you let out the blood you need and put cotton on them and tighten them for one night, then you loosen them.
And as for bleeding the vein of the nose, it is beneficial for acute fever and severe headache and for diseases of the face like the red erysipelas that occurs in the nose, especially if it is chronic.
And the way to bleed it is that the sick person tightens his neck, then you hold his nose with your left hand and take a thin, long lancet and insert it in the middle of the tip of the nose itself between the partitions of the nose straight, because the vein does not appear to the senses there, so the blood will come out immediately.
And it is appropriate that you deepen your hand with the lancet a little and let out the blood you need, then bandage it for a night, for it will heal quickly.
As for the two external jugular veins, the benefit of bleeding them is for shortness of breath, the beginning of leprosy, and melancholic diseases that occur on the surface of the skin, such as black vitiligo, scabies, malignant ulcers, and eating sores.
And the way of bleeding them is that the ill person tightens below them on his neck with a bandage, and the practitioner stands at the head of the sick person, and the sick person is sitting on a chair, then you bleed the vein lengthwise with a slightly wide bleeding, then you let out a moderate amount of blood, or according to what you see of the need for that, then you do likewise with the other vein, then you loosen the bandage and tighten the two veins with a moderate tightening, lest the sick person suffocate, and you leave it until the next day, for the wound will heal.
As for the veins of the jaw, the benefit of bleeding them after bleeding the cephalic vein is that it benefits from thrush in the mouth, corruption of the gums, malignant ulcers, chapped lips, and malignant ulcers that are in the nose and around it.
And the way of bleeding them is that you sit the sick person in front of you and tighten his neck with a turban, then you turn his lips and look at the two veins that you see, one on the right of the lip and the other on its left, and you distinguish them by their blackness, and that is also because around them are thin black veins, so you cut them with a severed cut.
If it is difficult for you and you do not know which they are, then aim to cut the largest and clearest of them, and likewise do with the two veins that are in the lower lip.
As for the two veins that are under the tongue, the benefit of bleeding them after bleeding the cephalic vein is for the ulcers that are in the throat from disease of the uvula and diseases of the mouth.
And the way of bleeding them is that you sit the sick person between your hands facing the sun and lift his tongue and look under the tongue on one side for a vein and on the other side for a vein, and their color is blackish, so you bleed them and be careful not to go deep in cutting them, for beneath them are arteries, so perhaps bleeding might occur from those arteries.
As for the three veins that are bled in the elbow, they are the ones that are customarily bled in all people, and their bleeding is in two ways: either by piercing with a wide basil-shaped lancet or an olive-shaped one tending towards thinness, or by incising with a knife-shaped lancet, which is the scalpel [and this is its image].
Image of the wide basil-shaped lancet:
It should be wide, as you see, so that it is suitable for opening the hollow, full, prominent, visible, thick veins that contain thick, turbid blood.
And this is a picture of the olive-shaped lancet:
And this lancet is less wide and thinner at the tip, suitable for phlebotomizing thin veins that contain thin, choleric blood.
And this is the image of the lancet:
This is the lancet that is suitable for incision, and there are wide and thin types of it, depending on the width and narrowness of the veins, and this may be inferred from others, and it is well known among artisans.
As for the basilic vein, which is one of these three veins, the benefit of its phlebotomy is that it draws blood from the ailments that are under the throat and neck, from what is next to the chest and abdomen.
And the phlebotomist should be cautious when performing phlebotomy on it and be careful of it, for beneath it is an artery, and if he makes a mistake and increases the insertion of the lancet, he will cut that artery, causing bleeding, so therefore, its phlebotomy should not be with a piercing lancet, but rather by incision with the lancet.
If the basilic vein does not appear clearly, then it should be avoided and another should be used, or some of its branches should be sought, or the arm's tendon should be phlebotomized in its place, for it is clear, and incise it with the lancet as we have said.
If you want to phlebotomize it specifically, then it is necessary before tightening the arm to feel the place until you identify the location of the pulse, then mark it with ink, then tie the arm and incise the vein with an oblique incision with the lancet as we said, and make sure that the strike falls away from the location of the artery.
And when you see, when tightening the bandage, swelling in the place that you marked with ink, then that swelling is the swelling of the artery, so avoid it.
If you see the blood, at the time of phlebotomy, jumping as the urine of a child jumps, and the blood is thin and red, then know that it is from the blood of the artery, so then immediately put your finger on it for a long time, then remove your finger, and if the blood stops, as it often does, then tie the arm and leave it.
And warn the patient against neglecting it, and let it be on his neck, and let him not move it for days until he recovers.
If the blood does not stop and overcomes you, and you do not have medicine at your disposal, then sever the artery if it appears to you, for its ends will contract and the blood will stop.
Or take a pistachio shell and split it, and take one half and tighten it on the location of the vein tightly with a bandage and padding until the next day.
Then if the blood stops, and if not, then treat it with what was mentioned previously regarding placing the styptic powders.
And stopping its blood is not difficult in most cases because of the smallness of the wound and the effectiveness of the bandage on the arm, so know this.
As for the Akhal vein, the benefit of its phlebotomy is that it draws blood from the top of the head and the lower part of the body because it is composed of a branch from the Basilic vein and a branch from the Cephalic vein, as we have said.
And the phlebotomist should be cautious when performing phlebotomy on it, because there is a nerve underneath it, and if he goes too deep with the lancet and hits the nerve, numbness will occur in it, which is difficult to heal, and it may not heal at all.
This nerve is often perceptible to the touch. If it is hidden in some people and is thin and not apparent, then you should make your incision with the lancet lengthwise and avoid the nerve as much as possible. If the vein is between two nerves, then incise the vein lengthwise.
As for the Cephalic vein, the benefit of its phlebotomy is that it draws blood from the head and is useful for eye diseases. It is recommended for this vein, especially, if you want to perform phlebotomy on it, to do it by puncturing with the olive-shaped lancet or the broad basil-shaped lancet because it is the safest of all veins, as there is no artery or nerve underneath it, except that you should avoid the head of the muscle with the lancet and look for the soft spot.
It does not harm it if it is not hit on the first try to repeat the phlebotomy several times, except that it may swell in some people if it is not bled on the first try, but that swelling does not harm it at all.
As for the method of phlebotomy, its complications, and what should precede it in its preparation, the first thing you should know is that phlebotomy is either used to maintain health only or used in diseases. The one used to maintain and sustain health and to prevent the occurrence of diseases should be performed on one of the three veins in the elbow, namely the Cephalic, the Akhal, and the Basilic, and the phlebotomy should be performed at the beginning of spring when signs of fullness appear, and it should be done on Sunday or Tuesday after three hours of daylight have passed.
As for the phlebotomy used in diseases, it has no specific time, but whenever the need and necessity for it arises, whether at night or day, at any hour and at any time.
Children should not be bled until they reach fourteen years of age, and the elderly who have passed sixty years of age should not be bled.
If someone intends to have phlebotomy for any reason, it is necessary to cleanse his intestines before phlebotomy with a mild enema if there is a lot of retained waste, so that excess putrid matter that harms the main organs is not drawn from the intestines to the veins during phlebotomy.
Do not bleed the bloated, the drunk, or the intoxicated until that condition has passed from them. Also, avoid phlebotomy immediately after fever, vomiting, diarrhea, excessive intercourse, fatigue, exercise, staying up late, fasting, and anything that weakens the strength, whether physical or mental.
Then consider thinning the humors before that if the blood is thick, with foods, drinks, and medicines, if possible.
Then he should enter the bath if there is no impediment preventing him, or he should engage in some exercise so that the blood thins. And make his phlebotomy in the middle of the day, as we have said. He should aim to clear his mind that day of all bad psychological symptoms such as worries, anger, and fear, and of all physical symptoms such as excessive fatigue and exhaustion, intercourse, and so on.
And have present in his company things that people are accustomed to using, such as various perfumes, fragrant herbs, entertainment, and so on, each person according to what they can afford.
Then the phlebotomist sits on a cushion that is higher than the cushion on which the person being bled sits.
Then he extends his arm, and the phlebotomist rubs it with his hand two or three times, then tightens the bandage with the cord and twists it two or three times. The tightening should be moderate because if the tightening is not moderate, either by excessive tightening, it will prevent the flow of blood, or if it is too loose, it will also prevent the flow of blood.
Then, after tightening, the person being bled should rub his hands together until the veins swell and become apparent to the touch. Then the phlebotomist wipes the lancet with a little old oil, specifically. Then he places his index finger of his left hand on the vein itself, slightly below the spot where he intends to bleed, so that the vein does not shrink and avoid the strike, because some veins are like tendons, shrinking during phlebotomy, and some are filled with air. So when you place the lancet on them, they sink under the lancet and deceive the phlebotomist, and the lancet does not open the vein. And if it does open it, the opening will be narrow.
Therefore, the phlebotomist should be firm and take his time in all these matters.
Then he lowers the lancet. If it opens the vein on that attempt, then fine, otherwise, he should try again a little below that spot or above it quickly if the area has not swollen.
If it swells or the patient becomes distressed, leave it for a day or two, and do not tighten the bandage, as it may cause a hot swelling. And he should not enter the bath.
Then he can resume phlebotomy if he wishes.
If the lancet punctures and the opening is small and the blood flow is thin, and you fear that the desired amount of blood will not come out, then return the lancet to the same hole gently and straight, and increase the opening slightly. Do this quickly before the area swells, because in many people the area may swell at the small opening. If you see that it has swollen, do not try again at all, as it will not help you. Put some oil cake on it, as it facilitates the flow of blood, and it is better in this place than the oil itself and all other ointments. Likewise, use oil cake in all your vein phlebotomy when the blood flow is difficult. Theriac Faruq and Shakhizaniya can also do this if either of them is placed on the area, as the blood thins and dissolves if it is thick.
If a large swelling occurs at the site of phlebotomy, which often happens, especially for those who have only been bled that one time or if the opening of the vein was small, then quickly place a sponge dipped in slightly warmed water and salt on the swelling and tighten it for an hour, and it will dissolve.
You should do this after the blood has completely come out from the vein itself or from another vein.
If something of blackness or greenness remains in the area after a few days, it does not harm.
If you wish, apply something of dissolved aloe and myrrh, or some extract of fudenj and the like.
Swelling and a bump often occur during the phlebotomy of the basilic vein, so place your hand on it, and if you find it softens when you press it, then it is a bad bump, so be careful not to put anything on it that we have mentioned because it might bleed arterial blood. But bandage it with something astringent to make the area firm, then treat it with the rest of the treatment until it heals.
It is necessary to extract blood from every person according to his strength and what appears of the dominant color of the blood. For, if the blood is black, let it out until it turns red, and similarly, if you see it thick, let it out until it thins, and likewise, if it is sharp until its sharpness is gone.
It is necessary for whoever is full-bodied and strong and needs to remove blood all at once to widen the phlebotomy of the vein and let the lancet be wide. And whoever is weak, then the opposite of that. It is best to extract it in rounds and to have the hole narrow.
The best way to perform phlebotomy is obliquely, angled and with an incision, not a stab.
This type of phlebotomy is safe from bleeding and from cutting a nerve, and it is better and safer than horizontal or vertical phlebotomy.
Whoever usually faints during phlebotomy, it is necessary to feed him before the phlebotomy some bread soaked in sour pomegranate juice or oxymel if he is hot-tempered, and let his blood out in three or four rounds. If he has a cold temperament, he should take before the phlebotomy bread soaked in a drink of water-mint or in honey drink sweetened with spices or in basil-flavored drink.
If fainting occurs during phlebotomy, and its cause is the loss of a large amount of blood, he should be given meat broth and a thin basil drink. He should use rose water perfume and have his chest gargled with it, and all other things we have mentioned in the section on fainting caused by bloodletting.
As for whoever wants to relax his arm and let his blood flow again, it is necessary for someone whose phlebotomy was for excessive bloodletting and whose strength is weak, to release blood little by little, according to his strength, on consecutive days.
As for whoever wants to relax his arm and let his blood flow again, and whose body is strong, let him do so seven or nine hours after his first phlebotomy.
As for whoever wants to draw blood from his body to the opposite side to which it has flowed, he should be treated on the second or third day.
As for whoever has a lot of blood in his body that has become hot and acute and has caused fever, it is necessary to remove the blood from him all at once and take out a large amount of it and widen the opening until fainting occurs, after having examined all the conditions of phlebotomy, and to place your hand on his pulse when the blood is flowing so that death does not occur instead of fainting. This happens often if the phlebotomist is ignorant and negligent.
It is not necessary, if you want to loosen the arm and release the blood again, and the mouth of the vein has closed and the blood flow is difficult, to press on it hard or twist with force because that is very bad. Rather, either leave it until you perform phlebotomy again, or remove with the blade of the lancet what has clotted from the blood at the mouth of the vein, or apply to it some salt that has been dissolved in water, or apply some theriac or scammony, and press gently until the blood comes out.
If the vein is swollen, leave it alone and do not touch it until the swelling subsides.
If there is a need to release blood again, it is unavoidable; then either bleed him above that area, or bleed him in the other arm or in the other vein.
As for phlebotomy of the median cubital vein, it is phlebotomized as a substitute for the median and the basilic veins if they are not found or are hidden, for it is composed of the two.
The method of its phlebotomy is that the patient puts his hand in hot water until the forearm becomes red and the vein appears clearly, then you tie it above it with the bandage slightly, moderately tight, then you phlebotomize the vein obliquely, a little, not horizontally or vertically, and let the opening be wide and let your phlebotomy be a little above the wrist joint.
If blood flow is difficult, put the hand back into the container with hot water and let the blood flow into the water until your need is met. If you are in the summer days, you might not need to put the hand back into the water. Mostly, flowing of the blood into hot water is practiced during winter.
Phlebotomy of this vein is safer than all veins, because there is no pulsating vein or nerve beneath it.
As for phlebotomy of the cephalic vein of the right hand, it is beneficial for liver ailments, and the method of its phlebotomy is to tie the wrist with a bandage or with your hand after putting it in hot water until the vein swells and becomes very clear to the touch, then you phlebotomize it slightly obliquely, and even if you cut it completely, it will not harm it at all. Be careful not to go deep with your lancet because the nerve of the fingers is beneath it and the area is devoid of flesh.
Then put the hand back into the hot water and let the blood flow in it. If you do not return it to the hot water, the blood will clot at the mouth of the vein and stop flowing. Once you have removed the required amount of blood, put some fat and salt on the vein so that it does not heal quickly. The same applies to every narrow branch.
As for the benefit of phlebotomizing it from the left hand, it is beneficial for spleen ailments, and similarly you do in its phlebotomy as you did with the second one, the same way.
As for the phlebotomy of the saphenous vein, its benefit is for diseases in the lower body such as uterine ailments, menstrual retention, kidney diseases, chronic ulcers of the thighs and legs, and similar diseases.
The method of its phlebotomy is to put his leg in hot water and massage it until the veins flow, then tie it above the ankle joint. The vein is located at the heel, visible towards the big toe, and it branches out into many branches on the leg. So, phlebotomize it at its widest branch, or at the heel at its confluence. This is best and safest.
If you phlebotomize it on the surface of the leg, be careful of the nerves underneath on the surface of the leg, and make your phlebotomy oblique, as if you intend to cut it, and the lancet should be sharp.
If the blood flow is difficult, let him put his leg back in the hot water and leave the blood to flow until it drains.
If the phlebotomist misses the vein with the phlebotomy in the first round, let him repeat the phlebotomy slightly above it, for the area is safe and there is no fear of a problem if you are careful of the nerve as we said. And similarly you do with the saphenous vein of the other leg in the same way.
As for the sciatic vein, its place as we said is at the heel of the lateral side, and the benefit of its phlebotomy is for hip pain if it is due to hot blood. The method of its phlebotomy is to have the patient enter the bath quickly and tie his leg from the hip to four fingers above the heel with a thin, long bandage, because it does not appear otherwise.
When it appears, phlebotomize it in any case you can, either obliquely, which is better, or sever it completely or make an incision, because its place is safe.
It is very hidden in most people. If you do not find it and it does not appear to the touch at all, phlebotomize some of its branches, which are those that appear on the back of the foot towards the little and ring fingers. Beware of the nerves, and let out the amount of blood you want, then loosen the bandage and put cotton on the place of phlebotomy and bandage the area, for it heals quickly.
