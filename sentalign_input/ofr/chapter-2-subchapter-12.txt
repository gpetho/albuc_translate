The procedure is such that you take a fine needle, and thread a soft and fine silk thread through it;
then bring the ends together and knot them both subtly, and the length of the threads should be one palm long;
then arrange in the instrument another short, fine silk thread, and knot the ends of the thread;
then have the patient put their head in your lap;
and be near the sun so that the work is illuminated, for it is a subtle and delicate task, then insert the needle with the instrument at the root of the hair next to it, and pierce it through the caruncle quickly until you pull it out over the natural hair;
then pull the hair up to the instrument, and insert that hair into the instrument, whether there is one or two or three or more;
then pull your hand so that the hair comes out with the instrument in the caruncle along with the natural hair.
And if the instrument is pulled and the hair does not come out with it, then you will pull the instrument from below with the thread that you have arranged there, until the instrument comes out of the hole above and you see it with the vision of your eye;
then you will pull the instrument and the thread, and close the eye and leave it closed for two or three days, until the hair is burned in its place and the flesh grows over it;
and if the hair is short, add a long natural hair, and lift it with the one where you leave it, until it is lengthened and then remove it.
