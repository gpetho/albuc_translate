of the stone
We have already spoken, in the section on types of stones, and their extraction, along with medications;
and have explained the difference between the stone generated in the kidneys, and all the signs, and in which stone one should operate surgically;
and in the bladder, and in the penis;
and I will tell you plainly and briefly.
I say that the stone which is generated in the bladder occurs more often in children, and it is a sign that the liquid coming from the bladder resembles water in its clarity; 
and sand appears in it, and the patient scratches his penis, and it hangs down often, and then hardens;
and he has a lot of these discharges from the bladder;
and the healing of children is easy until they are four years old, and is very difficult in old men, and is moderate in young men, for those who are between youth and old age;
and the cure is easier for those who have large stones than for those who have small ones.
And when we come to the treatment, it is first necessary to cleanse the patient with an enema, to remove all the feces that are in the intestines.
For it sometimes hinders the search for the stone.
Then take the patient by the feet, and shake him and move him downward, so that the stone descends to the bottom of the bladder, and sometimes jumps up from the high place;
then have him sit prepared between your hands, and his hands should be under his thighs, so that the bladder is completely inclined downwards;
then search for it and touch it inside;
if you feel the stone in the space, then hurry now to cut on the stone.
And if it does not fall at the touch at all, wet your index finger with oil, of the left hand, if the patient is a child, or your middle finger if the patient is a fully grown youth;
and put it in his anus, and search for the stone, and when you feel it with your finger, guide it to the neck of the bladder;
then press down with your finger, and push it outside where you intend to cut.
And instruct the assistant to press the bladder with his hand, and tell him to lift the testicles upwards with his right hand, and with his left hand to pull back the skin which is beneath the testicles in the area where one makes the incision;
then place there the cutting spatula, of which this is the form:
And cut between that which is between the testicles and the anus, not in the middle but to the side of the left buttock;
and be directly over the stone, and keep your fingers always in the anus, and make the incision transverse so that it is wide on the outside, and narrow within, according to the size of the stone, not too large;
perhaps press it with the finger that is in the anus, so that it may leap out without difficulty;
and know that there are some stones with angles and edges:
thus it is difficult to extract;
and there are some that are smooth, resembling an acorn, and round, whose extraction is easy.
In the case of those that have angles and edges, make the incision larger;
and if it does not jump out, you must then tighten the forceps that are like a file at the end, to firmly grasp the stone so that it does not escape;
or you insert underneath it a subtle instrument curved at the end;
and if you cannot manipulate it thus, widen the opening a little, and if the blood flows, staunch it with vitriol;
and if there is more than one stone, first push the largest to the neck of the bladder, then cut down on it, then pull it out, and the smaller ones afterward if there are several.
And if it is very large, it must be sawn, and a larger incision made.
For two things happen to the patient:
either he dies, or the urine constantly flows from there so the area cannot heal;
but nevertheless strive to pull it out, or break it up with forceps, until you remove it piece by piece;
and when you have completed your work, fill the wound with frankincense and aloe and dragon's blood, and bind it, and put over it a cloth moistened with oil and wine, or with oil and rose water and cold water, to soothe the hot abscess;
then turn the patient onto his back, and do not loosen the bandage until the third day.
And when you untie it, wash the area very well with oil and water, then treat it with diachylon ointment and basilicon ointment, until it is healed.
And if hot abscesses come in the wound and corrosion, and clotting of blood in the bladder, and because of this the urine is retained, which is recognized in such a way that blood comes with the urine:
then put your finger in the wound, and extract that blood, for if it remains there, it will corrode the bladder, and rot it;
then wash the wound with water and vinegar and salt, and help him in all the ways you know, until he is healed;
and it is necessary that every time you treat him, that you tie his two thighs together, and apply the medicines on the area.
And if the stone is small, and it is in the urethra, and stuck there, and the urine cannot come out;
if you treat it with what I mentioned before, that you cut him many times, one is excused from cutting due to this treatment.
I have already proven this.
Take an iron drill of this shape and let it be three-sided, stuck in a firebrand:
then take a thread and tie it around the penis below the stone, so that it cannot go back into the bladder;
then insert the drill into the penis lightly, until it reaches the stone;
and turn the drill with your hand into the stone little by little, until you can pierce the stone on the other side;
then the urine will come immediately, then press your hand on what remains of the stone that is inside the penis.
It is immediately broken, and comes out with the urine, and the patient is healed;
and if you cannot do this for any reason that prevents it, then tie one thread below the stone and another above, then cut the penis at the location of the stone between the two threads, then pull it out, and untie the thread, and clean the congealed blood that is in the wound;
and treat it until it is healed.
