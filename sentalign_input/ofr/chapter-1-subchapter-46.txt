from old pain in any limb
When pain arises in a limb, either from a fall or a blow, and this pain lasts a long time, and medical treatment is ineffective, then it must be cauterized with a cautery called "points," and the cautery should be applied according to the length of the limb and its size and weakness and its strength and its location with regard to twisting and its pain.
if he is healed from the first cautery, that is good;
if not, repeat another cautery over that one, for such is the custom that it should move to the nearest limb, therefore you must perform the cauteries until the patient is healed.
