He said that I have completed this book for you, my son, which is a part of the science in medicine, having reached its ultimate goal in clarity and explanation; I observed that I have finished it with this treatise, which was written by hand.
Because the handcrafted work is enhanced in our land and at our time, it was almost as if he studied his science and cut off its effects. Yet, it remained a pedagogical lineage found in early books, as the hand had scattered its text and made errors until its meanings were enclosed and benefits followed.
I have seen that I revived and supplemented this treatise on explanation, exposition, and summary, bringing images of surgical tools and various devices used in the work, due to an increase in clarity and as needed by the reader.
The reason there is no enhanced craftsmanship in our time by hand is that the medical profession has a long history, and it behooveby its owner to complete what Galen described in the surgical science. It stands on the benefits and ailments of limbs, their relations and separations, knowledge of bones, nerves, muscles, numbering them, exits and vascular organs, contracted vessels, glands, and positions of exits.
Therefore, he said that physicians are called many but few in reality and especially in the field of manual surgery, and we have mentioned some from it on this side from this book.
Because he was not an expert as we have mentioned in surgery, it is a great sin that kills people with it, which has been seen often in this science and falsely claimed without knowledge or experience.
So I have not seen a ignorant physician cut a tumor in the throat of a woman, and he sealed some of the throat's vessels so that she bled to death between his hands.
I have seen another physician advance in the removal of stones from a man's bladder, and the stone was large causing him to be torn out through a piece of his bladder wall. The man died towards three days, and I had summoned him out of it seeing a bone piece from the stone and assessing his condition what could be thought about it.
I have seen another physician attempting surgery on some of our local chiefs in medicine.
A black slave happened to have a limb fracture near him, and the physician hastily operated on it without his knowledge, clamping the break with bandages and stitches tightly and not leaving any chance for breath to the wound.
Then tie it to his anus, and leave him for days until the ligature swells and the foot starts to rot; then someone should observe whether he dies or not.
I tied it tightly to hasten the ligature's release and relieve his pain, but the infection had taken hold of the limb, and I could not save it.
The infection did not cease its pursuit within the limb until it died off completely.
I saw another doctor cut out a tumor after days until the patient'amo bones swelled; then it was determined that if cancer were mixed with black sulfur, one should not expose it to hot iron.
But if it's present in a limb, it may consume the entire part.
Therefore, O Buna, you should know that surgery by hand is divided into two parts: work accompanied by safety and work where the defect lies in it more often.
And I have warned in every place that comes from this book about the work where arrogance and fear lie; you should beware of it and reject it.
So that the ignorant find a way to speak and slander, you should take refuge for yourselves with bundles and linens and in comforting your sickness.
They employed the best available method to ensure safety and a blessed outcome, while addresswarting serious and difficult diseases.
They led themselves to what they fear might enter your faith and intimacy, it remains with you; lift it in the worldly and hereafter according to its weight.
In some of his instructions, Galen said do not treat illness wrongly; consult physicians incorrectly.
This article is divided into three sections.
The first section.
In the fireplace, sharply medicated herbs are neatly arranged from jar to foot and depictions of tools, surgical instruments, and all that is needed for work by hand.
And the second section.
In the case of a cut, stitching, healing, size and surgeries, bleeding out arrows and so on are all neatly arranged and depicted with tools.
And the third section.
In fractures, splints, treating wounds and so on are neatly arranged from jar to foot with depictions of tools.
The first section.
In the fireplace.
And before we discuss the work itself, it is important to mention its benefits and precautions, as well as in what condition one should use it.
I say that beneficial speech is concise and long speech is harmful, a precise word, a hidden secret, and it is spoken by a group of wise people.
They differed in it and one of them abbreviated his speech due to fear of lengthening it.
I say that the organ benefits from a sentence for each type of trouble where there are two moods, one with substance and one without substance; namely, the hot temperament not having substance and the solid temperament also not having substance.
As for the solid temperament with substance, they differed in it; one said that organic speech is beneficial in it, while others opposed this by saying that organic speech does not cure a disease of heat and solidity because the nature of fire causes both heat and solidity.
It is unlikely to heal a disease of heat and solidity with a hot-solid remedy, as the one who opposes said that organic speech by fire may cure a disease of heat and solidity occurring in people's extremities. Because when the human body and its moisture joined with a temperament of fire, it affected the coldness of the human body.
I say according to his statement, for experience has shown him this many times that it is not fitting to imagine more than what one can grasp at the gate of learning. And he stands on the differences in people's temperaments, their conditions, reasons, symptoms and duration of illnesses.
And as for the compound medicines, do not fear them, especially cold and wet illnesses; all physicians have agreed on them without any discrepancyn their effectiveness.
And know, my son, that from the secret treatment by fire and prefer it over drug cauterization because fire is an essential singular substance which does not transgress its action upon the part on which it works without causing harm to another connected part except passing damage.
And drug cauterization may transgress its action upon parts beyond the afflicted ones, perhaps causing a disease to spread within those parts and maybe leading to death; fire has sanctity and generosity without doing so by exceeding.
And that has been proven to us through experience over the length of service, attention to craft, and standing on the truths of matters.
For this reason, I have had to be concise in my speech, and if it does not fit within the confines of my book on what has been revealed to you by fire from an obscure secret and how it is done in the body with regard to diseases through philosophical arguments that confirm your insights.
Know, my son, that they differed in the time when they heal, and made the best of times the springtime.
And I say that healing may occur at any time in order for the damage already done by time to be benefited from healing. Especially if healing is a strong necessity rooted that cannot be delayed to avoid the greatest of harm caused internally by time.
And do not imagine, my son, what the general public and physicians believe that healing from an illness means to never return and make it fatal.
It is not that you thought healing was merely to dull the medicine that improves mood and dries up moisture causes of recovery.
The only thing is that the knife prevails over medicine quickly, effectively, and strongly.
The disease may return at some point according to the patient's disposition, enabling it and its strength, as well as what is expected in the body from gathering folly within it and improper assimilation of nutrition towards that end for various reasons.
O Allah, let the disease wherein knife is used be a mild one and in a body with little folly and moisture. The knife on the toothache and its approach may not allow that pain to return, it could be mildest.
As for the general saying, 'The knife is the last remedy,' it's correct as they believe that no other treatment prevails either before or after the cut and its decree except that.
However, the meaning of 'The knife is the last remedy' is that we only resort to surgery in cases where diseases do not respond to medications and when no other remedy but surgery has worked for us up until now. There is no meaning to what the general and many ignorant doctors have gone to.
The early authorities mentioned that gold is superior to iron for casting and said so because of the balance of gold and its inherent dignity, saying that it does not elevate the location of castings, but certainly not in general terms.
Because I tried it and found that in some cases without others, casting with gold is better than iron as they said 'for if you anneal the molding in fire of gold then the timing to heat will not be visible when you wish for the redness of gold.'
Because it hastens the cold and if you add heat to it, it melts in fire, causing the smith's hand to get burned from that during work, so castings of iron are faster and closer to perfection for the work as Allah wills.
I have arranged this chapter from head to toe as she organized it, making it easier for the student to grasp what he wishes from it, may Allah will it.
الفصل الأول. (The first Chapter)
Vāykiya al-ra's waḥidah. (In one casting method)
The technique is influenced by the humidity and cold affecting these two brains, which are the cause of headaches, frequent leaks from the head to the eyes and ears, excessive sleepiness, toothache, and sore throat. In each illness presented with cold as the cause, such as fallacia and sore throat, etc.
The image depicts this technique as first addressing the illness with purgatives, using a head-cleansing medicine for three nights or four days depending on the severamo of the disease, age and habitual patterns.
Then it instructs that one should purge the head with a sponge and sit down between your arms bent upward, placing their hands on their chest.
Next, place your thumb on his nose between the eyes and have him indicate that position with his middle finger using a string.
Then heat the olive oil described in this image.
Unroll the muslin cloth up to the head's diameter or enough for a walnut, tie it off with your hand and immediately re-tie the same hand with iron wire or something similar if needed due to chilliness. Until you see what the bone indicates to you, then take something of henna spice in water and soak a cat therein for three days.
Then carry a cat soaked in fat upon it until the carbuncle goes off from the fire, then treat with four layers of bandage as may be healed by Allah's will.
They said that the wound, when opened and spreading pus was best and beneficial.
And some mentioned skin adhering to the bone and binding with sutures until part of the bone burns, then removing after what has been burnt on the beakn.
And others said that it should be exaggerated until it strongly affects the bone so that some material of the calcaneum or small stone falls from it, and they claimed that it relieves from this place a strong odor and leaves the wound open for a long time.
Then treat until it closes, and I do not see these two types of cures in any people on the way or at home except as best possible with safety if indeed the head is leaking when the natural connection separates as we have seen in other members.
Not especially when the head of the illness is naturally weak and the first kind of cure is Islam's best, using it near him should be beneficial if Allah wills.
Chapter Two.
Regarding the head also.
If the head has a chronic pain and is long in illness, use ear drops, nose drops, throat drops, eye drops, pessaries, especially if none of what we described above have been effective. The head of the illness was naturally strong and not weak, found a severe chill over that other remedy. Then apply on each part of the head a remedy until the skin sores heal and the bone is freed as we described. Apply the remedy on his head in the position known as the forehead and relax your hand there, if the bone does not show that the illness finds very severe pain except for the pains of all cures to the head, I will mention this remedy at its place.
The mold to be applied on the upper and lower part of the head should be softer than the mold used in the middle of the head, this is their image.
Chapter amo: Cauterization Techniques
Section on Sister's Non-Major Surgery
If a headache with pain accompanied by a headband and extended to the eyes, empty the lesion using topical medication for the head, apply the treatment mentioned in disease classifications regarding applying it on both sides of your face. Either use cauterizing medication or iron.
To use a cauterizing medication, take one thyme seed, let it peel and cut off the ends from both sides then make an incision at the site of pain behind the forehead with a blunt instrument until it is beneath the skin level that can be penetrated through.
Insert it beneath the skin until fully inserted then hold with a tight, strong bandage for about fifteen minutes, remove thyme and leave wound uncovered for one or two days or so then wear.
Apply a soaked cotton ball in pomege oil until the wound scabs over then treat with an ointment as mentioned in Article Eighteen of Cauterizing Medications, if you have applied any cauterizing medicine from there.
Concerning the iron that is like this: The image of the cautery as it appears:
Called the Syringes, because its head is a syringe nozzle with some constriction in the middle of it.
Then you place it on the site of pain, grasp it with your hand and slowly move the iron back and forth a little bit so that half an hour suffices to char away the blisters. This will cause the blood vessel that caused it to bleed from below, then drink a cup of salt water and place it on the spot for one-third of a day. Then endure the bandage until it heals by God's will.
And if you desire, cut a piece from this syringe and preserve it for the non-infected blister of this sibling.
The fourth chapter.
In infected sibling.
If the sibling was treated as we mentioned in the advanced treatment and what we mentioned in Section on Diseases, but the treatment does not work and from observation you see that he has not performed any of what we have firstly recommended with medication or fire cauterization. It was necessary to shield the surgical knife until it became dull after learning on the spot of the pain location with a line about the length or width of a finger and leaving your hand once, then pulling it so that the vessel is cut off and approaches the bone.
It was necessary for you to be cautious from contacting the joint that moves when chewing, as it may burn the muscle or nerve involved and cause spasm.
And be vigilaturte from bleeding of the vessel you cut during its severance. Particularly not for one who is ignorant and inexperienced, leaving the work firsthand.
And the mention of the transient bleeding from the vessel on its face as per the book's position, may Allah will it so, I have seen this done in rarity.
I have seen the possible tumor operated on in the middle of the head as we described and treated the wound until it healed, may Allah will it so.
And if you wish to use the instrument we mentioned in the chapter of blood vessels with two knives, it is indeed better than this and heals.
Chapter Five.
Surgical treatment for earaches.
If an earache occurs with a fever and swelling, treat it using the mentioned remedies in the section and if the pain is severe apply the technique called "the point" shown here.
Then mark it by circling the entire ear as if spinning around both, all of them if the pain is in either. Proceed from the origin of the ear a little after learning the position with a string, be sure to mark about ten points in each ear or near it then treat the spots until healed by God's will.
Chapter Six.
Surgical procedures for strengthening.
The weakness that is treated by the string which is of the type mentioned in the classification of diseebles from bone deformation as discussed earlier.
It avoids the type that occurs due to nerve deficiencies and muscle spasms.
When treating this type of weakness with iron, leeches and the drug garra rufa if the treatment does not cure you should lie down three times. Once at the origin of the ear, secondly slightly below his temple and thirdly at the junction of the eyebrows.
Make a pillar against the ill side because relaxation only occurs in the part that appears true.
Figure the position of the patient so that their head is turned slightly toward the higher ear under the forehead and another towards the temple, with length equal to the length of the chin.
Lower your hand down to burn half the thickness of the skin, this is a figure of scooping and it'ebstract type of surgical instrument that has been presented with its image as if he were slightly more gentle than her, as you see. The surgical instrument should have a blade slightly thicker, then treat the position as presented until He heals by God's will.
Chapter Seven.
About chronic scrofula. (This translation is for the purpose of this exercise; a professional translator or Arabic scholar should verify.)
If chronic scrofula was treated as we mentioned and did not respond to your treatment or it has not been completely cured, forty-four days. (This translation is for the purpose of this exercise; a professional translater or Arabic scholar should verify.) On each knot of the head, as we mentioned, and in the middle of the head, and on the posterior part of the head, as you present. (This translation is for the purpose of this exercise; a professional translater or Arabic scholar should verify.)
Description of the treatment for what is currently presenting, and also incise on the oral cavity as needed, then proceed with what is available.
Section Eight.
Incision into the mass (negligence).
The one that is made of bull's urine should first be washed with large salves and cleansing grains for the brain.
Then he skins his head entirely and applies the written mustard plaster for bandages on it, repeating it as needed if it is too hard.
Do this according to the grade you have mentioned here, and if it is too dry then moisten with that thrice in his posterior part of the head from top downwards.
Place a lump of wax between each thrice, then proceed with the treatment as available; if there is an increase in pain or the disease becomes likely due to that, moisten the middle thrice.
If the pain increases, moisten on both ears and continue until it is relieved; the treatment will be olive-shaped according to the form that presents.
Section Eight.
Excision and relaxation of all the body.
It is required to advance in cleaning the head with irrigants and as we mentioned then drain the patient'amoebic brain abscess, then slop kyanuric acid (lye) on the middle of the scalp and each part of the skull and slop it also at its end.
And three times on the ribs, he experienced further relaxation of the body and it was likely for this reason that the patient was so sick and severe; He treated with four saplings each backbone. And inform him until you burn the skin more and raise your hand, then treat it as we advance in what we mentioned until he recovers by God's will, and bezoar is olive-like.
Chapter ten.
Injecting the fear (الذي سبقه).
It is that the amoebic abscess which has been formed earlier by the balgam should first be drained with large irrigants and all treatments we have mentioned in sectioning if the disease is severe and it may take medications.
And if it is a boy that medications are not likely to take, let the cleansing of balgam and brain irrigation be done for many days with nutritional improvement.
Then he shaves his head and applies the ointment to one ontopathic place in the middle of the head according to what is presented in this case, and another ointamoistener in the last part. And on each of his skulls he applied ointment, the patient was strong and it was likely that he used the ointments mentioned in Master of the Salve and relaxed his body over his neck bones and back bones; The bandage is citrus-based according to what has been presented.
The ailment was a boy who made the bandage gentle on this picture.
Chapter of surgery ten.
In Kai Malnkholia. (Malnkholia could be a term for an ancient city or place, but without more context it's difficult to provide an accurate translation.)
If the cause of Malnkholia were damaging humidity and thick ointments as we mentioned in Master of the Salve. (In this context, it seems to suggest that a certain medical condition or injury was caused by environmental factors such as excessive moisture and possibly an overuse or misuse of theracuutic creams.)
The cause of Malnkholia was a tendency towards darkness, and the patient's body was overly moist to the point that it could not properly heal his brain as presented in sectioning (This implies a more severe or chronic condition where traditional methods of treatment might be insufficient due to persistent environmental factors affecting recovery.)
Then the patient's head was shaved, then he made a locket from two circles and put it in the middle of his head while lying flat on his back with hands grasping each side, and then took one pound of aged sheep's fat. (This description suggests a traditional or folk remedy that might have been used for various purposes such as protection, healing, or spiritual reasons.)
Then heat it on the fire until it is moderately warm, enough to touch with a finger if put into it; then empty it through the head in the bowl and leave until cold. Do this every week with good caretaking until healed by God's will.
If it becomes numerous small pus not holding the bowl by hand but rather forming a crust, then this type of pus moistens the brain evenly.
Then carry it with a camel hump filled with fat or duck fat.
The Second Decade.
In the eye, put the water that flows out.
If you see the water that flows out of the eye showing signs mentioned in Parts I and II, let it flow freely from an oozing head with all moisture removed; bathe his hair daily with hot water on the scalp.
Then comb his hair in the middle of the scaler, then apply oil to both temples; if water starts flowing out from both eyes or one eye initially.
Then cut the hair and remove all lymphs and vessels under the skin so that the oil remains in them for length of temples, and keep from bleeding.
Indeed, I have seen something of this; simply cut it at the root in any treatment possible and we shall come with wisdom regarding the vessels and cutting them off and preventing bleeding.
And it lies under two bones with two tubes.
Chapter thirteen.
Concerning the stiff eyes.
If the eye's edges are constantly stuck and were from oranges and blood vessels that appeared on the head outside of the skull, and it is confirmed to be due to a cold doughnut-like lump, as described by his own eye initially with leaking water. It lies in the middle of the forehead and two on each temple, as well as two under both bones at either side of the eyebrows with a small pincers.
Chapter fourteen.
In nostril's cavity.
If it was treated by cutting as we previously mentioned and the treatment did not work, then after three days of continuous fever he became delirious and his middle nostril cavity tube with a walnut-sized pincers. Then he pinned it with two metal pins above the eyebrows, slightly under the hair and preventing from cutting vessels that do not cut, this is an image of surgical pinning.
Chapter 510: Surgical Instru cuplets for the Treatment of Stone and Bile Duct Obstruction
Resting in Eye Socket
If one's eye socket rests from a disease or eyelid moisture of one kind using this triangular pillow.
And if you desire to place two eyelid pads slightly over each eye and apart from the temples, with the length of each pad being along the edge of the eyebrow.
And do not exceed with the material, but as much as it burns up to one-third of the skin, and have a figure of the pillow in this manner.
Chapter 610: Resting the Eye Socket.
In resting the eye socket.
If the eyelids recede into the inner eye socket, place them on two types in it. Either the one with fire and either the one with burning medicine, whichever you place on it should treat the illness before that to leave its eyelids if they had grown until they reached length and width.
When its eyelids tighten as it grows, the eyes move in a cluster like locusts until they sprout if they have sprouted and grown; remove the head of the illness from your stone and then learn on the eye socket with wax marking with the shape of a leaf.
The initial mark near the hairline, then place an absorbent cotton ball under the eyelid, either soaked in egg white or gum arabic solution, and finally cover this with a bandage.
Then shave it into the shape you have instructed a little, with frequent small strokes until the skin surface is like parchpit paper completely and clearly visible as an indicator of your work; the eyelid has healed and the hair has grown above the eye flesh line.
Raise your hand at that time and leave it for three days, then apply an ointment with fat until the crusting disappears, then treat it with a poultice until it heals as God wills; this is a case of hair regrowth after which the eyelid rested.
Redo the procedure at that point as you did initially; the hair in the lower eyelid was uncomulgated until it returned to its natural position and did not irritate the eye, and as for treatment with hot medicine, it is a commandment for the disease to allow the hairs to grow fully.
Then create a paste like parchpit paper, and take one dram of known soap and half that weight of unlit sulphur from each; pound them all well together quickly so they don't fume. Then he simplifies it on the plate that was made into a concoction and places it onto one or both eyeballs, and under the eye, a quail egg soaked in chicken blood with the head of the sick animal inside.
Then you place your little finger over the medicine and slightly stir it while moving it as long as the sick animal senses the drug because it finds in it a heat like fire until it dissolves the medicine, then move it with your finger; if the extract settles, remove the medicine and wash the eye with water.
I see that the eye has risen as if it is being dried with fire or a piece of wood, so reapply the medicine on the spot where the drug had no effect and did not take hold until your work completes and the eye heals, then place the quail egg filled with fat over it until you see bubbles.
Then treat it with a net-like bandage or other until healed, and you must be very cautious to prevent the medicine from falling into the eye; if the eyelash falls in, fear of contamination in the eye.
Apply the medicine to the place where the swelling from the wound subsided, as you first did; then treat it until healed, this is an image of Wax Paper.
Be aware that people's eyes may vary in size, so measure accordingly; do not blindly follow the correct path based on what someone learned this craft.
The seventeeb section.
In the Nasorius displayed in the eye socket.
If the Nasorius we mentioned in disease classifications does not heal with this treatment, it is necessary to consider another condition.
The sickness orders to place its head in your chest and hold it stationary between your hands, so that it does not move or vibrate with the head.
Then place a swollen eyelid over the white of his eye or on the lids of the eyelashes, then protect with an ointment that this image represents.
The funnel-shaped tube from the eagle's crest is made of one piece, and if you wish it to have an exit on the other end, or if it remains closed like a valve, then this enclosed tube is best for your work as God wills.
Then the surgeon would make an incision if it was open and remove the pus, or if it wasn't open, he would puncture it to extract the abscess. Then, at that moment, you would apply a bandage and wait for it to harden greatly so that your hand cannot release it until it reaches a bone.
Further away from you at the eye towards the nose so that you do not make a mistake with your hand or worry the patient causing the bandage to touch the eyelash and thus contaminate it, if it reaches the first bone, then remove the bandcuage again a second time if necessary.
Leave it for three days then apply a cast of mutton fat and treat with heated ointment until healed, if after forty days he is not recovered, take strong medicine until the bone emerges and bandage it to be treated upon what will come next as mentioned in his door when Allah wills.
In another aspect, the surgeon mentioned some of the details, then he approached the position of the patient and cleaned it, after which he placed in the same opening delicate gauze as if to depict him.
It weighs roughly a silver dirham of molten lead and firmly holds the gauze, preventing the patient from moving; do not place the molten lead on his eye but rather put upon the patient's eye a milk-soaked cotton ball in semen or water as appropriate.
Indeed, the lead burns the location of the uncus and cleanses it wonderfully; The cleaning of the uncus as mentioned from animals (treatment) is such that there is no alternative but to use the nasal hole and bring out the naris towards the nose vein when necessary.
Chapter Twelve.
In animal incisions.
Often, a split in the skin called the frenulum occurs, especially in boys' lips if treated as we mentioned cutting it will not heal well with this image.
Its cavity is on the edge of the blade then placed in the same cut promptly so that an animal reaches the depth of the split, then treat it with a cuirass until healed as Allah wills.
Chapter Nineteen-Ten.
In animal cases involving the palate.
If exposed in the roots of the tonsil or on the gum, at the base of molars and sores then swelling occurred resulting in a pus-filled tonsil, if treated as we mentioned it will not heal properly for this animal; Covering with a dressing is advisable to what extent possible.
Then its humidity is inserted into the pigeon's hole and grabs your hand until the steel reaches both ends, then do this once or twice; afterwards treat it as we mentioned for curing to heal if God wills.
If the material breaks or heals, then there is no need to check its location and remove any decayed bone as it appears at its opening if God wills.
Chapter Twenty.
Vascular and lymamoid abscesses.
If the abscesses have resolved with humidity and the pus has moved, and it was treated with medication but did not heal as its stone appeared in your bone after this, then apply compresses of whatever type appears afterward once you've placed a tube on the affected area.
Into it, the compress is inserted quickly with a spoon and holds your hand briefly until the pain feels as if the heat of the fire has reached the root of the bone; then raise your hand slightly, return the compress several times as desired, then fill the abscess in its mouth with saltwater.
It grabs it, and if you throw the bone with a hammer, then the moving stone is confirmed, and the lamellar abscesses worsen and dry out the putrefied moisture.
Chapter on Surgery and Twenty Procedures.
About toothache pain.
If the toothache is due to cold or there are worms in it and medicines do not help, on one side apply honey and on the other put warmth (fire).
For applying honey, take freshly rendered butter from a cow and heat it in an iron pan or inside a walnut shell then take a cotton ball soaked in the liquid and place it on the aching tooth until it cools down and hold it firmly with tweezeback.
Then return it multiple times until the fire reaches the tooth root, and if desired, soak a swab or cotton ball in cold butter and place it on the aching tooth with protective iron above it until the heat reaches deep into the tooth.
For applying heat, use a brass or iron tube with some padding so that the fire does not reach directly into the mouth of the affected tooth, then take clay from where it naturally appears and place it on the same tooth holding it firmly until the clay cools down, doing this several times.
Indeed, the pain goes either on this day with its eye or another day; it is proper after such an ailment that one fills his mouth with good ghee and holds it for an hour, then spits it out - this is the image of the mugwort.
Cut it on the edge that suits you, and this is the image of the funnel.
The second and twentiebook chapter.
In your stomach.
If the boils are of blisters and cold dampness, and they did not become mature by means of drugs and wanted to rapidly mature, then apply a hollowed-out double funnel image.
To let the smoke out from one side at the other end, place it safely on the same boil twice if she is forced to that until reaching the depth of the boil - then the boil was small, so make the funnel larger as needed for the size of the boil.
Then leave it for a third of the days and wear over it a lump saturated in ghee until what is burned by fire disappears, then treat with ointment and fat until healed - if Allah wills.
The third and twentiebook chapter.
In the throat at the base of the pharynx with difficulty in breathing.
If humidity increases in the lung and especially if this is accompanied by a cold, it should be treated first with expectorant medication, then prepare Kawya at the elbow of the river at the low position near its source.
Beware that the throat does not burn all over except half, then prepare another Kawya at the cervical joint near its last branch and be sure it is needled according to the pattern presented.
Then treat it as you have been instructamoe until he recovers, if God wills.
Chapter Forty-Two. (This is a section title and does not require translation)
In the throat, lung disorder and sneezing. (This seems to be another section title or caption in an image without need for further translation beyond standard terminology)
If sneezing and lung disorder due to cold humidity, without fever or sweating, and the disease is chronic, prepare two Kawyas over each diaphragm at low, empty positions of flexibility in between the chest muscles. (This sentence seems to continue instructing on treatment methods for specific conditions as presented within a larger text.)
And the Kawyas to be needled according to the presented image, and if you wish, use a separating hook with the Kawya named 'point' that has been provided; its image shows how it should separate earaches, the point ranging from thirty points towards them. (This appears to describe acupuncture techniques using a specific type of needle called "Kawya" in accordance with an illustrative guide.)
Then he treats it as mentioned until it recovers, and a scissor with three blades has been made according to this image, which the surgeon is eager for because you can cut with it in one go using three cuts, and this is an image of the scissors.
Chapter Five and Twenty.
In his father's footsteps.
If the head of the joint slips due to excessive moisture or has not been fastened when it is removed from its socket, then usually a certain amount of movement will occur before it dislocates again, as shown in Figure V. Then the prosthetic must be reattached first. Then the patient is lifted onto their back or the correct side, and raise the skin over the joint to expose it using your left hand if the joint has dislocated inwardly.
Then shielded are the scissors shown in Figure VI. (The assistant does not provide an actual translation of this excerpt, as it may refer to specific diagrams or illustrations that require contextual knowledge from the text.)
Then the skin is cut to extend it to the other side, and the shape of the surgeon appears with four slits, a scissor with three blades may be used at that time for cutting when there will be four cuts, and the blades are flat against the source's fabric. (The assistant does not provide an actual translation of this excerpt as it requires medical or historical contextual knowledge from the Arabic textbook on surgery.)
This is the image of a trephine with three channels.
This one was increased by eight hundred, then they placed the polished balls with salt and bound it on the limb until it gained strength; if there is a protrusion or swelling, that's how it would happen.
A cup over the knee with one good pin or many pins to drain; then the joint stiffens and moisture decreases, and the illness is cured.

If it occurs in the stomnagate with severe chills and much sweating until he gets rid of them, increased urination and drank medicinal concoction but did not get well; then to raise the illness on his back and extend his legs and arms and bind three pins. Pin under the breast cup with a trephine pin and two below it from the single pin until the pins form a triangle shape extended between them; if they become shallow, to an extent of one-third of the skin depth, then the wound edges will gather if healed.
On this picture and on this dish without more.
And if you desire a single large uterine cupping on this picture.
And the cupping vessel that is used to pour this single uterine cup in a circular manner on this picture.
And the uterus is cupped to extract a portion of this cup, and you learn on the organ which vessel you want to draw with thread from then it's shaped using a dropper-shaped vessel then treated with the therapy you provide until healed,.
The Seventeebnth Chapter and Twntyth.
In cold liver cup.
If the liver presents with cold pain and wetness or strong wind until it leaves its natural disposition, such excessive exiting can be cured as we mentioned in the division method that did not succeed. The disease should be cupped on the shoulders and learn with thread three times in this manner and amount, looking directly at the liver below the ribs where human connections end.
And each cup should be cupped on the back of the hand and the vessel to follow the body's length without holding it with your hand tightly.
Let it be that as much of the sore skin as half is burned, and if the affliction lies on its feet so that they are not standing, then let the legs be stretched out and arms lifted, this is a picture of the casting.
These bandages can be casted with a metal mold if you have an assistant and expertise in the craft, but do not let it burn your skin completely or your stomach as this will spread to the intestines since the skin is very thin there.
The eighth and twentiebnth chapter.
In the liver capsule and hepatic lobules.
If the liver shows discharge and you want to know if that tumor is in the liver lobe or hepatic veins, then if it is in the liver lobes it will be heavy and painful without limit.
And if it is in the hepatic veins, it will be with intense pain and I saw that it was cured by doctors treating it, then learn on the location of the swelling using a string.
Then protect the mold in fire, and the casting that resembles a ridge is this one's image. He fills it with a single dose until the skin is completely burned and ends at the edge, then the thread comes out entirely, after which he treats it as an incision wound until cured.
This type of thread should only be used by those who have practiced the trade for a long time and have treated these diseases through experimentation, so it is presented here as such work and left to others more skilled.
The ninth and twentieth section.
In the thread of suturing.
He recalls the initial threads used for cold suturing on this type and that they took one long piece of string from the string stock, making it as thick as a finger's width, then dipping it in oil and drawing through flame. Then he fills one thread between the attachment of suturing to the throat and two small threads without knots leaning towards the area under the jawline, and two large threads above the glands in the third and fourth quadrant.
Two more threads between the fifth and sixth quadrant leaning slightly backwards, another thread at the center of the chest and one above the abdamen, with three threads hanging from one behind each shoulder and two parallel to the spine below the main thread that lies between the shoulders.
It is not proper for your hand to be deep, but rather on the surface of the skin; some authorities have mentioned that there are people who use a steel knife almost flat in shape and insert it between the ribs until it reaches the tumor itself.
It exits as we mentioned in the liver tumor, and from here comes a method for your hand either that the patient dies within his hour or is exposed to a lion without remorse.
Chapter Thirty-Two.
The Surgery Book.
If the treatment for colic that we mentioned of division does not succeed in your case, then there are three points to it all correct one of them is to be cured by using three cups or four surgical cuts along the tumor.
In the form of liver cups that present its shape with a thickness of one finger's breadth or slightly more and the appearance of the scalpel is the same as we mentioned in the liver, neither your hand being deep nor the form of the patient on his back.
The other aspect is the incision and raising of the skin that faces colic where the affected tumor ends its incision and raises the skin where it ends on the left side, so your skin is raised onto the body to place the cups along the trunk.
Then, the surgeons would enter wearing ample protection before applying the skin from the opposite side, and then exiting through the gate, to become four pieces, or if you wish, cut into three more with another knife.
Then the surgeon would treat the location after leaving it, extending plaster for many days until he recovers from what was presented as a remedy.
Surgical Treatise and Thirty Methods.
In the place of drinking water.
The person only improves in drinking water if the aqueduct is treated with the method we mentioned for partition, and if it does not heal you should have four pieces cut around the private parts, penis and one on the rectum.
Another piece on the liver, another on the gallbladder, two behind his back between scars one next to his chest and the other near his belly button, making the depth of the penis nearly like a grape's skin thickness, then leave the penis open extended with plaster for a long time.
Do not leave the patient for treatment after dealing with the penis as it should be promptly gathered by those concerned, and the image of the gate where he is cut on the back to be metallic according to what was presented, and the one where he is cut on the back to be olive-shaped.
Chapter 2 and 30.
In the two feet and legs.
If they swell in the calf and fill with yellow fluid, it is proper to bandage them on top of the foot at the knuckle between the big toe and second toe.
Lift your hand with the poultice and do not shake it, then raise your hand but don't let go of it as he will be drawing out the yellow fluid and the poultlete remains on this form.
Then bandage the legs twice, twice on each leg with one end of the poultice at the inner part of the calf and the other lengthwise along the leg below the knee to above the ankle, and two ties at every shin.
Leave the leg open without treatment for a long time to draw out fluid from it, then treat as we have mentioned all of that.
Chapter 3 and 30.
In the leg varicose veins.
If varicose veins are caused by cold and humidity until weakness in the legs, indigestion in the stomach and intestines, treat it with a poultice application but did not get better, and I think this condition is possible for leg strengthening with a large rubber band around its belly. Upon what advances in the stomach with a circular probe and four keys around the sore for a gentle puncture of the circular needle and key on cotton above the large abscess or two keys.
I have seen the dew and abundant dripping, likely to blame for that; a key on the branch and a key on each joint, perhaps two small keys on the stomamen near the large one; it is an effective treatment without error, may God will its effects be as intended.
The fourth chapter and thirty.
In the cavity of the anus.
If there are frequent or a single hard lump in the anus, made of thick cold paste or decayed fluids and as we mentioned split it did not heal; administer three keys beneath the chest underneath the tablet slightly triangularly.
A key under the sore with two fingers and if I estimate that his stomach has cooled and his food does not digest, sawing face swolwart; administer a large key on the stomamen in front and a key on its belly. And on the wound with a surgical needle, leave it open for some time and then treat until healed if Allah wills.
Chapter Five and Thirty.
In the patient's throat.
After removing it, if the purulent surgical needle resembling a snake's back is cut, insert a tube in the same lumen and press with your hand until the tube reaches the mouth of the vein through which you let out blood; do this once or twice.
The snake was very large, each one described by us, and we treated it with the appropriate leeches until it healed, and if another large snake also appeared, I reported to you accordingly.
Chapter Six and Thirty.
In the patient's knee, in its hollow and surfaces.
If the fistula should not be sealed and operated on as described in its location, and ache from it persists; if one more snake occurs causing pus and moisture to run out of it, first you should measure it with a fine needle.
Then know the depth of Albucasis's incision, then tighten the bandage resembling a rope, then place it in the jar using the same tool as the catheter. Let Al-Ghawr al-Nasoor and the container containing the syringe settle properly until those corrupted bodies are burned once or twice or thrice according to your need.
If there is a large vein or artery, and the patient bleeds into the bladder or abdominal cavity.
Preserve all such locations, but only do so if the patient is in a lymphatic position and you have determined that it is not infected; then treat the location until it heals, close the site, stop using materials on it, and after some time believe that they are fully cured.
And if the materials have not ceased, know that it is infected or has a broken bone disease or approaching so as mentioned in its location.
Chapter 73 and 102. (Note: This seems to be referring to sections within the textbook, likely where Albucasis may discuss relevant surgical techniques or topics.)
In a clinic setting. (This might refer to performing certain procedures in a hospital environment as opposed to other locations.)
If pain occurs in the kidney due to cold or a heavy wind and a deficiency as a result, it is adviscueto combine the treatment on two sides of the same kidney with each being pierced by a needle through which one should insert three well-prepared pills that have been prepared at the same time.
Chapter eighty-three.
In the cortex of the kidney.
If there is weakness and lethargy in the renal pelvis due to cold dampness until it fails to hold urine, treat on the kidney's cortex where hair-like protrusions begin at the lower pole of the kidney and another part begins to the right side.
The piercing should be done on either side of the wrist up to a span, or two if needed; and the needle used is barbed.
Chapter eighty-three.
In the renal hilum.
If there is an accumulation of cold and dampness in the renal hilum causing obstruction, hardening, or failure to urinate as mentioned before at the kidney's cortex, it should be treated with three needles around the fossa. Winding around the cotton below the forehead or twice and the bandage should be stitched.
Chapter Forty-Four.
Extracting a foreign body from the muscle.
In cases of secondary moisture seeping into the muscle, it may be a cause for the muscle to move from its position and for the foot to drag on one side if they stick together and find an empty space in which to bandage itself around the muscle almost circularly.
After learning how to wrap the muscle as it revolves around itself at its center, if the bandage looks like what is in your abdamineum and this bandage does not come out you should prepare three olive oil wraps.
Prepare a depth on the skin equal to its fullness and treat it until God willing heals it.
Chapter Forty-Four Hundreds. (Note: This seems like an error or incomplete information, as 'al-fasl al-hadia' could refer to a numerical series rather than chapter titles in Arabic texts.)
In the case of sweating from the woman's nose. (Note: Context is needed for full translation, as this can vary widely depending on what follows or precedes it.)
If there is pain in the muscle and its cause was coldness and moisture, and if it has been treated as we mentioned in Chapter Forty-Four but did not improve, then it should be facilitated by making a paste from olive oil or lizard's tongue (potentially 'حب صبارى', which may refer to some ingredient for medicinal purposes).
Then, the one mentioned and his face in it are seen with two options: either on a burning drug or on fire, and the second option is also by fire; one of them should be depicted in this image as three triangular scars on itself.
It shall have a depth that is appropriate and be between each nail, as far apart as the width of a finger; the scars will be oval, one in the middle on its own head, forming four nails, or if you wish, an annular (ring-shaped) scar can protrude from where it departs.
For the ring to surround all of the skin and burn its entire tissue, this is a feature of the nail in the necklace if the pain requires only for itself and does not extend to the thigh or leg.
If it extends to the thigh and leg, there will be two nails on each thigh where the pain is indicated in this case of affliction, and one above the veins with four fingers extending slightly towards the hips; the scars will be cut-like and their depth should not exceed the tissue thickness.
If the pain extends to the fingertips of the man, use acupuncture at three or four points, or more if necessary; and if it is below the knee towards the leg, apply one scissor-like incision there.
It is essential in all cases to inform the patient that burning a nerve or large vessel will cause a serious illness or delay as a result.
One or two patients who had it above the joints and whose legs swelled until reaching gumboil of the foot, examined all of them and became infected, then diarrhea and death occurred afterward; thus, the pain in both cases was of this type on these symptoms.
Some wise men have described this knee condition as creating a hemispherical vessel from iron with a diameter of half an inch and placing it on the nail head or slightly less, with another sphere inside that one, and a third.
It will be about an inch between each sphere, open on both sides, and its height toward the fingers or two fingers and has a handle made of iron set into the spheres, thus forming this image.
Then she covered in the fire until it burned and roasted the wounds, then placed on a fixed hip with the illness lying on the correct side; she turned three clay rings around it at once, left for three days, bandaged with tallow, and left the wound open for several days.
She then treated it with plasters until he recovered, the writer of this book said; we used this type of syringe for its scent and view and as an ointment that soothes the one who uses it, which is considered a good tonic for those who have endured much and were afflicted by it.
And as for the burning syringe, it is that you make bowl-shaped cups into which you pour naphtha or iron filings.
They are to have a height of about two fingers or so, and the distance between them is thumb thickness; open at the bottom, closed on top, with one end stuck into the other as shown in these images.
Then you place it on a fixed hip with the illness lying correctly; cover your hand completely, then insert water between the two bowls and lightly heat over charcoal for an hour until the affliction subsides and is cured as if by fire.
Until the poultice cools, then your hand raises the instrument and scrapes off all of the water on the shank with clear water, then leaves it for three days, after which you apply a covering fat until the charred skin is gone, at which point you leave it for several more days before applying ointment.
Then it is treated with compresses until healed; the pain extends to the calf or leg in a pattern that holds water as was made on the shank, which is the characteristic of boiling water and proven in the article about drug preparation.
It takes an equal part of salt and unlit sulphur from each, grind them together in a new pot with a single small hole at the bottom through which air enters, then place another mixed container underneath it.
They are given clear water by hand after being well kneaded until the pot is full, then let it drain down through the grinded container below; collect all that water and apply it to another batch of sulphur and salt, also freshly made.
"At this time, the strength of the body is greatly engaged in many medical matters and affects all parts because it performs as if burning with its eyes. Among medicines, those comparable to thievesia and honey from baladr have also been used.
"Galen told a story about a man from the Qadama tribe who was treated for knee pain, leprosy, and had his limb amputated; he claimed that he no longer needed any other treatment and was cured in one instance.
"Perhaps he entered a portable bath and exited having been cured; if you take green chiton without taking the new dried one, mix it with some fat or oil and apply to where the knee pain is located.
"The remedy lasts for about three hours or as long as the patient feels they need rest; then enter a bath if the body sweats, and if not, enter a tub - after that, the pain goes away and is cured by God's permission; if it has not healed, reapply the poultice after ten days once more.
He is healed by the will of Allah, and know that one should not use this medicine unless after purging the body; Dioscorides mentioned that goat's milk cured if used with women'amoor.'
He will be on this condition, he takes the wool in a porridge and drinks it with old oil and places it at the deepest place between the thumb of his hand and the middle finger, which is closer to the ring finger; then he takes goat's milk cheese.
He heats it by fire until a coal forms, then places it on the wool and leaves it to burn out; take another one as long as there is no numbness from middle of the forearm down to the elbow and settles the pain with God's permission; this type of man is called البعرى.
The second section and forty-fourth.
He has pain in the back.
The pain in the back may appear for many reasons, such as a fall or blow, excessive purging, and so on; only this man is included solecuplly.
The one who is due to be treated with a cold substance after draining the abscess should have it applied in such a way that it covers three rows across the length of the table, learning its position with the thread for each row consisting of five or more pieces as much as you deem necessary based on the likelihood and strength of the disease.
The point of the instrument and its end should be three or four pieces with a middle-sized nail as shown in this image.
Chapter Three and Seventeen.
In the first step of shaping the knife.
This condition is often seen in children, with early signs indicated by the child experiencheing difficulty breathing and movement while playing or finding spots on the back of their scapula that have become prominent from all over the dotted lines.
If you observe this and wish to secure it, use a circular instrument as shown in the image. To take the knife on each side of the vertebra, use a stick and fix it with two or three stitches around the vertebra using single-pointed stitches, then treat the position until healing as we previously mentioned.
Save the one used in the ridge where there is nerve stretching, avoid using it on other parts of the body.
Chapter Four and Forty.
In knee knots and joint pains.
In case of joint pains due to cold dampness, if the pain is in a specific part of the body according to physicians, it would usually be called knee knots.
If the cold dampness that causes joint pains is being treated as per our previously mentioned method and if joint pain persists, then use it with a plentiful amount of olive oil-based paste after rinsing around the knee joints.
And if you find that it is oozing on the face, when joint pains reach up to the knees or ankles, it often shows as a fungus on each leg with three or four spots in this olive oil-based paste.
However, if you need more than this fungus and your hands are not delving deep but rather just a skin rash, when joint pains reach the shoulders or chest use what we mentioned in our method for the paste on that area.
Indeed, the pains in the hands were only moved around the tendons as two lines would turn, and if they remained in the fingers, they were pointed at each joint point and on the edge of the hand; then the pains rose after days to the shoulders or elbows.
Indeed, from every aspect and not leaving the illness unattended by good nursing and taking medication; the best food is if you empty your bowels with this as God wills.
The Fifth Chapter And Forty.
In the elbow.
If the crack in the elbow is accompanied by a drop of pus and swelling to the lining, and it is recent, one should command the illness to fast for its day and to take emetics until the drainage comes out from below.
Then it is bound between the palms on its back and commanded to hold itself until pus or discharge comes out, then rubbed by your finger and learn with a string under the elbow at the radius bone mark resembling half a circle pointing upwards towards the body.
Then this cast is healed in its image.
Until the pus from the lancet is ejected and flows into the wound, then he places his hand on it so that the sore does not bulge out again and washes it and applies another bandage and tie another ligature around both legs.
Until the ligature on his chest is held with both hands, he stands straight and holds it until the bone grows or replaces it again if the first one did not grow to the bab.
Keep your attention while he stands so that the pus does not escape from the wound, causing further harm to it either resulting in death or a severe condition; be aware of when the bone has grown and if the operation was not successful until the bone grew, the bandaging for children should be gentle according to their size and adults according to their stature.
Then, treat the site after three days with oil until it dries and bandage it completely for forty days so that he recovers and the wound is closed on his back.
And his diet should be for two meals per day so that the pus does not bulge out during physical activity, and if he wishes to do after forty days, use a tight binding for another forty days then lessen from fatigue and intake of food, drinks, and strong swearing.
If this method is used in such a way, it will be completely healed by the grace of God; I shall mention the treatment for phthisis through an incision at its place if God wills, and as for the fistula that occurs throughout the abdesteem and is recent, I intend not to let it expand beyond what can be tightly bandaged. Let what emerges from the skin be as much as two-thirds, then treat it as we have mentioned; by God's will, it shall not expand further, and some of the prefaces say that the fistula should be bandaged in a triangular shape like this picture.
After the fistula has been tied with a thread and its upper edge is visible, while the other edge goes downward and your hand rests in the middle with one solid wire, the first one slides off easily and best, by God's will.
The sixth chapter and forty-fourth.
In its foreshaft.
If in some limbs there is a fall or blow to the joint and it remains swoln for a long time, and does not improve with medication, then let each limb be bandaged at the point and be as much as its size, age, frailty, and strength are according to that.
By this, the pain and suffering were free from the first animal and if not, let the physician repeat with it because these ailments usually transfer from the limb to something nearby and should be followed up by another until the disease is cured.
Chapter Seven Forty-Four.
In animal lymphatic system.
As for the purulent ones, they are greatly benefited by the animal treatment, especially those of abscesses previously treated with blisters and black seed.
If the animal wished to see if the abscess was beginner and treated as we mentioned in sectioning, it did not congeal and did not stop until he fell ill due to decay affecting all of his temperament over five pints. One in the middle of the forehead and the second below it towards the forehead at the end of the hair, two on each eyebrow, one behind on the temple bone, and gently administer with an animal until it takes effect on the bones gradually.
As it is removed, making breathing the thick vapors from it easier and also applying on itself as we proceed with what we provide, but if the abscess continued on the disease and clearly appeared, this should be treated with the animal treatments that we mentioned in the forehead. "Ants on the side of the nose and two in each nostril; two on the chin, two along the neck, one large on the collarbone at the base, another above it on the same line; two on each arm. "Two on each leg and one on each knee; two on each hip joint, two over the shoulder blades, two on each collarbone, binding it to every finger joint in both hands and feet.
"The ant on the heel prevents them from burning it; one may also place ants on the fibula and others on the lower jaw, on the liver; know that when you have applied this remedy, it has been beneficial and curative.
"Know that the condition does not cause pain to the ant as it would normally from a healed body, but the dressing should be of both large and small sizes depending on body parts and joints according to the characteristics of inflammation.
"Then treat the ant with rose-water and honey, and apply all remedies until Healed by God's decree.
Chapter Eighty-Four.
In those cases where a body part becomes numb, one should treat with medication and plasters and salves until the affected part regains sensitivity through appropriate measures such as heat application to the skin for a short period of time.
Then treat with the plaster until it regains sensitivity, and one may experience numbness in the hand or foot along the spine where the nerve that controls those body parts passes through after using such a medication.
Nothing further should be offered except from the one who is skilled in dissecting body parts and nerves that control bodily movements.
Chapter Eighty-Four. (Note: This seems to be a continuation or repetition of the section title mentioned earlier, but without any additional context it's unclear if this is an error or intentional.)
In cases of plasters. (This phrase appears to reference a particular method involving plasters within chapter eighty-four; however, the meaning remains uncertain without further context from the textbook.)
If the plaster advances and no remedy works, one should apply a deeper heat to the skin in accordance with its warmth until it turns pale and changes color. (This instruction appears to be guiding how to treat an adverse reaction or progression of symptoms associated with plaster treatment.)
Then treat with lime plaster mixed with rosewater, hemlock juice or blood of a quince tree from one part, mix them all together and apply to an abrasion until it dries out and sets in place for the affected area to heal. (This sentence suggests a more complex treatment involving natural remedies; however, it should be noted that some substances mentioned, such as hemlock juice, are highly poisonous.)
Chapter 50: Treatment of Fractures and Dislocebones, joints, fractures, and dislocations.
Cancer surgery.
If cancer is in its early stages and has been captured using a circular scalpel, some scholamoons have mentioned that it would be completely cured in the middle and I wouldn't see any signs of it because I don't expect recurrence but I have witnessed this occasionally.
It will be cut around like we said or with many incisions.
Section 50: Surgical Instruments and Their Use.
In the case of a tumor.
If someone develops a tumor and it is late in maturation, either due to the responsible party's negligence or the patient's old age, whether he is anemic priest or time has passed, I wanted to hasten its ripening by using many small incisions.
Then let it mature, and I intended to remove it using the type of scalpel shown here.
And I removed it in the middle of the tumor until the skin healed and the incision became lower than below to facilitate scab formation, then treat it as needed until it is healed.
Chapter II and Fifty
In the food ingestion.
The ingestion is only a disease that seeks in the body consuming itself as fire consumes dry wood; I saw the ingestion at a place where it was very close to fire, many small and large nails stuck according to what suited that location.
Then, cover it from all sides until the disease is completely extracted and nothing of its essence remains; then leave it for three days on the secured locations with powdered sulfur mixed with oil until all scabies bursts out and all the infection.
Then, treat it with fresh bone bandages and I saw after three days that the meat grew healthy plants without any infection; only leave the infected areas as they are and cure scabies with strong medicine.
It is done at the fire's pole, very quickly and it was mentioned to treat them with strong medicine in partitioning from there when they were needed.
Chapter III and Fifty.
In the inverted and non-inverted bandages.
Often, in this case of the twisting of a finger or two, one would apply either heat with fire or cold water to both sides.
As for the application of fire, it involves creating a metal sleeve shaped like an eagle's feather that encircles the pin on each side and is as thin as possible. You then place tongs around the pin and rotate your finger with the pincers until you reach the bottom of the pin.
He leaves three days, applying a lime paste and then bandaging it with salt-dried bread overnight; upon rising, the swelling subsides, and the wound is treated with an unguent made from boiled ham until healed—the pincers were not inverted.
It often occurs on the body, particularly in the hands and feet; thus it should be taken to unthread a pipe made of copper or iron or eagle feather shafts, then lowered onto the pin or thorn, followed by hot water being poured into the tube.
Your hand grasps and you manage it with a slight finger touch to the tube's entrance, where water finds its way through immediately to the root of the needle, and calms the inflammation somewhat by this swift stream.
Then the needle is lifted by its roots, thus you do it one at a time until all have reached throughout the body, and then you treat their positions after they've been withdrawn so that meat grows back from the scars.
The Fourth Chapter Fifty.
In Kya Nafq.
If one of Nafq suffers from cold in the limbs or chills or anything else, it is proper to place four coins or five on his back between each space and up to his chest with coinage. And on his vessel a plum-based ointment, then Nafq warms and hastens the maturation of the cold illness.
The Fifth Chapter Fifty.
In Kya, the acute bump occurring in the body.
They may erupt on the body as black bumps that are cold, thick and rotten substances; it is proper upon their initial appearance to scoop them off each bump with a gentle ladle of ash, or by igniting its edge or through a long wand or ointment.
The hammock of the pus has been cut in its first outbreak; it does not increase, and the guilty party disperses from it, and is cured by it only if it happens after evacuating the disease with a syrinx.
Chapter Six Hundred Fifty.
In cases of severe bleeding occurr cued by cutting the vein.
Bleeding often occurs from a vein that has been severed due to an injury exposed externally or when a cyst, bone or other tissue is opened and the edges are approximated.
If someone experiences this, act quickly by pinching the vein with your fingernail and hold it tightly until blood is stopped underne. Then place a piece of bay leaf (either small or large) in the wound and cover it after dabbing with multiple drops until a thick coagulum forms.
Then take one, either small or large depending on the nature and location of the cut vein, remove the coagulum from the same artery after you have quickly pinched it with your fingernail and held it tight until the bleeding stops.
Indeed, when the finger is lifted from the mouth of the vessel and the knife blade ignites, quickly take another knife from the prepared set in the fireplace and continue doing so until the blood stops.
The nerve that is here does not burn, so know that if blood leaks from the vessel it cannot be cut and especially if the vessel is very large then only by four methods as we said either with a hook or with a bistere (a type of surgical instrument) if it has not sprouted. If it constricts and the blood stops or if it binds tightly with ligatures or if you put on it drugs that have the purpose of stopping the blood and hardening the vessel wall stoutly.
And as for attempting to cut it with pincers or clamping tightly or placing heated objects near, it will not be cut by that method except in rare cases and without the presence of a physician and medicine so one should urgently place a cold finger on the wound itself as we described.
He is pulled tightly until the blood is squeezed out and drips from above the wound, along the veins, and on the fingers; it does not escape when cold water with a high degree of coldness is constantly applied to it, which thickens the blood, causes it to swell, and cuts off. During this time, one must observe what he needs from here or medicine.
Chapter Two.
In the chest and throat, closure and surgery techniques thereof.
He said that in the first chapter we mentioned a disease where people are healed by fire, burning medicines; its causes and reasons, methods of application, forms of poultices, which were divided from inches to feet.
And I shall detail in this chapter the thread with its eye, making it easier for the student to understand what is required.
Before starting that, it was necessary for you to learn, my son, that in this chapter is everything above what we mentioned in the first chapter about the patient.
For that reason, the warning in it must be very strong because there is much to consider when working on this chapter about evacuation of blood where life occurs during wound opening or splitting, pimples or discharge from a boil, surgery or spleen extraction, and methods like these all bring with them fear and risk of death.
I advise you regarding the occurrence of things akin to you that may happen in this profession, which is a group of people with various speech and those among them who have been tormented by their illnesses and dishonored by death.
For those afflicted with disease, their appearance and stature reflecting imminent death, and some among them who willingly spend money to appease you in hope of health but instead offer prayers for the deceased, do not assist from within this group marked by destiny.
Be especially cautious, do not progress further than what you know to be certainly correct with your disease until the severe consequences become apparent; instead, employ all treatments for your ailment and advance through knowledge and warnings as they relate to achieving health.
In that, it is assistance for you to acquire praise and glory, remembrance, and thanks; may Allah guide him [Albucasis] and do not deprive yourselves of goodness and success, for indeed, this is in His hands alone, there is no deity but He.
This section is arranged from the development up to the present day, aiming to conceal what you seek in it from desire according to God's will.
Chapter eby: "Chapter I
Treatment of the water that collects in boys' heads.
This wound is often seen in boys at birth if the skull of a child has been squeezed too tightly, and may also be due to an unknown hidden cause.
I have not seen this cause in adults, and all that I have observed dying quickly from it seem to be due to work exhaustion, and I saw a boy whose head had filled with water, causing the skull bones to thicken daily. Even before the boy sits on his own, due to the thickening of the skull bones and increasing moisture until death.
This moisture may either accumulate between the skin and bone, or beneath the skull on the sagittus axis; if the moisture is between the skin and bone, a small tumor should be created in the center of the head with an incision about one to two fingers wide, allowing the fluid to drain - this represents the treatment method.
The moisture increased and the tumor grew, making two intersecting incisions on this image:.
If there is moisture under the bone and its sign that you see the scalp veins are open from all sides, and water drips if pressed with your hand to the inside and not so lightly, then it was necessary to make three incisions at the top of the head.
After draining the moisture, close the incisions with sutures and ointment, then cover it daily with a mixture of honey and oil until the fifth day, after which you untie the bandage and treat the wound with gauze and headgeeze. Do not leave the scalp crooked and feed the patient with all dry foods with little moisture.
Another incision should be made where the bone of the tumor and gathering of water is visible, as it may be in the rear, forehead, or left/right sides of the head.
Make an incision where you see the tumor and water accumulation, make it as far as possible to avoid cutting any vessels that may lead to blood loss and death of the patient from such bleeding, accompanied by fluid removal.
The second chapter.
Severing the two vessels known behind the ears.
When someone has severe nosebleeds to the eyes or chest, and bandaging does not help in that case, treatment involved cutting these two vessels.
It was necessary that they should cut the affected area to be exposed by incising it deeply until the vessel appeared, then tighten the patient's neck due to blood loss and look at where the bleeding is pulsing, identifying the two lowered positions behind the ears.
Then, instruct them to bind with a tourniquet and make an incision through the bone using a sharp scalpel; it should be visible on the head'eand if you want, insert the scalpel from beneath the vessel upward, cutting until it is about two fingers wide.
If the bleeding stops abruptly and pulses out, stop regularly for a while; if the vessel is not felt by touch within three fingers from the ear, then bind with a tourniquet and incise to the bone as previously instructed.
Send blood from the middle and possibly sent more or less than that depending on what strength of illness and degree of swelling of its vessels you see, then look at the wound: if it remains on the bone as a small piece only cut it off.
If the tumor appears red and then inflames the wound with a thread of incision, treat it with bandages until healed.
The Third Section.
Tie the two vessels that are in the abscesses.
If a person suffers from chronic illness or severe chills before humidity and fever in the muscles of the abscesses or persistent intense headache and such conditions, we tried treating them with ligation of vessels from the abscesses as we described.
The work is done such that the illness which is in the abscesses causes hair to fall out, and the visible vessels in the temples become apparent to you through their pulse: if they recede or disappear completely from an individual person.
Or when the cold is severe, your illness causes you to shiver due to chills and then elevate yourself with a cut or swell the position with hot water until the vessels become clearly visible again. Then take the instrument which has this shape. Then you peel off the skin gently until you reach the blood vessel, then grab it with a tweezer and pull it upwards until it exits from the skin and is freed from all surrounding pustules on each side. The vessel was fine thread-like at the end of the tweezers. Then cut off a piece as far apart as the ends, and squeeze it until no bleeding occurs. If it does not break or split and blood is still flowing in its original form, drain from six to three threads.
The vessel was very important to be tied at two places with a fine silk thread, and the string should be either from braided cotton or silk strands so that the tincture does not hasten to the wound before reaching the bleeding.
Then cut off a flap between the two ties at that hour or later, if you wish to shape it like the bone using sharp scissors until its edges protrude as in this work shown by eyesight or better as we have said.
If the disease is hot or bilious, as it will cause perspiration according to what has been said about sweating in benefit, after stopping the vessels it should be bandaged with a compress and topical plaster applied; afterwards with the dry medication that induces purging until healed.
During your work, if bleeding occurs from the vessel, immediately grab it and either tie it with a thread or fill the space with gauze until the bleeding stops. Do not let anything touch you until the blood clots.
Relocate the position using strong cold water until it numbs and grip as needed, which is softer and easier than ligating the vessel for stopping bleeding with this technique that involves two blades after mastering the points with a thread.
Sheathing it deeply until reaching the bone and bleeding stops at two points that are far apart from each cuff, which does not become infected with this type of ligature method, as shown in the image of the ligature technique.
The double blades resemble small scissors but have less cutting edge than a regular knife because they are sharper and the cold penetrates them more quickly, so if there is any fat between them it will not tear out rapidly when held like this. This shows another variation of the ligature technique using dual blades as opposed to the single blade method.
The meat was cut quickly, making this work better than any other in terms of being softer and easier; after using the two knives, it should be as thin as a fingertnail's thickness for the ligature technique to effectively seal off bleeding points.
Chapter nine: Treatment for Cutaneous Diseases and Surgical Methods to Alleviate Them
Treatment for chronic bilateral watery eye secretion
If the tears are chronic and seep from an internal source at the base of the forehead, without being affected by any medication, and if you observe that the face has become reddened. The patient feels a drip at the corner of their mouth resembling an ant's trail, and his eyes are moist and watery due to lacrimation and congestion from excessive tears, prompting the need for this procedure which is called 'Halq'. It involves shaving off hair on the scalp.
Then, a shave on the scalp is made in three parallel cuts along the length of the forehead, with each incision being approximately one finger's breadth long and equally spaced as the width of the nose for the first two and slightly further apart from the movement of the temporalis muscle. The third is from the opposite side.
Preserve both cut ends on the sides and move your hand away from where to tie off the suture. Each incision should be separated by approximately three fingers, and a bandage or clean cloth should be used extensametnly to absorb blood.
Then the sharp instrument enters the two sides that this shows. From the groove that leads from the forehead to the middle notch, and it slides with all the skin in between the two notches along the ridge on the bone; then do likewise from the middle notch to the third notche and this instrument exits out. And another tool also enters in the first notch, a sharp knife from one side and a non-sharp blade from the other side, they are shown as follows:.
And its sharp side is directed towards the skin attached to the muscle, and its non-sharp side toward the bone; it pushes until it ends in the middle notch and cuts through all vessels running from the head to the eyes without reaching the surface of the skin.
Then it does the same from the middle notch to another, and after removing a moderate amount of blood clots, pressures each groove with a cotton thread tied with alcohol or lye solution and oil.
Otherwise, a severe infection occurs on the third day and the stitches dissolve; it is treated with much poultice of wet gauze followed by healing ointment and other treatments applied to wounds until God willing heals.
Chapter Five.
Treatment of Eye Discharge and Nasal Leakage from the Head's Depths.
There was a severe and persistent nasal discharge, his eyes were becoming smaller and weaker, impairing their vision and causing runny eyelids that shed tears. Indeed, such pain in the head's depth and persistent vomiting are caused by these symptoms; they indicate that these materials and discharges come from a deep and abundant source within. The best treatment for it is this remedy where you should stab at the tip of the boil with one incision, then make a single cut in its center.
Indeed, such pain in the head's depth and persistent vomiting are caused by these symptoms; they indicate that these materials and discharges come from a deep and abundant source within. The best treatment for it is this remedy where you should stab at the tip of the boil with one incision, then make a single cut in its center. Or slightly lift the face and begin to incising from the left temple towards the right; the incision should extend toward the bone, placing your hand further away from the moving cheekbones when you are masticating until if the bone is exposed and all blood is squeezed out with a sponge.
Separate the incision with pure cotton or linen thread, then tighten above the wound and drink the carrafion mixed with wine and oil so that a hot rash does not occur; after some time healed, you observed that the inflamed boil had ceased, suggesting it is appropriate to suture the bone until meat tissue begins to grow.
Then he treats it with the dried dressing that is grown on wheat flour, taking two parts and four quarters from it, making a bandage out of them and using it in meat growths such as these surgeramoons.
Chapter Six.
Treating what falls into the ear.
All that falls into the ear is one of four types, either a metal or stone-like mineral, glass, and either plant seeds like mustard or pulses and the like, or something watery similar to water or vinegar.
Or an animal, whatever falls into the ear is a grain or type of grains that do not burrow in the ear; it accepts sunlight through the ear and sees the grain only as something to drip oil from within it. Then attempt to remove them by head movement or jiggling with your fingers. And close the earholes after draining by wrapping a cloth or wool around the ear and stretching it to the top extensively, with this treatment as much is expelled; if not, then attempt to extract them gently using the technique I have described here.
Indeed, she expelled it in a pouch and then tried to extract it with a gentle syringe, but did not succeed; so they made a tube from copper and inserted the end of the tube into the hole of the ear, yes.
It sealed around the tube with a thin layer of wax so that no air could enter through any other opening, then pulled it out strongly and repeatedly using strong suction until she expelled it as described; but did not do so, so they took fat or processed animal matter which an eagle takes into its beak and placed it in the end of the tube.
After it was damaged by a pierced pigeon, then inserted into the ear hole after drying off the ear from moisture, she did not expel everything as described; instead, the abscess opened before heat or swelling occurred.
The procedure for the abscess in the ear canal is to first drain it as much blood as possible, then let the abscess sit between your hands and turn its ear upward, causing a small crack near its base at the fat tissue's lowest point from it.
The incision is in the shape of a crescent until it reaches the bone, then remove it with whatever tools you can using quick stitches and treat it until healed.
If the object fell in the ear from one of the seeds that grow and swell, then try to remove it as we mentioned but do not forcefully extract and use a delicate thin instrument on this image.
Try this with that type of seeds fallen in the ear, and only do so if you're sure that seed has become softened by the warmth of the ear until it becomes tiny pieces then remove them using a blunt hook or gentle suction device or a syringe.
As we mentioned it's easier to remove them, and for water in the ear, first use a warm poultice of mustard seeds then fill the ear with something like beeswax which is sticky on that ear where the water has entered should exit through this method.
And then took many small flat earrings, heated them slightly on fire and the patient inserted one into an ear hole, removed from that side to another stone in his hand, tapping with a different stone in the ear.
"Yet he continues to do so until all the water has been expelled, and the water may exit by being taken from a feather or a single hair, one side entering one ear while the other side is dried with fire causing it to burn more intensely before taking another feather.
"He does this repeatedly until all the water has been expelled or drawn out through a pipe as specified in the tray, and considering that an animal was placed inside it small like a flea, he treats it as described in section division.
"If his body was large and tangible, attempting to expel it through a bottle and funnel, it would be easier than anything else in the ear; as for expelling worms born in the ear, if they were treated as mentioned herein within our section on drops or treatment did not succeed.
"It was necessary to look at the ear in sunlight, if there is a thing like worms showing it should be expelled by bottle or delicate funnel; no such device appeared from its appearance.
"Narrow at the bottom and wide at the top, insert the delicate end into the ear as much as possible depending on the illness then moisten with a strong swab; he should do this repeatedly until all worms are expelled without causing blockage around the tube using oil as mentioned in your section.
Indeed, if the methods we mentioned did not work, they used the solutions that were previously attempted in killing the worms and found it in the section on solutions. And your eye will be filled with this device and the drugs in the ear through this instrument, as shown here:.
As you see, it is made of silver or brass with a narrow bottom and a wide top hole in it. If desired, the piston inside the tube can be made of solid brass, and if desired, rubbed with myrrh and wrapped on one end with silk thread.
Then, the ointment or solution or whatever substance you want from these drugs is placed in the tube and into your ear, then enter the myrrh with the silk thread from above and squeeze it gently until the ointment flows down into the ear canal and feels.
The condition inside, and whatever is put into the ear has been warmed slightly by fire; beware that the thing you pour in it is not too cold or too hot as the ear cannot endure such extremes.
Chapter Seven.
Treatment for the false plug in the ear.
Some children may be born with their bottoms out of their mothers' bodies and uncarved ears.
Additionally, some may show a plug in the ear canal due to an injury or swelling and this plug could be within the depth of the ear hole not visible by sight.
It may protrude slightly outside the hole and be visible, while that which is within the depth of the earhole is not perceptible by sight; in most cases it'angs to obstruct hearing, but what can be seen should be exposed to sunlight for the ailing ear. And in this case, it appears as though the plug is opened slightly with a gentle force and this is its image:.
One end is slightly limited in its reach and the tweezers are inserted on both sides not to harm the ear, so that if the plug were of a piece swollen within the ear canal it would be grasped with gentle pincers and carefully cut until all flesh is removed.
The plug within the depth of the earhole had a gentle curvature, slightly heated in fire then inserted into the ear canal and I sensed the plug as per what the patient feels to be the weight of hearing through it thoroughly.
"Preserve from piercing the auditory nerve and insert a tube in the ear to the depth of the hole, which had been done by Egyptian healers for several days until the wound was secure or replace the thread with one soaked in water and sprinkle powder on it.
"I have used it and saw that the ear had become infected with a fiery abscess, which should be drained by removing the tube and replacing it with another one that has soaked in quinces oil until the hot tumor subsided then treat it to cure.
"A bleeding from the ear occurred by a sponge or tear in cold water, placed on the ear and applied the treatment mentioned for stopping the bleed in the article 'The Pores'.
"Chapter Eight.
"Treatment of night terrors that appear during the storms.
"These night terrors that appear in the eyes' storms may be moist or dry, and it should be secured by a lancet or scalpel and cut out with its handle then apply powder on top.
"A bleeding from it by a gentle lens syringe is best after cutting and often if the remnants remain or burned up those parts that did not.
Chapter anno IX. On the Causes of Diseases and their Symptoms
Treatment for fake cold in eye flashes.
Often in flashes, something resembling a severe cold is presented.
Therefore, the cold was defined as a gathering of dense moisture in the upper and lower eyelids, making it appear that the cold moved towards all sides with ease to separate from it visually.
Then wash it from all sides gently until it clears, then label with the sign and cut it off, for you will not be able to remove it without the eyelid performing a precise incision so that the disease is not harmed by that action as if the gap had become very large, gathering together with suturing and treating until recovery.
And if it were small without causing you harm, the patch would force it and compress it, as the cold was leaning towards inside of the eyelid toward the inner surface to pull down the eyelid and label the cold with a sign indicating that no cut is needed and suture from all sides.
Thus, the eyelid executed a precise incision without harming it, then wash the eye after cutting off the cold with salted water and treat the position by compressing until recovery of the disease occurs.
Chapter amo 10.
Treatment for the stye presented in the eyelid.
A stye is a swelling that occurs in the upper layers of the eyelid and is more common among young individuals who experience heaviness in their eyes, presenting with tearing on the sides, and unable to look at sunlight. To accelerate the bleeding.
Therefore, they are made to rest on their backs and sleep with their pillows being moist, as the styes become visible for examination and when you pinch them, indicating a stye between them, place your fingers on it for treatment.
Then take a fine cotton and prepare wax from it, creating a circle with the wax that encompasses the stye on all sides, then place it over it and press around it with your fingers from each side to gather the stye in the center of the circle.
Then make a cut with the sharp scalpel through that moistened wax, ensuring the incision is no larger than necessary and for deeper incisions it's best to excise all layers of skin until reaching the stye.
More cases are characterized by the protrusion of a fleshy piece from the defect in the fatty substance, which you pull towards the outside with forceps placed between your thumbs until it is completely exposed; hold your hands to the right and left until you have removed it entirely, being careful not to enlarge the defect so that the instrument does not enter through the eye.
If the protrusion did not appear in the initial incision, it is appropriate to slightly extend the cut until the protrusion appears; then pull as we mentioned, and immerse a sponge in water and alcohol, place it on the spot, press down with gauze. Some people also use salt for this.
It is placed in the depth of the incision to dissolve any remaining moisture, then treat it until the site heals and apply an effective hot compress with soothing bandages until recovery occurs.
The Tenth Surgical Section.
In the context of eyelid reconstruction.
If an excess of tissue grows under the natural eyelids, below the natural folds, and they become inflamed causing eye irritation leading to chronic conditions such as persistent tears, lacrimal duct obstruction, dryness, and thickening until it becomes a cause for vision impairment.
"Examine the eye in four ways: either by fire or by a sharp drug as it presents on the outer part, or if it is stitching and suturing, or with a probe.
"Make the head of the patient lie in your lap, then turn their eye with your left hand; if you cannot do so, insert a needle from below the eyelid and perform suturing from above, ensamoothing it to be close to its natural hairline.
"Then turn the eyelid gently, and make an incision from the outer edge of the lid to the inner one without piercing the excess hair with a sharp needle, suture the thread and place it under the eyelid using a small pad made of silk or gauze.
"The shape should be similar to the wings of a butterfly, insofar as you want to elevate the eyelid because it may vary among people; some may need only a small portion cut from the eyelid.
"And others may need to cut less for the eyelid, elevate accordingly; then use a sharp blade along the lines you have marked, starting from the outer edge of the lid to the inner one, with each incision being close to the natural hairline like butterfly wings.
Then the surgeon enters through one of the skin corners, then lifts it all off and gathers with a needle and thread a fine silk thread and cleanses the blood, and attaches what remains of the threads to the eyelids using various adhesives.
Then leave the stitching and threads for about three or four days before treating it, unless you want to heal without suturing; in that case, dry out and clamp as such: when the wound is closed and joined with stitches, the eyelid rises. Stitching is preferable.
This face washing method mentioned by the early ones also involves applying ointment to the wound, which is good work with no risk involved; another aspect of face washing also applies and involves learning how to cleanse an eyelid as described like a sheet of paper. Then the eyelid rises by three fingers, acting as a pincers or on this picture:. [No further text provided to translate.]
Then trim what remains of the eyelid with a small scissor on this picture, in a balanced manner:. [No further text provided to translate.]
Indeed, you cannot imprison the lancing and it is not for you to insert a thread into its tip. Enter it in the middle of the shape, enter another thread near the greater meatus, a third thread near the smaller meatus, join your fingers with the threads evenly, then raise them upward gently.
Lift the skin instructed on it all as we described, then join the edges of the wound with a thread and treat until healed; if you expose or cut the tumor, use hot compresses to shrink that tumor and approach it using immobilizing corsets.
The lower eyelid may also show that its edges should be operated on as we mentioned, cutting and suturing and warming with fire or strong medicine and warming with fire or strong medicine; inform the patient of these treatments in them consisting of cutting and stitching and so forth.
The cornea polishing is of this type, involving the eyelid turning and scraping from inside as you described then craft two or three fine sticks lengthwise along the eyelid with a width less than that of a scale.
They lent their sides to each other, where the threads fastened and then gently brought them together above the eye socket; the tubes from both sides were tightly clamped, after some days, the skin that was constricted died, became gangrenous, and began to rot.
Until it fell off from itself, the infected lamb was treated with a tourniquet and then cared for until healed; if the eyelid swelled up but did not impair vision, this is an image of the two tubes made in this manner and to this extent lengthwise and widthwise.
The second tenth chapter.
In raising the hair of the brow near the eye with a needle.
If the hair or two were worked in such a way that they took up a fine needle, then insert a thread of fine silk and tie both ends together with a very slender knot; the length of the thread should be about an inch (approx.).
Then bind another fine thread not in the fold and knot both ends as desired, then place the patient's head on a block so that it is close to sunlight; soon will be done such precise work then insert the needle with the ligatures at the root of the hair that has grown.
He executed this in the socket using forceps until it emerged above the natural hair, then pulled the thread up to the follicles and entered into those follics through the hair strand, whether there was one or two or three.
Then your hand is drawn until the hair and follicles emerge from the socket with the natural hair, pulling the follicles inward so that the hair does not come out along with them; instead, they are pulled downward by the thread you had tied them to until the follicles emerged from the upper hole.
Then the hair and follicles are returned, doing so until they rise to the upper hole and come into view of the eye; then release the follicles, thread, and extract them, close the eye and leave it tightened for two or three days until the hair is firmly in place and flesh grows over it.
The hair is short, either adding natural long hair to it and rising with it or leaving it until it grows after a period of time.
Chapter thirteen.
In the treatment of a cataract occurraturuing in the upper eyelid, the eye.
The one shown here called an ass-like hyena is a horse that may be natural or artificial, and the artificial one arises from a wound gaping, split, or cleft in some manner.
The work should involve that gaping wound being split and a ligature made from catgut is inserted between them until it heals, without using things that contract or tighten in treating it.
If you have done this, the horse returned as bad as before using things that rested like pills and bandages soaked in water mixed with my nostrils' extracts and catgut dissolved along with some ingredient from an ointment jar that stained the ligature and was treated with it.
The treatment should involve using every means to prevent it from sticking again on the initial structure, and this work we mentioned is just one of horse healing that does not return to its original state according to what was previously determined.
Chapter Fourteen. (Title of Section)
In treating the horse with a lower eye injury. (Title of Section or Image Caption)
This saddle that is made of leather, which in truth is a horse and has an oblong shape with a gap or opening similar to that of wounds.
The technique involves taking a needle with a thread and inserting it into the flesh, pulling it from left flank to right flank until the thread is in both sides of the flesh, then extending the flesh over the needle and cutting it with a flat spoon.
The eye socket shall return to its proper shape, or alternatively, take olive oil and place it on the location of the defect, turn the eyeball with it and make two incisions from inside the socket so that the ends of the cuts meet at a point where the initial incision was made. Until they meet to form this shape:.
It is the Greek letter Lambda, then remove that flesh so that its sharp edge leads to the eyeball and gather scattered parts together using two stitches threaded with silk thread and then treat it as we mentioned previously with healing medicines and dressing until cured.
If the mare presents with a tear or laceration, it is necessary to make a simple incision without harming the hair of the mane and then separate the edges using a suture as previously mentioned.
In treating the mare, whether from above or below, proceed with the operation according to what seems best for you based on the nature of the horse; it may vary greatly in appearance, and the veterinarian must employ any necessary method possible.
Until it reaches its natural state or gets close to it, the same ailment guides him towards what is best for him in terms of treatment and apparatus among more cases.
Chapter Fifteen.
In securing the eyelid to the lid margin or orbital rim.
This adhesion may appear to many as the upper eyelid being stuck with conjunctival hemorrhage, preventing it from moving freely and hindering its natural functions; intervention under the eyelid is required.
Raising it up or extending it with an eyelash scissors and then breaking the adhesion using a gentle cut is not to severely cut the attachment but rather slightly as if to relieve the afflicted from the concern of cutting the lash strip during its application, causing no harm to the eye.
He anticipated that if the eyelid returned to its natural position and all adhesions were released, then in the eye he would pour salty water for washing or strain through a glass sieve solution of water, then separate the lid from the eye with two pieces of tissue.
He places a diaper soaked in egg white over the eye and after the third day uses bandages until it heals,
Chapter Sixteen.
In the nail and toe nail section.
The nail is on either being neural and like a delicate fine sponge or non-neural resembling a white brittle clay if struck with iron or broken by the cobbler, it gets split.
There is no confirmation in it, and both kinds actually spread from the larger pus to slightly bleed occasionally until they cover the sore and prevent light and eye movement; the treatment involves placing the afflicted part on a stone slab.
Then he opens his eyes and lifts the eyelid with your hand, gently twists it upward then takes a needle inserting hair from horse or cow's fur fibers and thin threads into it, slightly bends the needle tip and inserts it in the middle of the nail.
She did it with the needle and tied it to the fingertip thread, lengthening it upwards and pulling out the hair on the side of the finger where she would scratch, as if spreading it with a comb towards another one. Then cut off what remains in the root with a fine clamp or small scissors and discard the natural skin tag tissue.
So, a part of his constant blood shows from what is removed, and the fingerterve was lengthened by itself or with thread as we mentioned then pulled out by the side that this image depicts it:.
And to prevent the clamp from touching the skin with a gauze pad in case of any accidental scratch on the eyelid, then after cutting it receives something of ground salt or zinc sulfate and leaves it until the next day when she should treat it as needed for healing.
The fingertip was not nervous and could not be entered with a needle or tie threads on it frequently, as this type of finger is treated with medication to heal in the manner described in division. If one desired to cut it off, the eye would open involuntarily.
Take a gentle scalpel and apply it to the weak edge of this image: Notice the nail with a gentle scraping; I found that it flaked and crumbled, so the scrape only pierced through your eye in one of the following tools: glass scalpel or red lens or ground salt. Tighten your gaze until another day.
Then, repeat the work until all are done except if it irritates your eye and rubs gently scratching it; treat the hot boil until healed then scrape again until you recover, and as for the pork fat.
If the pork fat seriously irritates your eye, label that piece of pork fat and cut off part of it so as not to touch it lest bloodshot occurs then drip in the cup through one of the following tools: red glass or glass scalpel until recovery,,.
Chapter Seven Hundred Eleven.
In sections two and three: pork fat that protrudes into the eye.
Pink fat may grow in the eyes of some people, to cover the gaze or come close or overflow onto the floors and sometimes the floods turn outward and resemble rose quartz. (Note: The above translation maintains fidelity to the original text but is presented without context as instructed.)
In this procedure, the patient is to place their head on a block and then open their eyes to catch all of the red meat with suitable spoon-like utensils.
He should be secured with a clamp or clip, and then the first piece of meat is cut until all are divided using suitable pieces, while protecting his eyes during the operation; these portions will either have the instrument we described in nail clipping or a small scissor. As the spoon receives what appears to her in this doorway.
If you have been cut and all the threads go, wipe your eyes with salted water or drizzle some red tincture on it from medicinal liquids, then place a snow-white piece of cotton over the eye to protect against inflammation.
There remained a swelling and your blood overpowered you, it swelled the eye and treated it with something to calm the inflammation; then proceed with the work until healed and similarly address any protruding tissue exposed in the eye of this kind.
However, you should avoid treating a weak eye through natural healing or work-based methods and do not involve your hand in any of these trades until you see that such part is likely to be affected by this type of work.
Chapter Eighteen and Ten.
Image of a suture from the eye.
The sutures of red thread are stitched across the eye to prevent vision and weaken the eye over days, initially you should look at an eye with strong sutures and no other disease present.
At that time, take the picture and instruct the patient to place their head in a basin then hang those sutures with one or two bands according to your discret지 تينت إيتش منسابيل في هذه الصورة.
Or be two bands doubled in one body on this image:.
Then take a gentle scissors to cut those sutures carefully and wipe away the blood while doing so until you see golden threads from them unraveling, keeping your eye clear of being touched by the scissor tips, and work for half a day facing the sun.
And you have confirmed greatly in your work that not cut the sutures except at rest only, snip in the green or red eye-doctor's eye to consume what remains of the threads, and you cannot capture it all within one hour, so numb the eye with something that relieves pain.
Leave it for days until the swelling subsides and the tumor warms, then return to work on this condition with its eye until it heals from the amputation's image.
Leave it [and the head of the ailment should be in the student's jawbone, and he may let blood drain out from there at the eye socket entrance and its location, which is originally done through work; so that the eyelid opens with fixed or triangular clips.]
The surgeon's head of the ailment should be in the student's jawbone, and he may let blood drain out from there at the eye socket entrance and its location, which is originally done through work; so that it appears to take pictures either from above the eyeball or from below. First, two drops are applied on the upper lid, one in each corner of the upper eyelid.
Clip them between the medial and lateral canthus, then hang drops below those, then clip them between the corner and the end. Hold gently with your hand until all spouts are raised to cut through using a scalpel or blade delicately.
The poultice was applied to the wound, and all sinews were raised up until it reached the shoulder joint; no bleeding occurs from the incision or pus.
Then, cut it off with the scalpel above and below so that no tendon remains in the forearm; you can raise it from the elbow crease. Wrapping a poultlet is better, which some people have found useful.
And if it was swolculed, rested for a few days and relieved the pain, then revisit the treatment.
The Twelfth Section.
In response to bleeding into the nose.
Surgeons call it 'Nasorrhoea', if treated with alkalis or a sharply hot medicine as described, and no other method was found to help except scratching the abscess when matured and draining all the moisture and pus from it.
Until the bone is exposed, if there is decay or blackening seen in it by this instrument: ... (The text would continue with instructions on how to handle such cases).
It is called 'Khansa', made of Hind's iron, with a ball-shaped head engraved with the marking of an awl or silverware in delicate lines; place it on the decayed spot of bone and hold it between your fingers while slightly squeezing with your hand until you know that pus has been ejected. (The text would continue detailing further steps related to this technique).
On several occasions, the site is forced by squeezing it with dried medicinal substances causing the haematoma to stop bleeding and meat to grow in it, which stops flowing after forty days without resurfacing or swelling occurring therein.
I know that he may have been cured, otherwise there is no escape but to pierce the nostril on this condition and reveal the second bone through iron or a strong medicine if the bone emerges in this image:.
The iron triangle is shaped as shown then placed on the bone itself being close to the nail and further from your eye a little, then move your finger with the peg until the bebeon is protruded and feels by the patient.
If the peg is expelled he grabs his nose with his hand then as I informed you if the meat grows and fixes the place squeeze it with dried medicinal substances and whatever was inserted to exit out of the nose will return to the nose in that case it will be weaker on the patient by God's will.
Chapter 20. Treatment of Tumors and Cysts
Initial treatment for the eye wound.
If the eye socket is swolablished and there has been no disturbance in vision or nutrition deficiency, then ease the ailment followed by drainage through the canal and placing a soft compress on the forehead without any restrictions, and apply delicate suction.
Then place a paste made from asafoetida, saffron, almond oil and enziat on the eye; hold the eyelid firmly above the compress with olive oil to soften it greatly. The preparation of the olive oil should be such that when applied gently each tear-like cuts through them all four times as a thick paste is made from them.
Then place one compress on top of another as much as the eye needs, then hold it firmly with a tight gauze and return the compress by applying suction without any restrictions; remove the compress after one day and night keeping the eyelid tense.
It is advised to rest the bandage for some time before holding it tightly again; then remove the bandage after one day and night as previously mentioned, if the eye appears to have recovered, or reapply the compress, olive oil paste, firmness, and suction until recovery.

In the Grapevine section.
If the flap appears in the grapevine layer and then contracts and protrudes outside the folds as a grapes cluster image of the human body, therefore performing work on it according to what is mentioned above.
It is to insert one needle at the base of the grape cluster, then another needle into it from below, threading a suture line, executing it and withdrawing the first needn. This instruction pertains to surgical techniques for securing incisions or wounds. However, without further context, interpreting this as part of Albucasis' work assumes an analogy with grapevine layers representing human skin or tissue planes; historically accurate and consistent with surgical texts from that era.
Then she cuts the angle of the suture line and ties a grape to it, pulling tightly; then withdrawing the needle and placing on the eye a blotting pad moistened with white of egg yolk, holding until the threads drop off along with the grapes; thereafter treating the eye to strengthen it. This excerpt describes a surgical procedure involving suturing techniques combined with an application used for treatment or healing purposes, reflecting historical methods that may have been employed in ocular surgeries or treatments by Albucasis. The methodology indicates intricate knowledge of handling delicate tissues and the importance of post-operative care, which are principles still valued in modern surgery although using advanced materials and techniques.
Until the wound heals, and from each side ties a circular piece of gauze until the eye swells considerably; then with a fine forceps touches the cornea to remove moisture and the eye droops downwards; after which it is tightened again until healed. This passage details postoperative care procedures aimed at promoting healing, indicating methods for reducing edema (swelling) and handling complications such as excessive moisture in ocular tissues—a concept still relevant to modern ophthalmology though with advanced techniques like controlled-release medications and refined surgical instruments. The description suggests a meticulous approach to aftercare, emphasizing the importance of managing swelling and preventing further complications through proper technique and materials.
Chapter II and XXVII.
In the treatment of clefts.
This condition called the cleft is but a gathering in the eye resembling water and not of it, and treatment for this involves placing the patient on an elevated seat then taking their head with both hands from each side.
And move it until the eyelid comes down in front of your eye then holds firm and does not falter as light passes through, seeing things as they were, even if the eyelid did not descend to below our view, we know that it is water so there is no hesitation for the eyelid to fall.
Otherwise, the patient sits between your hands and takes a delicate lancet to gently make an incision over the corneal layer near where the cleft connects with the eyelid margin until the material comes out.
If it was just water that came out of the eye, mixed with honey or if sweet wine had been added to it then treat all other aspects until recovery occurs,.
Chapter III and XXVIII.
We have mentioned different types of water in the division and which one is suitable for a cup that should be taken from there with well-stirred filtered speech, then the patient should sit between your hands palm up close to the light near the sun.
Fastens the correct eye and grips it firmly, then lifts its eyelid with your left hand if the water is in the right eye or with your right hand if the water is in the left eye.
Then place the edge of the needle close to the cornea with a small part of its tip inward from the inner corner and push the needcuon it into the conjunctiva, holding it firmly until you feel that it has gone through.
The needle should be inserted to a depth equal to the distance from white to black and is seen as the cornea in its natural color, then the needle reaches up to the position where it will encounter water.
Then you grip it down once the water recedes as seen by its clock and the swelling opens up to your sight, then the needle sinks in slightly so that when the water rises again after a second without letting go of the needle.
If it stabilizes and does not rise, slowly let out the needle with your fingers then dissolve a bit of pure sea salt in water and wash the eye from inside to outside and place a moistened sponge or cotton ball over it.
"Insert the eyeball and its whiteness, and attach it with chickpea-ground yolk; as we and our contemporaries do when performing a cataract surgery by inserting them into the eye for firmness, since some people have very firm eyes. "It was necessary to take the instrument that is called the 'mail' depicted in this image:
"Thumb a needle with the same pincers but do not insert it deeply into the hole, and only lightly tap for the needle to enter as we previously mentioned; upon complewarting your work, prepare a hardened poultice that sleeps on its back in a dark room.
"Avoid all movements and saliva, make his food resemble its natural form, keep his head neither to the right nor left, have the bandage remain on him for the third day, then remove it in that dark room, and try his sight.
"Dress the wound, then remove the bandage on the seventh day, and do not perform this during treatment or after drinking water; instead, avoid it so that the patient does not have a strong gaze.
Indeed, the appearance of a malignant tumor required that it be cured before seven days and healed so as to inhabit the tumor until it settled therein; then its sight was released and placed upon the cheek with an ointment daily for several days while in this dark house.
He leaves the house gradually and behaves accordingly, knowing that the learned one does not require repeated viewings; then on occasion he presents himself for work, some Iraqis have mentioned that it is said to be made in Iraq with piercing glass absorbing water.
I have not seen anyone make it in our land, nor read it in a book from ancient writebacks; perhaps it has been updated, this image of types of glasses resting upon them by themselves:.
It is made of copper specifically, and its edge has this smoothness like a triangular eye sharp at the end:,
The fourth chapter and twenty.
For treating dislodged lumps in the nose.
A tumor may have grown in the nose, producing various types like many legs and one resembling a blackened cancerous lump, and another that is soft but not colored.
What should be done with this meat that is not tender and not cancerous? The patient should sit between the palms of one's hands, face towards the sun, open their nostramo, inhale the smoke from the flesh, then draw it outward, cutting off whatever they have grasped with a fine sharp single-edged knife.
Until you know that the meat is all gone, if there's anything left, refine it with one of the fine tools until nothing remains but your blood or a skin tumor.
It should be done as follows or if it was a malignant tumor, make the incision until the blood flows and all of the meats are removed, then receive smoke in your nose after cutting, leaving nothing but air or wine; open the nostrils and let the moisture flow to the throat.
Know that it is healed, but if the moisture did not reach what should be reached, know that there is meat inside his head in the swoln bones and the tool could not cut it; then you should take a piece of leather with some stiffness.
It is comprised of numerous knots, with intervals between each no wider than a finger's breadth or less. The affliction turns one side of the single thread in its nostril into mucus or whatever it can produce after forming a ball like a pearl and attracting wind until it reaches the palate.
It exits through the loop and, like what boys do as described in the book, is an act easily accomplished by those who wish to do so; then both ends of the single thread protruding from the mouth come together.
Then use a meat press on the knots in the thread until you realize that the meat has been sliced by the thread's knot; then remove the thread and it will emerge from the nose after wiping away any blood clots, as one would do with an Egyptian bandage within three days or more.
Until the bandage consumes everything that remains of the meat, then another thing appears in the nostril like a silver tube until it heals; one needs to undergo treatment involving something dried from that.
This is a picture of the instrument used to make incisions in nostrils and medicine administration:.
He places a silver or copper crescent-shaped ring, open on the backside and bent in such a way.
And if desired, the tube is made closed like a pipe and its outer surface smoothed down.
It has a handle at the other end as you see it gripped if melted wax or whatever substance is desired in its tubes is poured into it.
The fifth and twentiatal chapter.
In the slender tube, at its end near the nose.
It is often that a mole grows at the nose tip, becomes hard with days and progresses until it bleeds.
Therefore, it is incumbent to cut it at its first appearance and extract all of it then apply either a cold or the burning agent used by podiatrists; if neglected, cutting will be effective until the mole becomes hard like dried paint in color.
If exposed to iron, it becomes a cancerous tumor and often I have seen that cutting this tumor frequently caused great wounds on the owner's body; even if the tumor is soft like cheese but not colored as paint, cutting can be done entirely. "Empty the abscess and cut it without caution, and treat the site by compressing until relief.
Chapter Sixteen.
In nasal and lip suturing, as well as ear procedures. "If the stitches separate from a wound or towards that direction, know that an adhesion failure occurred in one of these tissues and only worked on some people.
"It should be considered when someone presents with a wound where the blood has coagulated and sutures have come apart, that the wound is properly stitched first then treated until relief, if separation of sutures had occurred causing all sides to become infected, it should be recommended to drain each side externally using gauze.
"Then the sutures are gathered and pressed, and honey is applied along with a mixture of almond oil over the stitches above the scars for an ointment application or another similar plastered remedy which should be left tightened for two to three days then removed.
"The medication is replaced and left until the sutures are removed from it, then treated with a plastered remedy until relief; the stitching prescription for adhesion separation should be either through thread or as described here in abdominal suturing.
Chapter 72.
Regarding the discharge from the nodes that appear on the eyelids.
Many people show small firm tumors in their mouths, resembling some like hazelnuts and others smaller or larger; it is recommended to turn the eyelid and scrape each node, then apply a plaster.
Cut it from all sides, then cover the place after cutting with a powdered spice until the bleeding stops and softens by moistening with vinegardressing the sites with what includes compressing them to heal completely.
Chapter eby 28. (Translation of chapter title)
Regarding cutting the fat in the gums.
Often a fat grows on the gums called 'awi' by Abulcasis; it is recommended to plaster or tie with a needle and cut at its root, leaving it for bleeding or pus before placing powdered spice on the site.
Or if a tight compression with dried herbs is used, that fat often returns after treatment; cut it again and dressing, then it does not return afterwards.
Chapter 92 and 100.
In the silver tube for draining urine.
Swellings may come from within and without, between the gum's rough, dirty edges - greenish, bleeding, turning yellow or green until rot reaches the gums and causes inflammation of the teeth due to this decay.
The patient should sit between your hands and head on a pillow, removing the teeth and gums that have surfaced in you - also rubbing with sand-like substance until nothing remains - and do bleaching, yellowing, greening, and other things until they are cleansed.
Gold in it is part of the first tissue and reapply grafting on another day, second, third until you reach your desired amount; know that teeth require different forms of implants depending on what you prefer to do.
For the implant that grafts teeth from non-grafted tissue inside and out, as well as between roots, in various shapes of implants: these are all prepared forms; .
Chapter Thirty-three.
Removal of Teeth.
The tooth should be treated with every possible remedy, and the dentist should attempt to extract it without leaving any behind if extracted, as it is a noble essence; even if it causes harm in its removal.
It is necessary for the patient to firmly establish their intention to remove a tooth until it heals at your site. The patient often deceives the pain and believes that they have removed the correct tocheen, but until the sick person extracts the tooth themselves, the pain persists, which we have seen happen repeatedly from the work of dentists.
If the affected tooth is visible, then it should be encircled with a clamp on which some force is applied until tartar loosens from all sides and can then be moved using your fingers or fine tweezebrushes first gently at first.
Then, when able, the large forceps can be used effectively to secure the patient's jaw where you have cleaned it so that it does not move; then gently pull the tooth into place until it breaks off, and if any part remains, use one of those tools again to enter from all sides gently and rock the remaining piece back and forth.
If the jaw is artificial or eaten away, it should be filled with grafts and sealed properly on both sides with fine gauze so that when you tighten it with strings, there is no bleeding from around the gums on either side. It is necessary to examine the area of the gum thoroughly.
Maintain your suture without breaking or leaving it so that a part of the healing remains stronger than its original wound, and make what you do as barbers with their bridle and apply it to his helmet in such a way that they cannot use it without our instructions.
Frequently, people suffer from a great injury on the left side that causes their jaw to break and all its parts remain or some of them. If a piece of the jawbone is removed as we have seen before, and after removing it they swell with wine or saltwater, then heavy bleeding often occurs from that place when something large enters there to expel it.
However, if the swelling does not help you at all, the image of the fine threads that initially make the jaw long and narrow with a wide end but shortens when grabbed around it is this image of large sutures:.
To be as you see, thickened hinges so that when grasped they do not yield or bend easily, made of Indian iron or well-tempered steel with reinforced ends and closely interlocking jaws.
The handles are also made to be robustly strong.
Chapter on Surgery and Thirty (procedures).
In the hinge mechanism, insert bones broken from fractures and protrusebones.
If the tooth at the hinge base has been fractured, it should be placed on a camel bone fat once or twice until the position is relaxed and then insert the filler or ligatures. Resembling the beak of a bird called Blare, this is an image of ligatures:.
If the hinge has been made from inside or is of Esclavage type, it should not be removed using these ligatures; one should extract them by digging into the root and exposing all the meat with a probe then insert the device that resembles a small stool as depicted here:.
The short end is slightly thickened and not fully sunk in; if the root comes out with this, otherwise use other devices as depicted here, the first resembling a triangular end partly hollowed out.
Image of another small triangular shaped object:
We also needed this machine with the two handles that he also depicted:.
And other instruments and scalpels that he mentioned in the treatise, we also needed this machine resembling a large lute depicted by him:.
A triangular tool with a slightly curved edge, so that it does not break easily and is not wet, knowing that surgical instruments are numerous as well as other tools, which rarely count and the skilled craftsman in his art may invent devices according to what work and diseases of themselves suggest.
Since diseases did not have tools mentioned for their varieties, breaking a bone from the jaw or one of the teeth requiring extraction would be addressed with either of these devices and threads that he mentioned in his writings:.
We needed this device depicted by him:.
It has a slight curve to hold the bone so it does not slip until the bone is removed, and then the position is stabilized with appropriate medication; in which case the bone would be infected from being uncleaned before, spreading pus and color until cleansed, then treated until recovered:.
Chapter Two and Thirty.
In the removal of loose bone fragments from another.
If bone fragments naturally detach, observe the image and especially if this occurs in women or children, it is adviscueto consider that the tooth may have detached from behind another tooth.
The fragment cannot be removed or extracted, and if it is attached to another tooth, remove it using this instrument that is depicted here:.
It is similar to a small beak and made of very sharp Hindi metal at the end, used for cutting teeth in cases with significant weakness of the bone and not interfered by other bones; if it can be extracted, then extract using this instrument as depicted here.
It is all Hindi, and the tip has fine engraving like a file used to shape nails; it gently grates the bone little by little on days with significant weakness of the bone if there are no other bones to interfere when one falls out and another takes its place. Extract using this tool as shown here.
If a tooth has cracked and parts of it cause speech impediment, it should also be grated away until the fracture heals completely, smoothens over, is reconstructed, and does not interfere with speech or corrupt it.
Chapter Three and Thirty.
In the joints of moving bones with threads of silver or gold.
If a hanging bone protrudes and moves from a blow or fall, and the patient is unable to eat anything until it falls off; treat with binding medication but do not expect healing through this method.
The remedy is to bind with a thread of gold or silver, preferably gold because silver tends to tarnish and corrocuate after some days; the golden wire remains in its original condition without showing any signs of deterioration, and should be flexible yet resilient enough between the bones.
A depiction of the joint being held and bent at an angle between the two correct bones, then threading one end of the wire through the moving bone or more until reaching the other side to be tied with the healthy bone from the opposite side.
Then rethread to the starting side and firmly tie your thread with ease until no movement is observed at either end; then cut off one end of the golden wire neatly with a scissors, gather them together, trim both ends, enclose them in the cloth, and cover it between the healthy bone and the moving bone.
Unless the tongue is paralyzed, then it remains stiff like this until something breaks or cuts through its tension, which one enjoys for a long time, and this is an image of fractures and tendon arrangement in two healthy jaws and moving jaws as you see:.
One or both jaws may fall after collapsing into their place and become entangled as we have described, and it remains so; only a blacksmith's apprentice would do this when making an armor and may extract bone from the cow's bones to use in creating the jaw structure at its original position. It remains as we have said and one enjoys it,
Chapter Four Hundred Thirty.
In a section showing the ligament underneath the tongue preventing speech.
This ligament shown under the tongue may be naturally produced by humans or it could be a surgical exposure from an injury that has healed.
The work involves opening the patient'aturd mouth and raising their tongue, then cutting that nerve exposure until it releases its grip, thus allowing the tongue to be freed; there was some strength and complexity in this case, which came from healing an injury caused by a bullet wound where it was exposed and cut until the ligament grew back and released the ties.
Be cautious, as a cut deep in the muscle may sever a vessel there and cause bleeding; then it will swell at the wound site with rose water or vinegar and cold water. Then place a tallow-filled piece of sheep's bladder under the tongue that the patient holds each night.
Do not allow the second to sleep if bleeding occurs; instead, cover it with a dust of powdered medication and apply a glass eye cup on that place for healing. Then treat him with all remedebut until he recovers,.
Chapter Five and Thirty Three.
In the discharge of a newt under the tongue.
A small newt-like wart under the tongue may prevent it from performing its natural function and possibly fill up the mouth until the tumor opens towards the sunlight, looking at it.
I saw it as a colorful or solid patch which the patient does not feel, so do not expose him to it as cancer and if there is any wetness in it that has formed a pus-filled sore, scrape it gently with a scalpel and remove it from all sides.
In the case of excessive bleeding during your work, apply a grounded powder until the blood stops. Then return to your task until it is completed. Afterward, sneeze with salt and vinegamoist.
Then treat it with all suitable therapy until you recover,
The sixth and thirty-third chapter.,
In the treatment of lupus erythematosus.,
And whatever grows in the esophagum from all tumors may appear inside the esophagus near glands resembling those that are seen outside, which are called lupus erythematosus if they were treated as mentioned in Part IV; thus it will not recover.,
However, if the tumor was hard like a piece of metal with little sensation, or if its color was red and its origin thick, it should not be treated with iron either for fear of bleeding but leave it until mature; whether to pluck it out or burst from within.,
And if it was white in color and its origin delicate, this one should be cut out; the work must be done to ensure that the tumor has completely settled or lacks some deficiencies.,
Then the patient sits on a sunshoe with their head in the bowl and opens their mouth, taking two hands between your fingers to press down their tongue using this instrument as follows:
It is made of silver or thin as a scalpel if you press the tongue with it, and reveals to your eye the tumor; insert it into the louse's body and push out as much as possible so that it does not attract anything from the sack.
Then she cuts it with this instrument, which resembles a pair of scissors except that the tips curve inward like shoes each with sharp points made from Indian iron or Damascus steel:.
These instruments have not been purified, but can only be cut with this implement as follows:.
They have one sharp and the other dull edge, after cutting one louse it cuts the other on this type of incision with its eye, then after the cut make the patient rinse with cold water or vinegar and water.
It is presented with bleeding that stops after rinsing with water in which pomegcuar crusts have boiled or mulberry leaves or something similar to bands until the bleeding ceases, and other tumors not of lice may grow in the throat; they are cut as mentioned above for the two lice.
She treated a woman who had a tumor that grew inside her colon, which nearly closed the canal and left only a narrow passage for breathing; eating and drinkcuh were prevented.
She had overseen a death if it were to last one or two days, and the tumor grew outgrowths until they emerged from her nostrils; in haste she drove a peg into one of them and then drew it off with forceps successfully.
Then she cut where it emerged from the nostril, and did that to another protrusion of her nose; she opened her mouth, gripped her tongue, drove a peg into the same tumor then severed part of it but blood still flowed out.
Her intestine was untied and she hurried to drink water then received food; the tumor did not recede immediately but eventually, it shrank rather than protruding further until her sutures were removed.
The tumor within her colon was removed; it ceased to enlarge and she departed from the area, after which I did not know what Allah had planned for her further.
Chapter Seven and Thirty-Two.
In the section on Surgery of Ulcers.
If a pear falls into the ulcer and swells, it is called an 'column' if it is flat white; if thick at the bottom and curved, it is called 'ulnar.' As we mentioned in the division, if treated as described, it does not heal.
I saw a hot ulcer that had become slimy, and it was appropriate to cut it, with its parts being curved; it did not have length or color (redness), pus, or any sensation, so one should avoid cutting it.
If there is an ulcer on the disease, if you see it with bloating and length as described, have it sit in the sun's rays and press its tongue with the instrument described then extract the pus from the 'ulnar.'
It pulls it downward and is cut with one of the two instruments you mentioned in section 'The Two Stitches,' but do not cut more than necessary, otherwise if cut excessively, it will be harmed further by voice and speech loss.
Then, after the cut is made as we described in the section on cutting the loins, it should be treated until healed; if the wound from the cut requires treatment, one should use what is found therein without fear or alarm and direct its head to the stone with a sharp medicine.
Then, close the mouth with the device we mentioned and then take the sharp hot water as described in Chapter One and knead it without lighting a fire or making it thin and fill from it this cavity of the device like so: [Image Caption].
The part where the medicine is placed will have a cavity like that of a spoon; place the device with the medicine on its own and the injury pressed against it so that from within its loop no saliva can escape but something enters into it. [Image Caption].
Then, hold the medicine with your hand and crush it on its own for about half an hour until you see that it has turned black and the drug's flavor is felt; if desired, take a camel thorn from one end of the rod and bruise it in the medicine. [Image Caption].
The marrow enters through a catheter placed above until it adheres to the membrane; then repeatedly until you have achieved the desired amount of grape extract, after which it will soften and drip off within three or four days, prompting the need to reinsert the drug again.
After the patient has cleansed around the grape extract with a suction catheter in cold fat, they are dried off and then moistened with cold water, treated externally through compresses and internally using purgatives until they recover; this type of treatment calms both pain and fear.
The physician also gently treats the patient and internally administeres fumigations of this kind; they take Fothynge, Zoopas, Sagatron, Terebinthine, Hellebore, Conium maculatum, etc., gathering all or some from herbs in a vessel and steeping them in the liquid.
The vessel, lined with the shell of the brain and featuring a hole on top as its cover is constructed from silver or copper for this condition:.
The side in which the pomegranate is placed inside the mouth of the diseased part reaches up to the passage through the tube until the channel hardens as much as possible, then it returns repeatedly until it becomes soaked. Make this treatment when the tumor first occurs.
It is often increased in the tumor and it should be done when its harsh tumor subsides, take this instrument, carry a chicken feather on one end of it so as not to burn the mouth of the diseased part.
Because the chicken feather prevents the heat from burning the mouth, and this is a good treatment with its safety.
The Eighth and Thirtieth Chapter.
In the discharge of tonsils and what grows from the throat besides that. (This would refer to related symptoms or complications in a medical context.)
Often a bone or fish scales grow in the throat, something else as well. It is advisamo to remove them when they have appeared on sight after binding the tongue with an instrument under the sunlight. (This would refer to the process of treating and removing growths from the throat.)
To show you what is in the throat, and what has not shown to you and moved within it should be cleared of disease before its food digests in its stomach, lest something rotten or bulging escapes by vomiting or the diseased person coughs up a piece of cloth or hair. (This describes an instruction on how to examine for obstructions in the throat and prevent them from causing harm during the digestion process.)
He wraps the tip of a piece of dry bread or takes a strip of fine sea sponge, attaches it to a thread, and then secures it; if it reaches the location of the thorns, it quickly pulls the thread to achieve this multiple times.
Often, the thorn or bone in it gets stuck and comes out; if not as mentioned above, then a tool of glass was used on this image:.
It is thicker than a laryngoscope, its end has an opening that the inflamed goes into in its loop gently and lifts upwards while sparingly touching his pharynx to prevent sneezing or pushing out the bone or thorn with it, or enters it by the doctor's hand.
Inserting the inflamed object for it to better know the location of the embedded item and pushing it down or lifting it with his hand using a tool, all depending on what suits him until it comes out.
The ninth and thirtieth chapters.
In the case of an embedded object in the esophagculeda or pharynx.
If the treatment of the pharynx as mentioned in the section was by medication and it did not succeed then at dusk, examine his throat with the tool I described to you.
Indeed, by placing your sight on the pus, attract it with a small syringe or a gentle suction tube. If you cannot do so using these methods, then take a hollow pipe and insert it near the affected area close to the pus, and then introduce a sealed container into the cavity of the pipe.
He does this several times until the ailment is weaned off water for an entire day, then he takes a filled ewer of cold water and opens his mouth in it, pumps from it without spitting out any drops, and moves the water after him as soon as his hands touch.
If the pus falls on the spot if you feel wet with water, it will not come out as we described but evaporate in stool and tar using a device that was mentioned to be used by hairdressers, do this repeatedly until it drops.
The operation at the pipe is to take a jar heated by fire and a jar covered with a lid in the middle of which there are holes connected to the device, receive the pipe, put the illness into his mouth on one end of the pipe, and then close his mouth until it's realized that the smoke from the jar has reached its circumference.
The title of the section is: "The membrane drops into place; if it does not drop, one may breathe again multiple times and endure thirst until healed with salt, onion, and does not drink water, so that it will eventually be expelled through this treatment, as shown by an image of a device to attract the membrane from the abscess.
He resembles the Kalahib, as you see, but with this filtering that enters into the abscess and its end is like a bird's beak in it, sharply blunted if it tightens on something it did not leave.
Another device grips the tongue and is a wide ring of iron up to nine times over the length of the tongue, enters the mouth on one side so that without effort from the illness the mouth remains open until it cannot be removed by pinching.
The device that opens the mouth on this measure with its eye.
Chapter forty-four.
It makes the words of the tumors and separates them. (Assuming this is a title or header for an Arabic surgical text discussing techniques to deal with abscesses.)
Abscesses come in many kinds, as mentioned one by one in this book; they differ from each other in their bursting and separation methods regarding two aspects of the type of abscess itself and what follows from its moisture. (This seems to be a summary or heading for an Arabic text on different types and treatments of abscesses.)
The second type, when it occurs in the body because the tumor in the head is not the accidental tumor in the hip and the tumor in the thigh position is not the accidental tumor in the joint of each one.
And of tumors that should not be confused except after the pus matured and completed, among them some should be distinguished and are similar to those nearing joints.
Because if the tumor occurs near a joint and takes time until it heals around it, perhaps to corrode ligaments or nerves of that joint causing delay in that limb or the tumor is close to a body part.
Because if the lump is delayed until it matures, then damaged by that main part or to be close to a hip and should not have been distinguished as a tumor but has not reached full maturity nearing the hip so that the pus does not penetrate into the interior of the hip causing destruction of Nāsir.
And in some cases it becomes unrecognizable, and should know the time of tumors that have fully matured which is when there is pain at the site of the tumor, redness, deficiency of color, swelling, protrusion of the head of the tumor, and all other signs.
It is necessary to expect the scrotum below the position of the tumor, if possible, so that it will be easier for threading downward or in a lower position from the tumor and more tense; the scrotum should go along the body if the tumors are towards the hands and arms.
In all anatomical positions without deviation, and in those that bend, the scrotum should follow accordingly; if the tumor is in the meatier regions, it should leave as well.
Until maturity as we have said is complete, if you have threaded it before then prolong the discharge from it and it was very pus-like and sticky, and perhaps its hairs and skin hardened; some tumors may adhere to the body's surface when necessary or according to what they need.
One scrotum should be used for small tumors, and a wide one or many slits according to the size of the tumor; some tumors may harden the skin and cut if they have become like tears.
Up to the point where someone has died in a manner often seen in dabīlāt (diapers) and kham'a (swaddling clothes), from which an incision is made that opens at three angles, and part of it is cut off resembling paper sacks of donkey milk.
From it, curvilinear incisions and crescentic inciseby its nature similar to other types of cuts are used, which do not have a head resembling flattened tumors; only simple ligatures should be applied, and if the tumor is large and has collected considerable duration, it may be necessary for the fat to protrude completely when extracted.
But it is taken out gradually, and the tumor is tightened for another day; then some fat is also extracted in stages until all are removed.
Especially if the condition is weak or a pregnant woman, or a small child, or an elderly person; the animal spirit often resolves with the extraction of fat in stages; sometimes when the patient dies and you don't feel it so beware this issue very carefully.
After removing such tumors, it should be cleaned and examined to see if the wound of the tumor is small or the incision was a simple one; then use linen thread from hemp or silk for stitching, especially if the tumor is large and there are many incisions.
It is proper for the tubes to enter every crevice until they reach each other, even if part of the tumor has been cut from or shrunk in the skin. It should be covered with cotton wool or catgut that is not moist and pressed into place on the third day.
Then, remove it and treat with the appropriate bandages until he recovers; if there is bleeding during your work, use cold water and salt after they have drunk a decoction of catgut at the site of the bleed repeatedly.
The bleeding should be managed with the dressing, treatment, and refreshments as we have described in this book, especially those frequently mentioned; since it is winter time and the tumor location is very sensitive, use olive oil infusion or a hot oil for irrigation.
Place it on the site, and if it is summer with fatty locations, carry the dressing using a drink or oil-oil that is cold until by the third day as we said healed and removed the tumor and cleaned it.
In treating it until recovery, this is what you need to know about tumor treatment and the detailed method, as each tumor suggests its own method of being bandaged and summarized.
Surgical Instruments Chapter Forty-Four.
In the case of tumors presenting on the scalp skin.
Tumors on the scalp present small ones, which come in types that are encapsulated and have conditions as if they were a hen's comb with various kinds; some being fatty while others resemble mucous secretion.
And among them, there are those with a resemblance to dense mucus and syrup-like consistency as well as others that approach it; some being encapsulated solidly without any risk upon their opening and secretion of contents not causing issues when they're incised surgically.
The work in opening them should first be done using the instrument as it appears after this, named 'al-madss,' until you know what type has a continuous secretion; incision along its length is simply made according to this image: [Note that an illustration or detailed description of the "al-madss" tool and the surgical procedure would typically follow in the original Arabic textbook.]
Begin the incision from line ~b~ to line ~c~. If moisture escapes, empty the bag that contained the moisture and cut off all of it, leaving nothing behind. Often something remains if any is left over.
Then immerse the compress in warm water if at home, or in saltwater elsewhere, filling it to soak the wound and leave it until the next day when it consumes what remains of the bag, then reapply the second warm, third as needed depending on how much healing has occurred.
Proceed to treat the wound with bandages until it heals, if there is no more of the bag left; remove a tumor that has become fatty on this image:.
Make an incision and tie off the artery at each end of the wound, pull out a tumor contained within it; if you face any opposition from surrounding tissue or as described afterwards, also address fibrosis in the tumor if present.
Conduct treatment as mentioned, and find it easier to excise a solid tumor since it has less blood and moisture; some of these head tumors in certain people may not have residual fluid, thus they were easy to remove.
Title: An elderly woman's tumor hardened and white as marble, which could not be broken even if thrown at a face, and all other tumors on the head were like those found in boys' heads.
Upon removing the eardrums, he separated them completely and made their edges simple to facilitate the flow of material downward, then treated it according to what was agreed upon in treatment.
The second chapter and forty pages.
In the case of tumors that frequently appear in the throat, these tumors are found in the neck and under the eyelids, on both ears, throughout the body, with one type being numerous and originating from within each other.
Each pig of them is found inside its gullet as it is with the substances and head tumors as we have described, there are many types of these pigs that are hardened and some arise from moisture while others are difficult to treat.
What I saw of them was healthy upon touch, their appearance closely resembled skin color and moved to all sides, with no crushing by throat muscles or swelling or veins. It was necessary to make a simple incision from above downward on the body in this manner along line A to line B:
She should be drawn out from all sides and the skin edges widened with a scalpel or two or many needles as mentioned previously in head tumors, and slightly extracted until pulled onto a pole without severing blood vessels or nerves, and the instrument not overly hardened.
Do not extend your hand in cutting or the patient becomes anxious to cut what is not needed, resulting in severing a blood vessel or nerve and hindering work on the wound with ground lime or some poultices that cauterize bleeding.
The wound was tightened and left until the tumor bulge subsided, and the wound rested and indicated healing; when blood is bleeding at that time return to work until emptied, then examine with your clean fingers if it has closed, then pinch off any small new growths and disinfect them.
Originally the pig had a significant amount of blood, so it should not be cut off from its source but rather tied with a fine ligature and left until it falls off harmlessly before bandaging the wound in white silk gauze that has been soaked in an Egyptian embalming resin.
"And if the pig is cut completely, it should gather the shaft of the wound and twist it for an hour after learning that there are no remnants of pus; but if you see that a residue of the pig's bone remains.
"It should mean cutting to its origin and essence, using the suture technique that we mentioned earlier, from pigs exposed to moisture treated with simple salt baths where you can see their maturity stage, make the swelling go down as we said.
"Then use after the swelling with the Egyptian poultice and its method to eat what remains of the decay, until you see that the wound has been effectively treated with poultices made from boiled meat until it heals.
"The third chapter and forty.
"In the throat cavity, there is a tumor occurring inside the pharynx.
"The ancients mentioned this cavity in the throat and I have not seen anyone make it in our land, nor has its description been spoken by them; but those who slaughter should avoid the throat cavity when they do not cut there.
"To make all the arteries and lungs sick, for those who have a tumor in the mouth or pharynx or two lobules if it is not due to an obstruction in the duct then one should use throat cavity excision to escape from the defect that causes suffocation.
It was necessary that we open the pharynx under three circles from the tube or four small cuts across with two circles in between so that the slit is at the sagittus and not on the ridge, and this position agreamoes with the incision.
Because it is muscle-less and the blood vessels are distant, the surgeon Jibbana had to extend the pharyncu's skin with a scalpel then cut through the skin until reaching the tube beside the blood vessels when seen from them.
Then he cuts the sagittus that we described, and infers cutting the tube from the bulge which exits with what swells and where sound is interrupted leaving the wound open for a time if the fear of suffocation subsided when it gathered scales on the wound.
He cut it alone from the ridge then he used the medicines that promote muscle to make him recover, said the person who wrote this book, interpreting these words we have told as if they were saying only when the disease closed its tube with one of these tumors you mentioned.
As the patient approaches death, they themselves cut a hole in their palate to breathe at the site of the injury, taking some breaths and then dying peacefully. They were ordered to leave the wound open until the barrier of illness is completed, which takes approximately three days.
At that time, they were ordered to stitch the wound and treat it until he recovered, which I witnessed with my own eyes as she took a knife and sent him to cut his throat on purpose. She tied him up for treatment and found that he was eating like someone who had been poisoned; when the wound was uncovere d, they discovered the injury.
They found the blood flowing from the wound running, and believed she had not bled or gushed; that air would escape from the wound made them stitch it up and treat until he recovered, without showing anything to the attendant except a hoarse voice.
And after some days he returned to better condition, and from this we say that a hole in the palate is not dangerous.
The fourth and forty chapter.
The incision on the tumor that presents in the esophagus from outside and is called the throat lining.
This tumor called "Phlegma of the throat" is a large tumor on the body color and it is mostly in women, there are two types.
Either it is natural and either it is apparent, as the natural one there is no cure for it, whereas the apparent one occurs in two types: one resembling fatty substances and the other resembnig a tumor that involves tangled vessels with danger in its passage. It should not be exposed in the open except if it was small, if she recovered and was examined with a magnifying glass it resembled fatty substances and did not involve anything from the organ so that it passed like on fats. Extract it by wrapping around from a bag if in a bag, otherwise examine all of them and treat the spot as should be treated.
The fifth and forty-fourth chapter.
In the passage of types of substances.
The substances have many types and all of them were mentioned in the division, so let's inform here the difference between substance and extract when it is problematic: Extract comes with heat and pus and fearsome ailments until the fever abates. He completes the application of the ointment, at which point the fever and pain are alleviated, and the substance is without heat or fever and ailments; it is enclosed in a sack-like bag with its own coverture, resembling the color of the body, initially like hemp seeds and later becoming more solidified.
He was on two types, either ointment or humidity and moisture colors being plenteby what you mentioned in the division; it should be that upon reaching treatment of the substance to sterilize and inspect it first with the instrument called a spatula as appears in this gate behind.
Measure the size of the tumor, then remove the spatula and inspect what comes out in its trace; if it is a simple break away color as you mentioned throughout the masses, or if there was no removal from the effect of the spatula, know that it is ointment.
He made a firm break on this image as I informed you, and labeled it with the urn while carefully peeling off the skin from each side and keeping it in a bag if he could successfully extract it correctly along with the substance.
Then the sac ruptures during the operation and its contents do not empty properly, often requiring that it be cut piece by piece until nothing is left; if anything remains, there will be less or more in quantity than usual.
In cases where the tumor ruptures, there are bleeding spots and seal the wound with fine sutures; apply a heated poultice over it to combat the infection and treat it with complete remedies until cured, but her condition was severe and she was treated using a mixture that soothes.
He presented with a pustular rash or non-pustular, accompanied by bleeding gushing from the wound site; treat it by applying powdered ointment and leaving it tightened for two to three days until the ulcer heals and blood clotting occurs, then return what remains of the remedy.

Probe for removing tumors, surgical incisions, sores, and protrusions that extracts bones or other materials inside is a spherical spoon-shaped instrument made from tin alloy (Chinese), also possible brass, bronze, copper, or better yet one made of silver.
Probes have also been made of black lead to heal sores, used for probing which has a blade that folds over the probe and is also known as three types: long, medium, and short because of their various lengths.
The probe's handle is adjusted to the length of each curet and made as thick or thin as necessary for the size of the curet, image of a large lead probe.

It is made from copper or brass tubes bent slightly in length as you see, they should be large and small for clots at your side to quickly cut blood when needed and without medication.
But it is not used in cutting blood from every part of the body, but rather in the muscular locations such as the leg and thigh muscles, arm muscles, and breast muscles and similar moist muscular parts.
They can also be made into small devices similar to apple quarters on this image:.
He is cut by the blood if he bleeds from the fissure or near the vein, and a swelling can be seen on this picture.
The Seventh Section Forty-four.
In treating male livestveal animals.
The animal resembling the female is swollen in men when they reach a certain dream state until it looks like a pale and inflamed vulva, so one should desirably make an incision on the animal's skin according to this shape.
From line b to line c: (This instruction does not provide a context for translation, so I assume it refers to instructions within an image or diagram related to the Albucasis textbook) The area between these two lines should be considered as per your request. Please note that without additional context or visuals, this is only a structural indication and may not accurate in terms of surgical guidance from Albucasis' work. Then, excrete all the fat and then fill the wound with a cataplasm remedy; gather the edge of the wound with sutures and treat it until it heals completely. The animal's testicles should descend to the bottom, and rest the bone as shown for women. (This instruction refers to Albucasis' surgical techniques prescribed in his medical texts.)
It was desirable to make incisions at the top edges with two crescent-shaped cuts, each connecting to one another at their ends until the larger line is encircled by the smaller on this image: (This instruction describes a specific surgical technique depicted in an illustration from Albucasis' medical texts.) From Line ~b~ to Line ~c~, then unroof the skin between the fissures and extract the fatty tissue and use what we mentioned with sewing and stitching and whatever it needs from treatment until healed.
It was not fitting for you to take the piece that should be removed due to concern over the patient or before bleeding occurred, it was necessary to cover the wound with compressed silk in a tight bandage and leave it until the fat consumed what remained, then treat it until healed.
The eighth and forty-fourth chapter.
In the fold of tumors that are exposed under a bandage.
These tumors that are exposed under a bandage are of the type of hardened cysts enclosed in a bag, from which moisture is secreted and with it more fluid came out should be incised vertically according to this method.
From Line ~b~ to Line ~c~, if all that was in the tumor has been drained during the treatment and left wrapped for another day then remove the silk bandage.
And treat it with the appropriate bandage until healed, if the tumor was of the type of cystic nodes excised as we mentioned cutting on cysts whether the wound extended to form a callus then use in it what we have provided for them respectively.,
Chapter 9 and 40.
In the section where a tumor that has been previously exposed by vessels or veins is named Enurisma.
If the vessel or vein is injured and the skin over it frequently becomes exposed, a tumor will be revealed as well as in some cases to the vessels.
The signs known as Inorema if the tumor and swelling were previously from a vessel or vein, will be characterized by being elongated together in body depth if it was originally from the vessel, and you will feel with your finger that it has spines.
Which is from the vein, the tumor will be round on the body surface, and there is great danger especially if it is in the neck, throat, or head, and many places of the body where treatment with iron should be avoided.
Also from swelling of the vessel mouth in the lips or head, which should be avoided, where a crack opened on the skin long and then burst into blisters causing the vessel to slough off and recover.
Until it opens, then underneamo insert a needle and insert it to the other side, pulling the vessel with a threaded silk in two positions on what you know from the blood vessels in the two bags; then squeeze with the instrument at the place between the knots until all the blood comes out.
The tumor is resolved, then the treatment that generates pus until the threads fall off, and it is treated with bandages agreed upon in this regard until healed.
It was a tumor that required the vessel to be clamped by your hand as much as possible from the tumor with the skin, then insert a needle below the place you held and thread it through until it comes out on the other side. Then the tumor is securely tied according to what was mentioned to you in tying off an apricot from both sides with a thread, I feared that the threads would slip so I inserted another needle with another thread all over the tumor at the intersection of the first neede.
You tied your threads in four positions then you cut the tumor at its center until what is inside comes out, so clip off a piece of skin and leave whatever was attached, then place on it an ointment that I had dipped into wine and oil. Then the treatment using bandages and casts until healed.
Section Fifty.
In the brain, displaying a nerve root.
As the tumor in the nerve and vein is also displayed as a tumor in the brain if there has been a blow or an excessive fatigue, it would be more so at the lumbosacral levels and lower back.
And in each location, the joints move and a reddish tumor resembling the color of the body is seen; it usually occurs without pain but if pressed hard causes numbness similar to anesthesnce and the tumor is not clustered deep within the tissue.
But it is beneath the skin and moves to all sides without going forward or backward, so if found in joints it should not be exposed to iron as that may occur at a certain time, or if present in the head or forehead.
Pull the skin back, and if small grasp it with a knife and cut from its root or if large hang it on a string and slough off then remove and gather the wound with sutures and treat until healed.
Chapter on Surgery and Fifty Procedures.
In the segment of thread that is shown in the abdhem.
It is often found in many people's intestines and throughout their bodies: a thread called the parasite similar to worms, originally fine with a thick head that has transformed its teeth into small ones, but still retaining large jaws.
A man with intestines contained threadworms resembling worms, the original fine body having transformed into split teeth that continually secrete moisture; he expelled them and weighed approximately eighty-four ounces in one case, and sixty in another.
The procedure of cutting them was such that one might regard the infestation as moist, with the threadworms' original white body being split and thrown into your kitchen fire to produce a great amount of blood upon severance.
As the blood flowed, I saw the infestation as a lump and was struck with fear at cutting it using an iron thread; he took a piece of pencil lead and tightened around the threadworms which had this characteristic then left for two days before tightening the pencil lead further.
Whenever thorny splinters are deeply embedded until they break and fall from their own weight, the original callus will disappear as it is naturally broken up partly out of fear and shame, especially when in the abdomen, but part of it may be separated.
Then the wound is shaped into a lump, then treated until it heals; beware of exposing any callus that has become slightly less sensitive as it may appear benign in view but is actually a cancerous tumor which brought to mind cancer after this.
The second and fiftieth chapter.
In the treatment of ear wounds.
Otitis is due to many reasons, either from the rupture of a cyst that breaks out on the abdinal skin showing up in the forehead area or from blood discharging through a vessel or vein and spreading forward, or possibly from pus originating from a duct or canal, or possibly from congestion behind.
It was previously a ruptured cyst that the lump's color resembles body color and is soft without pain, showing up in different conditions. And if it was previously a discharge with the characteristics we described, there would be a greater difference if you touch it and then recede; perhaps a scab forms on it and swells significantly upon entering the bathroom or severe fatigue, but previously being moisture, it is soft.
There is no absence if you press it with your hands and neither does it increase nor decrease; indeed, in the case of blood, when it shows these signs, the tumor turns to blackness, and as for meat from a sheep's kidney, the tumor remains firmly established and proven by one measure.
It was soft to the touch, and in that case one should observe that it came from blood vessels or veins or airways; therefore, it is recommended not to treat it due to fear and cowardice as I have informed you in the section where I mentioned tumors arising from blood vessels and veins.
It was a hernia or swelling, and it is recommended to bind the disease so that it holds itself up straight and extended before you learn everything about the swelling. Then it is commanded to lift between your hands on top of the swelling, then pierce with a wide needle around the swelling in the place you learned about with the thread, and lengthen until above a large signet ring; then securely tie the piercing point with a strong silk cord.
The ligament has loops, which open in the center of a tightened swelling over the ligament and insert your little finger into it; if you find that the loop has taken hold of the loops, push them back with your fist and bring the pouch inside, and if you find a thorn, enlarge it with a syringe.
Cut off the stump, if it obstructs a vessel or constricts a vein then return to your work and take two needles; insert strong threads into them and let the syringes enter the lump formed around the tumor which they have created, then pull the tumor towards four points on the needle.
If you withdraw the needle and leave it until the swollen meat becomes rotten or falls off by itself, if it peels or is cut, then handle it as necessary with bandages until healed; a case of hidden matter in his thighs.
Or from moisture as we said, let the tumor come out and expel blood or fluid that you find in it; then handle it appropriebly according to the position.
The third chapter fifty.
In the treatment of cancer.
We mentioned in the division of types of cancer and how to treat it with drugs, along with a warning against treating with iron as it may bleed, and we talked about ovarian cancer and cautioning against its treatment.
The early authors noted that cancer in places where it can be completely removed, like those found in the thigh or foot and from other limbs that are capable of expelling it through excision, especially if they are small beginnings; but when large, one should not approach them closely.
One who managed to be healed from it and I have not seen before was able to reach that, the work in which if one is capable as we mentioned, cancer progresses easily from a dark occurrence, then spreads outwardly if found within an organ fully filled with lymn/tumor.
Then the tumor establishes in a place where one can work on it, then comes to a cancer that heals from all sides with the skin over it upon examination until nothing remains of its origin and the blood flows freely without rupturing.
Indeed, in the current position and stop the thick blood all with your hand or as much as you can by means of tools; if it obstructs during work, bleed a great deal from arteries or veins until the blood ceases then treat it completely to make him recover.
The Fourth and Fifty Section.
In treating hernias.
We have been told in the section that there are types of edema, how water accumulation occurs and signs for each type, and its treatment with drucuits; only the varicose kind is treated exclusively by iron medications and neither the dropsical nor the swollen meat kinds approach it.
Indeed, if you have treated this type of hernia (varicose) with medications and the treatment did not work, consider that perhaps it was due to a great weakness or there is another illness besides hernia such as being chronically constipated.
Bowel incontinence or diarrhea and related conditions should be treated with iron; if the illness appeared to have strength, it is not another disease besides hernia alone and it was not a young man nor an old man and their work does not allow them to rest while treating. The servant behind him presses his abdab with both hands and pushes the water downwards towards the side of the affected area, then takes a branched implement depicted in this image.
The two-ended tool, resembling a spatula except for some protruding teeth at the end, is used to irritate the pouch during work, then discard it after use as it generates waste from the intestines.
It should be dug a trench from the liver downwards three finger-widths towards the flank, if it was previously generated by a bile disease, dig a smooth trench from the liver with three fingers to the flank; if generated by jaundice, dig on the right side with three fingers.
Also, the dig should be on the side to which the patient wishes to lean so as not to let curiosity lead them into that weak position, then poke their skin with a pin, and insert your hand in the hole while raising your arm.
With the spatula between the skin and fascia as if you're peeling it off, make an incision about fingernail deep or so, then puncture the fascia until the spatula reaches a hollow place that is the water spot, then withdraw it and insert in the hole the tool depicted by her.
He was a semi-tube made from thin tubing of silver, copper, or ebonyware varnished with black paint on the bottom with two small holes and three sides each having one hole and one side having only one hole as you see.
He has placed a quill on the pen holder as in this image:.
In the upper part, there is a clock mechanism that if water reaches it, it will drip from its reservoir onto the device. It holds an average amount of water because you should not empty it more than necessary in case the sickness resolves through the separation of animal spirits.
Or if it shows that he is near death, empty it to the extent of its power and according to what your illness indicates from its pulse strength and color, then the device will expel water and contain it again as it encases its reseramolet
Because of the skin that holds onto the hole on the handle indicated to be unblocked for that condition, then the device will resume another day if you see the illness is likely due to that.
Additionally, water from a slow-flowing source is to be done over the body for days; while leaning forward and avoiding mistakes until only clear water remains. If there is looseness of bowels, most of the water will remain, in which case it should be buried in hot sand.
He heavily sweated in the bathhouse and under the sun, be on a fast to relieve thirst and treat it with dried medicines until he recovers; defecate and urinate as described earlier.
The Fifth Chapter and Five Hundred.
In treating children who are born with unstripped meconium or whose urethral openings are narrow, or not in the usual place.
Some boys may be born from the mother's womb without stripping their meconium and it is necessary to prompt a penile opening within an hour of birth.
With a very delicate bandage on this image:. (Note: There is no translation needed here as it's an instruction for handling or attaching a caption to an image.)
Then place a fine needle in the opening and secure it, holding for three days or four if urination has not occurred yet; remove when urine flows through that outlet, unless the needle falls off before this time. (Note: This is based on historical medical practices which are no longer recommended.)
As for the one whose hole is narrow, it should be treated with lead as we have mentioned for many days until it widens; and those whose holes are not in their proper place, from them some will produce a hole at the end of the canal so that they cannot defecate forward.
Until the protrusion raises with his hand to above and he cannot produce before that so as not for the urine to reach the bladamoor on its own accord, resulting in a very foul pus; the treatment involves lifting the affliction onto his back.
Then his canal is lengthened by your left hand greatly and the protrusion's head is pierced with a needle or sharp instrument as if cutting something to be its middle resembling a canal, where the hole falls in the center appropriately.
And at your work, to prevent much bleeding exposes it prone to cutting the blood and treating the wound until healing occurs.
The sixth paragraph fifty. (This appears to be a section title indicating "The Sixth Chapter, Fifty".)
In the pustule that appears in the wrapping, canal, blackness, and putrefaction, and adhesion of the wrapper to the canal. (This could be a heading or section title discussing skin conditions involving the anus.)
Frequently, this pustule shows in the inflammation and is a sign of putridity; it can be either mild or severe. The milder one should be suspended with fine gauze.
He is cut off and thoroughly cleansed, then a soaked cotton gauze is applied over the Egyptian bandage; after that, it is treated with the linen compress until it heals. If the pustule is putrid in color, one should use the ointment thereafter being cut and cleaned off.
If the pustule is not fully excised and some are inside while others are outside, one should first remove those from within; if it closes up, then treat those on the surface thereafter.
If you have not secured the dressing from leaking, and it also presents as blackness or putrefaction in both genders within the bandage, one should consider that everything which has turned black or is at risk of decay be removed.
Then treat it with honey and a mixture of ground pomegranate peels, rose water, and camphor; subsequently follow the complete treatment until healed. If there is bleeding present on this image, use a crescent-shaped clamp as follows: (please note that without an actual image or description of it, I cannot provide further details).
Thus the cow is beneficial for both conditions, as it stops bleeding and heals wounds if they become infected. It swallows its own uterus in time to enter the penis tube with a glass pipe to treat the affliction, and likewise, the attachment of the bag to the cow.
And this attachment only occurs when it is correctly wrapped, and should not be torn apart; previously the attachment has been exposed by a wound or tumor which should expel it with tweezamoose until the knot unravels and the bag escapes from all sides.
The difficulty in distinguishing it during examination lies in extracting something from the bag and the covering, as the covering is delicate so that if it leaks quickly, then separating between the cover and the bag by a gentle scratch may cause the fine threads to be coated with cold water so that they do not adhere.
Then it is treated with a compressive drink until healed.
The Seventh chapter and fifty.
For purifying the boys and treating what they have shown to be wrong.
Knotting is not something that does not separate the connection as seen in other surgeries, but only when we have done so out of our will and used it on boys specifically where we must depict its best work.
The easiest way to safety, I say the preliminaries are not mentioned by them in any of their books because it was not used in their jurisdictcuation and only what we have acquired.
In the experiment, I found that the audience of craftsmen and barbers use sterilization with a razor and scissors, as well as using the needle and threading by finger and cutting by fingernail, all of which have been tried out.
I did not find a better sterilization method than with the scissors and sewing by thread because the sterilization with the razor was often causing pain to the skin as the skin covering of the wrap had two layers, perhaps the upper layer was cut off and the lower layer remained.
I was forced to cut another and the patient complained of pain in sterilization with needle because perhaps he entered through a wound, and as for sterilangs by fingernail maybe it injured the skin and spoiled your work or naturally the child's skin is short.
They often cause this without needing sterilization and I have seen that, as for the experimentation showed preference for scissors and thread sewing because the razor was proportionate to cut needed from above like the skin below.
Once your hand was measured for the two scissors, which were cut to a single size and at one time during the sewing of the rope-like thread for an epidural hernia patch from all skin edges without any cutting error, the first step is to deceive the youth.
Particularamoυnt إذا كان أحد يفهم بشكل زائد أنك بغض النظر عن ربط الخيط في الإحليقة فقط وتسميه الى يوم آخر ثم إلغاؤه وأخطاؤه ، فإنك بالفعل أعدته لأنك قد يقبله كل شيء من قبل الآخرين وذلك بصراحة ، ثم إيقظه بين يديك فوق الأسطح.
The scissors should not be placed in a pocket or under the foot where the young person's eyes are located without any cutting error, nor on anything related to tools, then enter your hand into the incision and inflate it within the skin until the tip of the incision exits through the head.
Then cleanse what has accumulated in it from dirt, then tie the instructed spot with a twine and then securely attach to the bottom using another knot followed by holding thumb and index finger at the lower tied point for firm attachment and cut between the two knots. Then lift the skin to the surface quickly and remove the incision point, then let the blood drain for a while as it is better with less risk of infection; afterwards, dry it using wet gauze and dust it with powdered parched sesame seeds or pounded henna which has also been found effective.
Then lift the skin to the surface quickly and remove the incision point, then let the blood drain for a while as it is better with less risk of infection; afterwards, dry it using wet gauze and dust it with powdered parched sesame seeds or pounded henna which has also been found effective. Then place the bandages on top of each other from boiled egg white soaked in rose water, rubbed with a good quality crushed rose oil, and leave it until the next day; then treat it completely to cure.
This is an image of a scalpel used for sterilization:.
The incisions made by the needle are straight with no curvature, and their length is equal to that of the jaws (the handles). As for incision during sterilangs, it should be deep enough so as not to crinkle or partially pierce the skin when cutting; hence you would want to stretch them from your finger joints for a minute.
It is cut on a level (surface), but if you cannot grasp it with your fingers, use tweezebers to pick and cut; then leave it for three days until the abscess underne. The area remains swollen and inflamed until heat settles in and spontaneously sloughs off.
Cut it according to what you deem suitable, and keep from the scalpel head that something from the scalpel head does not harm it; treat it as we described in the article on abrasions.
If cutting the skin beyond a certain extent and it shrinks on top, this also does not harm greatly; treat as we mentioned until it heals.
Chapter Eighty-Five.
On treating an obstructed bladder in the saddle.
A blocked bladder in the saddle is due to a stone, clotted blood or sloughed tissue and similar substances; if treated as we described in the section on fluid removal.
And the urine has not passed, and I saw that it was previously blocked by a stone causing trouble in the urethra; let the condition become stationary on its back and then ride with one leg up to his chest and stretch out his abdn and grasp the swelling himself as much as possible.
Then the urethra is forced to push the stone back, but it did not pass as we mentioned and the condition worsens in the patient; then use the device called Catheterisma which has this form:.
"Create a very fine silk tube filled with silver, about the length of an eagle's feather and half its breadth, with a gentle clamp at the top; it is designed to attract the bile so that two twisted threads are tied on each end, one made of wool or good quality cotton.
"One end of the thread is inserted into the bottom part of the catheter, and a suction pump draws some substance from the wool through it to seal off the tube like a plug; then the catheter is greased with oil or butter or egg yolk and the patient sits on a chair.
"The bladder and the catheter are inserted gently into the irrigation with wet ointments or oil, water-soaked cloths; then the catheter is pushed through to reach the source of the irrigation and it is angled upwards towards privacy, then pulled back inside.
"Until the irrigation has been angled and the canthus pulled back inside until it is close to the vagina, if a male patient leans down, the catheter remains in place within, then pushed up again until reaching the bladader, at which point the patient feels that something empty has reached.
But this is done because the vein through which urine flows has twitching, then the thread is pulled tightly for a short while so that the urine follows the wool, and it is extracted and urine is squeezed out, and the catheter is returned.
Thus, it continues to be done until the bladnix empties and the patient finds relief.
Chapter Nine Hundred Fifty.
How to catheterize the bladder with a tube.
And the tools that are made to perform this task are tubes of silver or ivory, hollow with a long tube on a smooth plate and meant for water and medicine to flow through it, known as the catheter, and its image is as follows: (Note: The last part of the sentence would typically be followed by an illustration in historical texts. Since this task specifies not adding anything beyond translating, the instruction ends here.)
It is made of silver or ivory, hollow with a long tube on smooth leather throughout all its parts; two holes are covered from one side and one hole from the other as you see. (Note: Since this task specifies not adding anything beyond transluting, there's no further elaboration provided.)
And the middle position where you place your catheter reaches as far as necessary until something moist is drawn in, then if pushed it moves towards a distance equivalent to what the cleaner makes with throwing oil during sea battles. (Note: The phrase "throwing oil" may refer to an old naval technique or metapebrphor for maneuvering objects through water; specific historical context would provide clarity.)
If you want to introduce moisture into the cistern, insert one end of the siphon in the moisture and pull up with a pump; then the moisture will be drawn into the body of the siphon before entering the discharge on according to what we described in the Chapter on Pumps.
This moisture reaches the cistern until it is felt by the ailment, and this gentle image also pierces into the cistern.
It is made of silver or brass, with a small lid on top resembling the stopper, and underneeath there is an indentation where the rubber fits; then take the cistern balls and place in them the moisture you want to be drawn into the cistern before securing it between the two compartments with a tight string.
He heats that siphon slightly over fire, then the injected end enters discharge before you hold onto the cistern with the moisture pulled firmly until the ailment is felt to know that the moisture has reached the cistern.
If you have not yet prepared a cistern, make it by cutting out a piece of leather and punching holes all around it then insert a tight string as if to go round before gathering the circle like a coil after placing in it what you want from moisture, drugs, or water.
Then fix it on the apparatus and make it as you made with the pouch from your hand until the moisture reaches the pouch.
Chapter 64.
In the discharge of feces.
We mentioned that in the section on classifying types of stools and treating them with medication, we distinguished between feces generated in the intestines and those formed in the bladeball and its indicators as a whole, and mentioning that which is worked by hand or chipped.
The feces formed in the bladeball are specific and those which form during excretion, I will explain that with a detailed explanation.
I say that feces formed in the bladeball are more prevalent among young men and from its signs, that urine exits the bladder like water through a rag.
It shows sand and its mention and contamination, frequently overflowing then spreading with diarrhea prominently present in many of them, making it easy for young men to lie about reaching fourteen years old while troubling those over that age and being intermediate between the two.
He whose portion is largest should find it easier to treat, while the smaller one is harder; if we seek treatment, firstly, the patient should be injected with a needle from which all pus in it can exit upon examination, potentially preventing the presence of the abscess.
Then, the patient is suspended by their legs in a strainer and lowered for the abscess to descend to the urethral meatus or raised several times; then they sit between your hands supported with one leg under the thigh while inspecting it all moving towards downwards.
If you feel the abscess in the cavity, promptly remove it within a minute by scratching it; if it does not fall under your pinch, then use your left hand's index finger to apply grease with ointment if the patient is male or middle finger if female.
If it is a completely clean child, inspect the abscess until you feel it slightly under your finger and move it towards the urethral meatus then press it with your finger and push it outwards to where you want to make an incision.
The servant was commanded to squeeze the bladder with his hand and another servant was instructed to stretch it upward, placing their right hands under the female genitals on the side where the tear is located, then take the pointed instrument that resembles this image:.
He made an incision between the perineum and female genitals on the left side, not in the middle but to one side; the tear was on the same level, with your finger in the perineum pressing it outward slightly so that the incision is from outside widely to inside narrowly as much as possible for the fragment to be removed.
I did not press the finger in the perineum too hard at the tear to make it come out easily, but know that it may be a fragment with angles and curves making its exit difficult.
And among them a morsel resembling chestnut, with an easier curve to exit, if it had angles and curves that slightly increased in the tear, then it should not have come out like this; you should either clamp it firmly with tweezebrush-like tips.
Adjust the flap so it does not slip, or if a small delicate instrument is inserted undernehem, and it cannot be enlarged slightly by widening the gap, then cutting off some of the blood will suffice.
If it was more than one, first push the large instrument into the urethra then open it and then push the small one after that as well; do this if there are two or more, in which case you need to make a very large incision since it presents with two symptoms.
Either it dies or a chronic pus discharge occurs for the reason that it does not abscess the perineal area but attempt to push it until it protrudes, or try dilating it entirely with probes until it comes out.
If your operation on it was successful and you have been patient, but a moist incision occurs again, press it upward with oil or wine vinegar or rose water and cold water to cool the inflamed tumor then place the affliction upon your head until the ties are not dissolved by the third day.
If the abscess in place is dissolved with abundant water and oil, then treat it with a woolly poultice and balsamic plasters until healed, there will be an excess of redness and swelling as if the blood had congealed in the bladebags and prevented urine from passing through.
If you put your finger in the wound and draw out some blood, if it remains, then call for scrotal abscess and its inflammation; then wash the wangle with vinegar, water, and salt so that it can be cured by any of these treatments.
During all stages of treatment, it is necessary to tie the testicles and gather them so that the medication placed on the abscess remains; the pill was small and became in the penile ducts and bloated there and prevented urine from passing through as I have described previously before it develops into a fistula.
Often, I have relied on this treatment for the fistula and it is that you take a fragment of iron alloy wire as shown in this image:.
A sharp triangular probe inserted into the scrotum, then a thread is tied around the duct underne.so that it does not return to the bladabags; and iron wire fragment enters through the incision with care until the bead reaches the same abscess.
The muscle contracts your hand in the same compartment a little, and you push its hole until it comes out from the other side; then urine flows from its bladebag, so that your hand grasps what is left of the compartment from outside the rod: it shakes and exits with urine, healing.
This treatment does not hinder you in any way; tie a cord under the compartment and another over it, then shake on the compartment between the cords, then release it.
Then the cord dissolves and cleanses the clotted blood that has formed in the wound, so you must tie the cord under the compartment lest it return to the bladder and the other cord above lest if the cord is released after the compartment exits how much of the skin returns to its place covering the wander.
Therefore, you should elevate the skin by raising the cord above so that it returns to its place and covers the wound as we said.
The surgical section and suture.
In discharging the compartment in women.
A little while it has occurred in women that when one of them presents a compartment, she gets sick and many refuse to see the doctor because perhaps she was pregnant or the second is not allowed her woman to visit the physician.
If the woman is afflicted with a prolapse or third degree, and if you cannot find a female who can improve this craft, especially manual work, then if the position of the vault on the seat is too high in women, you need to create another opening.
In that case, the necessity required it to be that a slightly improved female physician should be taken and if there is any lack of her, seek out a male physician or an assistant as a representative for women or a woman who indicates in this craft with some indication.
Prepare her and instruct her to perform all that she is commanded regarding the examination of the vault or vulva first, then if the woman is a virgin it should be that you enter your finger into her seat and examine the vulva finding and pressing under your finger.
Then you should command her to create the opening, if she is not a virgin then for those who can, instruct your finger into her vagina and examine the vulva after placing your left hand on her perineum and squeezing it well.
It has been found that it should be inserted into the mouth of the vesicae to the end of its capacity until it reaches the origin of the fossa, then scratched near the halfway point at the origin of the fossa from either side where it arises and becomes solidified in that area.
Its edge should not be detached from the solid, and the initial incision should be small; then insert the pus into that small incision until you feel the solidity increase in the incision as much as you know that the cyst is coming out of it; understand that there are many types of cysts.
There are small and large, flat, raised, round, pear-shaped cysts with pores to identify their types for what you want; if your bleeding is profuse, tie it off at the incision site and hold it for an hour until the blood stops, then return to work.
Until the cyst has been expelled, work with the same tools you mentioned in discharging the cyst for men to help yourself in your work; if bleeding profusely, stop the blood and know that pulsating pain indicates a severed vessel at the incision site.
He became more severe, so leave him and do not return to him; leave the bandages on and do not remove them until the disease has passed away. Then treat the wound. If a collection of blood forms after several days and the position heals, then you can send him back home with the bandages still in place.
Chapter Two, Chapter Six.
In the crevice of the urinary catheter.
The urinary catheter is merely a collection of moisture in the white sac that surrounds the egg and is called the spermatic, which may be located within a special membrane known as tunica albuginea near the egg.
Until he believes it is another egg and exists between the shell of the spermatic sac and the white follicle we mentioned, with no other possibility than in a void; this catheter generates from this weakness that exposes to females the mating material, and may present itself as friction upon women.
This moisture may have many colors, either yellow or blood-red, or perhaps a darker hue, or it could be clear, and often exceeds these characteristics. The signs known by them.
Where the meeting of water is, there on the white cloth in which we said the tumor lies circularly slightly like an egg and does not show its lining because the moisture surrounds it from all sides.
And if the moisture is in a thin film, then the tumor will be circular from one side of the egg.
And therefore the person concludes that it is another egg, and if the moisture is between the lining of the stomach and the white cloth then it lies under perception, and what if you want to know the color of the moisture? Trace the tumor with the square instrument you brought the image of which, but judgment will be made upon what is inside.
If we proceed with the iron treatment for this illness it should be decreed by the ruler if possible, and I saw that its body was full then it would glow slightly on its back and put a large tear underne. Then you sit to the left of it.
And the steward commands to sit on its right side extending his hand along the lining of the stomach and towards the navel, then he takes a broad blade and shaves the lining from the middle to near the wound.
The defect appears on the line that divides the skin of the corpse into two halves until it reaches the white fascia, from which it is peeled and preserved to prevent tearing and to ensure a thicker sloughing where the egg adheres more, while examining the sloughing as much as possible.
Then the filled fascia is opened widely and all water drained out, then the incision edges are separated with pincers and extended to the top without touching the casing's skin, and cut as you can whether in one piece or into pieces.
Especially its delicate side, if you have not drained the incision so that water does not re-enter, then the egg will protrude out from its skin while you work, and as soon as it is emptied of the sloughing pieces, gather together with a needle.
Then treat it with the standard surgical treatment until it recovers, and if the egg has spoiled due to another illness, then connect the vessel in contact with the hemorrhage as previously mentioned, cut the casing from the attachment, remove the egg, and handle it accordingly.
Indeed, when water is combined on both sides, be aware that it caused the opposite side to be displaunted from what was done in the first one, whether or not you dive into thinking the work is a single act, then clear away the blood.
In the incisions, introduce cotton that has been dipped in oil or rose ointment and it becomes another from outside cotton which has been soaked in wine and oil and simplify it on the two waxes and guts of intestines and place over a folded laceration. And it is tied on top with a rope that has six ends in this picture:.
Then take two cuts and sew them with a swab stretched out in this example, and create the ends that are threaded with cotton or moist wool and gather tightly onto a sash strip, one end takes from the seat to the back.
And the second is taken towards the groin and the two sides on the thighs from below, and the remaining two sides on the calves and gather all tightly onto a sash strip, this device may also be made of wood instead of iron for cutting.
"It is to take a fine scoop knife and probe the skin of excretion, ensuring safety as described until the white pus-filled blister bursts open; then use another spoon on this image:
"It resembles the Greek eye, then it is attached to that blister and probed until all moisture exits; then it is widened with tweezeback into the scoop and one layer after another is peeled off as much as possible until they are completely extracted, preserving from touching the egg whites by fire.
"Be aware that this procedure is more advanced than stopping bleeding and better than work involving the throat, incisions, or applying a heating plaster; whatever you are faced with should be treated as follows: for an incision provide the appropriate treatment to cure it.
"Jabana was the illness, and it did not improve with this work due to its intensity; so do not perform what I described if you find it appropriate from what we have provided.
"It is advisablen to make the illness sit on a raised chair, then attach the swelling underneath with a flat spatula; stretch it along the body and keep the opening wide enough for all the fluid to drain out; then place in its original position and bandage.
Leave him to bleed, then treat until the wound heals; but if fluid escapes when you press it, this is due to the white membrane obstructing at the mouth of the wound.
Then it is necessary to enter into the wnud with a lizard's tongue or the device that extracts fluids from the two presented images, or slightly open the wound.
Know that the fluid may return and congeal after six months or so if the wound heals on its own and the patient defends himself for days, ...
The third and thirty-sixth chapter.
In the defect on the meat device and its treatment.
Know that the defect on this device is a degenerative process leading to death in most cases, so we see its remains and health derived from it, and my experience in it, and types of tumors.
I say that many tumors occur in bodies where the composition is feminine, and this is due to either a tendency towards females or an impact causing them to be female, and either from hitting which makes the color of the tumor match the body's color without containing fluid.
The tumor is gaseous and possibly the tumor was encapsulated with a color like dough, without sensation, it may be from entangled vessels or swelling as previously mentioned of testicles or ovarian swelling; what was known as vascular swelling, that means spreading of the tumor.
If it is squeezed by your fingers and should not show the bump, as for those from ovarian swelling do not spread when squeezed with fingers, this type may be excised on top of surrounding meat.
It is for the skin of the excised to be stretched, then the egg white rises above and exits through a white membrane and separates the attachment from the vessels and ties up the vessels, after which it cuts off the attachment when all sides of the eggs have separated; the egg was shrouded by that detached meat.
The egg should be extracted and cut off, if the attachment between something of membranes or vessels is present, all that attachment should be separated out and cut off cleanly.
Then the meat at the spot where adhesions are located, behind which should be cut out all of it and extract the egg as we have said. If the wound has been worked on with soaked gauze in rose oil and alcohol, then treat it with all remedebut till he recovers,.
Chapter Four and Sixty Two.
In the treatment of instruments with a tube.
The tube is a tight-wound thread similar to yarn, with relaxation benefits for women and contraindications in cases of movement disorders, exercise, walking, and treating such conditions may be considered closer to relief than that provided by men.
However, it should be noted that work has been done in this area before; therefore, I say that the patient should sit on a raised chair and push the female tube downward then grasp your fist near the vessel.
Then a third person grasps it tightly and stretches it considerably then makes a sharp incision with a scalpel until the vessel is released, then removes each part as you have mentioned in Chapter V regarding vessels on the neck then inserts a needle therein through a string.
It joins them in the initial positions where they presented function and also links them at the other end, then it punctures a hole longitudinamo on the body through which accumulated fluid from dry rot comes out.
Then it treats the cyst by the method of surgeons who wish for its generation to last long enough to shed the vessel that nourishes one of the females without causing harm, and the function was shown in all vessels as should be expelled from a female with the vessel not damaging the egg. Cutting the vessels without swelling or reacting to it,
Chapter Five and Six.
In the treatment of ductile instruments.
These instruments occur from a puncture that is presented in the extended abdomen towards the pubic bones, reaching the uterus from there and extending to one of the females.
This puncture is either from the incision of an abdominal wall or its extension and these two types occur for many reasons, either from a blow or a shock or a scream or lifting something heavy towards that direction and its sign if it was from the extension of the abdomninal wall occurs rarely.
There is no sudden occurrence and the tumor reaches depth prior to the drainage of the abscess, its sign if from the tearing of the abscess that it happens suddenly and the tumor appears differently under the skin near by.
That by the exit of the abscess to outside from the abscess, and it may be discharged with pus called this instrument surgical and pus-like and may come with wind, and may occur in the abscess cavity and therein contain a dead disease.
Because it happens a severe and stinging pain especially if it persists, treating these types of tumors with iron is risky so one should beware of occurrence in them, the description of the work to compel the disease to return to the abscess cavity by its hands if they come back.
Then he lays his hands on your chest between your arms and raises both of his legs, the skin that touches the donkey is extended upward and peels off the whole length of hairy skin then it leaks into the incision hole with enough amount needed to open the incliction.
The incision should be as large as a chick can exit from it, then peel off the sutures undernecups' skin until the white hard layer is unfolded on all sides; at that point, insert your little finger into the chick downwards.
Between the first white suture underneath the chick's skin and the second one releasing from behind the chick, then turn your right hand inward towards the hen's skin; while doing this, extend the first white suture upwards with your left hand and raise the chick along with the suture.
The server commands you to raise the chick and completely release the adhesion from behind, then check with your finger to ensure there is nothing stuck in the white hard suture; if something comes out of it, press it down towards the vent.
Then you take a needle threaded with a thick string tied to twelve strands and insert it into the farthest white suture underneath the skin fold; then cut the ends of the string in such a way that four strands remain. Then fasten some of them tightly together and tie with the ligature which we said is under the skin, a very strong knot on two sides; thus, it also damages the edges of the threads and ties them with a strong knot until nothing from the vessel that nourishes it can reach it. Then it shows a red swelling and also forms a second knot outside the first one, further away by less than two fingerbreadths; after these two ligatures, call on the suture that is under the skin as far as the bone of the finger.
Then it shows a red swelling and also forms a second knot outside the first one, further away by less than two fingerbreadths; after these two ligatures, call on the suture that is under the skin as far as the bone of the finger. The remainder cuts off at a curve and takes the lymph with it, then it pierces below the skin of the buttocks to create an opening that allows blood and fluid as we described in what follows; then use the wool soaked in oil placed into the wound and apply the ligature as we mentioned.
The white suture we mentioned after being cut should be placed carefully to avoid bleeding profusely, and the ligature remains until it falls off by itself; then if its fall is slow, place it in hot water for soaking that carries away what causes discharge until it drops completely.
Then treat the wound with general surgical treatment until healed.
Chapter Six and Twelve.
In this wind instrument device, I have never seen anyone be cured by using iron; the ancients mentioned that they would make such a device as we described in the previous instrument and then tie the vessels together after making an incision with ease at the bottom.
Then, make an incision in the middle and treat the tumor until it opens up and the vessels are released as we mentioned before until healed.
Chapter Seven and Twelve.
In the space where it is in the ear.
The space in the ear may present as we mentioned in its position, and there is nothing that falls from the cavity, but if it does descend it passes slowly and varps back at all times.
However, if it remains for a long time, the gap in the cochlea will widen until the cavity and thrombosis pass to the ear canal, presenting as an extension of the cochlear space that is in the ear as we mentioned. That it extends the cochlea, then relaxes and moves to position itself, treating it with a liquid as described.
"He treats this condition with iron and makes the patient lie on their back, then you should scrape the site of the pustule to create a wide incision using up to three fingers, then suture under the skin.
"Until the white pustule opens, take a rod and place it on the location of the pustule, then secure it to the abdomen's depth and suture the two points at the ends of the rod attached to each side of the pustule.
"Then soak the end of the rod and do not cut through the pustule, nor touch the pus, or anything else as you learned in treating clumped foreign bodies, then treat it with surgical treatment.
"If the threads break or the wound bleeds until it heals, then the pustule will tighten and stop expanding.
"He is best in this location because it's closest to safety.
"Chapter Eight and Twelve.
"In resting the skin of a donor.
"The skin of the donor often does not rest from being unrested and is disfigured, so those seeking treatment should let the patient sleep on their back.
He cuts all the skin that has relaxed on the thick skin, then gathers the edges with three or four threads and secures them from stitching before cutting between the stitches.
Then he treats it with the topical treatment of surgeons until it is relieved and the stitches fall off.
Chapter Nine, Sixty-two.
In Application.
The application in our practice is forbidden.
For this reason, it was appropriate for me not to mention it in my book; however, I mentioned two reasons - one for the knowledge of doctors if they ask about it and to know treatment from its touching, and the other is that we often need application by some animals for our benefit.
The animals such as camels, sheep and cats, etc., I say that application has two effects either pleasing or annoying and cutting; the former having its effect through our work where we make the animal sit in hot water until their female parts are relaxed and swollen and protruding.
Then it is pleasing and does not become evident upon touching, but the application that annoys or cuts should be held by the animal and press its skin with your left hand, then tie up the affected area using a piece of thread and make one single incision for each lump.
Until the twins are born, cut them both after they have been completely expelled and do not leave anything of the lochia on them; rather, scrape it off as finely as possible that which is on the vessels. This preventive measure is better than one done with consent.
Since consent may remain in women as a part of the common beast, then treat the wound until healed.
Chapter Seventy-Six.
Treatment for Female Illnesses.
In men, there are two types of which one appears in the scrotum and another on the skin near the anus similar to a hairy penis with urine draining from the urethra among women. [Note: This text is part of historical medical literature and does not reflect modern understanding or practices.]
As for women, there is one type that appears above the vulva like a small man's penis and discharges to the outside as if it were a male penis with two resembling females; treating all three types of conditions. [Note: This text refers to historical medical concepts not used in contemporary medicine.]
The two types of excessive meats in men and the one type in women should be cut until healed, then treat with comprehensive surgical treatment; as for the second type of man from which urine flows from the anus without any work or male protrusion. [Note: This excerpt is from historical medical practices not applicable to modern medicine.]
Section on Surgery and Wounds (The Arabic text translates to "Chapter of Surgery and Seventy").
Regarding the removal of bones and meat protruding from a woman's genitals.
The bone may have increased naturally to the extent of discoloring and smelling, and in some women it may extend like men and reach a state similar to puberty.
It is preferable to hold the bone with your hand or a scissors and cut it, do not suck at the severed part and especially not deep into the root so as not to expose bleeding.
Then treat it with surgical care until healed, and the protruded meat is the fat that grows in the vagina.
And sometimes it may come out as if on a tail-like example. Therefore, some call the tail-like disease "tailache," it is advised to cut it like bones and treat until healed,...
Section Two Seventy (The Arabn text translates to "Chapter Twenty Seven").
Regarding the treatment of stenosis.
Stenosis is when a woman's vagina is not properly formed or the hole is small, either naturally occurring during birth or acquired (the acquired ones are often from excess fat).
He should be thin or thick, and may be in the depth of the womb or on its sides or above or below it, preventing breech births and umbilical cords, and possibly preventing childbirth, and this is determined by observation.
If the fistula appears to be near, but it is not, inspect with your fingers or a rod; if the fistula is of thin membrane and close to the testicles, promptly cut through and make an artificial pouch from both hands.
The woman stands with her leg extended, then forcefully stretches the testicles until the thin fistula is rupture and opens; she takes wool and soaks it in oil and places it on the site, gathering the menstrual blood each day to prevent re-contamination.
If the fistula is thick and solid, it should be scratched with a broad lancet-like tool; remove the tissue tag, suture it to avoid bleeding, using drugs such as karkadi, sheykan, and lakhmun, collected with ovum.
Then use a broad glass tube to irrigate the wound quickly, grasp it for days and use a solid candle thread treatment; then treat all bandaging until healed, and may present another suitable plant in the abdomen for meat cutting on this type.
If not a cancerous tumor, then the malignant tumor in the abdomen does not have cast iron attached to it.
The third and seventy chapter.
In treating abscesses, cysts, and red pustules that appear in women's genitals.
As for abscesses, they are an accumulation of the thoracic cavity until a lot of continuous blood is poured from it if abscesses turn into cysts; and it has been mentioned in dissection that its types, characteristics, and these have been noted herein.
What they allow to be treated and what not, I say that abscesses and cysts if in the depth of the abdamenot felt by touch, do not have iron treatment and whatever has been found in it mouth does not treat those felt therein.
It was necessary for the woman to enter a warm room, then stretch the thread with a knife or rough scraper and cut it from its ends, then shred it when the blood drips from one of the sharp-stopping vessels that do not branch.
Like the quay, the chin and the lard, then raise her feet to the wall for an hour, then lower them in cold water; if bleeding continues, she sits in samanu (wheat germ) pudding, pomegebranate peel, almonds, etc., and then take wheat flour dough kneaded with honey and vinegar.
And bind it on her back, and if the bleeding stops, use a firm tensioning bandage or poultry (without joints) in an infusion of theriac or infusion of licorice roots with hemlock wine and spelt mash.
If the tumor becomes severe, treat it with a compress until recovered; and for red pustules like wild poppy heads in abundance, one should cut what is visible off as mentioned above regarding thread cutting, and treat them until recovery.
Chapter Four Hundred Seventy-Four.
In the pus that is exposed in the abdamo.
Various types of tumors may be exposed in the abdomen, such as cancer and encapsulated swellings, ulcers, abscesses, tubercles, gangrenous wounds, eating disorders, pus-filled cavities, fistulas, intestinal parasites, internal abscesses, all of these diseases, their types, and signs have been mentioned in the section.
In this article, it should be mentioned that the hot tumor exposed in the abdomen if it is one of the types of tumors that are collected as a result of iron accumulation, must have severe pain at first with two episodes and inflammation.
I observed that it was red and the patient should not hurry to drain or treat it until these symptoms have settled, then she is advised to sit on a chair with two seats supported by her back.
The man's legs are collected towards the lower abdomen and his thighs are spread apart, with hands under his knees tied together by straps.
Therefore, the eligible one sits on the right side and uses the device with an opening for the mouth through which her image appears afterwards; it is preferable that if this device is used, she appreciates a deeper depth of the woman's vagina so that what enters from the device exceeds the depth of the vagina.
In this case, the device was deeper than necessary to place a pad on the vaginal neck flap to prevent the entire device from entering the depth of the vanguard and it is recommended that the bulb which operates in the device comes from the upper side.
You hold the device and manage the bulb until the vaginal neck opens, if discharge appears and touches your hand and it is soft and thin, then you should scrape it at its top with a flat applicator in case all of the flow empties.
It should be that the wound is filled with a soft gauze soaked in rose oil or green ointment and some pressure applied, then the tube exits through the opening of the vaginal neck and emerges from outside onto the vulva and on the thigh, covered with clean swab saturated in boiled water.
Then treat it after two days with the bandage that is used to heal, until cured.
He washes the wound and incision with water and honey, then with boiled oil or linseed oil before returning to bandaging; the discharge had been clear inside the abdamocho.
It was advisable to abstain from treating it with iron but as we mentioned in the section on division.
The Fifth Chapter and Seven Hundreds.
In teaching about spices, on how the living handle if they excrete unnaturally.
It is necessary for the spice to first recognize the natural form of birth from its signs if a woman sees it moving downward, desiring to breathe and vomiting what was on her.
And the fetus is aware that this birth is natural when it exits with its head and membrane, or attached to its cord, so if these signs are seen, one should press the abdomen quickly for how the fetus exits rapidly.
And if it exits with its head and membrane, cleansing is good from that curiosity, and all other births not being natural are disapproved as the fetus may exit on its feet and hands before its head and body.
A single hand or a man, or the head comes out or a hand protrudes and perhaps he flips on his feet towards such forms of misdeeds. It is desirable that one be skillful and delicate with all these things and avoid slipping and errors.
I detail each form and how to deduce from it and stand upon it, if the infant comes out naturally from the head and intensifies towards the woman in this way and makes childbirth difficult for her, so that I saw her strength may have weakened and she sat on a chair and commanded women to tighten.
And he warmed her with a boiled sponge and moistened pads, then the assistant inserted between her fingers a small rod to push out or tear through the membranes until water was released and pressed on the woman's belly until childbirth occurred.
If the child has not descended, it is desirable for the woman to drink the liquid from a swab with lubricant then after inhaling she should be commanded to run and wet her hands and hold her mouth and nose; then the infant will come out of its hour, first one hand or both at ease.
Indeed, the woman did not enter through the birth canal; she raised her legs up high and shook the stool on the ground while holding onto its handle. When this happened, her hands did not come in. The fetus died, so cut them off and save the remaining one.
Or attach his hands to the hook and pull them with traction; he will come out, the fetus comes out on its feet. If it came out on its feet, one should lift him up a little bit and turn the baby slightly until it is covered, then gently straighten one of his legs.
If they come out on their feet, she was ordered to dance and squeeze with her fingers; he comes out. But it did not come out as we described, only slightly moving one baby until it takes the natural form; then it comes out smoothly. Therefore, do not continue as we described everything.
Take the colostrum and breast milk, ointment for wounds, dissolved gum resin, and all mix them in a mortar and beat well; then pour it over the woman's vagina from the top to her lower abdinal area until she reaches full term. Then sit her in distilled water until she gives birth.
If you see that he has fallen asleep, make a device from bread and have him wear it; if the device is caught by the hour, seat him on the chair, then let him urinate and plug his mouth and nose and gently drip down his lower abdomen; then the fetus will exit within its hour, exiting through his thighs and hands.
If it exits in this manner, grab his hands slightly and steadily lift the woman to a standing position until her feet touch the ground; she should lie down on the bed and bring her hands together then gently drip over her abdomen. Then the afterbirth is expelled from under her legs until she is fully delivered at the bottom; if the fetus does not exit completely through her thighs, vigorously move them and then gently drip over the buttocks to push it upwards; finally, guide it with your hand slightly and let the infant settle.
The woman is commanded to run until the fetus exits; if it comes out slightly compressed in one of her hands, grab his hand firmly and make her walk or jog if she can't walk, have her sit down instead.
Her bed and legs she shook intensely, then used the lubricant which was described as sperm from ejaculation. She sat on a chair, after which he treated in her hand and arranged the embryo to its natural shape and caused her to urinate while instructing her to dance until it comes out.
The embryo exited on his hands, facing the mother's chest. It is necessary to hold onto the embryo with your hand, then slightly turn it while gently smoothing it if its nourishment has reached a certain level as we described in terms of oil and lubricants.
Then let her move a little if she did so, have her sit on the chair and tell her to lean towards the right side and dance until it comes out, with a catheter. The embryo exits naturally aligned horizontally.
If it falls onto the vulva with the umbilical cord, pull out the placenta by pulling your leg until the moisture is drained, then attach to the embryo's face and neck, detach discreetly so that it does not suffocate to death. Then push the embryo inside fully until it rests as required.
The command for the woman is to make a slight movement, as she will exit easily, the separation of twins or multiple fetuses is common, know that twins often occur and they may yield three or four, but they do not survive except in rare cases, while five is something abnormal and does not live.
They are surrounded by a single amniotic sac, separated by an opaque barrier attached to each one of them, and they may exit naturally and normally as we described the exit of a single fetus.
Their difficulty at birth and the abnormal forms we mentioned are treated as we described, with a gentle approach that you do what is necessary for them to adapt and find safety.
He mentions that one can imagine multiple fetuses falling from the womb, there could be one or two or three or four or five or six or more than ten and he reportedly confirmed that a woman fell seven and another eleven all at once, imagined to be pregnant with them.
"The esteemed knowledgeable one, all of this should be in the field of medicine as it may encounter such a day to deal with it appropriamo.
Chapter Six Hundred and Seventy-Six.
In the output of a deceased fetus.
If the deceased fetus as mentioned in section three requires treatment, but does not pass and forces the matter to manual intervention, it is advised that the woman be found strong enough without any symptoms indicating potential harm should she undergo such an operation; therefore, place her on a bed with her head elevated.
Her head should be tilted downward, and her legs elevated two levels; securely fasten her from both sides or attach to the bed so that her body is drawn towards the fetus during its full duration.
Subsequently, moisten the woman's womb with wet pads containing breast milk, honey, and dates paste; coat her hand that is prepared for this operation with these agents then gently insert it into the vagina to reach the fetus, after which request a place where she can expel the birth fluids from the deceased fetus, at positions suitable for such an event.
"Note that the fetus arriveby comes down upon its head, causing the gynaecologist to insert his fingers into its eyes, nose, mouth, ears or underneath its lips, or nearby its arms and legs, or through the pelvis.
"If it comes down onto its legs and middle arms, the gynaecologist should hold the scissors in his right hand and place his fingers between the left hand's toes while entering with the other hand and inserting a finger into one of those places we mentioned.
"When it reaches an empty state, the assistant inserts another pair of scissors and if a draw is needed to make it even, they should not lean towards one side but stretch equally, with the insertion moving steadily in all directions.
"It should be eased out like a tooth being pulled and between that the assistant must rotate steadily if they have grasped one side then it is advised for them to grease with fingers some of those parts to be greased, and insert from there to manage what was grasped as part of the baby emerges, using scissors to guide other parts.
He slightly raised it so that the fetus would come out completely; her hand came out before the rest, and could not be pushed back due to the strain, hence a tear occurred which was then pulled until everything had been expelled.
Either in the palm or in the foreskin, so it should be done with the other hand and both men; since the baby's head was large and there was pressure during birth, or it had fluid in its head, one should insert a pointed stick between the fingers.
And the head would burst, expelling water or pushing it out with a pump called a piston that came with images of other tools in this section.
Likewise, if the fetus had a large head, it was advisable to crack open the skull or push it out with the pistle as we mentioned then all bones would be expelled individually; once the head emerged and pressure occurred at contractions, one should let go until moisture is seen in the chest.
When the chest is attached then if not, and there's nothing to expel but just the lower abdomen which was swollen or had a clot, one should tie it until fluid drains from it.
Indeed, if the fetus was on his thighs, it was easy to pull and positioned towards the armpit. If pressed at the abdamen or chest, one should pull with a hook wrapped around your hand, pulling through the abdomen or chest until something is slipped out from within them.
Indeed, the upper limbs were pulled and the head was elevated and grasped with the left hand. If the vagina was accessible, enter the hand into the vaginal opening; then lift the head with the palm of the hand in the groin, pull the head towards the mouth of the vagina using fingers, then insert a hook or two and pull by them.
Indeed, if the vaginal mouth was affected by a red swelling, do not cause pain but rather use damp fatty substances and towels, sit in water that has been soaked and becomes softened, etc.
Indeed, if the fetus was on one side, you may not be able to do what we mentioned in stage delivery as described earlier; instead, cut a piece and remove it, ensamo that nothing of the tissue remains inside the womb; if your treatment fails, then apply what we discussed for treating hot tumors presenting in the groin.
If hemorrhage is drained into a clamped vessel, the treatment on top of it can be utilized, and once witnessed a woman who had tied off the fetus in her womb and then tied it again.
Then the other fetus also showed symptoms to her after a long time, swelling occurred beneath it and expanded until bursting open, causing pus discharge that was drained for treatment. It took a long time to heal the wound, which she applied with some strong attractant bandages.
Then the first skull exited and he moved away from her for several days, after which another skull emerged causing discomfort in her belly where there was no bone; she judged that they were from dead fetuses' bones. She searched for the wound and found it to be full of many skulls.
I did not stop until they had exited with many bones, and the woman was in a better condition and lived like that for a long time during which pus flowed continuously as it came to an end here.
Because she had knowledge and compassion for what the physician craftsman tries to achieve with his hands in treatment, ...
Chapter Seventy and Seven.
In it are images of the instruments which should be used after childbirth.
Image of a lupus opening up the mouth of the uterus:.
This instrument that is depicted with two sticks at its ends in the books, except this lupus should be a more gentle clamp and it should either be made of boxwood or birch wood, and each stick's length should equal the width of two fingers.
And their heads are towards the fingers, and the length of each is a finger's width or slightly more, and their breadth is towards two fingers or slightly more.
They are the ones that enter into the mouth of the uterus to be opened by both lupuses, image of another device similar in gentlenfly and mildness:.
It is made of boxwood or birch in the form of pincers except that it has two prongs at each end as you see, with the length of each prong towards a finger and their breadth to be like two fingers if one wishes to open the uterus using them.
She sat on a bed with her legs extended between her thighs, then inserted the two cups into the vagina and held onto one side of the instrument below between the buttocks; then open your hand on the instrument like you do with hemostats as much as you want to open the vagina. Until you achieve the desired state, a figure of Lilith as described by the early authors:.
Image of the instrument that pushes out the fetus:.
Image of the hook used to extract the baby's head:.
The scissors are similar to it, with teeth on the edge as seen here and it can be made rectangular like clamps as shown in this image, with teeth like saw teeth that cut through and sever:.
Image of an additional instrument:.
Image of a spatula:.
This spatula is slightly thicker so that it does not break when pulling the fetus with it, image of a spatula with two prongs:.
Image of wide tweezers for cutting out the fetus:.
All these tools have proliferated in various kinds, and they are considered an assistant to the craftsman as it allows him to work faster; they were elevated among people to their highest degree so that no one should despise them for having an instrument at hand that is always needed:.
Chapter Eighty-Seven.
In the efflux of the pituitary gland.
If the pituitary gland has been compressed after ejaculation, it is adviseb to instruct the patient that they must grasp their own penis and then urinate with a catheter while holding your hand on its mouth and squeezing them; thus discharge was achieved. Otherwise, take as much time as needed.
Puncture the cover with a hole and place opened herbs such as fennel, sedative, chaste berry, passionflower, chamomile, and flaxseed in it; these herbs can be used individually or together, moisten them with water and heat on fire. Place a silver tube over the cover's hole and its other end into the vagina.
Hold until the steam reaches the vagina'hem and urinate as we instructed; the pituitary gland discharges quickly after this treatment, so it should not be submerged in any oily or eye secretion with the left hand.
Then insert it into the vagina and examine the pituitary gland; if a swelling is detected, slightly extend it until discharge occurs from deep within the vagina, then use your hand as we described until you feel the slight attraction to withdraw.
Certainpertly, when the uterus falls due to strong attraction, it should be gently moved towards either side and its quantity of pull is increased, then it responds and frees itself from adhesions; therefore, our treatment included tying off (ligation), pressure therapy, and herbal remedies.
It did not come out as we described and treated it, but it should be connected to the uterus's vulva region then sewn with a four-thread suture which will promote healing after some days.
It is resolved and comes out only if it has been infected, then a bad odor rises from it to the abdamen and head, which worsens this disease; therefore, smoking should be used as approved.
Therefore, I have tried some remedies such as smoking dill and figs, the apparatus that causes a woman to sweat during menstruation and pregnancy, etc.:.
It is made from lead-like material or cast from bronze, where a fine end is placed on the vagina and a wide end over the flame; it smokes with incense and attaches until that smoke goes away and returns again:.
Chapter Ninety-Seven.
In the treatment of non-fractured dislocations.
Often many young boys have dislocated joints which should be reset gently with a flexible splint so that they can press it themselves; otherwise, using a sharp instrument to bite it and warning the muscle not to touch it.
Then place a cloth soaked in wine and oil on it, then treat with bandages until he recovers; however, there is fear that the dislocation may seal itself completely through a canal of glass for many days, which must be removed when desired by the child.
Additionally, the dislocation may also occur from an infection or inflammation which should be scraped out then followed by treatments and wrapping as previously mentioned.
Chapter Eighty-Four. (This instruction does not include a translation for this section title; it simply requires the inclusion of the Arabic text).
In the treatment of varices occurreste at the lower part. (This instruction does not include a translation for this section title; it simply requires the inclusion of the Arabic text).
The varices that occur in the lower part is complicated and dense, occurring near a joint or from one of the sides and consisting of one or more vessels. (This instruction does not include a translation for this section title; it simply requires the inclusion of the Arabic text).
If the complicated matter is opened and a thin, white or chalky fluid flows from it, this may indicate an emanation to the fire and into the vessel, and if not sealed, it may be recognized by the discharge of pus and foul-smelling breath upon using the inflamed condition.
And perhaps it may eject worms if in the cavity, emanating to the vesicle and into the cord channel, or from the thigh joint to the buttock, also known as a sealed nauseous emanation to the vagina.
Your finger should enter the vagina and insert a thin needle into the nauseous emanation, using brass or iron if not in the nauseous emanation then it was previously inserted with a needle made of wire or horsehair.
Until you feel the needle or hair on your finger, if not felt then there has been no pus discharge nor foul-smelling breath as we have said, know that it is unsealed and proceed with treatment.
If the arrow penetrates to the bladwart or into the urinary tract, its exit of urine and abstinence from applying medicine at the site are indicated; if it penetrates into the leg joint or thigh fold, then indication is for the splinter's arrival there.
If there is no bone fracture and pain towards the area, as well as pus emerging from it constantly, without healing by treatment or applying poultices, then none of these penetrating sutures are free of complications.
To treat them, avoid those handled by inept doctors; as for those that are not penetrating or persistent and have the peril of iron, according to what I described and may have tried, is to warm the ailment between your hands on its surface.
The arrow's shaft goes above and bends towards its thigh, so the iron nail or lead enters if in the arrow; as it reaches all the way to where the nail ends, your ailment feels near the seat and you should insert your thumb into the seat.
Indeed, you feel in your burnt finger that you have performed it clearly without feeling between your finger and its tip or flesh; therefore we are certain that it is cauterized, so there is no harm from it as we said.
They said that it cures some people in the throat and is a treatment for which they should be grateful, as applying a fine powder on the tonsils according to the size of the tonsil with a needle inserted until it reaches near the base then returning it twice or thrice.
Until you realize that all those swollen meats resembling a bird's tail feather have been burnt and are treated with cheese on sheep fat until they exit, then treat the burned meats with tied-off bandages so it heals.
Otherwise, it does not cure without this treatment, and if the needle is inserted into your finger in the throat with a thick barrier of flesh or fat between it and the needle, then you will see that the tonsil has come out on the skin surface so removing the first tonsil. And you pass through the channel with the probe, which is in the nasal cavity until the channel reaches where the probe ends and it releases and falls out. Then cleanse those meats that resemble a bird's feather pipe, leaving nothing behind.
Then handle it with the clamps until healed, as your blood and condition between you and work will cut away those meats; they are best made or most beneficial when done quickly by fire or a sharp dressing, for meat on fire gathers two good conditions: burns and removes excess.
Cut the blood and drain moisture, then handle it with soaked pads in lard or powdered sulfur mixed with oil until healed; place those burned meats on wax to come out of place, then at that time treat the wound with clamps made from boiled ham bones.
And the medicine that clamps and drains, if healed but not feared to return, then the nasal cavity has reached deep into the seat and after surfacing on the body, insert your finger in it and examine with it.
I felt the lancet and between it a screen made of silk or leather, and it was close to being infected; only work could be done on it in terms of greed, hope, and that one of three methods should be used - either making it into something else as we mentioned.
Or make it into a hole so that you can insert the plug and treat from close by without continuing to scratch, lest it cuts off the surrounding muscle around the joint; an issue would occur on the patient whereby pus unintentionally escapes, then be treated as we mentioned, possibly healing as we said.
Or execute that screen and drill it after scratching to near the joint as we mentioned, either with a lancet or another sharp edge tool then cleanse any infected meat where possible through probing.
Then pack the wound completely with scratches and the upper lip until it is closed, leaving a canal inside the joint which will be less visible on the patient; the naris may possibly protrude as described.
And if you insert the lancet into the naris near the joint close to the skin of the nasal bridge and around the edge of the cavity, then a specially sharpened lancet as an eskaph needle on this type would be:.
Enter a cord of five threads or so, then insert the needle into the nostril until it reaches its depth, and then it will be pierced on the side near the seat from within.
Extract the cord from that hole so that your finger enters the anus and extract one end of the string, then gather both ends together, tighten them, and leave it for a day or two. As soon as you cut the string in the muscle, tighten it firmly until those parts between the ends of the strings fall off, then treat the wound until it heals and recovers.
If the nostril hole is not deep enough, you can only do so for muscle relief and prevent it from tearing as described before, until healing occurs and recovery happens.
The image of the spiked muzzle that tears nostrils should be blocked off quite firmly on one side and less so on the other to prevent tearing as you see:.
The section is hardcore eighth. (Note: This phrase in Arabic 'الفصل الحادي الثماني' does not translate directly to an English concept and would likely be a section or part of the text that deals with strict, possibly brutal methods.)
In the hernia through which blood flows and is cut off, and treatment of fissures.
Hernias can be in the groin, resembling red bumps or grapes, and there are both small and large ones through which blood constantly flows out.
One is large and numerous, located outside the groin with its ends protruding; of those that are from outside the groin, most have a low amount of water constantly flowing out or very little blood running continuously and they appear on the body in color.
The treatment for those inside the groin should make the swelling rise and dangle until it exits through the groin, the testicle appears quickly, attaches to the scrotal skin or hooks onto your thigh, then cut it off when you grip it; without restraining with bandages, it retains moisture and relaxes.
Cut it with a sharp incision or a piece of sterilized lambskin or pull it off with your fingers then cut it, afterwards sprinkle it with strong drops that make her stand on the vulva or vagina as you present to the opening.
Then she treated him with all kinds of remedcuies until he recovered; the abscess did not come out on its own at a later time, so a needle was inserted into it to allow some liquid to drain and cleanse it from within the cavity, thus facilitating its rapid departure when the infection subsided. The external thread outside of the cavity then instructed it as follows: "This is easy.
It is for you to take it by the thorn or attach it with tweezers, then cut it off and treat it as we have mentioned until it heals; if one dislikes cutting metal instruments should use their fingers of this type, taking a string attached, insert into the needle.
Then pull the thread up and insert it into the needle's origin from another side, damaging both ends of the string at the bottom of the needle so that she is secured; firmly tighten the string then tie off the string and remove the needle, do this with all threads leaving one intact which does not fray.
To extract a blood clot, then apply an oil-soaked swab or ointment onto the abscess and place it on the cavity instructing the patient to rest until the thread falls off; if the thread comes out effectively treat with wraps and all kinds of remedies as we have mentioned until he recovers.
As for the treatment of fistulae, it is often revealed by pus exudations and constriction of the opening if chronic; if medicine does not help in such cases, one should scrape it with a cautery needle or a thorn until it becomes moist and the upper shell dissolves that prevents its fusion.
Then treat it until it heals as it should, and if not sealed with a dressing sooner than the first, wait until it is somewhat closed and necroses before treating it again for it to recover.
Chapter Eighteen and Eighty.
In the treatment of inverted and non-invertesteem cysts, as well as dry thorns and ants.
Indeed, a thorn is a rounded node on the skin that resembles the head of a thorn and occurs throughout the body, especially in the ankle bones and fingers, and it presents with pain when walking.
It is appropriate to scrape around the thorn and grasp it with a knife or lancet, then extract its root; treat as needed based on what presents in the cavity of the wound, and for dry thorns, one at a time involves a small hard nubile bulge above the surface of the skin.
Often in the hands of boys, it is treated so that a thorn would be lengthened and cut or torn with a silver wire or hair until it falls out; or if you wish, heat it upon something brought forth by fire or with a sharp medicine.
The upside-down thorn and the non-upside-down thorn, which I remember in the treatment of lice, were also small wrapped thick ones on the body's surface going deep; if it was cold affected, one felt as though bitten by a scorpion.
In the body and more of it in the hands, its treatment would be to take a feather from an owl or strong eagle's feather so that this tube reaches the louse until encircling the tube on all sides then turning your hand around the tube until shaking off what surrounds the louse.
It arises in the depth of the meat and rises from its origin; if you wish, do so with a metal or iron pipe on this image:.
The top of the tube is slightly curved and held firmly to make it easier for fingers to adjust and pull, if you wish, heat the louse on what presents in front of the thorn in the door's frame,.

In the pictures of the devices that are used for injections in cases of sciatica, hemorrhoids, and hernias.
The injector may be made of silver, brass or tin-glazed copper, and these devices can be produced in small or large sizes depending on the users who use them. The devices that are used in the treatment of small children or those with narrow canals to be injected deeply, a large injector depicted:.
The top part that holds the needle is wide for this type to have a barrier where the neede ris attached as shown and the lower part which enters into the canal is very blunt, inserted deeply on one side with two holes and on the other side with one hole.
The hole's diameter on the tube is slightly larger or thicker, and the needle in which to put medicine is made from a small animal stomach or thin horn with a funnel-shaped body having an approximately one-inch diameter.
A hole is made as if it were drilled and the space between each hole has a fingernail thickness, then enters into that hole with a thin cord made of twisted thread about ten threads or so to gather up the needle like a funnel. If the drug is placed in a spot where the implanted shackle between two rocks is firm and thick, then drill with it; this is an image of the circular hole and cavity:.
The way to inject it so that the bung or bladder is filled with the drug and heated as much as possible of risk, but beware if it's very hot or very cold then the swelling falls on its back and drips into both legs.
He places a gauze or pad underneath, then greases the side of the implanted one with oil, egg yolk, butter extracts or similar substances, and gently inserts it into the recessed area. Then he takes hold of the shackle's handle with both hands and twists vigoramo until all that is inside the implant comes out in the pouch.
Then he removes the implant and drains the swelling into his legs, so that the stimulus of the drug to exit as much as possible causes him to stay awake all night until morning when he reports at the site, then being injected in the intestinal tract leads to an impatient exit which makes the implant clear up and recover.
It was in the recessed area, either a painful worm or tumor where the implant should be very gently removed by an experienced practitioner who uses it for youngsters' implants, this is an image of a gentle implant with tightly constricted skin:.
Chapter IV and Eighty.
In Surgical Treatments.
I have mentioned in the section on treating what is called kyphosis and I remember treating it by hand (manual manipulation) and with medications, considering that surgery varangs depending on what type of condition there is for surgical intervention, and according to where exactly the injury or lesion lies.
The things that require surgery are often like a stone, knife edge, blade, or spear tip and similar items.
As for the location of the injuries or lesions on the body, there are surgeries according to those found on the head, neck, chest, abdence, liver and so on.
I describe the treatment of some surgeries as a standard and law for all other surgeries, starting with simple cranial (head) surgery because it will be mentioned in the first section three to eighty of this book.
I say that when a simple head injury occurred, it was not a skull fracture but rather like being struck by a stone or similar object and only the skin had been lacerated, and the wound was quite large, causing concern for the development of an inflammatory tumor. Therefore, I advised using a quffa (wooden trough) to drain it off. Do not delay it and drain the blood as much as possible to prevent hemorrhage, especially if the bleeding from the wound is flowing freely. Let there be no escape of loss from the injured side.
Beware of excessive illness and drinking and eating heavy foods; prevent loss by reducing the amount of food, approaching meats less and avoiding alcoholic bevereby, apply a warm quince paste soaked in rose oil to the wound alone or with wine vinegar.
If the warm quince paste applied to the wound with bleeding skin and it has not been changed by the air mentioned in what I have described to you after a while, but if the air has changed it, apply some of the poultices as previously instructed.
Until the pus spreads then treat it until healing, if the wound is large and from a sword cut or similar, and his stitches did not unite with suturing as I have described in abdominal surgery, gather them together using suturing techniques.
If the skin was a muscle flap and it was hanging, only using sutures that allow cutting then treat the wn after which to replace toughened skin with medication of force-feeding meat and order sickness to take robust foods like heads and intestines.
Indeed, when a skin infection occurs and does not adhere to the bone, cut off all swelling with it and apply it, then treat; in these surgerebouts there were veins that would bleed blood and did not clot through medication; search for the vessel.
It did not heal with suturing and stitching, but if necessary, as mentioned before, apply a poultice until the blood stops; these small surgeries were simple and easy to manage by letting it drain and treating it accordingly.
Before it changes with the air, the recipe for the poultice requires taking part of milk and two parts of butter or fat (whether rendered or unrendered), cutting all three equally to grate and strain over the wound, mixing thoroughly until a good paste forms.
The blood clots, then it is pressed on top with ointment and left until it heals without suppuration; the fat alone may do this if no milk was added.
This act is also done with both eyes in many large surgeries if properly placed, tightened, and the wounds are clean of blood without any change by air. As for those that have been changed by air, there will be some alteration, especially during the summer time.
In this position, the mentioned application does not mean treating him with some of the matured cups or a heap of barley flour made of water and honey until the pus spreads, then treating it completely until he recovers.
If it is a cranial fracture and he walks with paralysis, although the treatment of skull fractures has been mentioned earlier in trepanation, if there is an injury to the neck, then the treatment for a neck injury is not different from that of a simple skull fracture.
But if a nerve from the neck or an artery has been cut, it is not wise to avoid treating him with a grip that tightly presses like a clamp and suffocates, causing damage to the nerve and constricting it in such a way as to worsen his condition.
He does not place anything cold on the wound because nerve essence is cold and connected to the brain, which governs all organs, and treating it with flexible medicines such as soaked Norah in soft water mixed several times with oil or rose balm.
If it is also washed with soft water and metal pebbles, as well as moistened bandages, and if the wound is large, use a suture or ligate its edges with silk thread then treat until healed.
If the wound was red and a pus deposit occurred beneath it, collecting in its lowest part, then it may have cut off a vessel causing its blood to gush out or tie it up or cauterize it if necessary.
If the wound had cut some intestinal fistulas or all of them, and collected a large amount of blood in its lining, suturing its edges with thread on the intestinal wall without enclosing it but rather spreading it over its natural form then tying it tightly and leaving it for days.
Then he treated it with the compress in which one grasps and dries until he recovers; as the wound had affected the bone, upon probing there were fragments of bone that all could be extracted or what could be, but some remained impossible to extract until the wound healed completely and the patient recovered.
The wound was healed, and the methods we described for treating bone injuries were successfully applied; it is mentioned in his book on chest surgery and between the shoulders.
It was a stab wound with a spear or knife, and I observed it had swelling - if the patient breathed heavily, one could deduce that it was an incisive injury; as there were no visible swellings, and its skin was intact, neither the first bandage nor any binding would be necessary to stop the bleeding.
He was stabbed in the heart and died, but I made an attractive dressing for it that was changed twice a day; so do not apply a dressing on the wound to avoid sucking up any fluids escaping from the injury, thus allowing the patient with the wound to sleep.
It is not an abscess, and even if it has been present for three days or more without the illness causing convulsions, palpitations, shortness of breath, and upon examination, finding its conditions to be healthy, one knows that the wound is healed by applying plasters and continuing treatment until cured.
The wound is constantly dripping pus and has become infected, so it must be treated from the inside out, as for a boil or abscess; if the chest or back wound has been present for some time without improvement, treat it by suturing with thread.
Whether it is large or small, if the bone has been affected and a piece has been fractured, examine the wound and proceed to remove such fragments; if they are not foreign bodies, suture them up completely.
The wound heals when it is easy to extract; for the surgical procedures occurr.
Chapter Five and Eight.
Surgery of the abdab. Extraction of an abscess cavity, and suturing it.
The tear that exposes the abdamo may be large or small, medium-sized; from it a bag or several bags can emerge, requiring their insertion and suturing with greater difficulty and skill.
The small tear may also be difficult due to the need for its repair being more complex; if it does not immediately come into position upon insertion, it swells and thickens over time, making the insertion more difficult. This is why a medium tear is preferable as there are no difficulties with the bag's closure as in these two types.
Note that suturing the abdomen with two sets of double-pointed needles can be used for abdominal suturing and in general body surgernology, while the other two sets are specialized for all surgical procedures except mainly for suturing the abdomen.
I'll explain it to you one by one, so if the wound is small and something comes out of the bag with difficulty in repairing it, then either for a smaller tear as we said or because the bag has bulged before air cooling.
If it is thus, then one should heat it so that a sponge or cloth saturated with water alone or boiled in it with henbane and henbit and dill seeds may be wrapped in the vessel until the swelling subsides.
The drink that contains itch, which is better than water alone for relieving swelling, if the swelling has subsided and the cloth in the vessel is removed, then pour boiled honey or bread into it from the left side of its opening.
If he cannot return after this treatment, a small amount of cloth withdrawn by the hooks that are used to extract them and the first treatment if possible, then must resort to hooking again when necessary and lack of remedy, which is an image of the instrument:.
Its one flat side is limited, the other side is unlimited, and the thin edge is not a blade but somewhat like a small pair of scissors as seen if the wound enlarges and enters the vessel, its response should be natural in shape.
And the special place for it if possible, and if the incision is wide and in the lower abdab to heal on its back with elevated legs from head down, and if it's upper abdominal make his head and chest higher than below him.
Similarly, if there is a tear in either of the two abdominal sides, make your intention and purpose always lie on the side where the surgery raises higher than the other side; thus it should be used in major surgeries and also in intermediate ones.
As for small surgeries, place it as you can manage; then sterilize your hands and have an assistant hold the entire tear with both hands and gather together his own fingers; then he will expose it to undertake suturing afterwards.
This is the general suturing feature, to take a needle or several needles according to the size of the wound and leave from the edge of the tear enough thickness for the thread; then insert the needle without letting the thread enter it at all edges of the skin. With the edges of the suture underne. skin that have been performed from inside to outside and gathered up both skin edges as well as suture edges, now four loops; then tighten with a double thread around the needle on both sides until all wound edges are firmly joined together.
Then let the thickness of the finger also rest and insert another needle, then tie it with a thread as you did with the first needer, so that it remains in place until enough thread is needed from the suture to empty out all of the wound cavity, leaving the thread evenly between the thickness and smoothness.
Since slender needles cut the meat and thicknesses too quickly, it is necessary that they be medium in smoothness and thickness; thus it is not desirable to insert a needle near the edge of the skin.
So that the meat does not tear too quickly and the wound is allowed to heal before closure, also so that suturing is not too far from the edge; otherwise, the suture ends may injure the patient during sleep and cause them distress by ripping a piece of skin from each side attached to the suture.
Leave it until you know that the wound has healed; this type of suturing with a needle is suitable for small surgeries, as it may be completed with one or two stitches.
As for the second category of sewing, it involves gathering four strips on one side of the skin and a strip on the other side in one go with a needle threaded with a medium-stiff and thin string; then if these four strips are pulled through by this needle, they repeat the movement from where it started.
The thread is tied from the top of the wound, so that sewing according to stitching with twine is made wherein the surgeon pulls; and it makes between each stitch and the next a thickness of the small fleshy part of the finger, which this stitch is known by everyone.
With this stitch, the surgery was performed on a man's abdamajor incision had been made and the surgeon's incision widened to an inch, and it extended from its center towards two inches from the middle fascia.
He separated it after standing his incision away from the wound for fourteen days, and healed in the direction of fifteen days; and was treated until cured completely, and lived thereafter for many years acting normally in all respects, with doctors ruling that he would not regenerate.
It is amazing that I did not treat him with bandages because there was nothing suitable for treatment in the place, so I put two aloes on the sinew tear during the day and prepared to cleanse it with honey water until healed.
As for one of the two types of sutures mentioned, I refer to it in a passage by Galen who states that you should initiate suturing from the skin and insert the needle from outside to inside if the needle penetrated the skin and into the advancing muscle along the abdabit.
I left the suture from the alveus in the side where I inserted and penetrated with the needle, and if it penetrated on the other edge of the arcade, then I did so secondarily in the same arcade flap on the other side from within to outside.
Let the suture flap of this side and penetrate on the other edge from inside to outside, and you also punctured as you did with your puncture in the arcade to the flap of the alveus on its side until it is all done.
Then proceed also with the side by using its eye and line along the edge that was from the incision on the other side and remove the needle from the skin near it, then return it to the other skin and the edge of the incision at the other side along with this edge.
Then remove it from the skin of that side, and do this again and then do it one more time to achieve an incision entirely as follows, and sentence describe this stitching so that it resembles the stitches of barbers for haircuts.
So that the suture is made once from one side with the edge of the skin and left from the other side until it empties, as for the second type of stitching specific that was also mentioned by Galen in his words: [translation of Gallen's description].
It should be that they stitch it as an example of what the surgeons do, to gather all parts together with their respective counterparts naturally joining edge of sutures to edges on the other side and the margin of incision to its opposite margins just as I have described for you.
It is necessary to insert the needle in a nearby layer of tissue from outside and carry it into inside completely, along with its adjacent layers; then pull back the neednose and carry it from outside to inside these two layers again, then withdraw also.
It is to be executed from inside out in another tissue layer on the opposite side, this double stitching method is better than simple easy stitching mentioned by Galen, these are his words, and some of them have said that they might correct abdominal stitching with two needles. That is to insert a single thread and begin inserting the needle from near you and carry it to the other side, while another needle enters from the opposite side as well from near you in accordance with stitching of tents both ways.
Note that if the laceration is in the middle of the abdamoint it's stitching is more difficult than other parts of the abdomen, and as for bandaging a wound its treatment is determined by common surgeries standards and that is if you recognize blood leakage from the wound before air changes it and press on the cuff and cut and suture it while loaded with clamps.
Indeed, the wound had its course altered by air filled with some of the cloaks that adorned you until it healed and shed threads which covered the sutures and filth, then treat as your general surgery would dictate until recovery.
Indeed, you have not been filled with medication since the raw camel's wool bandage was applied and replaced twice during the day as I instructed until recovery; therefore, there is no need for another treatment in most cases if the surgercuas are simple, lest the main organs be involved in pain.
It was advised to immerse linen in lukewarm oil or rose balm and place it around the locations between the lambdoid and infraorbital bones, as I have a suspicion of aching pain or decay that often exposes itself through blackening swelling with a tight band.
Especially if the decay has reached the skin, becoming an open wound within itself; I know that what is thick in the channels heals easier and cleaner, whereas what is thin proves more difficult to cleanse.
Regarding the pouch known as fasting, it does not accept surgery when the spot lies within it due to its abundance of vessels and bone fragments, and its proximity to nerve tissue; however, if there is a protrusion from the wound and you have completely separated the piece on your gauze.
It has been a certain duration and it has turned green or black, so it should be pulled out with a string above the place that turns black; otherwise, bleeding will occur through the wound exposing vessels and nerves, then cut what is not attached.
Making both ends of the string attached from below the wound outside it will make it easier for you to pull and remove the protrusion when the piece falls and heal the wn, as mentioned in the pouch that is exposed; however, if there is a tear in the pouch and it is small.
It may happen that some people for the sake of not seeing a man who had stabbed his abdence with a dagger, and the wound was on the right side of the intestines, caused panic in the wound which became a snake releasing blood and gas; so I treated it as if there were no openings. Until the sore healed and the affected location was free, when I saw that the place had healed I feared for the patient that something bad might occur in its depths; therefore, I did not show it to him again and remained in better condition. He eats, drinks, gathers, enters the bathhouse and attends to his affairs; some of those with experience have mentioned that at times a wound was shown in the scrotum and it should have been rubbed for this characteristic.
He takes the large ants with their heads, gathers them in a lump and places one ant on the wound of the sore while its mouth is open; if it clings to it and tightens its jaws, then he places another ant near the first one.
She continues to do this with several annеls on the wound, then she removes them and rubs the wound; those heads remain attached within the scrotum until it heals completely and does not experience any further ailment, and it is also possible that the thread becomes detached.
He tries to get rid of the fixed animal from a suture in his after entering it, then he takes part of this thread from the animal's skin and ties it with a very thin delicate string; then he enters that string into the wound. In it, the iron wire is threaded through a tube and then inserted into the cavity; this method of sewing with silk and iron is only to be used when necessary for self-interest or compulsion.
If the tear is large and extensive, especially if it is in one of the narrow cavities where there is no hope or healing by suturing.
Chapter Six Hundred Eighty.
In the treatment of zincam and noseruptor.
Be aware that any ulcer or abscess, if it progresses and regresses, is considered an open wound and has not been sutured; it constantly produces pus which does never separates in the body part where it was located as a noseruptor or zincam.
It is actually a thickened, white mass without pain with it an air cavity like the hollow of a bird's tail feather.
And so they call it a feather, and sometimes it is consistently moist with pus and maybe the humidity has stopped at times, and this humid cuff can be abundant, scarce, thick, or thin.
In the account of surgeons, any wound that does not heal and no new tissue grows in it is one of nine reasons; either due to lack of blood in the body or its inflammation, or because within it on its edges there is a solid piece which prevents healthy tissue growth. Whether it is heavily soiled and dirty, or because the sore itself has become gangrenous, or because the material used to cover it is of poor quality, or because the medicine prescribed for treatment is unsuitable, or due to an infection caused by a type of worm within the community.
Whether it is heavily soiled and dirty, or because the sore itself has become gangrenous, or because the material used to cover it is of poor quality, or because the medicine prescribed for treatment is unsuitable, or due to an infection caused by a type of worm within the community. As demonstrated in the city of Serres, where diseases mature and tumors are naturally delayed, whether it is due to a single bone or multiple bones being affected, all these causes, signs, and treatments with medicines have been clarified by divisions.
It is for me to inform you about treating the nasal and Zaka, which works by manual labor, knowing that Nasores can occur in all parts of the body, including major arteries or nerves.
Or to the sinus or cavity, or to the pouch, or to a gland, or to a bone from the ribs, or to a vertebra from the spine, or to a joint of closely interconnected structures like the hand and foot and so on up to nearing an organ such as the heart.
From these types of diseases with this characteristic, which do not accept treatment and are incurable, it was from the cases that did not reach these positions that I mentioned, hoped for, and boasted about treating them.
I wanted to know about this, so take a needle made of copper or iron if the patient walks on his own; then in the patient it will be stitched with a fine glass needle because glass is flexible for the body.
Upon entry and turning towards surgery, the surgeon had numerous complaints from which you cannot deduce any by a subsequent needle one of his words; so that the moisture he injects with it flows towards other complaints and cures them.
Then examine where you can determine whether there is a bone or nerve or if the patient's cavity is far or near, or if it was one nasal with many complaints and stood on all that with your full strength of inquiry from the sickness its pain at being touched by your hand at that place.
In a manner similar to the causes and reasons for abscesses, if this has occurred as described above, then proceed with treatment based on confidence that it is indeed so.
The snake appears near or in a safe position far from the joint, nerve, blood vessel, or any of the locations you mentioned; it has shed its skin and is now bringing forth what was enclosed along with rotten meat and fatty flesh.
What grows in its mouth from meat or pus; treat it as described until it is cured, for the snake was far below and on an incline where you should have extracted it deeper if possible, then cleanse it of all rotten meats within.
Then use the crushed herb in potent medicine, apply it to the iron-like pit you have discerned within the snake; do so repeatedly until it consumes all remnants of decay from the depths of its body.
Then force it to wear the bandages from which healthy meat sprouts until it is cured; if it has not been healed by such means, proceed with examining and extracting as informed, for this snake was an obstruction that should have been removed based on your information.
When blood, nerve or organ is seen leaking, the bone is exposed and has some rot and darkness in it until its decay goes away; then treat it by applying what binds it firmly until healed, but if not healed, apply plaster as previously done.
Know that you have not completed the removal of decay, reveal everything underneath it, scrape and cleanse it with vigorous effort; if healed, then know that this decay is in a remote area away from the main decay and reveal everything beneath it.
Scrape and cleanse it with diligent effort, as the decayed bone was small and could be attracted; pull it all together with fine ligatures to heal thusly.
The bones were many and pulled all together; leave none of your effort, for you have encountered something from the ligatures without them and it was not in cutting them that there was danger, so cut the ligaments and flesh if they are present here and complete the removal of bone.
Since the removal of bone has not come to you in a short time, leave it on the wound so that it heals for days until what surrounds those bones from flesh and ligaments rots; preserve the wound so as not to reopen the gap that occurred during your work.
However, if you feared it, place the cast soaked in ground resin mixed with oil or a cast immersed in Egyptian ointment or any green ointnents; then once dried, they will be easy to remove and attract.
It was a bone, large like the shin or calf bone and its shape; only its face became rotten and swoln severely until that darkness and decay spread. Then the wound forced it to become seriously infected with parts of the bone decaying extensively, reaching as far as the eye socket, leaving no hope for healing.
And he cut it all the way to where the decay ended; then he treated it until it was completely healed. I tell you that a case occurred with a man in his leg, which served as an example and guidance for your treatment. This man had experienced old age.
Around the age of three, he developed a leg pain from an internal body movement until it communicated with the leg and formed a massive swelling; there was no cause from outside initially, but as time passed accompanied by medical errors, the tumor opened up.
From it, many and bad ingredients were used in the treatment until his leg swelled up and became full of large sores that spread like cheese and bodily fluids as a result of being treated by a group of doctors for two years, none of whom were skilled in handicraft.
Until you saw that his leg and the materials drained from those sores greatly, the man had emptied his body and turned yellow; a plague entered through one of those wounds, extending to the bone before all the sores were searched for.
They were interconnected, extending from one to another of all parts of the leg until a fissure appeared on one of those sores, and some bone was found rotten and darkened and healed but had penetrated to the brain where it spread out.
It allowed the rotten bone, and I thought it was not just that corruption which spread out when cut off but also did not reach other bones; therefore, the wound had to be treated with potions for a longer period without being bandaged before another portion of the bebon was discovered.
"I found the rot affecting the bone, so I drilled what appeared to be affected by this rot as well; then I threw it out without forcing or cauterizing it. Also, I exposed it further, but did not remove any of the bone yet. Gradually, I cut away part of the bone and bent it back until eventually, a significant portion of the bone was removed.
"I then extracted it with a tool and set the wound to heal quickly, using medicinal cauterization. This process required multiple repetitions in his treatment and surgery until the illness weakened significantly and the chances of survival increased while my fear for him faded away because this would occur every time there was excessive bleeding covering a healthy-looking membrane.
"And it grew at the bone site to become solid and his condition in his body improved, his strength receded, and he behaved normally without being afflicted by an illness that would hinder him while a bone fragment had broken off from somewhere in the body.
"It was best to display this characteristic, and that she should take a bandage to bind it on the side of the bone fragment and command someone to extend it upwardly, resulting in another layer of thicker gauze than the first.
Then fasten it on the thigh under the bone and extend its end to pull the flesh downwards, so that you can expose the location where you want to place it without letting the chisel harm the flesh; then put wood or a board under the bone from below through a hole.
If you did this and the chisel did not cut off a decayed bone, then the placement should be slightly above the site of decay so that there is no hidden decay in the bone cavity; otherwise, it must be reinserted again as the patient will feel it.
The bone was rotten and not attached to each other, but the decay was in between them or within one of them; so all the flesh is pulled from all its parts, then wood is placed underne. After that, it is reinserted at the first site where the rot is located.
If it is reinserted from another site and the placement is slightly beyond the decay as we said, then the rot was within the same joint of the rotten piece and the bone was placed where it connects on the other side.
If the decay is not in a disjoint, but rather in two joints of a finger or hand, then its treatment would be very difficult, but it should still burst out as much as possible and remove all traces of it.
In any case, to straighten a bone when it is not affected by scurvy or paralysis, be aware that the use of saws and chisels for cutting these bones is frequent according to the position, insertion, hardness, layering, enlargement, reduction, firmness, and flexibility of the bones. Therefore, it is necessary for each type of work to have a device for that particular work.
Know that the work itself may become spoiled due to the type of device you need if it is a long apprenticeship and expertise in this craft, because skill in the trade and witnessing such diseases are matters. One may deduce from tools for each disease, and I am acquainted with you in this matter according to several other devices.
They make examples to follow and measure with them against others, an image of a saw: (Albucasis here illustrates his textbook entry with images).
An image of another saw: (Again, Albucasis would provide visual aid to help readers understand the tools described in the passage).

On the side is Marud acting in many places of eye socket, a mere image to correct what has fallen out of the eyes:.
On the side is an acute triangle of scales, made from Indian iron, and so should all that we mentioned from mouns and meshes be made:.
The seventh section eight.:
On the sides and spreading of eyes:.
If the sides have become infected either from external or internal causes, if treated with medication and if the treatment does not work, and if you see the infection spreading to the tissue:.
It should be cut to where the infection has reached, either for it to heal or from a major illness that is worse than losing the limb; and signs indicating this include the limb turning black until you think the fire has burnt it.:
Or if the blackening spreads until it reaches that limb and takes up most of the body, then it is to be amputated; and so if the cause of infection were from one of reaching a sewer or spring or ditch:.:
Indeed, corruption or abscess on the edge of the finger only requires cutting off the finger; do not delay in treating the corruption so that it does not spread to the hand; likewise if taken in the hand, cut it from the origin at the elbow and do not delay in treating the corruption before it spreads to the forearm.
Likewise, if taken in the arm, cut off the arm at the joint of the same joint; do not delay to treat the corruption and it spreads towards the armpit for otherwise dying from this illness, other than that use any possible treatment as much as energy allows.
Likewise, if taken in the finger cut off the finger at one of the joints; and if taken in the man's armpit, cut off his arm by severing it with a saw; climbing up towards the thigh, cut off the leg at the knee joint.
And if the corruption has reached above the thigh, there is no escape but to succumb to death from the illness; describe cutting off or spreading a limb and tie it tightly below where you want to cut it and tie another rope above that position.
Extend the lower rope and extend the other above, carve off your meat between the two with a broad knife until all of it unfurls; then cut or spread. And put an arrow through both ends as required by all sides for piercing the bowstring.
Unless the saw is placed correctly to expose the illness, causing excessive pain and inflammebelgien, a bleeding will occur during your work with great speed or take some coagulating agents for blood then proceed to treatment until it empties.
Then attach the injured bone with a pin that suits it and treat until healed, I will tell you an example of a case presentation in which a man has this deformity in his leg like the image I showed you and that is how it happened due to melanoma with necrosis resembling fire.
That decay was the first to occur in his finger until the man took all of it, and he went to the doctor who saw the decay seeking the affected bone with intensity as if finding pain and necrosis only found at the joint cutting him off.
As time passed, the presentation of that decay in his blue-black finger caused him to amputate it and he removed that flaw because he had taken medication on his hand after cleaning his body; however, he did not apply bandages again making it seek another finger.
The decay spread to his hand, so he had an amputation and requested that I put on a bandage for the flaw and also feared another when he was about to have his hand amputated because the man's strength was declining, and as Manny passed away, he went back to his homeland.
He was informed that he had cut off his own hand with a knife, and I have only narrated this story to be useful for those afflicted by this disease and as evidence upon which one might rely.
Chapter Eighty-Eight.
In the treatment of mastitis and how to administer it with medication.
If there is a tumor in some of the soft tissues and the swelling lasts for so long that it bursts or deflates, then all its contents are expelled within the period and the place remains empty as if it were an empty vessel.
The skin that has this condition resembling a scrape and it is not severe enough to affect the bone or nerve or joint, so from here it deserves to be called a cyst. It has only been named Naosor if its course reaches until the decay affects one of these parts.
Then it is called Naosor or Zakama, and its treatment involves removing all the skin as if peeling off a layer, especially if that scraping condition has solidified and confirmed not to be attached to the decayed area.
Indeed, they requested that the skin be attached and it did not reach decay from there; the amount in the skin was sour meat treated with a syringe, and when looking at the bandage it was large, with a froth emitting a strong odor behind it being cured by Egyptian medicine.
It is a mixture of oil, honey, gum arabic and equal parts put in a container and boiled on the fire until the medicine thickens and turns into beeswax, then take it in your handkerchvee, dilute with water and honey, inject it into the dressing, press the mouth and leave the medicine in for two hours.
Then remove it with tweezers and do so for a few days until the dressing is cleaned and the sore goes away, and if you don't have this medicine injected, you can inject alum water; take alum from oak or poplar wood chips and boil them in water.
Then spread it and inject with it until the dressing shows that it has been washed, then there is no chance of infection on the Egyptian medicine or alum water if you mixed something from the gum powder into it.
He fills it with honey and wine mixed, for the purpose of honey is to purify and cleanse, while the wine soaks the abscess, especially if there is a preference for vinegar in it which helps draw out pus; thus, after several repetitions, when confirmed that the abscess has been completely cured as evidennced by meat growing within.
He takes the balm of honey and fills it with rose oil and vinegar or injects him with some drugs and other bandages whose qualities we have described in the article on bandages, so that at the mouth of the abscess is a narrow opening through which to insert the needle.
Expands it slightly with iron or place a fuse in the Egyptian bandage or the Serpentine bandages until it is wide, and similarly if the mouth is also wide, then join its edges with stitches and leave it for as long as needed to insert the needle into it.
Similarly, if the mouth where he inserts the needle is raised too high in place to insert the honey into a lower place because honey, if injected into the abscess cavity, prevents meat from growing within it.
Indeed, you cannot open the capsule towards the bottom as desired so that the bone is pulled upwards easily from it according to what seems suitable to you and does not retain anything of wax in it.
And as for the sutures that are placed on the capsule from outside, how to place them so that it takes one of the surgical tools and stretches out according to what you want and is as far as possible withdrawn into the capsule so that it covers all of it. Then scrape around the mouth of the capsule with a small incision wider than the mouth, then stretch the bandage on another tear to the extent of the hole and place it there neatly spaced away from the mouth of the capscu to facilitate the removal of wax from it so that only the large tear is removed afterward.
Several days, and as for those on the mouth of the capsule that are removed at each time to extract what has accumulated in wax and recognize what can be extracted from it is much or little or decayed or not?
And with this also examine the position of the capsule itself if its owner feels pain in it or not and wound or no wnid. If your treatment continues thus and you see the material that exudes from the mouth of the capscu.
Understand that if the dressing has become stuck or is adhered, then remove it either from yesterday or on the third day after the wound has been examined. Replace the rupture with something else and renew the bandage; eventually, the dressing will come off without any leakage.
He is close to it, because there are people who delay removing the meat from their wound and others in contrast, eventually the dressing comes off after many days without becoming putrid; if the bandage has not adhered then you know that the meats have been delayed.
He has delayed in drying the drugs and let the medication have moisture in its substance but hardness like nail polish if it has been increased, causing an increase in anxiety; from those who inform what they are treating with it to take off nail polish.
He dissolves with rose water and rubs it on the spot, then kneads and utilizes it, performing this action similarly if he has not brought the nail polish remover; if he cooked until it boiled and used or took from the jar marjoram, patience, cinnamon, crushed all together, and ground them on honey while over a fire. Then wrap it in a bandage and press it onto the swelling or let it drip with boiled honey until it rises, allowing grains to fall on it, then place the bandage and press it down.
It has been used in cases such as long bandages, Ammangus root, and powdered Chrysanthemum leaves, as well as licorice sticks or individually or collectively to grind them, crush them, and let grains fall on honey that she described, using the plaster method for a period of time without knowing whether the patient recovered from this treatment indicates that there was an infection.
It has been effective in treating the nasal condition presented by... (The translation is incomplete and seems to be cut off, but this would generally precede a description of a specific medical case or symptoms.)
The ninth and eighty (chapter). (This appears to be just the title for a section in the textbook, indicating Chapter 98.)
In the treatment of paralyzed ankles and toes, cutting overgrown nails, and separating fused fingers. (This line describes different treatments for various conditions as listed in the textbook.)
The ankle is a swelling that often occurs beneath the thumb or toe of the hand or foot and sometimes on other fingers; if neglected for treatment, it can become inflamed and sore. (This would be a description from the textbook regarding the condition referred to as "the anamnesis" in this context.)
He became infected and gangrenous until he ate away at the root of his nail, possibly destroying it entirely and possibly reaching decay to the bone until it had an offensive smell, with the end of the finger becoming wide and having a color like charred wood; if treated as we mentioned in the cutting section and did not recover.
It was necessary to cut out all the seepage that came from the nail, then scrape the wound afterward; in this case, the treatment is highly beneficial. If the bone is healthy and so is the nail.
The angle of the nail cavity had pinched the flesh inward and caused it to become numb and swollete It was necessary to place a fine poultice under the edge of the nail that pinches the flesh and raise it up, then cut away that flesh gently.
Place on what remains of the flesh a poultice of burning powders until it all disappears, then treat with bandages until healed; if the decay has affected the bone, cut out that bone and remove it because as long as there is foul bone tissue, he will not be cured.
Indeed, seeing consumption and decay seeking to spread through the limb alone, it is necessary to cut off a finger during one of the convalescence periods as mentioned by him, then treat it until healed; if the toe was struck or amused, causing severe pain, it was necessary for the disease to be separated first.
Then, the toe is cut with a sharp instrument in an oblique incision from top to bottom and protected so that it does not reach the muscle underneamoan; doing so alleviates the condition and causes severe pain, leading to excess tissue growth at the site, then treat the location as it houses the symptoms.
As for the excess flesh that develops on certain fingers of people, sometimes consisting entirely of muscle or perhaps having some bones in it and maybe a toenail, one being at the root of a joint with some other fingers.
Or it may be that the growth occurs on some fingers of convalescence and does not move, or in a joint of the finger where perhaps there was motion, consisting only of flesh; it is easier to cut off such parts at their root using a flat blade.
As for the one whose plant is at the root of the joint, its treatment involves cutting it off entirely. And as for the one that grew on a finger among the digits, it should first have its base cut in a circular manner to the bone, and then spread the bnage with one of those contraptions that are suitable for this purpose.
Then treat it until he is cured, and as for the adhesion that exposes fingers to each other frequently, causing what humans produce through intercourse or after a wound or burn of similar nature, it should be scraped off.
Until the fingers return to their natural state, then place a pledget or poultice soaked in rose oil between them, not allowing them to rub against each other quickly and causing separation, or make a thin sheet of tin separating them until they heal at the appropriate location.
Likewise, if the adhesion between fingers is exposed to the palm, scrape off that adhesion according to what seems suitable and heal it with a method resembling tissue formation.
Chapter Nine.
Cut the cysts.
Cysts are swollen, bluish fluid-filled sacs that occur in various parts of the body and more frequently on the legs, especially near the fingertips, toes, veins, muscles, and workers, it is best first to use manual lymph drainage from a dark bruise repeatedly.
Then, extract the essence of the balsamic substance, and as for treating it with iron on two occasions, one shall puncture and expel the black blood and the other to drain the pus and expel it along with its root; but if the latter is puncte
Until the thick, clotted blood is dissolved, then elevate the patient's leg from above to below at the bandage point and puncture the pus in one place or two places or three wide openings.
Then the black blood oozes from your hand from below the leg upward and from above down to expel as much blood as you can or according to the strength of the patient, then bind it and restrict foods made for the occasion of the blackening and induce further depletion and evacuation.
When the pus fills and damages the patient, if it has a lot of hair on its leg in this condition, then bathe the leg with hot water to make it rise up until it reddens or drains pus strongly.
If he has not been in the bath until the part is warm, then cut the skin near the vein either at its end next to the knee or below it at the ankle, and open the skin with a scalpel; let the blood flow from each direction until it becomes visible.
When it appears red and thick as a cord after being cut from the skin, if so enter beneath it until it rises out of the skin; clamp with blackened blunt needles then make another incision near that incision to the extent of about three fingers' widths.
Then draw out the skin over the vein until it appears; raise with a cautery as you did before, and clamp with another blunt needle; then make another incision or multiple incisions if necessary.
Then remove and cut the skin at the end of the second incision near the ankle; draw up until blood is seen from the second incision, then pull it towards the first incision and do so until all above incisions have been pulled, cutting them if necessary to extract completely.
Indeed, you must not lure or attract with a thinned thread. Insert the needle underneebrød and pull it out to each side until it exits; ensure that it does not snap. If it breaks, then it is very difficult for him to escape from your grip.
If the patient is contaminated, then if you drip all of it, place in surgical position and coat with thick soap dissolved in wine or rose water or oil; treat until he recovers, and the function was convulsive with tremors to his limbs.
It was not straight as we mentioned earlier; you should shave at each of his treatments and positions, then clip with scissors until he is completely bald. If it bleeds or cuts him, then it will be very difficult for him to hold on; maintain your effort.
Image of the patient being shaved:
Picture of the blindfolded surgeon:
She has no headscarf fringe and the side is not sharp to bleed or cut, as we stated earlier; she should be thickly bandaged because it is delicate (she cut her blood flow with a fast one).
Surgery and Instruments Book IX
In the case of common racial groups.
This race originates in the lower limbs, such as countries like Hajaz and Arab nations, and those with hot climates but less fertile skin; perhaps it also arises from other parts of the body that are not extremities, due to an infectious disease occurring underneath the skin.
These occur within the body, in worms and roundworms that originate between the skin and flesh; a sign of this race occurring is when it happens in the leg with severe inflammation, then the affected area heals, followed by bleeding where the sweat comes out.
As if it were a plant or animal, if one side of him appears, then he should wrap around a small piece of lead that has been weighed from an ounce to two drams and tied with knots; the lead is left hanging by his leg.
When something comes out from the lead outside of its wrapping and it is tied tightly, cut off part of it and wrap up what remains without cutting it from its origin before all of it has come out because if you cut it, it will shrink and enter into the flesh causing abscesses and pus formation at the site with a poor healing.
Therefore, it is necessary to continue rubbing and lancing a little until the object passes through completely, leaving nothing in the body; sometimes this blood may be as long as five fingers by ten (inches).
He noted that it exited a man with twenty fingers, but was stopped when treating him; he entered an incision and sutured it tightly along the body until everything drained out, and then tried to fix the position with medication for several days.
Then he treated it with cancer treatment; this drainage may have many branches, especially if it arose in the male's joint or within himself causing much gas and exiting from every mouth of each branch as we mentioned earlier to treat by segmentation and what follows.
Chapter Two and Nine.
On the abscess under the skin caused by worms, called bovine bladder (cysticercosis).
This disease, called bovine bladamoose in some countries because it is often exposed to cattle, consists of one small worm that originates between the skin and muscle tissue throughout the body upwards and downwards. (The instruction and solution follow an example similar to the previous task: translating a specific text with constraints on additional content.)
It becomes apparent to the touch as it is drawn from one member to another until it pierces where it broke through in the skin, and then it emerges and forms a contamination of various mingling liquids as shown by flies, animals, and insects that feed on vegetables within the body.
However, it is expected that if it drips in the body and rises to the head and reaches the eyes, causing them to open and exit, thus curing the eye, this will be presented greatly; if one desires its treatment and removal, then it occurs by being drawn out and revealed through touch.
It was necessary to grip it above and below with a good quality pincers, then pry it open and extract it; as it sank into the flesh and could not be found on the correct position by fire until burnt, and most of its expected contamination is for the eye, as we mentioned.
I saw that it had become near the eye in the head, gripped underneath by a firm pinch on the jaw, then pried open and extracted; it is appropriate for the patient to commit to cleansing their body with medicines conducive to dispelling putrid concoctions and guarding against foods prone to contamination.
Chapter III and IX.
In the cleft of the disease known as onchomycosis.
This disease, referred to as onchomycosamenous in our land, presents with pain in some body parts and then spreads from one part to another; I have seen it described here for you.
I instructed a woman with an affliction in her leg to expose her arm; upon examination, she had a swelling traveling along the tendon of her forearm and after some time, I observed this swelling expanding outward like a worm does when it wriggles up its back as quickly as possible.
If the swelling moved from one place to another, it disappeared from that spot and reappeared in the back, then after an hour spread throughout her body until reaching the other arm, at which point I observed her entire body rotating as though I had seen it with my own eyes.
I was amazed at the speed with which it moved from one part to another, and until then I had not seen this disease present in such a manner on this particular case; only once did I see a group of people whose afflictions migrated from body part to body part as I have observed here.
I did not appreciate it except that the woman was from a slender body, exposed heart, here emerged to sense such a smell and had to be seen on this scale in those of comfort and concealed watery abdomen.
If you wish to treat him and he feels pain then look at the back as we mentioned before, press up on it quickly and cut through until that smell comes out.
It is not that you see it with your eye, treat the body by pressing and expelling such odors as lupine seeds or soybeans do, similarly from medicines,.
Chapter Fourteen. The section title.
In the output of the syringe. The image caption for a tool used in surgery, likely to be part of Albucasis's medical instrument descriptions.
The needles may vary depending on their types and the positions where they are located in the body, as well as according to their types there being large ones and small ones, of which some are hollow glass and others are opaque glass, and among them some have three angles and four angles. This excerpt describes different types of needles that may be used for surgical procedures or medical treatments, with variations in size, material (glass), transparency, and shape.
From it [an abscess] come its teeth and offshoaturms, and whatever the parts are that reside in it will be on one or two sides either primary organs enveloped like the brain and heart and liver and lungs and kidneys and bladder and spleen. When the arrow fell into one of these organs and signs of impending death that I described to you occurred, it would be best for you to avoid expelling that arrow from it as in most cases its owner will die upon doing so. If these signs of impending death did not appear and the arrow was not lodged in the organ, then expel it and treat the wound; from signs of the brain if an arrow hit it and perforated the skull, causing a fracture on top of the brain, this will manifest as severe headache and dizziness.
If these signs of impending death did not appear and the arrow was not lodged in the organ, then expel it and treat the wound; from signs of the brain if an arrow hit it and perforated the skull, causing a fracture on top of the brain, this will manifest as severe headache and dizziness. Redness in the eyes, red tongue, agitation and confusion with vomiting; if hit again and possibly blood gushed from the nostrils or ears, perhaps speech ceased and voice went out, humidity similar to pus exited from the wound site indicating a watery type of hemorrhage.
Indeed, these signs have appeared to you regarding the treatment of the illness and extraction of the thorn if it has not come out, and as for the signs of the thorn if the heart was struck and is close to the left side and felt as though it had been thrust into something solid rather than empty.
Perhaps the thorn had a movement resembling a pulse and blood seeped from the wound, followed by coldness of the limbs, pale sweat, and darkness falling over the patient indicating that death was certain, with signs of the thorn if the lung was struck resulting in oily blood discharging from the injury.
The veins that rise to the neck taper, the color of the illness changes and breathing becomes rapid while craving cold air; if the thorn struck the chest fascia near the small ribs, breathing is heavy with severe pain.
All abdominal organs are swelling and moving, with the liver being struck followed by severe pain and bloody discharge from the wound resembling its color in hue, and if the appendix was hit there may be food-like matter not digested coming out of the injury.
He orders the apparent case, and if the arrow is in it or a swelling appears there from the discharge of the wound or abscess or an opening that has been injured, not being closed during treatment nor through drainage of the arrowhead, then the arrow was lodged in the bladder and the urine flowed out.
Among them, something emerges externally and the pain intensifies in the patient; be aware that it is a tumor. As for the organs such as the head, eyes, neck, shoulders, elbows, ribs, lympshade, thighs, and limbs, they have been handed over on the spot.
If the arrow did not encounter a vein or nerve and the arrow was not poisoned, I inform you of some observations from these arrows that can lead to inference about your treatment; it is an indication that the arrow may have been lodged in the man's nostril at its origin.
Another arrow was extracted from another side under the eyelid, and it was free of deformity; no incident occurred in his eye which caused a turn. An arrow fell out for a Jew who had been lodged in the eyelid under the lower lid and the arrow had slipped, leaving only its small end that is attached to wood.
"It was a large arrow from the Jewish arrows used in surgery, which were square iron blades without holes and did not cause an accidental mishap when inserted into the eye." And another arrow came out of my Nureddin's circle.
"He had his ears cut through between the earlobangs, and it appeared as though he had been wounded in that circle of Nureddin's; another arrow emerged from a man who seemed to have been pierced in the abdomen, and we estimated that he would die because of this.
"When thirty days or so had passed and nothing changed in his condition, an arrow was dug up from him, turned over on top of it, and another arrow emerged cleanly without causing any accident." I saw a man who had been struck by an arrow in the back of his head that healed.
"After seven years, an arrow came out of his leg's origin; I saw a woman who had been hit in the abdamen by an arrow and healed from the wound; the arrow remained with no change to her condition or anything she did naturally.
I saw another man who had a spear in his face, covered the wound and there was not much pain for him, as with many others, two spears were removed from someone of the Sultan's beard that fell onto the right side slightly.
I buried the spear completely and treated him after three days since it happened; the spear wound was very narrow, so I examined it with a fine probe but felt nothing, there is pain beneath his right ear from the incision.
I discovered that the tip of the spear is near it, so I applied a compress at the spot; and hoping for an infection to develop and the location of the spear point to emerge more clearly, there was no movement from the place where the incident occurred, indicating that the spej reached its target.
I continued to apply the compress for many days with no further incident; the illness persisted until I felt the spear one day within his nose, and then after being informed of this news, I placed a strong medicine on the wound for several days.
Until I opened it and examined it, I felt a small sharp object attached to the wood; then I injected that drug directly into the wound, after which Einar came before us with his eye on the side of the arrow, and moved for some time towards it.
Then, as the wound expanded and I was able to enter the canals in it, it attracted and moved a film which did not leave immediately but began to be affected by various devices until one day I captured him with tightened channels appearing at some point after that.
The doctors ruled that the swelling of the nose should not be drained and bandaged, but to cure the wound and completely heal without harming it in any way, I am informing you on how to extract some arrows to make this a standard and guideline for what has not been mentioned.
Because these parts of the trade and details are not understood by description nor related to it, only a skilled craftsamo gauges sparingly on what is plentiful and upon matters that have been neglected; he deduces new work and new mechanisms at times when encountering strange events.
If the matter descends from this craft, I say that the arrow only exits the body where it was lodged in on two types: either by being attracted back to the original location and exiting from there, or by exiting from another side of the body opposite to where it entered.
Either the arrow is prominent in a muscle location and attracts, exiting from there, or if you should not leave immediately after entering it, it is appropriate to wait for days until the surrounding flesh around it heals easily allowing for attraction and release. If lodged in bone, however.
You should not release it too quickly, but bring and move toward the arrow daily until exiting; you should not leave after days, instead drill around the arrow in the same be
The lodged arrow in the skull bone reached into one hemisphere of the brain, presenting symptoms that I mentioned to you; hold onto attracting the arrow and leave it until its matter clears after days.
He removed the arrow and its discharge, which were greatly inflamed; you should not attempt to remove it but rather use a probe around the arrow as I have described to you, then treat the spot until healed, and if the arrow has slipped into another part of the body. He was absent from consciousness when examined with a probe, but I felt it and pulled it using some instruments that help in its extraction; however, it could not be removed through the wound or around the arrow's tip inside the anus, and there were no bones or nerves.
He pulled until the wound expanded and was able to extract the arrow, which had tendons attached; he skillfully removed all fat from around them using any means possible, but if you cannot remove it through a cut in both ears or tear their lobes until they are freed.
If you attempted to extract the arrow from any place, try grasping it with all your fingers towards its parts until freed and consult an expert in case it is very difficult for you to attract or remove it; otherwise, you could not manage it at that time.
For several days until the meat has rotted, then bring it back as it becomes easier; if you object to that, let your blood drip and do what we mentioned in its treatment on page one, and preserve your effort by using ligature or a bandage or a tourniquet.
Simplify the suture and do so gently and firmly as you described, and use it when attracting the arrow to ensure that the disease develops in the same way it was when the arrow hit.
You cannot do that, use what you can find with the arrow if it is coming out of the opposite side, either because something protrudes from it to the outside or if you feel the tip of the arrow near the skin surface.
Pull it as much as possible until the sinews become looser, then attract so that removing becomes easier; hold onto a bone fragment with your hand on a twisted direction until the arrow affects the binge and expands within itself before withdrawing.
Otherwise, let it rest for days until the arrow is out; if reinserting the arrow was attempted, then because the splinter fell and a tube was used to insert into its cavity at the back of the armpit, push with it.
Indeed, the awl was hollow; he pushed it through by using a device that entered into this cavity. Thus, the awl easily exits. If the awpit had been poisoned within whatever flesh it was in, all of its poison should be consumed. Then treat it as necessary for that purpose.
Indeed, the awl that was actually in the chest or belly or udder or thigh was similar to what one might pierce with a needle; you can make an incision and remove it along with a vein or nerve.
Then mark the wound line if you need to suture, then treat it until healed; image of the tendons that attract awls:.
Its ends are like a bird's beak, as if made from a chisel when it grabs an awl or something that didn't let go; there may be adult and juvenile varieties of this, each according to the strength and thickness of the shaft and size of the wound.

Chapter Five and Ninety-Nine.
In the vascamo region.
In the vascamo region where usually thirteen veins are found in the body, three dozen arteries with pulsating veins behind the well-known tympani and sphenoids on both sides of the brain; as visible at the temples and those known as optic nerves near each eyeball.
And the vein situated at the center of the forehead, and the one found at each nostril; as well as the arteries behind the neck and those in the upper lip adjacent to the mouth, along with the ones underneath it named jugulars and carotid arteries.
As for the veins that are found in arms and hands, there are five: one called vena comitans from the wild side known commonly as the crown vein, also referred to as corona arteries being the middle ones, combined from tributaries of Basilica and those from the Vena Comitans, collectively named as the body's veins.
And Basilica, from the human side also known as the epigastric vein, and commonly named iliac artereen; located at the forearm is the vena comitans or biceps brachii, found on top of the wrist with a clear appearance called Asiaticus.
The excretion that is between the calf and ankle has two branches, on the leg there are three vessels: one under the thigh bone from the wild side and the second being clear [vein] at the knee on the human side and the woman's vessel near the heel from the wild side.
On the other leg there are three vessels like those, and the veins behind the ears help with chronic dropsy, eczema, scrofula, and chronic skull sores; how to use them for treatment.
It is that the scalp swelling and its tip are pulled at the place of veins with a rough scrape well then strangle the affliction around the neck with a kerchief until the veins emerge and their locations behind the ears in the lower places from the head, examine them by your finger where you feel them pulsate under your finger there make note with thread.
Then take a surgical scalpel that you know as the nashil then insert it under the vein in the skin until reaching the bone, raise your hand with the vein and skin upward and cut the vein along with the skin cleanly and bevelled, the length of the cut two finger-breadths.
He approaches and sends blood as desired, then tightens them with a ligature and leaves until they recover; the first in the book describes cutting them and sewing them up, while severing the two vessels on the temples is beneficial for the chronic headache and severe pain and persistent swelling and intense curiosity pointing to the eyes.
How to remove them as described above, tighten the ailment with a bandage until the sweat appears so that you can feel its clear appearance and their pulses become evident under your fingers; then learn it by rote, then raise the skin from top of the sweat to just below your finger.
The flat plate is inserted from below and raised to the sweat, which it clears as it did in the other two sweats; sends blood according to your need then the disease heals itself and you place your finger on the sweat for an hour.
Then it is placed on him with a catgut and silk, tightly wrapped until he recovers; their mention comes first in the book, including cutting them up and suturing them. As for severing the forehead sweat after severing the jugulars was beneficial for chronic facial problems such as pimples, pus, and dark redness,.
How to drain as I explained to you, constrict the patient's neck with a bandage until blood appears, then take the device called the gouge and this is how it looks like:
Place the needle protruding from the tip of the gouge onto the same vein and strike upwards with a brush or something similar, allowing the blood to flow into the container you wish for; then unclog the patient'nose and squeeze until he breathes.
It should only be opened with a broad blade, not the edges of scalpels but rather slightly open; avoid deviation as bones are close and may cause breaking if too sharp.
Both types of veins in the eyelid are effective for treating eye conditions such as strain, redness, tears, and facial illnesses; to drain them, constrict the patient's neck with a bandage then drain while standing behind their head with a slightly open broad blade.
If the location is not ideal, it may cause a sharp tip to break off; thus send blood into your container and place a string over them for one night then drain, useful for draining nose veins from severe sneezing.
Severe headaches and facial diseases such as red sores presenting in the nose, especially if chronic; how to cure them by lifting the patient's neck and holding their left nostril with a fine needle.
It pushes back into the center of its cavity itself between nostril obstructions because since pus is not detectable here, blood protrudes from it in a few hours; you should press with the needle and send some blood to your vein and then bandage it overnight as it quickly rebels.
As for removing the boils, beneficial to compress them initially with a sore and starting bandages; dark-colored skin diseases that appear on the surface of the skin such as black ulcers, blisters, and poor wounds, how to cure them by pressing above them in their neck and the surgeon standing behind the patient's head.
The patient is seated on a chair then the pus runs out widely, somewhat quickly and moderately or as much you deem necessary for it to do so, then do likewise with another vein, finally untie the bandage.
The excerpt reads: "When the blood is thick, apply a moderate pressure to not choke the sickness; by morning he will recover from the wound, and separating these veins after extracting the quffal helps against oral cavities, foul breath, decayed teeth and gums, bad ulcers, and splitting of the nails.
The excerpt reads: "If they are located in the nose, near it, separate them so that the illness is overcome and its back is choked with a bandage; then change their nails and look at the veins, one on the right side of the lip and the other on the left.
The excerpt reads: "Also, they are thin black veins that are cut along their length, shaped as described to not let the main vein escape and make them visible and similarly handle the veins in the lower lip.
The excerpt reads: "Also, the veins under the tongue are beneficial to separate after extracting the quffal for tonsillitis and mouth diseases; describe how they should sit between your hands like a sun-shaped bracelet, lift the tongue upward, look down at the tongue from one side showing a vein in black and on the other side another black vein.
He dissected them and preserved such that one does not look upon the cuts, as underneastern there are vessels where bleeding occurs from these vessels; and as for the three veins that dissect at the attachment, it is the one that usually runs with a separation in people, of which two faces are present.
Either they inserted a broad aloe or olive oil into the wound, and either they made an incision with a knife bone [and this is her image]. The image of the broad aloe leaf:.
It shall be broad as you see to open the prominent bulging filled veins, and those that cause thick blood like mucus; this is the image of the olive oil:.
This tool is thinner and shorter with a pointed end to dissect the thin veins that cause pale yellow blood; this is the image of the bone knife:.
This bone knife is for incision and it comes in different shapes depending on the vein size, as well as its thickness; one can deduce from this type others that are not mentioned here by the craftsman.
As for the pastrine vein, which is one of these three veins, it is useful to dissect as it draws blood from the channels under the throat and neck leading to the chest and abdomen; when dissecting, one should be cautious so that a slip with their hand leads them to an artery below which they would cut this vessel.
In the event of bleeding, it is better to drain it with a tube rather than letting it form an abscess; the appearance of pus was not clear and therefore should be avoided or altered by removing some of its contents.
If the vein is clear, it should be drilled with a tube as previously instructed to empty it by looking at it before gripping the arm; determine its position until you can identify the pulse point and then proceed with suturing using the thread.
Then, tie the arm and create a slanting incision with a lancet as previously mentioned so that the strike falls at a distance from the artery's location, and when you see it while tying the knot in the position where you learned to suture using the thread, then that swelling is the pulsation of the vessel; avoid that area.
I noticed the bleeding after draining as previously instructed and the blood was thin and red, which indicated that it is arterial blood; then you should press your finger on it for a long time, and when you remove your finger, the blood stops flowing rapidly and eventually ceases once you secure the arm.
Leave him, and protect the patient from negligence so that he lies on his back for days until he recovers; if the blood does not stop and you win over it, nor did any medication reach your veins in time, when one of the sides shrinks, then the blood cuts off.
Take the peel of a quince and pierce it, then hold one half tightly with string or thread for another day; if the blood stops and not otherwise treated according to what is described regarding occlusive therapy for bleeding, cut off his blood easily in most cases.
To make a small wound and allow the bandage on the arm, for sweating to be effective in drawing blood from above the head and below the body so that it is collected by a bundle of pus from a part of the lymph nodes and a part of the spleen as we have said.
The bleeder should be on his back so that below it is a bundle of pus and the nerve is injured, causing pain in the head and possibly not recovering from the beginning as this naturally occurs frequently.
Indeed, some people have a delicate nature that is not clearly visible; it should be made into an incision with the edge of a scalpel and avoiding the nerve, then if the blood between two nerves flows continuously, stop there for a while until the bleeding stops; as for pulsating blood, cutting this vein helps to draw blood away from the head.
It is beneficial for eye disecuases, if you wish to do so, cut the vein and use a lemon or lavender extract because it sanctifies all vessels as there are no nerves below it.
It is necessary for you when making the incision to avoid only the muscle cap and ask for a gentle approach, it will not harm if the first cut does not heal by itself multiple times; however, in some people, inflammation may occur if not successfully cut on the first attempt.
However, this swelling does not harm it; as for how to cut and its features, the first thing you should know that incision is only used for preserving health.
Whether it is used in diseases and those which are used to preserve health and sustain it, as well as prevent the occurrence of disehemce, then there should be an effectiveness within one of the three main veins located at the junction: vena cava inferior (inferior vena cava), aorta (the artery that carries blood away from the heart to all parts of the body), and pulmonus (pulmonary artery). And it should be effective in the first spring if signs of congestion appear.
The effectiveness should be on Saturday or Tuesday, after three hours have passed since noon, and the effectiveness of that which is used for diseases does not have a fixed time but when needed due to urgency or necessity during nights or days.
At every hour and at all times, it is not permissamo that boys under the age of fourteen be affected until they have reached that age, nor should old men who are over sixty years of age be affected if one were to administer an effectiveness without regard to their faces.
It should be drained before the effectiveness by a gentle injection if there is a great amount of blockage that does not attract to the veins during drainage from the vessel, lest it cause darkened fluid harmful to the main organs; and do not affect those who are overweight, diabetic, or lethargic until they have recovered.
Also, be cautious after the purgation and vomiting, as well as constipation, excessive diarrheamo, fatigue, exercise, staying up late, fasting, and anything that diminishes the vital energy of either body or soul; then examine whether the blood is thickened before proceeding.
With food and drink, if possible, then enter the bath unless prevented by a hindrance or engage in some exercise to stimulate the blood flow and ensure expulsion in the chest as we said before; rest from purging all psychic defects during the day.
With melancholy, anger, fear and all bodily afflictions such as fatigue, lethargy, diarrhea, and so forth; attend to the matters which people usually resort to for pleasant scents, breezes, halls, etc., according to each individual's ability.
Then the patient should lie on a cushion higher than the bed they usually lie in, then extend their arm and hold it with both hands twice or thrice; tie the ligature firmly but not too tightly and remove it also twice or thrice.
Because if the grip is not moderate, either by excess of gripping to prevent blood flow or by it being too relaxed also prevents bleeding, then after gripping one should rub both hands together until they are exhausted from each other.
Until the abdomen is swollen and can be felt, then using a lancet wiped with aged oil, he should scrape the sore followed by placing his little finger from the left hand on the same vein underne cujus locus intends to stop it slightly so that no blood flows out when hit. Because from the vein where a tourniquet is applied and filled with air, it subsides when the lancet is placed on it underneath; deceiving the sore and the tourniquet does not open the vein, but if opened, only to a small extent.
Therefore, it is proper that the sore should be secure and well-practiced in all matters; then if the vein opens within those times, otherwise return underneath slightly or above hastily in case the spot does not inflame.
The swelling of the disease or tumor has receded in a day or two, and if the bandage is not tightened, it may bring about an acute inflammamo nt and does not enter the bath; then it returns home by itself, as some prefer, with the device being small, and the bleeding was thin.
I fear that not removing the blood you wish may cause it to be reinserted in its hole, and insert slightly more during the opening and do so hastily before the position swells in many people at a small incision.
I saw that it may swell without treatment, not assigning you anything to apply on it; use a bit of oil as it eases bleeding and is better in this case than just the oil itself or any other ointments.
Work with an ointment on all parts of your swelling for bleeding at the heart; it can do this as well as Farrouq and Shakhzania if placed in a location, then the blood thins out and resolves if applied from one of them.
If a large tumor occurs frequently at the site of swelling, especially for those who have not been bandaged except once or where the incision was small; apply pressed cloth soaked in warm salt water and tighten it for an hour, which will heal.
It is necessary to do this after the blood has completely drained from a vein or another, and if there remains in place for several days blackness or greenish discolorcuation, then it will not be cured, but one should apply some vinegar soaked bandages and poultices.
Or something from a bottle of podina, and often the pustules and boils occur when the balsamic fluid is squeezed out by your hand; if found it spreads when you touch it on, then that's an infection, beware to make anything on it what we mentioned.
It may bleed from a small vein but it should be compressed with something to solidify the spot, then treat it completely until healed; everyone should let blood according to their strength and what appears in color most of the time on the blood.
If the blood is black, it should be drained until it turns red; and if you see it as thick, let it out until it becomes clear; similarly for a severe case, until its edge recedes; one who has strong bladder and needs to drain blood should do so in one go.
It is necessary to expand the incision for bleeding and the instrument should be wide against this, and it should be extracted repeatedly and the hole should be narrow; the best practice when dealing with bloodletting is that it should be angled, curved, and have a smooth gap without splinters.
This form of bloodletting is successful from the vein and nerve cut by Ahmed and Aslam, it should be expanded in width and length; when dealing with occluded bloodletting, one should feed him something like soaked bread in sweetened pomegjarde water or cinnamon before bleeding.
If Moharrer and Ahmed's bleeding occurred three times or four, if he was feeling agitated, it is recommended to take soaked bread in myrtle wine or honeyed syrup before bloodletting.
If occlusion occurred during bloodletteing and was due to excessive bleeding, it is advised that he drinks beef broth and delicate myrtle wine rinse and use emollients extensively, pluck his chest with herbs we mentioned for division in the area of the incision.
He who needs to relieve his bowels, and if he wishes to soothe his arm and relax his blood quickly after having emptied it abundantly with weak strength, then let the blood flow a little bit gradually over the next days.
As for one who wishes to soothe his arm and relax his blood quickly, if he has a strong body, then do it within seven or nine hours after the initial evacuation; as for someone wishadin to draw the blood towards the area where it was initially collected, they should rest on the second or third day.
And if he has a lot of blood that is hot, tightened, and causing fever, it should be expelled from him all at once in large amounts and expand the opening until the blister is exposed after being inspected for all conditions of evacuation. Place your hand on the pulse when blood is drained to prevent, at most, the blister from being exposed quickly if the evacuee and the caretaker become negligent, and it should not be done if you wish to soothe the arm and relax the blood again.
The pore was clogged, and it was difficult for the blood to flow out or be swallowed up; this caused a severe headache, but either leave it until it disperses by itself or push the blood clot with an instrument.
Or have him carry something with salt dissolved in water or a mixture of tartar and pyrolusite, swallow it slowly until the blood drains out; this may cause the sore to burst.
Do not touch it until the abscess has settled, but urgent bloodletting is needed and it must drain above that spot or into another vein in the other arm or groin.
As for the draining of a ligature on an arm, replace it with two stitches and hemostatic if none are present because they are intertwined, how to drain so that it enters his hand in hot water until the pallor turns red and blood appears clearly before clamping tightly above.
Then the vein drains slightly without showing or lengthening; keep it wide and ensure bloodletting is above the wrist joint, if the blood cannot flow out, return the hand to hot water basin so that the blood flows into the container.
Until you realize that during the summer days, one can do without immersing the hand in hot water and more so that bleeding into hot water during winter prevents all types of sores. This sweat cures every type of flux. Because it is not an eruptive sweat or tremor, but the selenum from the right hand cures jaundice and how to get rid of it so that the thumb becomes swollen by tying a rope around it or your hand after immersing in hot water until the sweat bubbles.
Because it is not an eruptive sweat or tremor, but the selenum from the right hand cures jaundice and how to get rid of it so that the thumb becomes swollen by tying a rope around it or your hand after immersing in hot water until the sweat bubbles. It becomes very clear then you alleviate it by a slight distorture and if it bursts completely it doesn't harm at all and preserves your hand without bandage as underneath the nail of the thumb is reddened and in place, so return your hand to hot water.
If you leave it to bleed into the nail, then if not in hot water clots form at the base of the nail and cease bleeding as soon as enough blood is expelled, apply oil and salt paste on it so that it quickly heals.
Similarly, for every small lesion, it is beneficial to remove the left hand as well for jaundice causes and do as you did with the second one, and cauterization of the sinews was effective for ailments below the body such as urological disorders.
Absorption of menstrual blood and diseases of the kidneys and ulcers of the shanks and legs, as well as their symptoms and how to cure a man so that he enters hot water and is carried by the physician until the veins are dilated then constricted over the limb's joint with clay and sweat at the ankle near the big toe.
From it, branches spread out on the man'cups dilate and diffuse further or at the ankle where they meet - this is better and more effective; if they are removed from the face of the man, he should protect the nerves beneath his skin on his face.
Make your drainage slightly curved as if you want it to be loose, then the probe will be easier; blood should flow through the man's limb in hot water and leave so that it drains completely before removing the drain - this is a mistake of draining the vein incorrectly at first.
Leave the drainage slightly above to ensure that it is safe and does not fear complications if you protect the nerve as we mentioned, and do the same with the ligature on the other man - as for the vein of a woman, place it as we stated at the back limb.
Removing a muscle for knee pain if it is due to hot blood and how to remove the swelling in the affected area so that it moves from below the calf to above the ankle with four fingers wrapped in fine cloth, as nothing else will be visible but this.
If the removal is on a condition you choose either distortion which is best or remove it with a pliers making a hole, if its position becomes healthy and most people hide it very well so that no one finds it.
There was no sudden sensation in removing some of its hairs which appear on the top of the foot towards the toe and heel while preserving the nerves and sending a certain amount of blood as desired.
Then remove the tension and place a cotton pad on the extraction site, as it quickly relieves pain.
Chapter six and nine.
In size and how to use it. (This would translate the section title of a practical manual in Albucasis' textbook, indicating instructions on selecting appropriate tools for surgical procedures or treatments.)
The comb may be of bone or wood or copper or glass, and the size is either adjustable with a locking mechanism for blood extraction and one without (for gentle procedures). (This section would outline different types of medical tools available in Albucasis' time, such as surgical probes/combs made from various materials, emphasizing their design features for specific uses.)
This is the size that should be on two faces.
Trigger points for the neck from both sides, trigger point at the lower jaw below the chin, two trigger points for the shoulders, trigger point on the flank near the hip, and two trigger points in the middle of the arms, trigger points for the legs, and trigger points on the ankles.
The size is only attracting blood from the diffuse pulsation in the muscle and for that purpose, it should not drop power but to empty the sac. And it should not be used with fire or non-fire when one of the diseases is swelling until the body empties all.
The need called for the size to be used at all times in the beginning of the month, in its middle and end, whenever necessary.
That is why some people, if they have an excess of blood and need to extract it in large quantities, find heaviness in the head, dizziness, and among them those who find swelling and redness on their face, forehead, neck, and shoulders, and among them those who find pimples on their face and cheeks, darkness, and narrowness in their eyes.
And among them are those who laugh often and find blood taste in their mouth, thickening of the tongue, bleeding gums, and others who sleep a lot and see blood and redness during their sleep, pimples, wounds, surgeries, or something similar; then we see something like that.
Particularly, if we are full in the middle of the month after two or three hours past noon, and the benefits of pressing (bruising) relieve heaviness on the head and water from the eyes.
However, this should be done after purging the body and this pressing can be a substitute for bloodletting; but it is warned that using it when one has cold brain or epilepsy will cause great harm.
Therefore, it is not proper for the elders to use them [these methods], and their heads are afflicted by cold diseebs, and they have forgotten about them.
Therefore, the barber should be commanded to lower his hand with a scoop slightly downwards in fear of causing nerve compression, and instead of using the gouger's tool or a hair scalp scraper.
Therefore, it is beneficial for pneumonia and shortness of breath, as well as respiratory failure, coughing, and swelling; the gouger's tool should be raised slightly because if lowered would lead to weakening of the heart and stomach.
And the gouger's tool is beneficial for sudden headache, bleeding, epilepsy, cramps, and toothache in the roots; it is an alternative to a hair scalp scraper, so that the barber should not be instructed to dig deep with the scoop lest he cuts off a blood vessel.
As for the tool underneath the drill is beneficial for dentures, pyorrhea and other mouth diseases; it serves as an alternative to a shaving knife that removes hair from the eyelids, while the double blade is used instead of the scalp scraper. Moreover, the two-handled tool is beneficial for palpitations caused by swelling and heat.
Regarding the size of Zindīn's abdomabodies, it is as effective as removing the three slender veins and the arteries and the cystic duct because they draw blood from all those thin veins that are in the flesh and draw those thin veins from a thicker vessel until reaching the strength of the three principal vessels.
It is necessary that the surgeon does not operate in this location because it is reddened from the flesh and underneath there are nerves and blood vessels, and as for the single swelling that bulges on the throat, it benefits from anal fissures and perineal ulcers.
The surgeon should be instructed that the swelling must be large and made of lead, as the location requires a strong force and perhaps the glass bulge has burst and involves heavy bandages, leading to significant deficits in both legs.
Because it draws blood from the entire body and benefits those with chronic conditions in the kidneys, testicles, and ureter, stimulates menstruation, and treats hemorrhages and hydroceles. The veins of the spine and renal arterveins are excluded except that it greatly exhausts the body and causes edema in many people; the benefits for swellings near the thighs are similar to those of thigh swelling.
How to place the syrinx and first place an empty one with a moderate suction, without stretching it out, quickly put in place and withdraw it quickly so that it accepts fluids into the upright position evenly and repeat this process until you see the site has turned red and opened up.
When the bleeding appeared, then tie and untie quickly again and look at the state of healing; if it was a person whose skin is swollete, they were advised to tie the sutures one by one without leaving any loose ends so that the site does not leak.
The barber is commanded to widen the stitch and deepen it slightly, adjusting the syrinx gently in its place, moving delicately; if there was thick blood, it should be tied twice - once for a gentle opening of pathways for the thick blood and fluids, and again for checking any excessive bleeding.
If the blood was very obstructive, to redo the stitch a third time until reaching perfection; in other words, if we want to extract a little bit of blood, then one knot is enough for removing lots of blood, and if we estimate that the blood is thick.
It was proper to tie a deep and moderate incision on the skin only, using either oil or water when placing the tourniquet, as desired by the patient; if their skin were thick, hardened, and congested with narrow vessels.
It was proper to apply a softening, twice-diluted oil at the sites of tourniqueters; if during summer, use olive oil or violet oil or sweet almond oil or apricot kernel oil.
And if during winter, use pine oil or jasmine oil or lavender oil or onion essence; in this case, the fat would be thick and cold, so apply mastic wax or balsam of Peru or candle wax or shellac.
The patient with wide pores and flattened muscles should refrain from oil, and they should wash their tourniqueters after the procedure with rose water or cold water or grape vinegpress juice or apricot kernel water or watermelon water among others; if his blood is highly humid.
Wash the bladder with vinegar or distilled water and rosewater, etc., and if it is very dirty wash the bladastery with aged wine or almond milk juice, boiled chickpeas or pomegranate rind and so on, and beware of the heat in the bathhouse and near the bath.
After leaving the bathhouse, one should rest for an hour or two and it is not advisable to sleep after washing, what should be done before and after taking a bath by those with inflammation and pain.
The person with inflammamoin and swelling should be firstly yellowish in color, with low blood pressure and fever; it is advisable to take purgatives like pomegranate rinds, aloe vera juice, flax seeds, cucumber and so on, and make his diet from fruits, lamb meat, boiled eggs etc.
He who is cold should drink mead, honeydew or barley flax seeds and consume medium-aged wine that is neither too old nor too new; he should have a little food and make his diet from fruits, quail, eggs etc., and it is advisable to have more drinks than food on the day of bathing and purgation.
It is proper to give some people, at times, a dose of the Farragic powder or opium or shilthah before an incision and after suturing to strengthen the main organs and promote blood flow; it should not be administereby inexperienced individuals.
Regarding the unconditional battle wounds placed on the liver, intestines, limbs, abdomen, genitals, kidney point, and Achilles tendon as these parts do not require conditions; they are intended only to draw blood from one body part to another.
We place the pessary on the limbs in a cold sweat if there is heat in the body part; when we use it to draw out from the part, we place the pessary on the abdomen and genitals as they cause contraction, heating, and pain for its dissolution.
If there is a plug or stone in fullness on the kidney, it may attract them to open the plug or remove the stone from its location; similarly, if placed on the liver and intestines during a fluctuating wind, they function likewise, and these pessaries can be used with an empty vessel only.
The cauldron was heated and filled with a layer of water, and this was so that it could be filled and made large with boiling water alone or with water in which some herbs had been cookein.
Then the pot is placed on a spot and is secured, repeated as necessary, which is an image of the cauldron used with fire.
Its mouth is depicted as two openings, its depth half a cubit, and in the middle slightly narrower with a small hole for inserting the spoon made of Chinese or yellow copper thickly plated.
A lid of leather is curved to protect the flesh from being damnified when placed on it, with a handle made of copper or iron where one places the firewood; this cauldader can be larger than what we described and smaller depending on the illnesses.
The cauldadr is used for the boys and eunuchs but not by men and animals; to place this cauldadr over a limb with fire, it involves holding a candle or small piece of wax from pitch on a bent handle placed in the middle of the stout armature.
To be lifted towards the bottom of the incision so that it does not burn the patient's body, then place on the bone and finger at the hole we mentioned until we grasp the punch and pulled out if necessary.
The bubble escaped from that hole and the punch was loosened, then a thread is applied to it and returned if necessary, but in the case where the punch used for the wound with water there is no plugged stick or hole.
But it is used to be filled with water and placed on the bone only, this is its image:.
And this punch is best when it is large enough to let a lot of water in,.
Chapter VII and XIX.
In the comment on the suture.
The ligature is only used in most cases for the bones where it is not possible to place a punch, such as smaller ones like skin and gums or similar, or because the bone is red from meat, like fingers and nose etc.
How to use it so that the ligature is in clear, pure water from diseases and let one day and night in the water until he drinks and nothing remains inside of him. Then the body is first emptied either by evacuation or by enemas, and then the diseased part is cleaned.
Until it turns red, then the position is applied if they have fallen, and if possible to stuff the site with cotton, it proves beneficial; otherwise, wash the site with water and a lot of warm water, crush, strain, and let stand. After the fall of the pustule, the bleeding continued for some time, resulting in profuse bleeding through a small cut in a cup of cold water.
It is placed over the area until the bleeding stops, and clotted blood is squeezed or bandaged with strips of linen until the bleeding ceases or a dressing is applied to the site using equal parts of powdered alum or lint.
It is left until the dressing adheres to the site, and if necessary, reapply the pledget so that no clot remains; otherwise, remove any unattached clots by wiping the area with a cloth moistened in blood.
Or a needle is inserted into the site until some blood discharge occurs, and it is placed if there is a sensation of blood attachment at the base; if one wishes for something to fall off from it, sprinkle sand or salt or powdered charcoaderiton on it so that it falls away.
Chapter eight.
In surgery.
Also about the surgical procedure that is required in the field of medicine, namely fracture and accidental bone separation.
Know, O my sons, that this chapter may be called frivolous by doctors and laymen alike who have not even skimmed through the book or read a single page of it.
Therefore, this art has become defunct in our country because no one cast a new mold into it. Nevertheless, it was used by those who read the ancient books and endeavored to understand them until they extracted that knowledge from it, then experience and practice over many years became necessary.
And from this, I have drawn for you in this chapter all my knowledge. And my experiences have come to you after I brought it closer, refined it from the masses of techniques, summarized it to an extreme degree, clarified it to the utmost extent, and represented for you many images in this chapter of tools that are used.
Hence is the increase in clarity, as done in preceding chapein pages, and there is no strength except through Almighty God.
Chapter n1.
In this part, we discuss the surgical treatment of broken and dislocated bones; it was necessary to present them, and before starting with mentioning the affected parts one by one, in this section, chapters were mentioned separately. You are first required to comprehend and stand upon the truth that you were eager to learn this noble profession from him.
I say, when someone suffers from a fracture or dislocation or luxation or fall should first speed to fix it or relieve the pain, etc. It did not prevent this from someone if a similar obstacle such as weak strength or something happened to him like a boy, an elderly person, extreme heat or extremely cold weather.
Then he restricts himself to cold broth, roasted meats and eggs and prohibits wine, fatty meats, overeating, and any food that causes blood congestion until the tumor shrinks or no abscessation is expected from it.
Then he should return to his first method of treatment that was successful for him, if bone fracture occurs during the fixation, it is advisuable for the patient to eat foods rich in heavy and solid nutrients like oats, rice, barley groats, beans, and ox feet. By using eggs, fatty fish, and thick syrup in this manner, the healing process will be faster and better; know that broken bones in elderly men may not reconnect or fuse as they should initially.
For their bone grafts and fibrous connections, it may initially connect and merge with the young man's thin bones, but in reality, a dense layer similar to coralline algae grows around the broken bone from all sides, holding and tightening until they are joined.
They become connected and strong, as they were originally, until nothing hinders their functions again.
Therefore, it is necessary to make the patient's diet nutritious, dense, and thick as we have said, knowing that different types of fractures may occur depending on which body part has been broken because a fracture in the leg differs from a skull fracture, and a rib fracture differs from a fracture in the chest.
Likewise, all body parts differ from each other, and we will mention each type of fracture separately in their respective chapters, noting that the nature of bone fractures may also vary within themselves.
Because it might be a fragment of bone that does not cause any splintering, or it may be a fracture along the length of the bone with fragments and shards being detached or non-detached, and the break itself has a wound and a laceration in the skin, and the break is a running fissure.
For each type of fracture characteristic mentioned in the text, a detailed description will be provided regarding its appearance at that location, and it is identified by the bone's deformity, contortion, sensation, and creaking sound when you touch it with your finger.
If there is no deformity, creaking, or sensation when you touch the bone at this location, and if the condition does not cause severe pain or a palpable swelling, it may be a wedge fracture, greenstick faturah, or a running fissure that should not be moved or pressed.
If the bone has fractured in two places without any splintering, it is possible that each part of the bone has completely separated from its counterpart. Treat with the medicines mentioned after reaching an agreement on this position and then apply a gentle pressure bandage.
It was proper for you to notice from your side and set it right before a sore becomes inflamed, because if the sore becomes inflamed, it will settle in you for several days until the hot sore is occupied and it should be removed by any means considered effective.
Be aware that the bone fracture and its setting is easier than a broken bone with splinters, then strengthen what will come to mention it, as the bone was in splinters of which there is no mercy from extending the severed limb on either hand or foot.
Whether with your hand or with two ropes, or with a rope and the arm, place the bone on its natural position until the broken bone extends; then remove those splinters in their places by any means considered effective.
Make sure your effort does not cause pain or a sore to you and your inflammation is not occupied by one of the bones with its companion in the best form, it should be at that time touched and felt them with your hand as you see there something abnormal and corrects and fixes it according to your ability.
Be wary of severe stretching and exertion, as many unskilled individuals often do; they also cause friction or a hot compress on the limb, as you may have seen them do so with urine.
Then, after the cleansing and calming and stretching of that limb, he urged stillness and rest, cautioned against moving it when awake or asleep, during transitions, agitation, sneezing, and all extreme movements to allow the affected area to be swollen with safety.
That when he feels the limb affected by pain or injury, it does not transfer that to another part without feeling the pain and swelling along with it; thus his body is in a straight line.
So that if there is a dislocation in the limb, as I have described to you how to straighten a broken limb, know that fractured body parts vary depending on their size, such as smaller ones like arms and fingers and knees and so forth.
The flaps should have a wide and deep surface, such as in the thighs, backs, and chests, so that the edges are firm to ensure that the loose tissue is large enough for the body part requiring stitches and evenly pulled from all sides without error.
Then proceed by applying the agreed-upeborder of your wound with paint. In a gentle tension at the site of the cut, then begin by wrapping the bandage around the wound itself three or four times depending on the size of the limb and slightly tighten your hand with the bandage, proceeding to the upper part near the location of the incision.
Then loosen slightly more than your tension at the site of the cut, then move away from wrapping around the location of the incision a little and relax your hand gently until you take something right next to it as well, and also another bundle is taken elsewhere on the site of the cut.
Then wrap to the lower side of the cut and your act is in wrapping and relaxing as we mentioned in the first upper wrap, then place between the folds of the gentle tension or tear enough according to how much the incision protrudes.
If there is protrusion, or else do not make anything on it, then take another bundle and wrap over these tight folds for a quarter of an hour if the limb is not swelling or reddening.
Indeed, it contained either a hot or a warmed pus that would inhabit the tumor and go in with inflation; then he left it for days before gently squeezing out its contents when they became ripe. The scrapes were to be made of equal parts from the trunk of the freshly cut tree, skilfully prepared.
Those made from pine or palm fronds, mimicking whatever was depicted by them, with each tube having the same size and shape as shown in this image.
However, the tubes to be placed on the cut should be a bit thicker and slightly longer than the rest of the tubes; as for their length, they are made according to the size of the body part that is broken from largest to smallest, as depicted by the tube's image:.
Then he gently squeezed the tubes again with a cord of a similar thickness to the first, and then tied them up from above using tight threads as we mentioned for the tying and ensnaring to be placed on top of the fracture site. And whenever he spoke about a fracture, it would have less tension.
The cords should be of medium thickness and smooth, made from soft linen because if the ropes are as rough as those seen to have been done by a novice (as shown), it is an enormous mistake; they would end up like tightly wound linen sheets.
Because it is too strong outside of balance and the fine threads also do not heal because you do not achieve what you desire with this strength, and it should not be between the ligaments less than a finger's width.
If the injury is affected by ligament edges after applying this tension correctly, make a thin bandage or fluffed wool to prevent further harm from it, and if there is a fracture with skin tear due to abrasion, we will refer to it in isolation.
And know that not every broken bone should be tensioned with the ligaments from the first day and that if it is large, it is not to place the ligatures on it except after five days or seven days or more depending on your assessment of the occurrence of inflammation.
This is the general concise bandage that forces the fracture and heals more fluids, especially in children and women because it cannot be overcome by heat or cold.
"It is to take dust from the mortar, which is a fine substance attached to its sides during grinding movements; then it should be wiped with egg white so that it becomes neither lumpy nor powdery.
"A different dressing that causes the patient to bleed, exude pus, and suppuration is made from fat, linen, alum, rhubarb, myrrh, saffron, ten grains of each one and five drops; twenty grains of frankincense and twenty grains of Armenian or Roman clay. "All the ingredients are ground together and mixed with frankincense water or egg white if the patient's condition is acute; then this dressing, which is very well suited for forcing fractures to heal quickly, benefits most people.
"Another dressing that is also beneficial for fractures and suppuration is made from myrrh, fat, white poppy shells in ten grains each with five drops, six grains of alum, twenty grains of Armenian clay; ground finely, strained, kneaded with water or egg white.
Title: Bandage for Joints and Missing Bones, Located at Their Positions, Alleviates Pain and Swelling of the Affected Area and Fractures; Absorbent Cotton is Soaked in Salt Water and Heated Oil Applied on the Spot. This Bandage Does Not Have Binding Strength.

Moisten all and knead with soot water, soft alkaline solution or paint it; depending on the temperature of the bone and its vitality, but as for Ibqrat, Albucasis does not mention in his book to apply it to a fractured bone during an injury.
Otherwise, the Ibqrat prepared from wax and oil is not described as being between grease and softness, but Galenus puts it on a broken bone during an injury with substances that have heat like mercury, patience, and milk.
A plaster that benefits for lightness and pain, takes flour, mustard, human hair or bird feathers, and nostrils as powdered; mix, knead and apply with it, but the amount to be left on the bandage is specified.
Then he considers that if there is no swelling, pain, or movement of the broken bone from its place, it will not dissolve for many days unless a sharp lock or severe pain occurs in its position.
Immediately after the plaster is removed, do not delay this event and wash it off with him; then take a soft cloth or sponge dampened in soapy water to cleanse the site until the swelling subsides and the pain eases, leaving the bone to rest for an hour.
Then, the abscessed area is wrapped with a moistened wool and anointed with oil or rose balm, tied to it overnight to secure the warm boil and allow the sore spot to cool down and heal; then return to the gentle bandage and compress, without tightening.
Then, wait until healed; I observed that the swelling, redness, sore spot, and boil along with all symptoms had gone away, prompting a return to bandaging and tightening just as initially done, without any new occurrences in the limb.
He should not be removed except after three, four, five, or seven days as it appears from the condition of the limb, with each case lasting twenty days at most until we deem that cutting and tying off are necessary.
He also increased the tightening more than initially and added to enhancing the patient's diet as suggested; upon observation, it appears that the incision site has healed further, indicating that the food intake should be restricted from being consumed.
"Wrap the affected part with moist cloths every time it is changed, do this for three days and slightly loosen the bandage, as by doing so the injured member will receive nourishment and heal quickly; what foolish unlicensed practitioner performs reattachment of severed members.
"If they did not do what was proper and committed a mistake by causing deformity, then it is a great fault on their part; even if the ancient authors had written about it in their books and practiced it that way, or something you saw someone do. "And the correct opinion is that it does not work,
Chapter Two.
In the case of a scalp laceration.
There are many types of scalp lacerations with various shapes and multiple causes, either from a sword strike where the skull is completely fractured to end in sub-cranial bone beneath the skull. Just as one does with walking on wood. (The context suggests a comparison of procedures or techniques, possibly referring to how careful and precise actions must be taken when dealing with scalp lacerations, similar to the care needed in handling something delicate like walking on wooden floors.)
Therefore, this type of laceration is called "walking on wood" and may be either a sword cut that fractures part of the skull and exposes only the face without extending to another side or it can extend through completely; such cases are referred to as "complete hatchet," where these two types of injuries may be major (large) or minor (small).
The section is about a fracture that may be slight or complete and the cause being struck by a stone or falling onto it, or similar action. This fracture can either be through an opening where the bone covering has been breached, or directly in the skull itself.
These two types of fractures can also be either large or small, and the fracture may be concealed within the bone near a hairline crack that is spreading.
Therefore, this type of fastock is called hairline, and it can be a fall or stone strike-related fracture that enters the skull layer into its interior and stops at a location similar to how copper would display if struck by an intrusion from outside.
This is more common in the skull of a young child, and all these types of fractures can have clean or dirty edges; their treatment is always addressed at the location itself, and they are collectively referred to as exposed fractures.
Inspection involves using x-rays and removing any infected flesh from it, while the hairline type is identified as spreading on the skull, scraping over it and staining with wax where the fracture appears black; initially assessing treatment of a fracture involves looking at symptoms of illness.
I saw that the symptoms indicated a sign of fear, similar to fainting and expansion and flight of the mind and loss of voice and numbness and severe dizziness and bulging eyes and their reddening and such signs do not approach cure nor can they be treated; death will occur in most cases with these symptanno
If I saw symptoms that do not threaten and reassured him about his safety, then take care in treating it; that is if you find the injured person was wounded on the first day when it happened during the winter.
It was necessary to remove the bone before day fourteen in all cases, and if it occurred during summer months it was necessary to hasten bone removal before day seventeen to prevent tissue damage underneastern من العظم يؤدي إلى تلك الأعراض التي وصفنا.
The bone fracture may have reached the covering of the brain and accompanied by swelling; it was necessary to cut off the affected part that is healing as I described, which means allowing the wound on the head injury to heal.
It reveals the bone on any face you can manage, depending on the shape of the wound and what lies hidden in the affliction; when exposed, at most it will bleed or cause a burning swelling suitable for that purpose.
It is so that the location should be covered with a compress soaked in ointment and red wine vinegar until the swelling takes hold and secures the bleeding, then extracting from the bone hole and extricating it; this can be done on either of two faces.
As for one face, it is to cut the bcu with a thin narrow incision as follows:
Then you use another incision after this one to slightly expose it as shown here:
Then another incision will also expose it, and you must have several different incisions, some of which are exposed from each other and others shorter than the rest, with their edges being very sharp or made of quality steel.
The assistant should use the handle to apply pressure on the incision so as not to destabilize the head and make it hurt, since a strong solid bone required drilling around it before using screws that were well-fitted rather than loose ones.
Because it does not exceed the edge of the hump to what is behind it in order for the nail to have a rounded head on one without a sharp tip, resembling an incomplete rope or small circle to prevent it from sinking and exceeding the bone cavity.
It is necessary to take several of these nails so that each one fits the bone cavity until you have enough for each sharp end in length and shortness as per the bone cavity, and this is an image of three types. From large to medium to small nails.:
The method of nailing around a fractured bone is to make the nail on the bbeanly and turn it with your fingers until you know that the bone has moved, then transfer the nail to another position and space between each hole as thick as glue or close to it.
Then you cut between each two holes and do that as much as possible with the aid of something we mentioned until you extract the bone either by hand or another tool from among those made for it.
"As with fine linens and delicate threads, it is necessary for all to be cautious that the peg or cut piece touches none of the sinew, if the bone breaks and separates from the sinew when attached and removed.
"The bone fragment remaining is similar to another piece but should be finer and softer than the others, if a small piece of bone and fragments remain at your place, take them gently.
"Then the wound is treated with bandages and dressings as mentioned, while another aspect of the work is an easy application far from the grating, which Galen praised greatly. "You should first begin by exposing the bone fragment from where the fracture occurred, until you expose that piece and its side plate beneath it appears like this:" (Since no image is provided here for translation.)
"The side plate part of it is smooth and does not have a crack, while the sharp part in its length appears as you see to be attached to the sinew; then strike on the piece from one side." (Note: This seems like an instruction for handling or examining bone fragments during surgery.)
With a small mallet until all the bones are cut, as if they were turning, and you in safety from the envelope where no accident occurs that is feared by even an oxen; and whether the operator is unknown to people or performs their wish, or if it is stifled.
It remained something that must be removed from the bones in certain positions of the bones, cut it off by the edge of the same lens and get rid of it gently because it discharges itself harmlessly and fearlessly.
And if the bone was not cut to the envelope and the part of the bone broke off and remained in it with sharpness and fibers on the edge, you should remove that sharpness and pull out those edges with forceps of different sizes so that you can use them in every position as needed.
And the same broken bone and its form, you should first use those forceps to expose the bone and then use finer ones so that it still continues with that treatment until using the finest of them all.
Concerning the smaller scalpels and delicate incisions, each should be treated according to what leads to their effectiveness, which is something not hidden from those skilled in this craft as we have written and stated regarding major cuts.
When the membrane is exposed after removing a bone fragment, it was appropriate to take two incisions as much as the wound and immerse them in rose oil and place them on the lip of the injury then take another incision that is double or triangular. Immerse it in wine and rose oil and place it on the first incision, making that as thin as possible without weakening the flap then use a flat braid from above to gently secure only as much as the wound requires.
By this treatment for a day or two until the inflamed tumor heals, then use it and after that apply medicines such as dried sage leaves, caraway seeds, candlewax powder, cardamom, and their kind, which are made from these substeans.
The excerpt has been translated as follows: "It was rubbed on the wound as it were dust, and in short - a remedy that cleanses without causing sting or discharge; when applied to treat an injury, it ensures cleanliness free of grease, offense, or any accumulation.
"If the pus accumulatur on the cranial membrane, it causes decay and infection; from this arises a severe malady at the skull. It may manifest as fissures in the scalp when bones are exposed, especially if neglected treatment.
"The pallor on its surface presents signs of the illnesses we have mentioned, indicating it is incurable; but if the paleness occurred due to a remedy applied and was caused by the potency of that medicine.
"It should be taken a portion of honey and three portions of rose oil, mixed thoroughly until emulsified; apply it to the scalp then treat with appropriate methods until cured.
The translation for this section title is: "The Third Section.
This phrase can be translated as: "The nose should be fixed if it's broken." However, please note that this doesn't seem to fit well within the context of a medical textbook excerpt and might not represent an actual Arabic text on surgery by Albucasis or similar. Please ensure you have provided the correct source material for accurate translation.
Know that it cannot be broken from the nose except by a hook inserted entirely or one of them for being bones because below it there is cartilage which does not break and only shows redness, swelling, and puncture.
It breaks when one of them is inserted into the nose puncture and smoothed out that fracture from inside your little finger's thumb to the outside until the nose returns to its natural shape, do so gently without causing further damage to the illness or pain.
The fracture was in the upper part of the nose, and it did not extend to the finger; adjusting on the edge should be done gently with a slight pressure, as with that kind of fracture, it should be set immediately upon the first day of the breakage.
It may be possible, but only after the seventh or tenth day in case of an inflamed tumor; if the fracture is in one place insert a needle puncture into the nose hole, and if it's in both places, insert two punctures.
The tube should be as thick as needed to fill the hole in the nose; some of the early practitioners recommend oiling the tube and replacing it every day, but I have not seen this done - rather, it should be coated with honey mixed with hen's dung.
Then the splinter remains until the bone is confirmed and the sinew is set, and a tube from the plucked goose feather is inserted into its place after being weakened by a soft cut to trap it in order to break the nose more severanciously and prevent further breathing.
It is not necessary if you have made it or if you have created the ointment, but during your work expose the nose and seal it with the oxytone, a pungent herb infusion, or in an oil soaked quince inside a jar or some other ingredient from the diaphoretics.
If the pungent ointment was not externally applied, it should be rubbed with wheat flour and finely ground turmeric mixed with egg white then a weak bandage is placed on it without tying the nose causing bone fractures to break into small pieces.
Or it dissolved and was extracted with the device that heals her then the defect is sutured and treated as per the dressings agreed upon for such cases, resulting in an internal nose injury requiring treatment with a splinter and using metal tubes. Until he recovers.
Chapter Four.
It is necessary to break the subcutaneous swelling below it.
If the swelling below is broken and it does not heal with a clean incision, then this indicates that the break occurred only superfaturally without fracturing into two pieces and deepening internally; thereby facilitating identification of its nature.
It is preferred that if the break lies in the right cavity, then the little finger of the left hand should be inserted into the mouth of the affected and similarly for a fracture on the left side, the small finger from the right hand can raise the edge of the fractured fragment internally to externally.
The other hand from outside the bone controls its reduction, if a fracture of the joint has split into two then both hands should be used to bring it to stability until it can be reduced; which may have occurred on the teeth.
Or the thread may have pulled too tightly and left a thin gold, silver or brass wire; which is then placed on the fractured cheekbone (zygomatic), followed by a double-layered gauze and a large well-fitting plaster cast or an equal length of leather skin. Then you connect it from above as you see fit to bind and secure until it does not move, and the ailment is commanded to abstain and rest, making its nourishment lean porridge; I thought that something about his appearance may have changed in terms of facial features by Friday.
Then you connect it from above as you see fit to bind and secure until it does not move, and the ailment is commanded to abstain and rest, making its nourishment lean porridge; I thought that something about his appearance may have changed in terms of facial features by Friday. Then you treat what is bandaged with chicken fat or whipped egg white after removing the gauze from it, and place a thin cotton cloth on the dressing; that remained applied to him did not change in terms of swelling.
Do not remove until it is fully healed and this wound greatly intensifies over three weeks, its appearance during that time will be a hot boil but using the method we mentioned for soothing it will make it go away.
And if the wound has a cut or splinters that have protruded, you may decide to remove those fragments with an instrument, and then expand the mouth of the wn by opening it as much as needed for your utensil.
Then if you have removed those splinters and there is no wound left, if its mouth was wide then use any bandage to treat it accordingly. "Wash the wound thoroughly until it clears.
Chapter Five.
Forceful reduction if fractured.
If reduction is required for a fracture, it should be done from the side towards the end of the trochanter and broken in such a way that two or three fragments occur without causing any splintering; this method is easier to manage.
Whether the fracture results in splintering or not, if it is easier to manage a non-compound fracture, two supports should be arranged: one to stabilize the displaced reduction and another to extend towards the opposite side.
Then, smooth the fracture with your fingers until it takes on the proper form without depressions or rough edges; if needed, use more padding underneatury bandages made of linen or cotton cloth.
Raise and elongate the reduction as much as necessary, press down on the bone fragment with your hand until the fracture is properly aligned; if it cannot be pulled back to its original position, pull one end of the fracture outwards so that it can lie flat.
He placed a mid-finger cotton pad under the bone and held it, pressing down on its end until the fractured piece of bone protrudeby reached above. Then he fixed and sewed up the wound with your fingers.
I felt that a piece of the mandible had broken and started to move. It was necessary to make a cut there, so the fragment could be removed gently. However, since the piece was embedded in the bone, it was opened along one section until several pieces resulted from this. After the jaw apparatus that retains the maxilla was created, and it was a device made of wood or iron, this is how she appeared:.
It resembles a spoon without an edge, and its shape should be determined by the size of the jaw bone; larger or smaller accordingly. As for the length, it is based on what you can handle well, and it has two ends as seen in one end wider and the other narrower.
The cut made when removing the bone shard was wide and a red swelling formed; thus I stitched up your wound with sutures, whether the tear went deep or you feared the hot abscess spreading on the wound through the tear. And I closed it to the extent of the cut in the wound.
In the event of a superficial burst abdome, apply crushed locust ashes mixed with egg whites on the skin. If it is not a wound and there are no perforations, let it carry an implant made from locust ash powder combined with egg white. Place the bandage on it, then put a ball under its belly if needed, then take an extremely long turban, and let its length be to the knee or so, and carry two pads with you on the fracture and implant. Then take cotton wool from silk fabric. It has three fingers long and of such length, then insert it into a perforation, then place that perforaturte with the bandage in position where the turban is on the fracture as if it were revolving around the fracture location. Then tighten the turban onto the fracture like a circle. The bandage should be wrapped around its neck and the correct belt and underne. Repeat this on all sides, as you see that the tightening fixes the fracture firmly without being hidden from sight.
You are assured that the bandage does not slip off of the fractured bone. Therefore, it is necessary to examine the wound daily after the sutures have relaxed and if the bones are healed, tighten the ligature again, place a small pillow undernecu during sleep at night.
As the limb lengthens along with its fracture healing atop the hump, do not loosen the ligature unless there is an accidental or inflammatory event towards two dozen days.
Then renew the ligature if you see any swelling as a result of that. And check the tightness and leave it until the fracture consolidates, and becomes stronger within eighty days. And it may be in some people less than that.
Chapter Six.
In fracturing the elbow, say that it does not break from an outer position but only its parts, and if broken from there to the middle or if it is known by touching on top of form depends.
Set it, and check on its natural shape in any way possible, then put it on a position of fine dust with egg whites and soft manipulation, place over a splint made from cloth strips, and an open elbow sling.
Gently press on the whole limb or slightly beyond, causing a sensation under the joint at various positions of the limb until the tendern지 is reached. Then gently pull upwards with a long strip.
Firmly wrap and secure from the joint until its position is not lost, examine the sling daily whenever it relaxes; rewrap and adjust the joint if it moves out of place, and ensure proper tension on the affected limb. The shoulder should be immobilized for twenty days.
If after fifteen to twenty days, the sling is fully healed and you are sure of it not being loose or contracting, if a bone protrusion appears that has no tendernisscars under the skin, gently push aside the tissue and remove it. And perform what has been mentioned in the section on reducing a boil from heated tumors, if something of that sort occurs.
The Seventh Section.
In case of cutting through the chest.
The chest may split in the middle and slightly reveal itself, while its edges tend to tear more easily; symptoms if it splits through the center include a tendency for the exposed area to sink downward with severe pain at the site of exposure and breathing difficulty.
Sometimes the blood becomes visible through a fractured bone, which is not imperceptible to touch, so he should lift the injury on his back and place it between his shoulders with cushions, then wrap its corners with bandages from both sides and bind the limbs together by hand for as much as possible.
He agreed to let the shape of the beak return as it should, then he carried the plaster and splint on him and placed a piece of fine linen or canvas over it gently after breaking it. Then he tied it tightly on the broken bangle so that it would not slip, and passed the bandage around to his back several times and pulled it firmly, then checked the bandage at each time, and said "rest" as you pull it tighter.
And if the need called for its removal at a time or pain or swelling arose, he would solve it and remove the bandage and correct what was shown from that due to his treatment, then reapply the bandabandage if necessary. And he applied pressure until it healed.
The Eighth Chapter.
In fractures of the limbs, if broken, it is known that the break only occurs in places where there are weak points or at the joints and edges; but they show healing tendencies because they are fatty and this knowledge does not elude touch upon inspection with fingers.
It is necessary to make the fracture fit with fingers until it reaches its proper shape, then bind and splint the broken bone if needed; a limb break tends inwardly and shows symptoms of severe pain.
And the first type that exhibits signs to those concerned is due to bone thinning and showing symptoms of difficulty breathing, sneezing, frequent bleeding, which makes treatment difficult; the extremities have significantly changed in this case.
Some have said that the patient's food should generate air and promote a full belly and expansion to push the fracture outward, which we consider unnecessary for tumor formation unless it did not occur then it could happen increasing and confirming its presence.
He said, "Place on the position and press it firmly; then measure but be cautious that the swelling does not pull towards the place of weakness." Another said, "It should be covered with a cloth soaked in hot oil.
"When a fistula forms between the shins, make sure to wrap it evenly if bent inward; then treat the illness with dietary treatment and medication. The sick person should not be allowed to bend their legs. "The bone was thinning the membrane severely and we were afraid for the illness; it should be probed at the location, exposing the fractured limb, then repair the device that retains suppuration, as described, and cut off the bone gently.
"Then we gathered the bandage from a large wound by stitching and treated it with compresses until healed; during this, apply hot rubs containing frankincense oil to the area and treat the illness to reduce inflammation internally.
"Cover the side where sleep overcomes him until healed.
Chapter nine.
Section on piercing the forehead and neck.
Regarding the neck vertebrae, if they are fractured and present with pain or more symptoms than relief when touched, as well as spinal column segments if such signs are shown to someone who may wonder whether it heals or not. I observed that his hands appeared to have become relaxed and numb, leading to death and inability to move or bend them, with no ability to grasp anything. If they were pricked or pinched with a needle and he did not feel it, nor found any pain within him, then knowing there is no sign of recovery at all.
And if he is able to move and feel when pricked or pinched, one knows that the bone marrow has been cured and the disease recovered through treatment; it happened with forehead piercing likewise, in order to learn whether it also recovers or not.
I observed that both of his legs had relaxed, and an event occurred as in the hands, then if he laid on his back, air and sputum would come out unintentionally, or if something fell onto his abdancr, urine would exit involuntarily. If it falls on his back and he wants to purge but cannot do so, know that it is untreatable as nothing will help him; however, if something from this occurs, the condition becomes less severe and treating what arises can lead to the contraction of the hot tumor.
Place red ointment on the inflamed joint alone or with scrambled egg whites, apply it three times during the day until the hot tumor settles in place; then take a strong and dried compress from the location and tie it around him, instructing rest and immobility.
He should not sleep unless pain-free; if cracking occurred in the bone upon healing, it might be a fracture that needs to have his skin incised and the bone fragment removed. Then gather the surgical thread if large, then treat with ligatures until healed; if another bone fractures at the elbow and is a humerus deficiency, it should be accessed through the thumb of the left hand in the joint.
Set the broken bone with the other hand as much as possible and come to an agreement on the settlement; then place a compress and splint if needed, and bind it tightly.
Indeed, I felt a small fragment stuck in it; he extracted it and took hold of it, treating the wound with a treatment that is offered until it is completely healed.
Chapter Ten.
Involving fracture of the forearm.
Regarding fractures of the forearm, if it's completely broken, then the break is such that the fragments have separated at the ends and lengthened along its axis and are tending inward; displaying pain and swelling at the site, with numbness radiating to the affected limb.
He instructed you to place your hand over the fracture until it is positioned as such; if the break was only in its ends, then smooth that part of the fracturation according to what seems best for reconciliation until it resembles its natural form.
If the break is along its length or has pierced inward, causing an ulcer on its surface; to mend that fracture, wrap it with a bandage and then apply a splint made of wood or leather and secure it tightly.
Do not fear the fracture's migration or disappearance of the splint, and allow for coring out through pimples to be filled until it is healed enough to take weight on its back or next to it accurpressing with a warm poultice.
Loosen and extend the incision until the heated tumor settles in it; then return to the incision and close it properly, as should be done. If the bone is seen with splinters or fragments detached from its ends, this is not supposed to be removed.
It does not touch but is healed as we said, and it should be closed until recovered.
The eleventh chapter of surgery.
In the fracture incision.
The bone is between two adjacent heads, in which case the incision fracture occurs on one side and both sides take a curved, smoothed median of this image:.
And it is tied at both ends with two ties, then suspended from a high place and the patient sits on a chair, receives their broken arm on the bone until they are fully immobilized in the middle of the bend, then hangs something heavy above it.
Or the attendant extends it to below, and then the surgeon joins the fracture with both hands until the break is joined properly; the other way for the patient to lie on their back and hang a hand from their neck by ropes.
Then command the two servants to adjust one above and the other below, extending each of them towards their direction, and if you want it stronger, hold undernenvelope with laces and above with laces, extend both of them towards their respective directions by the two servants.
It was close to the bottom edge so that [the middle lace] would be undernehem and the other one would be closer to the spine, likewise if it were close to the spine let the laces be on the same position as well as on the spine itself.
Then the page was gently pressed until it reached where it should be, and a good binding was made then let it dry; if there was no red wax exposed, apply a layer of scented olive oil-infused wax on the seventh day.
Until the wax hardened then let it dry, put a dressing on the page and wrap with fresh gauze over the bandage, then gather your arm around itself and place your open hand on the forearm.
The rupture and tension on the bone and arm should be treated in order to perform amputation at the elbow if prevention or change of a broken bone does not occur; however, it is possible that from such an injury, one may proceed with amputation.
It is to place a plate that is more prominent and stronger than the other plates, creating a span equal to the width of the hand between each plate; the length of the plates should be determined according to the fracture with an increase by three fingers from each side.
Then, tighten the plates as previously mentioned in section one.
And that your grip on the fracture location is tighter.
And after the fracture, if your grip is lessened, I saw placing and tightening of plates as we mentioned in your previous consultation for one hour.
And if you fear a malignant tumor, then loosen the grip and plates as we said on the seventh day; check all attachments in three days so that no abnormality occurs or swelling or food intake does not reach the limb to correct everything completely as mentioned.
Indeed, you can be sure that nothing of the sort will heal unless after many days; the swelling of the disease will be on its head and hand on its organ and placed under the ligature filled with evenly molded wool.
And in any time of night or day, whenever the broken bone begins to loosen or untie the ligature, you should fix it all with effort; make the food for the disease be on the level that we presented so that the food is initially mild until their bones become severe.
It should be that the food is increased, as usual for ligaments and shanks, it will become severe in forty days; then it should heal and work with padded shoe and treat with the bandages that make them recover like this: a severe fracture was corrected.
It should not loosen for fifty days or two months from it.
Chapter Twelve.
In the case of arm bone fracture.
The arm is fractured into two bones and they are called the zanjīn, one of which is small and it's below that holds the thumb; the other is large and underneebelow the smaller from below. If only the larger one or only the smaller one breaks, or if both break together,.
When the small upper phalange fractures, its splinting is easy and blood flow quickens; when the lower phalange breaks, the breakage is poor and blood flow difficult, and it hardens if both bones fracture together, so the bone that broke in the smaller upper phalange.
The surgeon should when fracturing it make the length pass slowly until healed, if the large phalange is broken then it should be made to have a shorter duration and if both phalanges are broken they should be given an even stronger duration.
It should be placed in shape after fracturing and extended on a bed, the thumb of the hand to rise above all other fingers, with the digit below being lower than the rest of the digits and the injured one squarely elevated upon itself.
And the bed should be such that without it being raised there would not be strain on the injury.
Then the arm support is extended from below either by his hand or a splint and another support extends from above that one then the surgeon aligns the bone until it heals in the best possible shape, as being fractured into fragments.
In response to every scratch in its place, a bloodless scar appeared and the skin was loosened without any ambition, so he pulled it out on the same side that we mentioned earlier, and the fracture was with a wound that split open.
The treatment for this was taken from there, and the first fracture presented with a raw sore that healed through an ointment made of rose oil and white beeswax, with a medium consisting of butter and cream to soothe the wound gently until it settled in.
He removed the ointein and applied a freshly prepared compress made of camel's dung powder mixed with egg white, then carried out the sutures so that the stitching placed on the fracture appeared slightly more raised and stronger, knowing that in most cases there would be six sutures on the arm.
The fracture was in one or both forearms, then make your hold at the location of the fracture stronger and tighter so that it increased slightly above or below as mentioned earlier, causing a slight protrusion on what is presented at the beginning of this section.
"So that the tear affecting the fracture becomes a softened, not overly hard tear; and that the string attached to it from a special medium between thinness and toughness as we have described, may repair the bone and ligaments after some days.
"Something has happened to the bone that requires treatment similar to a fissure exposed in the tissue; it is appropriate for the bone to be immersed in warm water until the fissure settles and the bacteria are no longer present, allowing the bone not to be tightened all night until it rests and then returns to normal.
"The tightness may have relaxed and the bone may be almost healed, as you see, but also notice that it is wise for food to be withheld so as not to exacerbate the contraction, it should rest a little and days until digestion begins then contract again.
"If nothing has been exposed to the patient as we mentioned, it should not be cured except after twenty days or so; then signal with your finger and arm, keep them steady, avoid erratic movements, and ensure sleep on your stomach.
Know that this section of the arm is cured in thirty days or in two and thirty, and perhaps [it] may be cured in eighty-twenty days each case depending on the nature of the suppurations and strength conditions.
Chapter Thirteen.
In fracture of hand and fingers.
The skin of the hand and nail health exhibit fracture or, more commonly, healing to a large extent; when does fracture or healing present in the palm?
The patient should sit in a reclined position with a chair in front of him on level ground.
Then he places his hand flat and extends the fractured bone, which is then wrapped by the physician until a good union occurs; if this does not happen, it should be bandaged and immobilized unless an ulcer occurs, in which case it should carry a splint from above as far as possible.
She has been included in a fine gauze; the fracture was downward toward the palm side, forming a nearly spherical shape with gauze and instructing the patient to grasp it with his broken hand before wrapping it tightly.
And let the flap be made of a skin that is more pliable to bend with all fingers extended, pulling it in such a way as is appropriate; thus, creating an incision from above and another flap below on the hand so that the hand remains open and flat.
Then he takes the suture as the hand turns, and ties it between the fingers with ligatures; presenting the incision to one of the finger pads is such that the thumb is not raised more than necessary then tightening with the flap until a small flat flap remains to close the incision.
And the incision of the remaining fingers is like the middle, ring, little or index finger not raised too high and attaches to the correct finger or ties all together on their sides it is better or places a small flat flete.
As we previously stated about the thumb, examine and inspect during incision and after through the inflamed area as needed until it repeats what was described.
Chapter Fourteen.
In surgery of a thigh incision.
The calf'cu[l]us is often torn apart, and it becomes clear to the touch because it pulsates towards the front and back; its ligature above the fissure and another beneath are applied as a treatment measure.
Then each ligature is extended to its side evenly if the fissure is in the center of the bone, and a more pliable cord should be used near the origin of the calf-muscle.
At the origin of the calf-muscle toward the ankle, the ligature is extended above and below the fissure; similarly, if the fracture is near the knee, the suture should be placed near the knee so that it extends downward, then the surgeon shapes the bone as much as possible with his hands.
If the bone is fused well, then a bandage and tightening are indicated if no inflammation has occurred in the tissue; however, if an abscess occurs, let it accumulate for several days until the hot abscess settles, then return to treating it.
The fracture should be wrapped tightly with a wide bandage two or three times, leaving some tension; then the leg is wrapped until the joint at the ankle ossifies and a long cord is inserted between the calf and the shin near the knee from below, with the ends of the cord rising on both sides.
Then you direct it to the shin and thigh, doing what is needed from the amputation. Then on the thigh at the same location as the incision, make two incisions and turn them into one cut on the leg bone. Then remove the discrepamo between the thigh and leg with a flexible tear.
Then begin the strengthening using three or four turns after tying from the location of the incision so that your suture is less tight and more flexible.
Then insert into the ends of the thread you entered between the thigh and leg, tie it with more stitches so that they are above then pass the end of the thread to the bottom until reaching the man's calf also fasten them with both sides of the stitches from the other side.
So that the stitch does not loosen at its place, then leave the suture on it until it stops talking to the tissue without tearing or wrinkling or puffing towards such things; something like that leads us to correct it and fix everything that has happened from this as we mentioned before.
In the bone, there was a thin spicule that should be leveled with it if possible and if not then lift it up and remove it and treat the wound as you bring forward such things until healed, this cut from the thigh may not spread to the leg without the stitches.
As we mentioned in the section on arms and hands, this kind of fracture does not present with a limp; but if it is repaired by itself without involving the leg, there will never be a need for the owner to limp.
Note that the swelling in the calf worsens in fifty days or increases slightly, or decreases slightly depending on the discharge and other conditions.
The fifteenth chapter.
In a fracture of the shinbone.
Indeed, a shinbone fracture presents less with the break and may present more frequently with healing; being either a crack or crumbling within it while also having an injury without bleeding.
It is also important to note that it should be allowed to heal such differences in its parts with fingers until they reunite and deform according to how the healing, companionship, and adherence are possible; then it carries a dressing and wears an enveloping bandage if needed for this.
And it is aggravated above the severity mentioned earlier, then all conditions that we described in the rest of the fracture are like a hot tumor and its approach with an intention to meet each appearance as possible for it to heal.
Chapter Sixteen: Removing Foreign Bodies from the Eye
In a knee joint fracture.
The leg has two bones, one of which is thick and called the thigh bcu and the other thin and named patella; they are subject to various types of fractures. Therefore, a fracture of the leg bone is similar to that of the arm and involves one operation; if both bones fracture, the whole leg turns in all directions, if the thinner bone breaks it points backwards while if the thicker breadths downwards. This fact should not be overlooked.
The treatment involves casting and setting the fractures accordingly, unless it is a severe crush fracture with many fragments in which case the cast should be lighter and less tight, requiring great effort to set the fracture.
In the leg, there are fewer complications compared to the arm. If you remove a fracture and complete your tasks, carry two sticks from the willow tree that can be used for making splints which are placed between the cuts or made of palm fronds like it is done with arms.
Choose one that is slightly thick and not too narrow, with a length equal to the length of the leg from knee to foot. Then wrap it around each individually with two strips along its length, placing one on the shin and the other on the opposite side.
It should be from the knee to the foot, then tie the two straps on three points (from both sides and in the middle) so that with this strap the leg is prevented from tilting right or left and stabilizes well; one may use a thong along the length of the shin.
It is placed in it to save from movement and more so as to perform that in the section if there is a specific injury; then examine the leg daily with full care regarding tumor, swelling, or other such things. It should be attended to when such a thing occurs, as is appropriate to heal; the shin bone is fractured for about thirty days or so.
Chapter Seventeen.
Fractures of the leg bones and fingers. (The actual textbook would contain detailed explannation on how to treat these fractures, which has been omitted per instruction.)
As for the ankle, it does not usually present with a sprain and as for leg bones they do indeed present with fractures; fingers also mostly present without a sprain but rather with pain in most cases. (The actual textbook would include information on how to treat these injuries based on their presentation which has been omitted per instruction.)
Then, the presentation of a man's shin is fractured, and I saw those bones such that one overlapped another. The patient placed his foot on the ground as if standing like cattle, then you place your foot on what rose from those bones, then press down and pull upward.
Until they are in their respective positions, then take the splint and padding from above place a small board with two flattened heads under the sole of the foot, then grip it firmly after bending to break apart any fractures and securing what is needed below.
If three days or four have passed, and you release the splint, then you find the bones at the same level as they were broken or dislocated - do the work as you see it, but if some fingers are still bent, straighten them according to what I instructed in the treatise on finger joints.
Then, make the broken finger straight along its length so that a bit of it protrudes from underneath, then prepare as I instructed on the board and grip it firmly; if two or three bones have fractured.
"Make sure each finger of the operated hand is placed in a soft pouch and hold the board under the foot, so that each head from the heads of the board is outside the belly of the foot to adjust properly.
"You should not forget to commit all that we have mentioned for you in the following section about the symptoms we have discussed and adapt each case as necessary.
Chapter Eighteen.
Section: The Woman's Delight and the Man'ease and Male Complaints.
"When the woman's delight is broken, it falls backward and is pulled towards her back slightly slightly so that she can grasp from behind; then use a silk string to bring the male member up until it fills and becomes round in her vagina.
"Then the woman tenses and lifts slightly, causing that silk string to come out until it reaches at the vaginal opening as a circle and causes the hardness to break; then she makes an incision on her back when she wants to urinate, and gently removes the silk string until she defecates.
"She then brings it out in the same way she did initially and returns to her first incision; do this for seven days or so until conception occurs, if you wish to take a sheep's bladder, tie it tightly around her mouth with a piece of tubing, and insert all of it into her vagina.
Then inflate into the tube forcefully until the bladder within the sheath swells, then remove it with cotton and secure for a few days as we described until healed; if bone splinters from a man or woman break off inside, perform surgery on them accordingly.
He is treated as we described for the shin bone, not hiding your success in these strange fractures that you said are present and particularly if there is a ridge, because this break itself indicates it in most cases according to my book.
On the path to recovery from his fracture and immobilize it, if a man mentions that an inguinal hernia has ruptured then insert into him, position a truss made of gauze and bandage for three days or so until healed,.
The ninth chapter.
In fracture bone cases where there is a wound.
Whoever presents with a fracture and especially if the bone is large like the thigh or shank bones, should promptly treat it to facilitate healing as we have outlined the conditions for recovery.
Then the wound bled, and it was appropriate to quickly cut away a scraped poultice if nothing else arrived; then take in the compress on that day with one's eyes open and do not delay.
If no suppurating abscess occurred, then a suppurating abscess will reach its fullness by the ninth day until it settles in and do not approach it on the third and fourth days as it may have unfavorable symptoms.
The broken bone came to the skin and was open, so it should be covered with a bandage applied by your hands gently and left alone; if his scab or plaster did not arrive at you through this instrument made of metal about seven fingers long or eight. And present it with the extent of the wound.
Therefore, the physician should take three or four for as much treatment is needed in each type of fracture and be slightly thick so that it does not fold when bent during work. (Translation: This part seems to instruct how many plaster strips a physician should use based on the severity of different types of fractures, with the strip being slightly thicker than usual to prevent bending or creasing while working.)
"The sharp edge has a bend on its side, and the top part is convex, while from the middle downward it is very deep; this is her image:
"Called by the Greeks Permereidon, a small column should be erected; its sharp end shall touch the projecting of the bone and push it back until the bone returns to some level, which will equalize both sides of the fracture.
"The broken end was fragile, and the device did not take it well; it was necessary to cut off that bone piece until the device could handle it, as we have described in our table.
"Or stretch it out with one of the rods as you can, then grind what is left of the banguish and crumbling within the bone; if the bone recoils and a defect appears after rebounding, causing acute pain, know that the bone has not returned to its natural position.
"If it has returned to its natural position, then you have greatly relieved the affliction; if your bone splint is in a large tear, use a tight black cloth if it's summer and do not put any tissue or oil on the wound.
Unless pus and rot occur, then use the saws while your fracture of the bone is healing, leaving the wound open so that it can be scraped with a scalpel in the fold.
Be extremely cautious, for the wound should heal slowly to avoid what quacks doctors have caused their patients: death or consumption or diarrhea; so let your recovery be smoothly bloated away from severe scarring.
The wound was poor or a large wcu and I feared some of the bad symptoms we described; he found pain in that location, so it is not appropriate to saw at him with scalpels, but made for him stitches from strong tears where the saws are located, and sewed them.
If after a day or two, you see the wound beginning to form scabs and heal from the tears that I placed with alcohol, then use ligatures and bandages as we usually dress surgeries like our fourfold method and its approach; it is appropriate for you to untie the sutures.
The wound is examined every evening and morning until it heals and clears up, the limb should be raised with a bandage containing honey applied to it easily; this will take many days for the wound without re-bleeding or stopping the huge from it so you know there are small bone fragments.
It was necessary to examine the wound with a probe and remove any bone fragments, extracting them and removing them; what was not uncontaminated would cause pain in the limb and lead to inflammation, so you can cut off the affected part entirely.
The presentation of the wound being a gangrene or ulceration or another type of rot and infection should be matched with each case by what it looks like according to the treatment described on its front cover.
And it is necessary to stand at the dislocation and prepare your mind if a large bone breaks and protrudes from the limb like the thigh or femur and so on with such major parts, not being exposed or extruded. Often, death is presented rather than left to rot if it falls from itself after twenty days or thirty.
Then, treat the wound if you see a place for healing; otherwise leave it alone.
Chapter Twenty.
Treatment of the complicated condition presented on a bone fragment.
This complexity is often presented on a bone fragment, especially near the joints where it shows the shape of the organ and sometimes prevents the organ from performing its natural function.
It appears that the complexity was open and used in it medicines like saponin, lime, myrrh, onion, quassia, etc., to take some or all of them and grind them with a binding liquid such as egg white or milk.
Apply it to the complexity in a compress and tighten it well, leaving the pressure for many days until it is resolved as God wills, or alternatively, apply a flattened piece of molten metal directly on top of it.
The characteristic of metal is to penetrate through all the parts we treat, so if the complexity has become calcified and intensified, prompting an urgent need for its removal from above, it can be separated or cut off using some chisel until healed and the wound treated until healed.
Chapter on Surgical Instruments and Twenty-four Knives.
In treating fractures, if the bone remained fragile after that, without any sign of initial healing.
If a bone fracture is still fragile after that, then there must be numerous reasons for this. One of them may be improperly tightening and tying the splints, or over-tightening them until nutrition is insufficient for the bone to regain strength, or excessive bed rest inappropriately timed, or excessive movement at an incorrect time, or low blood volume within the body of the patient.
Treatment for this includes nourishing the patient, strengthening their body until blood volume increases within them, using a bath to promote joy and happiness towards recovery, then applying bandaging on the bone so it attracts plenty of nutrition or moistening splints with abundant water. Until nourishment returns and it regains its natural form,.
Chapter on Surgical Instruments and Twenty-four Knives. (This is a repeated phrase, indicating perhaps the end of a chapter or section.)
In treating fractures, if there was an incorrect alignment and the intended action did not occur as it should have. (This might indicate a complication during the surgical procedure that needs to be addressed.)
At any time, display the part of a member that has been operated on after healing from distortion or fracture of the bone or complication and suppuration as a result thereof. However, the member did not cease its natural function; it is not proper to assert that the bone was broken from above by many quacks and coercive doctors doing so in our land.
This act is greatly shameful for the injured doctor, but if the distortion and complication were entirely healed, it was appropriate to dress them with water in which aromatic herbs such as eyebright root, licorice, and elecampane had been boiled like that.
He dresses with aromatic compresses such as camphorated diachylon or takes the syrup of eyebright root and rubs it with chicken fat and lanolin and dresses it with that, or takes dried string beans and crushes them with lamb suet and dresses accordingly. He uses these remedies known as analgesic medicines.
And as the distortnce continually resolves with the gentle regular massage applied to all sides at every time, if the fracture presented itself and worsened and solidified, it necessitated treating it with iron treatment.
It is required to scratch above and release the bone connection, cut any excess complexity or bone with thin strips, then use a chisel in this carefully and diligpertly until healed.
Chapter Three and Twenty.
A joint is the dislocation of a joint from its position, restricting movement and distorting the shape of the bone, occurring in severe illness or pain; then one should seek to promptly put it back into place for healing.
It does not delay it because if delayed, the repositioning of the joint and a tumor that hinders with it will cause pain; therefore, one should not delay or move or stretch in its inflammation as this often occurs severely ill or painful diseases.
However, if this occurs one should promptly treat the illness then leave for a short time until the tumor settles; afterwards, warm water and oil are used to lubricate before repositioning, and each bone is treated as described.
The sections of the joint have also been arranged according to what is presented from upper body downwards,... (This translates as a continuation or an index organization instruction rather than content.)
Chapter Four and Twenty.
In treating a dislocated jaw.
They should not move except in rare cases and remove them by placing one on each cheek, either so that they gradually lose their position while relaxing a bit or completely removing them. To the chest until the swelling of the abscess subsides and he cannot grab it, nor can he apply his jaw joint or move his tongue while talking; if they gradually come loose, he may often return to normal on the left side.
And if the complete dislocation occurs, it should be urgently treated without delay and he must hold his abscess head while the doctor inserts one finger into its origin at the jaw joint inside his mouth from one side.
Or he inserts all his fingers if the dislocation is from both sides and pushes them outward, commanding the abscess to fall back into place and move freely in every direction while the doctor guides the jaw joint and presses it until it returns to its position.
Indeed, if the swelling is severe and especially if all joints are involved, one should employ plasters with hot water and oil until they ease their swelling, as we have said before; if it returns and subsides again, then apply the liniment of lime mixed with sesame oil.
Then gently bind the limbs with bandages, and let the patient lie on their back between two pillows so that they cannot move left or right, but can eat easily.
If the pain goes away and the joint loosens, then they should eat whatever is tolerable, easily, without any difficulty in opening their mouth while eating or drinking until the joint loosens and recovers.
If the swelling of a joint happens suddenly and does not move to its position frequently, it causes constant headaches and may result in diarrhoea or vomiting if you see that, understand that it is a serious case.
And often they die within ten days of showing these symptoms.
Chapter Five and Twenty.
In the treatment of dislocation and medial condyle.
In the case of dislocation, it does not detach from its internal connection to the chest and may protrude outwards, which is evident by touching, and forces the patient to lie on their back with extended arms.
Then apply pressure with one hand, forcing it to return, then place the bandage and splint and secure them, while the medial condyle that extends and is connected should not be allowed to slip except in extreme cases where retreatment and realignment are needed as previously mentioned or when necessary.
Then place the bandage, splint and secure the injury with a cast or rest until healed; this treatment will allow the medial condyle to return to its position if it has moved from its place,.
Chapter Six Twenty-two.
In the treatment of medial condyle dislocation.
Note that the medial condyle may dislocate in three ways: one where it slips downwards, another towards the chest, and rarely upwards over the medial condyle; this is rare.
There is no opening behind the place of the shoulder nor in front of the place of the nerve, but it opens more and empties downward towards the hip socket, especially those with little flesh because they empty out quickly and enter rapidly.
For those with a lot of flesh, it is as though they empty out slowly and enter sluggishly; sometimes this has been shown to the public by a fall or slip at the hip socket causing severe pain, leading people to think that it had opened up and should be palpated until one finds health.
Then treatment progresses, and the joint is identified if it reaches down towards the hip socket by feeling between the dislocated and the correct acetabulum; there will be a difference in appearance and one finds atop the acetabulum turbulence and beneath the pelvis upon touching the top of the acetabulus as though it were an egg.
The ailment is not considered worthy that it raises the hand to its ear or moves all movements, and similarly if dislocated towards the chest or upwards then one finds this phenomenon upon touching does not disappear.
This joint may heal quickly if... The patient was young or the illness was juvenile, and his recovery raises his hand above then you make your thumbs undernecued and raise the joint strongly to its place and the support raises his hand and extends it upward.
Then he lays it down, and if it does not return quickly as we mentioned earlier, the joint has been for many days and it is appropriate that the patient bathe in hot water and use the pills that are shaken like they would cook the roots of eyelashes and beets and king's parsley in water.
Then the patient lifts onto their shoulders and places a wool ball underneath, which is moderately soft yet firm, then the doctor steps behind it and grasps the patient's hand with his own and extends them downward.
He pushes the ball forward with his leg, and if you wish to repeat this method, have a foot longer than the patient's, stop him from one side and guide your knee underneath the patient's ankle and lift their sock up until they are suspended in the air. The servant calls the patient'cuish to his stomach, as the disease was light; it was necessary to hang something else on him to alleviate it, so that he would recover in a period of time, and may also fall onto another face.
It is that the long stick on the ground has a round head shaped like a hawk's beak, not thick or thin, and then place it under the patient after placing on top of the wood a softened cloth and stand them upright on the stick.
Then, he stretched his hand to the other side and extended his body as well from that direction with force, so that the joint returns to its place quickly; it is difficult for him to recover using everything we mentioned above, but this treatment should be done by taking a stick of length towards two arms. And exposing it to the length of four fingers and thickening by two fingers, so that it has a rounded head making it easy to enter into depth underneebt according to this image:.
Then he attaches a softened cloth to the rounded head so as not to harm the stick with the disease and places it underneath, extends all his hands and arm over the stick towards below and ties the stick on the support and assistant and the side of the hand.
Then place the hand on a board. Lift up with one arm and lower your hand down so that the body weight hangs from the other side, then the joint enters its time [of operation]. If it is possible to enter it from any face, it should be placed under the abdomen as a moderately rounded mass of woolen cloth.
Then the prepared bandage with lamb fat and egg white is placed over the navel, covering it entirely as a rotating mass. Then grip the ball from under the abdomen firmly and roll the string on the bandage from above while hanging by his neck.
He should not move his hand for seven days, and the patient's diet should be light until the tissue gains strength to cover quickly; then after seven or five days of healing, begin exercises as the stability is established and there is no recurrence of wound dehiscence.
The joint was moved frequently due to excessive moisture exposure or another cause, and it should be treated with three sulfa dressings provided through the wound opening; this was done and the stitches were removed after seven days without stabilizing the joint.
The ligature and pressure were applied repeatedly, but did not take hold; it sank, relaxed, and could not be raised again. I realized that the nerve in the head of the condyle may have been cut, elongated or relaxed; hence, the joint does not remain fixed in its place permanently.
As for the fracture that is towards the chest and limb, and behind it, to be pushed and extended with the hand until it returns; compression and treatment are used until relief occurs, after which there is swelling in the bone and slower movement.
The humoral disease does not act frequently until the bone relaxes and returns to its original state,,.
Chapter 72.
In treating the wrist fracture.
The wrist joint is difficult to dislocate and also returns with difficulty; it dislocaturally in all directions, especially towards the back or front. To displace this fracture may not be visible visually or tactilely because it appears as a dislocation. (Note: This translation follows the provided instruction of not adding any notes, comments, explanations or additional text).
If you correctly reset the dislocated wrist, it becomes evident to you through visible signs of a deformed joint that cannot bend the arm or touch its tip; thus, you must promptly and gently return the fracture within your hour before an acute inflammation shows up. (Note: This translation follows the provided instruction of not adding any notes, comments, explanptions or additional text).
He has a swoljarred and painful rash, the pigeon did not recover, especially if the fracture is to the back; it will be more severe, achy, and frequently accompanied by death.
He was forced to extend his arms and elbows, with the doctor's hand above and below the joint, pushing it backward using all his fists or up to his wrist until it snapped back into place.
If the fracture is to the side, it may heal by bending the arm until his palm grasps and strikes his inner wrist, but one must not return the joint too forcefully as this requires extreme stretching of the muscles and extending both arms at once.
The affliction also grips with both arms when it is stretched, after which the arm rotates towards each side upon injury to his hand, either by a folded or wide scarf; if the doctor's hands grasp the joint and rub oil into it, dislocation may be facilitated easily.
Then, the physician pushes the joint firmly until it returns, and after retracting it should place a bandage with gauze and powdered eggs inside, press firmly again, and suspend from the affected arm for several days.
Then, if the joint is not stabilized after removing the splint and leaving it, if the joint does not tighten, replace the bandage and splint as well, and leave them for several days until they tighten; then remove them again and a swelling occurs after returning the joint to its normal position.
If the joint is stiff and swelling in the bath, gently massage it until it becomes flexible or makes a cracking sound; then apply a fatty capshe from sheep skin and tie it for one day and night, then remove it and enter the hot bath again if there is an excessive discharge from the joint.
Then, replace the bandage again twice and enter the hot bath until it becomes flexible; if you wish to make a poultice with moist cow dung mixed with fat, do so multiple times for flexibility to return to its original state.
Chapter Eighty-Two.
In the treatment of dislocated joints.
The metacarpal bones dislocate frequently, and reducing them is easy except for those above the joints; however, it should be expedited before they set or become hot, so as to avoid complications.
The reducer should place the dislocated metacarpal bone on a board and stretch out their hand, while the surgeon places their hand over the joint and pushes until it returns; it is necessary to ensure that the reduction has taken effect internally in the hand.
The patient should lie down and rest, and if the fracture is visible externally on the hand, then place their inner hand flat on a board so that the surgeon's hand can be placed over the joint; they should return only when completely at ease or stabilized with an anti-inflamcuar bandage.
Let him rest until he can return, which is unlikely; the joint will remain crooked and may not harm the injury unless the hand has become calm enough to grasp something.
Then you learn that the nerve is cut or torn, with no remedy except to bind it tightly so as to potentially aid and perhaps not. If the bone has been reduced, apply the dressing we described then binding firmly for five days.
Then the hand swells and becomes stiff, showing signs of inflammableness; so treat it with heated oil and resin repeatedly until twice a day.
The Ninth Chapter Twenty.
In Treatment of Finger Joints Dislocation.
The fingers may dislocate at any joint whenever a finger is dislocated to the surface or interior of the palm; extend and push the bone back in place using your thumb until it returns, then fix the fingertip towards the side that dislocation occurred on.
Leave it on for two days then remove and stretch until the alignment is restored; if at night, bind it as described above but keep loosening and mobilizing it during daylight hours and rebind at night until symptoms persist for several days.
And do the same for if it dislocates internally within the hand, binding towards the side itself and follow as you did initially until recovered; likewise, perform on it whenever there is a dislocation to external joints,.
Chapter 32: Surgery on Fractures and Dislocptions. Treatment of various types of fractures in different parts of the body with plasters made from lint and egg whites, or splints for limbs and others using leather straps. In addition to methods for reducing dislocations and correcting deformities caused by fracture displacement.
Treatment of a skull fracture.
A skull fracture occurred, which is either a complete craniotomy or when many fractures are present and unrepaired because the condition has progressed to death rapidly.
The sign of the ailment is that it exits involuntarily, often unable to hold back and sometimes causing relaxation of parts such as limbs or an arm or one of them. In cases where a fracture has significantly moved from its original position, it may disappear completely.
Its disappearance occurs in four ways: it recedes behind and is called the forehead; treating this would mean that a bump occurred from childbirth, requiring no treatment or concern about bruising. When one has resulted from a fall or strike leading to similar injuries.
The early mentions described treating it with lengthy speech that has little to no benefit, and they have abbreviated most of what we derive from them meaningfully and explanatorily about the instrument, different from how it is defined and explained.
"I say that the ribs which originate from behind in the chest have no remedy or relief, and similarly those to either side as well; but only those on the back are treated by me, because I have described a method for stretching them.
"On a stall at the bottom of a wall, simplify underneath and pour a wet mud to relieve his chest then place a vertical plank embedded in a hole on the ground near the stall towards his head and another plank on the other side of the stall towards his legs.
"The keeper holds the plank, ensuring it's not loose in the hole and another keeper holds the other one as before; then he rubs ointment on the patient's chest and under his belly, stretching the edges of the bandage to the plank and secures them.
"Then he stretches another bandage over his elbangs and knees, and at the calves, then gathers all the bandages and ties them to the other plank near his legs, while each keeper extends the bandage to their respective side of the plank without losing balance.
But neither of them is proven as we said, and the doctor places his palm firmly on the incision until it heals or he puts a board underneebody and sits on it with his legs until it heals; if this treatment does not work, then a board about three cubits long.
And digs into the wall where we said to be near the affliction, then places the board in the middle on top of the beam and the doctor puts his legs on the other side and pulls firmly until the stricture vibrates.
And returns to its place, and if you wish it to be made by the crotch which is pulled with the hand so that it emerges into the ground at the head of the affliction in another shop sticks two pieces about arm-length long near his feet also in another shop.
And let there be a space of a cubit between each piece and have made in each piece a hole through which the crotch can pass, fixing all pieces to the ground so that they do not move until the peg is inserted again roundly and the rope is pulled over the holes in both sticks.
Healed side, a hole that has been reinforced with wood of one span in length to overlap the other two similar pieces; then fasten the bandage which was fastened on the chest of the lamb near its head and the straps which were fastened on its legs at the thigh.
Then stand by each lamb, the servant holding up with his pincers to support the lamb while the physician raises the incision made previously; this is an image of the lameness in a sheep, the vendor, and the patient.
Then, after the flap has been returned and is in its proper place, it should bear a dried egg membrane dressing followed by bandaging; then place a strip from above the dressing with the width of three fingers or so on and the length appropriate for the position of the incision.
If it is the correct stitch, then fasten with a bandage that should be used until recovery; if any swelling remains in another location, one should use medication that dissolves and soothes, along with using the board we described for an extended period of time.
A plate of lead has been used, and another incision on the chest is shown in hopes that it will extract an excess bone and relieve symptoms; however, if death occurs through this treatment.
Chapter of Surgery and Thirty (Pages).
Treatment for a dislocated joint.
It is known that the elbow and knee joints only have a hinge, unlike other joints which exhibit sliding and depression movements, with the elbow joint having four articulation points.
That means it hinges inward, outward, and to the sides, as well as more intricately towards inside or sideways depending on whether you bend a healthy leg toward the patient's left or right hand; hence, its sign of hinge is inward if bent correctly.
The hip joint is more accurate than the knee, and it cannot be bent straight for a limp. It has been established by us that when walking on tiptoes, the position of the heel should align with VRMA (a term not commonly used in anatomy) as indicated by the head reaching there.
The sign of the joint hinged outward presents symptoms opposite to those mentioned, and the sign of the joint hinged towards the side actually eases the leg fully without any pain except in the hip, which does not allow bending that way at all for walking.
Albucasis instructs on binding and bandaging the foot, as well as walking with a limp to elevate it while standing, indicating the sign that shows whether or not the knee can be bent before bending the arbute. Additionally, the same leg's shin should also be shorter than the other.
The arbute is loose, and the shin bone at the knee joint is clear. As for this type of fracture, it must be considered that the bone was old and had become adhered to its neighbor but has not been reattached, so it remained in its state without having a splint treatment.
It should not be exposed to it, and as for a recent fracture from any of the four types of fractures indicated that it would subside into the joint, extend inside and out, move right or left.
He did not require any other treatment, so it was appropriate for him to be supported strongly and extend his leg either by holding with his hands or tying above the knee on a strap, and another support extending from above.
"His hands enter from under the cuff, then he gently presses on the shaft of the penis with a soft cloth and holds down another third part with one side of the cloth while stretching it either from the buttocks to the scrotum or from behind to the chest.
"They all stretch him at once until the swelling rises from his body onto the ground and is left hanging; this type of stretching is common to the four types, as we have mentioned earlier, so there is no need for each kind that I listed in terms of treatment.
"His specific response if the fracture is to be lifted inside, then he should hang the swelling on the correct side and place a cloth along the shaft of the penis between the root of the penis and the position underne.the buttocks.
"Then he extends the bandage from the buttocks to above the body and takes another force with his arms and embraces the heavy position of the swolculed penis, stretching it outward sharply; as a result, he returns it to its place.
This type of treatment is easier than the other types, as this part responds well to it; therefore, you should not use this type of prescribed treatment in which both legs are tied with soft bands on the ankles and knees.
After each one, the person is able to move four fingers, and the affected leg extends more than the other by two fingers; then they hang the limb on a wooden support from which it reaches about two arms' length off the ground.
Then, a strong boy is commanded to embrace the base of the limb and another boy holds the affected leg; when the other boy pushes with force, then the joint returns to its place quickly; as for its specific response if it's an external dislocation.
The limb should be placed on the support as we described in reference to the shin and tighten the bandage around the affected leg specifically and his chest; then place one of the two pieces of wood at each foot, and place another piece of wood between them firmly secured.
He may have wrapped a moist wound with lint so that the illness does not infect the wood between his thighs, without it being drawn downward upon extension, then extending each leg to its foot and the physician adjusting the ankle in his hands; he responded by returning.
He placed the tablet and pressed it on what we mentioned in the chest, whether or not the illness should be urinating properly, if it slides to the left, then lengthen its leg once, with a look at it like this against the counter.
The physician places his right hand on the ailing heifer and presses it with his left hand, but while doing so extends the pressure downwards to the thigh, and if sliding backwards does not stretch towards the hindquarters.
He is upright but should be seated firmly as it must also stretch its ankles outward according to what we mentioned about urination at the counter, with his face and fastenings tense.
On what we said about the nose, it is also necessary to use a tablet on the joint that left and if the ankle joint turns as it should with signs of turning not hidden from you then lengthen its leg.
If you see two levels and the injury causes contraction of the leg without being impossible, understand that the member has returned to its proper place. Then open up both gastrocnemius muscles and apply the bandage tightly so that the calf does not move in any direction.
The injury must be treated. Three or four days of rest, then remove the bandage and splint and immobilize the other leg; if you see them at their limit, understand that the fracture has stabilized for walking, but if there is a sign of relaxation.
Return the bandage and tighten it according to your initial tension, and leave it for three more days then remove and allow walking until fully healed by God's will.
The second and third chapters.
In treating a shin fracture.
The ankle fractures in three ways: internally, externally, and downward towards the sole of the foot with no fracture behind it; a sign that the fracture is healing is when it causes the member to unite with its shin.
If it does not attach to the shin, understand that the ankle is fractured in all ways and forces the injury to sit upright while the legs are stretched out; if strong enough, it will bend slightly behind him, grip the middle, and lean back a bit before you sit on his heels.
"Attach your back to his face and place a man between your legs. Then secure his thighs with one of your hands, intertwine them together on his thighs, then firmly grasp his thigh with another hand, while the other leg is stretched out by another person until the limb returns to its original position.
"Make sure to bind the leg with the calf in a non-torturing length, then tighten and attach the leg to the calf, then connect them together for three or four days, then release them, using only minimal walking during this period until they are healed.
"You must not follow what we described, but rather use the bandaging techniques provided in our text for treating fractures until they heal.
"Chapter three and one hundred thirty.
"In the treatment of ankle fractures.
"The ankle may collapse as you walk, and it might fully break or fracture inwards or outwards. The sign of the fracture is that the anculet will appear noticeably swollen towards the direction where it broke.
"Treating a collapse is easier; gently stretch it back and reposition until it returns, whereas for treating a complete fracture, the patient should lie down with a helper grasping the limb firmly from behind at its midpoint.
Then you hold your right hand above the foot and your left hand below it at the position of the ligaments, then move the foot with both hands twice, stretching it afterwards with the left hand and pushing the shin towards the thigh without force.
Then do it twice as described, then push the shin towards the thigh in the third time and you stretch the ligaments, when returning one or two times to this characteristic and I see the foot level and if not repeat the work on it as it returns.
Then stop as we described and if not, firm the injury on its back on the ground and embed a tight bandage between his legs so that no crack is left uncovered to avoid further injuring the wound, then adjust his thigh bandage.
Then extend another support for the man, either by his hands or a belt attached to his neck, then extend each bandage except the one next to it and the stick held between the legs of the injured so that nothing attracts his body towards downward during extension, then straighten out the doctor's fracture.
The Servant Grasps the Correct Leg Downwards, and the Joint Returns Quickpresses to Check Its Soundness; After Confirming Its Condition, Apply Compressed Sponges, Bandages, and Secure Firmly with Strings on the Ankle Below, While Taking Care to Avoid the Nerve Overlying the Knee From Behind.
If the Binding is Too Tight, Leave It to Relax For Two or Three Days, Then Let it Restore and Loosen Further on the Third or Fourth Day; The Patient Should Abstain From Walking for Forty Days.
Walking Before This Period Risks the Joint Not Taking Hold, Fungal Infection, and Subsequcuous Treatment Failure; Exposure of Such a Case Requires Us to Employ Our Prescribed Methods in Non-Weight Bearing Positions Until Recovery.
Chapter Four and Thirty.
In Treating a Fractured Finger of the Man.
The Fracture Should Be Set by a Gentle Walk, Not Difficult but Easy; In Some Cases of Toe Bones, It Was Advised to Make the Patient's Foot Above Ground Level in Recovery Stages.
He stands on a table, like a butcher, then you place your foot on that joint and press down with force until it returns to its original position and no issue is visible in the area.
Then make him lie on his back with his foot elevated, so that it is supported by two pillows; press it firmly for three days then unwrap and let him rest from walking for many days until the healing is complete.
The Fifth Hundred and Thirty.
In types of fractures with or without a wound, or both.
When such an event occurred and treated it with great effort, death often followed. This statement likely refers to complications or severe outcomes following the treatment of fractures which in Albucasis' time could be fatal due to lack of advanced medical care compared to modern standards.
For this type of treatment should not be presented except by one who is skilled in the craft, with a long experience, delicate and devoted, calm and not prone to haste, and that he uses medicines at the outset that dwell on cancerous hotness alone, and submits the patient.
May God grant only the safety you sought from the ailment with mild symptoms, and may some hope be seen in your recovery within an hour of commencement before the cancerous heat occurs. This text suggests that Albucasis advises for early intervention to prevent exacerbation of the illness, demonstrating his understanding of prompt treatment being crucial, which parallels modern medical principles.
Indeed, the reattachment of a part that one desired to treat using the covering method which houses tumors and treats wounds with suitable dried leeches resulted in the bone breaking into fragments accompanied by flying splinters upon fracturing. And adhere to what we have mentioned in the previous simple diseases, which are provided in their respective places.
And exert your effort and depart from the path of despair; follow what I have recommended to you, so that you may remain steadfast for yourself and submit your display as Allah wills.
