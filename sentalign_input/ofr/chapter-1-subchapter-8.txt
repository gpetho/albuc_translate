of lethargy
For this illness, it is necessary to give the patient strong herbs and pills that cleanse the brain;
afterwards, shave the patient's entire head, and apply to the occiput the mustard plaster that is described in the treatise on plasters;
and this is the method of cautery:
do it as I have said.
If he is healed thus, it is good;
and if he is not, then make three cauteries down the middle of the head, descending to the neck, and let the space between each cautery be the width of a thumb;
and treat it like the others, and if you wish to add more, and the patient is tolerant, make a cautery in the middle;
and if necessary, two others on the two temples, and treat him until he is healed;
and let the cautery be the one called "olivary," as I have said before.
