On the sawing-down of teeth growing on top of others.	On Filing Teeth that Protrude Over Others.	0.7547344
When teeth grow in other than their natural place the appearance is very bad, specially when it occurs in women or slaves.	When teeth protrude unnaturally, they mar the appearance, especially in women and girls, particularly those who are in public view.	0.75988406
So you should examine; if the tooth has grown out behind another tooth and it is impossible either to saw or file it down, then extract it. But if it be attached to another tooth, cut it down with an instrument of this kind.	Thus, you must consider the approach carefully. If a tooth has emerged behind another and is misaligned, such that neither filing nor grinding is possible, then extract it. If it is attached to another tooth, cut it using this instrument, which has the following shape.	0.83671385
It resembles a small chisel and should be of Indian steel with a well-sharpened end.	It resembles a small beak and is made from Indian iron, with a very sharp tip.	0.8482369
You should spread your cutting with it over several days on account of the hardness of the tooth and so as to leave the others undisturbed.	Make this cut gradually over several days due to the hardness of the tooth, ensuring it does not disturb adjacent teeth.	0.6847196
If the tooth projects in such a way as to make filing possible, use a file of Indian iron, shaped like this.	If the protruding tooth can be filed down, use an iron file, shaped as follows.	0.73332703
It should be wholly manufactured of Indian iron, its handle too, and covered with very fine points to resemble the file used in making needles. You should file the tooth with it very slowly and gently over a period of many days so as not to shift the tooth and cause it to fall out; then finally smooth it and scrape it with one of the scrapers.	The file should be entirely of iron, with a handle covered in small points, similar to a file used for making needles. Gradually file down the tooth over several days, working gently to avoid loosening the tooth and causing it to fall out. Finally, smooth the tooth with a fine razor.	0.84687567
If it be a tooth of which part has broken off and it hurts the tongue in speaking, file it down till you have disposed of the roughness of the break and the tooth is smooth and neither injures the tongue nor hinders speech.	If part of a tooth breaks off and injures the tongue, file it down until the roughness is removed, leveling and smoothing it so it no longer harms the tongue or impedes speech.	0.88807434
