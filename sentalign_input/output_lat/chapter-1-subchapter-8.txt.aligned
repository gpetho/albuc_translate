First, great electuaries should be given to the patient to drink; and pills to clear the head.	To begin, the patient should be given a drink containing potent hyeerae and pills that purify the brain.	0.72749984
Then let his whole head be shaved and apply a mustard plaster to the hinder part as described in the treatise on plasters.	Then, shave the patient's entire head and apply a mustard plaster over the occiput, as described in the chapter on plasters, and repeat this application several times.	0.66145396
That should be applied several times as it is a kind of cauterization; do it in the very way described there.	This serves as a form of cautery, and perform it according to the sequence described in that section.	0.60263515
If he is cured, well and good; but if not, burn him with three cauterizations on the back of the head, arranging them in a row downward from the upper part of the head to the base of the neck; and make an interval between each pair of one finger's breadth.	If the patient is healed by this, it is well. If not, then make three cauteries on the back of the head, extending from the top of the head down to the lower part of the eye, spacing each cautery a fingerâ€™s width apart.	0.8195891
Then treat as aforesaid.	Then treat the cauteries as previously instructed.	0.7730803
If you wish to add to these cauterizations and the patient be fit to bear it, give him a burn in the middle; and if still more, then burn him on the two frontal prominences.	If you want to add more, and the patient can tolerate it, then make an additional cautery in the middle. If further treatment is desired, then cauterize over the two horns of the head.	0.7901883
Then dress till healed. Let the cautery be an olivary as described before.	Then treat the patient until he is healed, using the olive-shaped cautery as previously described.	0.68188465
