of circumcision
Circumcision is not a separation of continuity like other wounds; however, when we perform this operation of our own volition, and specifically on children, it is necessary that we perform the best work, and the easiest for healing.
I say that the ancients did not speak of the circumcision of their children, because they did not practice it in their law, and we only have what we have acquired through experience.
For I have seen the majority of masters and healers who performed circumcision around a knife, and forcefully, and with just a razor; thus the heart fled because there are two layers of skin, and perhaps they cut the upper one and leave the lower one.
Then it must be cut again, and the pain is doubled, and with the cleaning, which is done with a knife, the tip of the member is not safe; and with the cleaning of the nail, perhaps the iron slips, and ruins the work, and often they are born such that they do not need cleaning, and I have seen it.
Regarding the cleaning which is done forcefully with the thread, I have found the benefit of experience, because the force cuts evenly as well above as below.
For when you press your hand, cut evenly in one single motion; but ensure the thread is tightly wrapped around the skin; and the manner of the first procedure is that you make the child think, if he understands, that you are only tying the thread around the penis, and then make him happy in all the ways you can; then make him stand straight between your hands, and hide the tools between your hands or under your feet so the child does not see them, nor any of the instruments; then put your hand on the penis and blow into the catheter, and draw it upwards until the head of the penis is inside; then clean it well of the accumulated filth, then tie the marked place with a double thread, then tie it below in another place with another tie; and hold it with two fingers by the second tie with the thumb and index finger, and cut between the two ties, then quickly lift the catheter and pull the head of the penis; then let the blood flow little by little, for this is the best; and put powder on it and over the powder a cloth soaked in a mixture of cooked egg white tempered with rose water, combined with good fresh rose oil, and leave it on until the next day, and treat it with other treatments until it is healed.
The shape of the forceps for cleansing is this: the two ends should be thin and sharp, and the ends should be as large as the handle, equally.
The error in the cleansing occurs when the catheter inside flees from the incision; then you must extend it with your fingernail, before the place forms an abscess; and cut it evenly, and if you cannot hold it with your fingernail, hold it with forceps, and then cut it.
And if three days pass, and what is under the penis is swollen, leave it until the hot abscess subsides, and peel it lightly; then cut it as gently as you can, and be careful of the part of the penis, so it does not harm it.
Then treat the area with wound-healing powders, as we have mentioned in the treatise on powders, and if you cut the catheter excessively, and it goes too far, it will not cause harm; then treat it, as we have said, until it is healed.
