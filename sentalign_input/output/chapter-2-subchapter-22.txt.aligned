have the patient sit between your hands, then take the fine spatula and make a small hole on the cornea through the continuation of the conjunctiva with the cornea and the corona, so that the swelling comes out; and when it has come out, instill into the eye warm water mixed with honey, or water in which fenugreek has been boiled and honey, then treat it with other treatments until it is healed.	But if the pus is not ready to be brought down by this method, then seat the patient in front of you; then take a fine scalpel and cut a little above the corneal tunic near the coronal junction of conjunctiva and cornea, till the pus comes out. When it comes out, instil warm water mixed with honey, or water boiled with fenugreek and honey. Then treat as usual till healed.	0.7642946
