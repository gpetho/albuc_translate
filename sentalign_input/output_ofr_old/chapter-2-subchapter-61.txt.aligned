of the stone in women	It is very uncommon for women to have stone.	0.55016494
It rarely happens that a stone is generated in women, and if it does happen sometimes, the treatment is difficult, and it is prohibited for three reasons: one is that perhaps the woman is a virgin; and the second is that one cannot find a knowledgeable woman who will reveal herself to doctors, especially when she is chaste. And the third reason is that perhaps one cannot find a knowledgeable woman skilled in this practice; and the fourth reason is that the stone in a woman is located deeper than the stone in a man, for which it is necessary to make a deeper cut, and there is great risk. And if necessity compels you to do this, then you must take a very knowledgeable midwife, and one hardly finds them, and if you do not find one, at least look for a discreet and skilled physician; and present to him a very wise matron experienced in the lives of women, or a woman who knows some of the art, and instruct her to do what you command her regarding the examination for the stone; and look carefully to see if the woman is a virgin: then she must insert her finger into the rectum and search for the stone; and if she finds it, she should hold it under her finger, and instruct the patient to insert her finger into her vagina, and search, and press her left hand firmly on the bladder.	As these are very uncommon, if you are without one then seek a eunuch doctor as a colleague, or bring a midwife experienced in women's ailments or a woman to whom you may give some instruction in this art. Have her with you and bid her do all that you enjoin; first of all, in searching for the stone. If she perceive that the woman is a virgin she should pass her finger into the anus and palpate for the stone. If she finds it and keeps her finger on it, then bid her cut down upon it.	0.7981519
