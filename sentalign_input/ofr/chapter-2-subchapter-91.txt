of the vein of the penis
This vein appears on legs, in hot areas where neither grass nor trees grow, and in land without moisture;
and sometimes it appears elsewhere than on the legs, and this happens from the putrefaction that comes under the skin, as it occurs inside the body with snakes and worms, generated between skin and flesh.
And the sign of the beginning of this vein is that a very large inflammation appears on the leg, then the location changes, and the vein begins to protrude, like the root of a plant.
When the head appears, you must wrap around it a piece of lead weighing from one and a half to two drams, and tie it, and let the lead hang from the leg, and each time it protrudes more when cauterizing, wrap it around the lead, and tie it;
and if it is too long, cut off a part, and wrap the remainder, and do not cut it at its root, until it is completely removed; 
for if you cut it, it will go back into the flesh, and cause an abscess and putrefaction in the area, and a serious illness;
therefore it must be pulled little by little until the end, and nothing remains in the body;
and this vein is sometimes when pulled five palms long, or ten, and a man once came to me, from whom it emerged ten palms long, and when you cut it, insert a probe into the hole, and pierce it all the way through, so that it all comes out;
and the matter within should be emptied, and apply medicines generating pus to the area for a few days, then treat it like abscesses.
And sometimes this vein has several branches, and especially when it appears in the joint of the foot, or in the foot, and many holes appear there, from which branches emerge;
then treat it as we have said before.
