from old pain in any limb When pain arises in a limb, either from a fall or a blow, and this pain lasts a long time, and medical treatment is ineffective, then it must be cauterized with a cautery called "points," and the cautery should be applied according to the length of the limb and its size and weakness and its strength and its location with regard to twisting and its pain.	When pain occurs in some limb due to a fall or a blow and the pain becomes chronic and medical treatment has no effect upon it, you should cauterize it with the punctate cautery. In each case the cauterization should be in proportion to the size of the limb, its strength or weakness, and the chronicity of the pain and contusion in it.	0.80844975
if he is healed from the first cautery, that is good;	If it is cured at the first cauterization, good; otherwise repeat the cauterization.	0.66429716
if not, repeat another cautery over that one, for such is the custom that it should move to the nearest limb, therefore you must perform the cauteries until the patient is healed.	For it is customary for these pains to move from one part to a neighbouring part, and you must follow them with the cautery till the patient is cured.	0.65645754
