Chapter seventy-nine on the treatment of unperforated hemorrhoids.
Many boys may be born with their anuses not perforated, having been blocked by a thin membrane.
It is necessary for the midwife to perforate that membrane with her finger.
Otherwise, she should open it with a sharp scalpel, being careful not to touch the muscle.
Then she should put on it cotton dipped in wine and oil.
Then she should treat it with ointments until it heals.
If you fear that it will close up, place a lead tube in the opening for many days and remove it when the child needs to defecate.
Blockage of the anus may also occur from the healing of a wound or a swelling.
It is necessary to incise that healed area then treat it with what we mentioned of treatment and lead.
