On the method of cauterizing an oral fistula.
Chapter 21.
When an abscess forms at the root of the gums, the palate, or the roots of the teeth, which produces pus, ruptures, and eventually ages, leading to a continual discharge of pus and the formation of a fistula, and if the treatment of it does not prove effective, then you must heat a cautery sized to fit the fistula.
Then insert the heated cautery into the opening of the fistula and hold your hand steady until the hot iron reaches the depth and end of the fistula. Do this once or twice as needed.
Then continue treating it afterward as we described in the treatment section until it is healed.
If the discharge ceases and it heals, it will be good.
But if it does not heal, then it is necessary to expose the area and remove the corrupted bone as described in the relevant chapter.
