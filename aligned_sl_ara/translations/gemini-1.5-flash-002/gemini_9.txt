The author of this book says: When I have completed for you, O my sons, this book, which is a part of medical science in its entirety, and have reached the utmost clarity and explanation in it, I saw fit to complete it for you with this chapter, which is a part of practical work.
Because practical work is completely lacking in our country and in our time, so much so that its knowledge is almost extinct and its effect has ceased. And there remain only a few traces of it in the books of the ancients, which have been copied by hands and marred by mistakes and confusion, until its meanings have become obscure and its benefit has been lost.
Therefore, I saw fit to revive it and compose this chapter on it in a way that is explanatory, clear, and concise, and to include pictures of cauterizing irons and other surgical instruments, since this adds to clarity and is essential to what is needed.
The reason why there is no skilled craftsman in our time is that the craft of medicine is lengthy, and its practitioner must first study anatomy, as described by Galen. so that he may understand the functions, forms, temperaments, connections, and separations of the organs, and the knowledge of the bones, nerves, muscles, their number, and their origins, the arteries and veins, and the locations of their origins.
Therefore, Hippocrates said that physicians are many in name but few in deed, especially in the craft of surgery, and we have mentioned a part of this in the introduction to this book.
For he who is not knowledgeable in the anatomy we have mentioned will inevitably make mistakes that kill people, as I have often witnessed among those who have imagined themselves skilled in this science and claimed it without knowledge or training.
For I saw an ignorant physician who incised a scrofulous tumor in a woman's neck, and he severed some of the arteries of the neck, so the woman bled to death in his hands.
And I saw another physician who proceeded to remove a stone from a man who had a fistula, and the stone was large, so he acted rashly and removed it with a piece of the substance of the bladder. And the man died after about three days, and I had been summoned to remove it, and I saw from the size of the stone and the state of the patient that I could have done so.
And I saw another physician who earned his living practicing medicine among some of the brothel keepers of our city.
Then a black boy came to him with a fracture in his leg near the heel, together with a wound.  The physician, in his ignorance, hastened to bind the fracture over the wound with bandages and splints very tightly, and he did not leave the wound any ventilation.
Then he gave free rein to his desires, then he left him for days and ordered him not to untie the bandage until his leg and foot swelled and he was near death.
Then I was summoned to him, and I hastened to untie the bandage, so he found relief and was freed from his pains, except that the corruption had become firmly established in the limb, and I could not prevent it.
And the corruption continued to spread in the limb until he died.
And I saw another physician cauterize a cancerous tumor, and it ulcerated after days until the misfortune of its owner increased.  That is because if a cancer is purely of a black humor, then it is not at all proper to apply iron to it.
Unless it is in a limb that can be entirely excised.
Therefore, my son, you should know that manual work is divided into two parts: work accompanied by safety, and work accompanied by harm in most instances.
And I have warned in every place this book comes to, of the work which contains danger and fear, so you should avoid it and refuse it.
Lest the ignorant find a way to speak and criticize, so take for yourselves firmness and caution, and for your patients gentleness and deliberation.
And use the best method leading to safety and a commendable outcome, and avoid dangerous diseases difficult to cure.
And purify yourselves from that which you fear might cast suspicion on your religion and your worldly affairs, for this is more lasting for your reputation and higher in this world and the next for your standing.
For Galen said in some of his precepts, "Do not treat a bad disease, lest you be called bad physicians.
This chapter has been divided into three sections.
The first section.
On cauterization with fire and cauterization with strong medicine, arranged systematically from head to foot, with illustrations of the instruments and cautery irons, and everything needed for the work by hand.
And the second section.
On incision, perforation, bloodletting, cupping, wounds, and the extraction of arrows and the like, all arranged systematically, with illustrations of the instruments.
And the third section.
On setting (bones), dislocations, and the treatment of sprains and the like, arranged systematically from head to foot, with illustrations of the instruments.
The first section.
On cautery.
And before we mention its use, it is necessary to mention its benefits and harms, and in what temperament it is used.
And I say that discussion of the benefit and harm of cautery is lengthy discourse, a precise science, and a hidden secret, and a number of wise men have spoken about it.
And they differed in it, and I have shortened their words for fear of lengthening.
And I say that cautery generally benefits every bad temperament that is with a substance and without a substance, except for two temperaments, namely the hot temperament without a substance and the dry temperament without a substance.
As for the dry temperament with a substance, they differed in it. Some said that cautery is beneficial in it, and others said the opposite, that cautery is not suitable in a disease that is from heat and dryness, because the nature of fire is heat and dryness.
And it is impossible to be cured of a hot, dry disease with a hot, dry medicine. And he who says the opposite said that cautery with fire may benefit from a hot, dry disease that occurs in the bodies of people. Because when you add the body of man and its moisture to the temperament of fire, you make the body of man cold.
And I say as he says, because experience has revealed that to me many times, except that one should not imagine that matter except one who has trained and practiced in the field of cautery to a great extent. And he stopped at the difference in the temperaments of people and the state of diseases in themselves, their causes, their symptoms, and their duration.
But as for the other temperaments, there is no fear for you from them, especially cold, moist diseases.  All physicians have agreed upon them and have not differed in the benefit of cautery in them.
And know, O my son, that among the secrets of treatment is cautery with fire and its superiority over cautery with burning medicine, because fire is a simple element whose effect does not exceed the member that was cauterized, and it does not harm another connected member except slightly.
And cautery with burning medicine may exceed its effect to what is beyond the members, and may perhaps cause in the member a disease difficult to treat, and may perhaps kill. Fire, because of its nobility and the excellence of its essence, does not do that except if one exaggerates.
And this has become clear to us through experience, long service, attention to the craft, and understanding of the realities of the matter.
Therefore, I have dispensed with lengthy discourse.  Were it not unbecoming of this book of mine, I would have presented to you concerning fire a hidden secret and the manner of its action in bodies and its expulsion of disease with philosophical, demonstrative discourse too subtle for your understanding.
And know, O my sons, that they have differed concerning the time suitable for cautery, and they considered the best time to be springtime.
And I say that cautery is suitable at every time, because the harm resulting from the time is absorbed in the benefit which is brought about by cautery. Especially if the cautery is for strong, necessary, urgent pains which do not tolerate delay, because of the fear that what follows from them may be a calamity greater than the slight harm which comes from the time.
And let it not occur to you, O my sons, what the common people and ignorant physicians imagine, that cautery which cures a disease will never return, and that you make it a prohibition.
And the matter is not as they suppose, because cautery is only like a medicine which alters the temperament and dries the humors which are the cause of the pains.
Except that cautery is preferred to medicine in the speed of its success, the strength of its action, and the intensity of its power.
And it is possible that the disease may return after a time, according to the temperament of the patient, the strength of his disease, and what may be prepared in his body from the gathering of humors in it, and his neglect of himself in acquiring them from foods and similar causes.
Except that the disease in which cautery is used is a mild disease and in a member with few humors and moistures. Like cauterizing a tooth for pain and the like; it is possible that that pain may not return, and that is in the least.
And as for the common people's saying also that cautery is the last of medicine, it is a true saying, not to what they go to, for they believe that no treatment benefits with medicine or without it after the occurrence of cautery, and the matter is otherwise.
And the meaning of cautery being the last of medicine is only that when we use types of treatment in a disease and those medicines do not work, then we use cautery as the last thing, and it works; from here it occurred that cautery is the last of medicine. Not in the sense to which the common people and many ignorant physicians went.
The ancients mentioned that cautery with gold is better than cautery with iron, and they said that because of the moderation of gold and the nobility of its essence, and they said that the place of cautery does not suppurate; and that is not absolutely the case.
Because I have tried that and found that it only does that in some bodies and not others, and cautery with it is better and superior to iron, as they said, except that if you heat the cautery iron in the fire, made of gold, you will not know when it is heated to the degree you want because of the redness of the gold.
And because cold quickly affects it, and if you increase the heat, it melts in the fire and is poured, and the artisan falls into trouble because of that; therefore, cautery with iron is, for us, quicker and nearer to correctness in practice, God willing.
And I have arranged this chapter on cautery into sections that I have organized from the head to the foot, to make it easier for the student what he wants from it, God willing.
The first chapter.
In cauterizing the head, one cauterization.
This cauterization benefits from the predominance of moisture and coldness on the brain, which are the cause of headache and frequent colds from the head to the area of the eyes and ears, excessive sleep, and toothache and throat pain. And in general, for every disease that occurs from cold, such as paralysis, epilepsy, and catalepsy, and similar diseases.
The image of this cauterization is that you first order the patient to vomit with a purgative medicine that cleanses the head for three or four nights, according to the strength, age, and habit of the patient.
Then you order him to shave his head with a razor, then you seat him before you cross-legged, having placed his hands on his chest.
Then place the base of your palm on the base of his nose between his eyes; where your middle finger ends, mark that spot with ink.
Then heat the olive-shaped cautery, whose image is this.
Expose the bone the amount of a clove or a carob seed; then lift your hand, or if not, replace your hand with the same or another instrument if it cools. Until you see of the bone what I mentioned to you, then take some salt, dissolve it in water, and soak a piece of cotton in it, and place it on the spot, and leave it for three days.
Then apply a cotton swab soaked in butter and leave it on until the scab from the cautery is gone, then treat it with the four-ingredient ointment until it heals, God willing.
And they have said that the more a wound remains open, the more pus it discharges, and that is better and more beneficial.
Some have mentioned cauterizing the skin to the bone, holding the cautery until some of the thickness of the bone is burned, then removing what was burned from the bone afterwards, then treating it.
And others said it is necessary to exaggerate with the cautery until it strongly affects the bone, until it falls from the bone like a small carat or disc, and they claimed that it vents from that spot the vapors of the head, and they leave the wound open for a long time.
Then treat it until it heals. I do not see these two types of cautery at all except in some people and by way of risk, and in my opinion leaving it is better and safer. If it is done, the head weakens when its natural connection is broken, as we have seen in other members.
Especially if the patient's head is naturally weak. The first type of cautery is safer and better in my opinion, and I use it, so use it and be safe, God willing.
Chapter Two.
Also on cauterizing the head.
If a chronic pain occurs in the head and lasts for the patient, and poultices, collyria, snuffs, ointments, and dressings have been used, especially if he has been cauterized with the single cautery that we described and nothing of that has benefited him, then look. If the patient's head is naturally strong and not weak, and he feels intense cold, cauterize him again a little above that. Then cauterize each temple of his head until the thickness of the skin is gone and the amount of bone we described is revealed. And cauterize him in the back of his head in the place known as the hatchet, and lighten your hand in this and do not uncover the bone, for the patient feels a severe pain from it, unlike the pain of all the other cauterizations of the head, and I will mention this cautery in its place.
The cautery with which the temples and the back of the head are cauterized should be gentler than the cautery with which the middle of the head is cauterized, and this is its image.
Chapter Three.
On cauterizing non-chronic migraine.
If pain occurs in a fissure of the head with headache, and the pain extends to the eye, then let the patient vomit with purgative medicines for the head, and use all the treatment that I mentioned in the divisions of diseases. If that does not work, then cauterization is done in two ways. Either cauterization with a sharp, burning medicine or with iron.
As for cauterization with a burning medicine, take one clove of garlic, peel it, and cut its ends from both sides. Then, incise the place of pain in the temple with a wide scalpel until there is a place under the skin that will contain the clove.
Then insert it under the skin until it disappears. Then, bind it tightly with bandages, and leave it for about fifteen hours. Then, unbind it, remove the garlic, and leave the wound for two or three days, then dress it.
Apply cotton soaked in butter until the place suppurates, then treat it with ointment until it heals, God willing.  And if you wish, do this with some of the burning medicines that I mentioned in the eighteenth chapter on burning medicines.
As for cauterization with iron, it is in this manner: Heat the cautery iron, which is depicted as follows:
It is called the nail cautery because its head is like the head of a nail; it has some perforation and a small projection in its middle.
Then place it on the painful area and hold your hand while you rotate the iron little by little; the amount of skin thickness you burn should be about half. And lift your hand so as not to burn the artery underneath and cause bleeding, then soak cotton in salt water and place it on the area and leave it for three days. Then dress the cotton with butter, then treat it with ointment until it heals, God willing.
And if you wish, cauterize this migraine with the knife-like end of the cautery, and be careful not to cut the artery in this chronic migraine in particular.
Chapter Four.
Chronic migraine.
If you treat the migraine with the aforementioned treatments and what we mentioned in the classifications of diseases, and the treatment is not effective, and you see a cause for which the first cauterization with medicine or cauterization with fire is not sufficient. Then you should heat the knife-like cautery until it turns white, after you have marked the painful area with a line half a finger-length or so, and you should leave your hand once while pulling it, until you cut the artery and reach toward the bone.
Except that you should be careful not to touch the moving jaw during chewing, lest you burn the muscle or its motor nerve and cause spasms.
And be cautious and watchful of the bleeding from the artery which you cut, for there is danger in cutting it. Especially for one who is ignorant of what he does and is not an experienced practitioner; and leaving the work is better.
And the treatment of bleeding which occurs from the artery will be mentioned in its proper place in the book, God willing; if you see from the ailment something which this cautery does not overcome.
And you see the patient's body capable, cauterize in the middle of the head as we described, and treat the wound until it heals, God willing.
And if you wish, use the cautery which we mentioned in the chapter on the incision of the artery with the two-bladed cautery, for it is a better and more effective cautery than this.
Chapter Five.
In cauterizing the pains of the ears.
If pain occurs in the ear due to cold, and it is treated with purgatives and all the treatment which we mentioned in the section, and the pain does not go away, then heat the cautery which is called the point, whose image is this.
Then, after heating it, apply it in points around the whole ear, or around both if the pain is in both. And keep the cauterization a little away from the root of the ear, after marking the place with ink.  The cauterization should be about ten points in each ear, or thereabouts. Then treat the areas until they heal, God willing.
Chapter Six.
On cauterizing paralysis.
The paralysis treated by cauterization is that type which arises from phlegm, as I mentioned in the classification of diseases.
One should avoid cauterizing the type which arises from dryness and nerve tension.
When you have treated this type of paralysis with applications, snuffs, and gargles, and your treatment has been ineffective, then the patient should be cauterized with three cauterizations. One at the root of the ear, the second a little below his temple, and the third at the juncture of the lips.
Make your cauterization on the side opposite the diseased side, for the relaxation occurs on the side which appears healthy.
The image of the cauterization is that you cauterize with a cauterization opposite the upper tip of the ear, a little below the horn of the head, and another in the temple, its length being the length of the thumb.
Lower your hand with the cautery until you burn about half the thickness of the skin. This is the image of the cautery; it is a type of scalpel, the image of which has preceded, except that it is a little gentler than it, as you see. The scalpel should have a little more thickness. Then treat the area as previously mentioned until it heals, God willing.
Chapter Seven.
Cauterization of chronic apoplexy.
If the apoplexy becomes chronic and you treat it with what we have mentioned, and your treatment is not effective, and the patient does not have a fever, cauterize four times. One cauterization on each temple, one cauterization in the middle of the head as we have mentioned, and one cauterization at the back of the head as previously described.
The application of the cautery is as previously described.  It may also be cauterized on the stomach, which will be more effective. Then treat as previously described.
Chapter Eight.
On cauterization for forgetfulness.
If it is due to phlegm, the patient should first be given strong purgatives and brain-cleansing pills.
Then his entire head should be shaved and a mustard plaster, as described in the chapter on plasters, should be applied to the back of his head repeatedly, for this is a type of cauterization.
Do this in the same manner as described there. If he is cured by this, well and good; otherwise, perform three cauterizations on the back of his head, arranged in a row from the top of the head to the nape of the neck.
Make the distance between each cauterization the width of a finger. Then treat the cauterization as described before. If you wish to increase [the number of cauterizations] and the patient can tolerate it, cauterize the middle one.
If you wish to increase [the number of cauterizations], cauterize the temples, then treat it until it heals. The cautery should be olive-shaped, as described before.
Chapter Nine.
On cauterizing paralysis and general body relaxation.
It is necessary that you proceed to purify the head with purgatives and what we have mentioned. Then shave the patient's head, then cauterize: one cauterization in the middle of the head, one on each temple, and one on the back of the head.
And three on the vertebrae of the neck. If, in a case of body relaxation, you need more than that, and the patient can tolerate it, and the disease is strong and intractable, then cauterize four times on the vertebrae of his back. And apply the cautery until you burn most of the skin, then lift your hand, then treat him as previously mentioned until he is healed, God willing. The cautery should be olive-shaped.
Chapter Ten.
On cauterizing epilepsy.
Only the epileptic whose epilepsy is caused by phlegm is cauterized.  It is necessary to first purify his brain with major purges and all other treatments which we mentioned in the classification, if the patient is an adult and able to take medicine.
But if he is a child who cannot tolerate medicines, then let him use gargles and masticatories that purify the brain for many days beforehand, along with improving his diet.
Then his head is shaved, then one cauterization is performed in the middle of the head as previously described, and another cauterization at the back of the head. And one cauterization on each temple of his head. If the patient is strong and able to withstand it, then perform the cauterizations which were mentioned for the patient with paralysis and body relaxation, on the vertebrae of the neck and vertebrae of the back. The cautery should be olive-shaped, as previously described.
If the patient is a child, make the cautery gentle in this manner.
Chapter Eleven.
On cauterizing melancholia.
If the cause of melancholia is corrupt humors and thick phlegm, then perform the cauterizations which we mentioned for the paralytic patient.
If the cause of melancholia is an excess tending towards black bile and the patient's body is moist, then purge him so as to cleanse his brain, as was previously explained in the classification.
Then shave the patient's head, then make a tightly-woven linen cake in the shape of a circle, then place it in the middle of his head while the patient sits cross-legged holding it on all sides, then take one pound of old sheep fat.
Then heat it over a fire to a moderate temperature, such that the finger can tolerate it when inserted, then pour it onto the middle of his head within the circle and leave it until it cools. Do this for the patient once a week, along with other good management, until he is cured, God willing.
And if you wish, cauterize it with many small punctures, without holding your hand to the cautery iron but rather by waving it; for this type of cauterization moistens the brain moderately.
Then apply a cotton wool pad soaked in sheep fat or chicken fat to it.
Chapter Twelve.
On cauterizing a cataract in the eye.
If the onset of a cataract in the eye becomes apparent to you through the signs mentioned in the classification, then act quickly and purge the patient of what will purify his head and protect him from all humors, and sweat him in the bath on an empty stomach for several days.
Then shave his head and apply a cautery to the middle of the head, and then two cauteries to the temples if the onset of the cataract is in both eyes, or to one side if it is in one eye.
Then cut with the cautery all the veins and arteries under the skin, and let the cauterizations be lengthwise across the width of the temples, and guard against bleeding.
If you see any bleeding, stop it immediately with any treatment available to you.  We will discuss the wisdom of cauterizing and cutting arteries, and preventing bleeding.
And he may be cauterized at the nape of the neck, under the two bones, with two deep cauterizations.
Chapter Thirteen.
On cauterizing chronic weeping sores.
If the watering of the eye is chronic and persistent, and originates from the veins and arteries on the surface of the head, outside the head, and you are certain that it is caused by a cold, thick, phlegmatic excess, then cauterize it in the manner described at the beginning of the treatment for running eyes. One cauterization in the middle of the head, and two cauterizations on the temples, and two cauterizations at the nape of the neck under the two bones; and if more is needed, cauterize one on each side of the tail of the eye at the edge of the eyebrow with a small cautery iron.
Chapter Fourteen.
On cauterizing the foul smell of the nose.
If you treat it with what we mentioned in the classification and the treatment is not effective, then immediately purge the patient with colocynth for three nights, then shave his head and cauterize the middle area with an olive-shaped cautery iron. Then cauterize with the nail-shaped cautery iron, two cauterizations above the eyebrows, a little below the hair, and be careful of the artery, do not cut it; and this is the image of the nail-shaped cautery iron.
Chapter Fifteen.
On cauterizing the relaxation of the eyelid.
If the eyelid relaxes due to illness or moisture, cauterize the eyelid with one cauterization using this crescent-shaped cautery iron.
And if you wish, cauterize a little above the eyebrows, two cauterizations on each side, and keep a distance from the temples; and the length of each cauterization should be the length of the eyebrow.
And do not exaggerate with the cauterization, but only to the extent that a third of the skin is burnt, and the shape of the cautery iron is like this.
Chapter Sixteen.
On cauterizing the eyelid.
If its margins are inverted inwards so that it pricks the eye, then cauterization is of two types. Either cauterization with fire or cauterization with a burning medicine. As for cauterization with fire, you should order the patient beforehand to leave his eyelashes, if he is one who plucks them, until they grow long and even.
If it pricks him while they are growing, then tie his eyes with a bandage so that they do not move until they grow.  Then, when they have grown and become even, place the patient's head in your lap, and then mark on the eyelid with ink a sign in the shape of an Asian leaf.
The beginning of the mark should be near the margins, then place under the eyelid cotton soaked in egg white or in the saliva of a lizard. Then heat a cautery iron, this is its image.
Then cauterize according to the marked shape little by little, many times, until the surface of the skin, which is in the shape of the Asian leaf, is all burnt, especially its surface. A sign of the success of your work is that you see the eyelid curled and the hair raised from the flesh of the eye.
Then lift your hand and leave it for three days, then apply cotton with butter to it until the scab falls off, then treat it with ointment until it heals, God willing. If some hair returns after a while and the eyelid relaxes,
repeat the cauterization in that place as you did before. If the hair is in the lower eyelid, pull it out until it returns to its natural place and the hair does not prick the eye. As for cauterization with a burning medication, it is that you instruct the patient to leave the margins until they lengthen and become even.
Then make from paper the shape of an Asian leaf, then take from the usual soap and from unslaked lime, of each one a drachm weight or so, and crush them both well together, and do that quickly lest it dry. Then spread some of it on the paper that you made in the shape of the Asian leaf and place it on one or both eyelids, and place under the eye cotton soaked in egg white, and the patient's head in your lap.
And place your index finger on top of the medication and press it slightly, and you move it whenever the patient feels the sting of the medication, for he will feel a burning sensation like fire. As long as he feels the sting, leave the medication and move it with your finger. When the stinging stops, remove the medication and wash the eye with water.
And look, if you see that the eyelid has risen as it rises when cauterized with fire or by cutting; otherwise, apply more of the medication to the place where the medication did not affect and did not blacken, until you complete your work and the eyelid is cauterized.  Then apply cotton with fat to it until the burning subsides.
Then treat it with palm ointment or otherwise until it heals.  And it is necessary for you during the procedure to be extremely careful that nothing of the medication falls into the eye. If the eyelid relaxes after days, and you fear something in the eye, remove the hair.
Then reapply the medication to that relaxed part of the eyelid, specifically as you did initially, then treat it until it heals.  This is an image of the Asian leaf.
Know that people's eyes differ in size, so your cauterization should be according to that. The correct method is not hidden from someone experienced in this craft.
Chapter Seventeen.
On cauterizing the ulcer that appears in the canthus of the eye.
If you treat the fistula with what we mentioned in the classification of diseases and your treatment is not effective, then it should be cauterized in this manner.
Order the patient to place his head in your lap, and let a servant hold his head in your hands firmly so that he does not move or shake his head.
Then, place a cotton ball moistened with egg white or saliva on his eyes, then heat the cautery which is of this form.
It should be hollow like the quill of an eagle's feather on one end, which is the cauterizing end; and if you wish, it can be perforated on the other end, or if you wish, it can be solid like an awl, but this hollow one is better for your work, God willing.
Then, squeeze the fistula if it is open and remove its contents and dry it; or if it is not open, open it and remove its pus. Then, place the cautery on it while it is very hot, holding it with your hand until you reach the bone.
And move your hand slightly away during cauterization from the eye towards the nose, lest your hand should err or the patient should become anxious and the cautery should fall on the conjunctiva and damage it. If you reach the bone on the first cauterization, that is sufficient; otherwise, repeat the cauterization a second time if necessary.
Leave it for three days, then apply a cotton ball with butter and treat it with drying ointment until it heals. If forty days pass and it does not heal, apply a strong, corrosive medicine until the bone is exposed and denude it as will be mentioned in its chapter, God willing.
Another method of cauterizing a fistula, mentioned by some of the ancients:  You aim at the location of the fistula, incise it, then place a thin cone in the incision itself; this is its image.
Pour into it the weight of a dirham of molten lead, and hold your hand firmly on the cone, and the patient should remain completely still, lest the molten lead flow into his eye; and it is necessary to place on the patient's eye cotton soaked in egg white or in water.
For the lead burns the fistula and heals it wonderfully. If the fistula heals with the cauterization and treatment mentioned, that is sufficient; otherwise, it is necessary to use nasal perforation and to return the fistula to the nasal passage, as will be described in its appropriate place.
Chapter Eighteen.
On cauterizing a cleft lip.
A cleft often occurs in the lip, which is called a hair, especially in the lips of boys; it occurs frequently. If you treat this cleft with what we mentioned in the section and the treatment is not effective, then heat a small, knife-like cautery of this shape.
Its cavity should be as thin as a knife. Then apply it, hot and quickly, to the cleft itself, until the cauterization reaches the depth of the cleft; then treat it with cerate until it heals, God willing.
Chapter Nineteen.
On cauterizing a fistula occurring in the mouth.
If a swelling appears at the root of the gums, or in the palate, or at the roots of the molars, then it suppurates and bursts, and from the running pus a fistula results, and you treat it but the treatment is not effective, then you should heat a cautery to the extent that it fits in the fistula.
Then insert it, hot, into the opening of the fistula, and hold your hand until the heated iron reaches its bottom and end.  Do this once or twice, then treat it afterwards with what we have mentioned of treatment, until it heals, God willing.
If the discharge ceases and it heals, well and good; otherwise, it is necessary to examine the place, and remove the diseased bone according to what will come in its chapter, God willing.
Chapter Twenty.
Concerning the cauterization of loose teeth and gums.
If the gums are relaxed from moisture and the teeth move, and you have treated them with medicines without success, then place the patient's head in your lap, and then heat the cautery iron, whose image comes after this, after you have placed the tube on the tooth.
And quickly insert the hot cautery iron into it, and hold your hand for a little while until the patient feels the heat of the fire has reached the root of the tooth, then lift your hand, then return the cautery iron several times as you wish, then let the patient fill his mouth with salt water.
And let him hold it for an hour and then spit it out; for the loose tooth will become firm, and the relaxed gum will tighten, and the foul moisture will dry up.
Chapter twenty-one.
On cauterizing a toothache.
If the toothache is caused by cold, or if there are worms in it, and treatment with medicines has been ineffective, then cauterization is done in two ways: either cauterization with butter, or cauterization with fire.
As for cauterization with butter, you take cow's butter and boil it in an iron spoon or in a shell, then take a piece of cotton, wrap it around the end of a probe, then dip it in the boiled butter and quickly apply it to the aching tooth, and hold it until it cools.
Then repeat this several times until the heat reaches the root of the tooth.  If you wish, you can dip wool or cotton in cold butter and place it on the aching tooth, and place a heated iron on top of it until the heat reaches the bottom of the tooth.
As for cauterization with fire, take a copper or iron tube, somewhat thick in its body so that the heat of the fire does not reach the patient's mouth, then heat the cautery which is shaped as shown and place it on the tooth itself, holding your hand until the cautery cools; do this several times.
Then the pain will go away, either that same day or the next. After the cauterization, the patient should fill his mouth with good butter and hold it for an hour, then spit it out. This is the image of the cautery.
Cauterize with whichever end you wish, and as is possible. This is the image of the tube.
Chapter Twenty-two.
On cauterizing fistulas.
If the fistulas are from phlegm and cold humors and do not respond to ripening medications, and you desire rapid ripening, heat a hollow cautery iron, which is pictured here, perforated at both ends.
So that the smoke exits at the other end during cauterization, place it cautiously on the tumor once and twice if needed, until you reach the depth of the tumor. If the tumor is small, make the cautery iron to the size of the tumor.
Then leave it for three days and apply cotton soaked in butter over it until what was burnt by fire is gone. Then treat it with ointment and tents until it heals, God willing.
Chapter twenty-three.
On cauterization for hoarseness and shortness of breath.
If humors prevail over the windpipe, especially if that is accompanied by coldness of temperament, then the patient should first be purged with laxative medicines, then cauterize with a cautery iron in the hollow of the neck at the root of the throat in the lower place.
Beware of reaching the throat with the cautery and do not burn more than half of the skin, then cauterize another place at the joint of the neck at the end of its last vertebra, profoundly, and let the cautery be nail-shaped in the manner previously described.
Then treat him with what has been mentioned until he is healed, God willing.
Chapter twenty-four.
On cauterizing lung disease and cough.
If the cough and lung disease are due to cold humors, and the patient has no fever or consumption, and the disease is chronic, cauterize two places above the clavicles in the low, soft, empty places, and another place in the middle of the chest between the breasts.
The cautery should be nail-shaped, as previously described. If you wish, let your cauterization be punctate with the cautery called the "nuqta," the image of which has been shown previously in punctate cauterization for earache.  The points should number around thirty.
Then treat him with what has been previously mentioned until he is cured. You may also make a cautery with three branches in this manner, and it hastens the cauterization because you cauterize three places at once. This is the image of the cautery.
Chapter Twenty-Five.
On cauterizing the armpit.
If the head of the humerus is dislocated because of slippery humors, or if it is not fixed when it is reduced from its dislocation so that it becomes habitual, then it is dislocated at the slightest movement, as we have seen. Then the joint should be reduced first. Then the patient lies on his back or on his sound side, and then the skin inside the armpit is raised upwards with the fingers of your left hand if the joint is dislocated inwards.
Then heat the cautery iron with two heads, which is of this form.
Then cauterize the skin with it until it penetrates to the other side. The shape of the cauterization is four cauterizations. It may be cauterized with a cautery iron with three heads; then the shape of the cauterization is six cauterizations, and the heads are of the fineness of a rose thorn.
And this is the image of the cautery iron with three heads.
And this number may be increased by one, so that the cauterizations are eight. Then, apply crushed balls with salt to the cauterization. Then the patient must remain still and not move the limb for a time until it strengthens.  And if the dislocation is upwards, which is rarely the case.
Then cauterize above the shoulder, one good nail-shaped cauterization, or many cauterizations in a dotted pattern.  For the joint will become strong, the moisture will depart, and the patient will heal.
Chapter Twenty-Six.
In cauterizing the stomach.
If cold and excessive moisture occur in the stomach, to the point that it is disordered, and frequent discharges occur there, and it has been treated with various treatments without success, then the patient should lie on his back, extend his legs and arms, and then be cauterized with three cauterizations. One cauterization below the xiphoid process, to the extent of a finger's breadth, with a nail-shaped cautery, and two cauterizations below it on either side of the first cauterization, so that the cauterizations form a triangle, and sufficiently separated so that they do not join if they suppurate.  The depth of the cauterization should be about two-thirds the thickness of the skin. This should be the shape of the cauterizations.
In this manner and to this extent, no more.
And if you wish, cauterize it with one large cauterization in the middle of the stomach, in this manner.
And the cautery with which you perform this single cauterization should be in the shape of a circle, in this manner.
And you may cauterize the stomach by punctation for someone who is apprehensive of this cauterization. This is done by marking points on the stomach to the desired extent with ink, then cauterizing them with a pointed cautery, then treating it with the treatment previously mentioned until it heals.
Chapter Twenty-Seven.
On the cold cauterization of the liver.
If there appears in the liver pain from coldness and dampness, or from a subtle wind, so that it has departed excessively from its natural temperament, and the patient has been treated with what we mentioned in the division, and that has not availed. Then it is necessary that the patient lie on his back, and three cauterizations should be marked with ink in this shape and this exact amount on the liver, below the diaphragm, where the elbow of a person ends.
And after each cauterization, there should be a cauterization the thickness of a finger, and the cauterization should be straight along the body, and do not press down firmly with the cautery.
And let the amount of thickness of skin that you burn be half of it, not more. And let the patient stand on his feet, and if he is not able to stand, then let him lie down with his legs extended and his arms raised. And this is the image of the cautery.
And you may be able to cauterize these cauterizations with the knife-cautery, if you have gentleness and skill in the craft, and take care lest you go too far in the cauterization and burn all the skin, and burn the abdomen and reach the intestines, for the skin there is thin, so know this.
Chapter twenty-eight.
In cauterizing a swelling of the liver.
If an abscess appears in the liver, and you wish to know if that swelling is in the flesh of the liver or in its peritoneum, then if it is in the flesh of the liver, the patient will feel heaviness and pain without sharpness.
And if it is in the peritoneum of the liver, there will be intense sharpness with the pain, and you see that physicians have been exhausted treating it, then it is necessary that the patient lie on his back, then you should mark the swollen area with ink.
Then heat the cautery in the fire; it is the cautery that resembles a hoe, and this is its image. And cauterize it with one cauterization until you burn all the skin and the cauterization reaches the peritoneum, until all the matter comes out, then treat it with the treatment of abscesses until it heals.
And this type of cauterization should not be used except by one whose training in the art of medicine has been long and who has repeatedly experienced these diseases; then he may undertake such work, but leaving it is better in my opinion.
Chapter twenty-nine.
On cauterizing the fistula.
The ancients mentioned cauterization with the roots of rhubarb for a cold fistula in this way: you take one long, dry root of rhubarb, the longest you can find, about the thickness of a finger, then soak it in oil and heat it in the fire. Then you cauterize with one cauterization between the connection of the clavicle and the neck, and two small cauterizations a little below the nape of the neck, inclined towards the side under the chin, and two large cauterizations above the breasts, between the third and fourth ribs.
And two cauterizations also between the fifth and sixth ribs, slightly inclined backwards, and another cauterization in the middle of the chest and another above the stomach, and three cauterizations on the back: one between the shoulder blades and two on the sides of the spine, below the cauterization which is between the shoulder blades.
You should not deepen your hand with the cautery, but it should be a superficial burning of the skin.  Some of the ancients mentioned that some people used a curved iron cautery, which they heated and inserted between the ribs until it reached the tumor itself.
And the pus comes out as we mentioned in liver tumors.  In this method of cauterization there is a great danger; either the patient dies immediately, or a fistula forms in the place which will not heal.
Chapter Thirty.
On cauterizing the spleen.
If you treat a spleen ailment with the treatments mentioned in the classifications and your treatment is not effective, then cauterization is done in three ways, all correct. One is to cauterize it three or four times in a row along the length of the spleen.
In the shape of the liver cauterizations whose form we have described before, and between each cauterization and the next should be the width of a finger or a little more. The nature of the cautery should be as we described in the cauterization of the liver, and you should not deepen your hand in cauterizing, and the patient's position should be lying on his back.
The other way is in the left flank, and you raise the skin opposite the spleen where the patient's left flank ends, and you raise the skin opposite the spleen where the patient's left flank ends, and your raising of the skin should be across the body so that the cauterizations fall along the body.
Then you insert two cauteries very carefully until you pierce the skin on the other side, then you remove the cautery, and the cauterizations will be four. And if you wish, you may cauterize with the other cautery with three points.
Then you treat the cauterized area after leaving it to discharge pus for many days, for this is more effective than all the treatments mentioned previously.
Chapter thirty-one.
On cauterization for dropsy.
Cauterization is only beneficial in particular for ascitic dropsy. If you treat the dropsical patient with the various treatments that we mentioned in the classification and your treatment is not effective, then you should cauterize him with four cauterizations around the navel and one cauterization on the stomach.
Another cauterization on the liver, and a cauterization on the spleen, and two cauterizations on his back between the vertebrae, one opposite his chest and another opposite his stomach. The depth of the cauterization should be approximately the thickness of the skin. Then you leave the cauterization open to discharge pus for a long time.
And do not deprive the patient of treatment after cauterization with what is necessary to combine the two purposes for him, so that healing will hasten to him. The shape of the cautery instrument with which the back is cauterized is nail-shaped, as its image has preceded, and that with which the abdomen is cauterized is olive-shaped.
Chapter thirty-two.
On cauterizing the feet and legs.
If they swell in dropsy and fill with yellow water, then it is necessary to cauterize on the top of the foot in the hollow between the little finger and the ring finger.
And place your hand with the cautery iron and do not bend it, then raise your hand and do not return it at all, for the yellow water will ooze out, and the cautery iron is in this form.
Then cauterize on the legs, two cauterizations on each leg, and the cauterization should be with the sharp end of the cautery iron, and the cauterization should be along the length of the leg, one below the knee and another below that towards the middle of the leg, and on each thigh two cauterizations.
And leave the cauterization open without treatment for a long time, so that the water may ooze out, then treat it with all that we have mentioned.
Chapter Thirty-Three.
Concerning the cauterization of diarrhea.
If the diarrhea is from cold and humors, to the point of weakening the retentive and digestive powers in the stomach and intestines, and this has been treated with various treatments and it has not healed, and you see the patient able to withstand cauterization and strong, then cauterize him with a large cauterization on his stomach. As preceded in the cauterization of the stomach with the circular cautery, and four cauterizations around the navel, gently with the mild nail-shaped cautery, and a cauterization on the cotton above the coccyx, large or two cauterizations.
If you see the humors abundant and the patient able to withstand it, then cauterize him with a cauterization on the pubis and a cauterization on each loin, and perhaps add two small cauterizations on the stomach near the large one, for it is a successful treatment whose benefit does not err, God willing.
Chapter thirty-four.
On cauterizing the hemorrhoids of the anus.
If there are in the anus chronic hemorrhoids, many or one, and they are from thick, cold humors or putrid humors, and they were treated with what we mentioned in the division, and the treatment did not work, then cauterize the patient with three cauterizations on the lower part of the sacrum, a little below the table, triangular.
And a cauterization below the navel by the width of two fingers. And if you estimate that his stomach has become cold and his food does not digest, and you see his face swollen, then cauterize him on the stomach with a large cauterization as mentioned before, and a cauterization on his liver. And another on his spleen with a nail-like cautery, and leave the cautery open for a while, then treat him until he heals, God willing.
Chapter thirty-five.
In cauterizing warts.
After cutting it, if the wart is cut, heat the cautery which resembles a nail, then insert it hot into the same cut wart, and persevere with your hand until the cautery reaches the mouth of the vein from which the blood flows; do this once or twice.
If the warts are numerous, cauterize each one as we have described, then treat them with ointments suitable for them until they heal. And if you cauterize it with a large cautery on cotton, it will be more effective.
Chapter thirty-six.
In cauterizing the fistula which is in the anus and its surroundings.
If the patient does not consent to the incision and the procedure which we described in its place and shrinks from that, then perhaps he will be healed by cauterization. If a fistula occurs and pus and corrupt humors flow from it for a long time, then the first thing you should do is measure it with a thin probe.
Then know the extent of its depth with the probe, then heat the cautery which resembles a needle, then insert it hot into the fistula itself, along the course of the fistula and the extent to which the probe entered, and repeat the cauterization until all those corrupt substances are burned, once or twice or three times, according to your need.
And be careful not to burn a nerve if there is one, or a large vein, and if the fistula leads to the body of the bladder or to the body of the intestine.
Guard against all these places.  You do this only if the fistula is in a fleshy location and you estimate that it is not penetrating. Then treat the area until it heals. If the area is sealed and the flow ceases and remains so for a time, then know that it has completely healed.
And if the flow does not cease, then know that it is penetrating, or that in its depth there is a decayed bone or something similar, which will be mentioned in its place.
Chapter thirty-seven.
On cauterizing the kidneys.
If pain occurs in the kidneys from cold or a strong wind, and the patient's sexual function is thereby diminished, then it should be cauterized on the loins, over the kidneys themselves.  Cauterize each kidney with the nail-shaped cautery previously mentioned.  And perhaps cauterize it a third time in the same place, resulting in three successive cauterizations.  This will be more effective.
Chapter thirty-eight.
On cauterizing the bladder.
If weakness and relaxation occur in the bladder due to cold and dampness, so that the patient cannot retain urine, then cauterize it with one cauterization below the navel, over the bladder where the pubic hair begins, and one cauterization to the right of the navel and another to the left.
The cauterization on each side should be the size of a thumb joint.  And cauterize one or two times in the lower back, if necessary.  The cautery should be nail-shaped, as previously mentioned.
Chapter thirty-nine.
On cauterizing the uterus.
If a substance forms in the uterus due to cold and dampness, preventing conception and corrupting its humors, making menstruation difficult or causing pain during its arrival, then three cauterizations should be made around the navel, as mentioned in the cauterization of the bladder. One or two cauterizations on the cotton in the lower back; the cautery should be nail-shaped.
Chapter forty.
On cauterizing a dislocated hip.
Mucous humors may settle in the hip joint, causing it to dislocate.  The sign is that one leg will appear longer than the other when compared, and an empty space will be found at the site of the dislocation.  Therefore, a semi-circular cauterization should be applied to the affected area of the hip joint itself.
After outlining the joint with ink in a circle so that the joint itself falls in the center of the circle, use the cautery iron whose image is shown in the cauterization of the stomach. If you do not have this cautery iron, perform three cauterizations with a large olive-shaped cautery iron.
Make the cauterization deep enough to reach the entire thickness of the skin, then treat him until he is healed, God willing.
Chapter forty-one.
On cauterizing sciatica.
If pain occurs in the hip joint, and the cause is cold and dampness, and you have treated the patient with what we mentioned in the division, and the treatment has not been effective, and this has lasted for a long time, then it is necessary to evacuate the thick humors from the patient with the foul-smelling bean or the prickly pear bean, or the like.
Then shave it and apply cautery in two ways: either cautery with burning medicines or cautery with fire. Cautery with fire can be done in many ways, one of which is to cauterize the hip joint itself with three triangular cauterizations in this manner.
And make them of a suitable depth. The distance between each cauterization should be the width of a finger. The cautery iron should be olive-shaped.  You may also cauterize one in the middle on the head of the hip itself, making four cauterizations.  If you wish, cauterize it with the circle previously mentioned in cauterizing a dislocated hip, a single cauterization.
So that the circle encompasses the entire hip and burns through the entire thickness of the skin. This is the method of cauterization for sciatica if the pain is confined to the hip itself and does not extend to the thigh and leg.
If it extends to the thigh and leg, cauterize two areas on the thigh where the patient indicates pain, and one above the heel, four finger-widths towards the outer side slightly. The cautery iron should be knife-shaped, and the depth of the cauterization should be only the thickness of the skin.
If he indicates that the pain extends towards the toes, cauterize where he indicates with a pointed cautery iron, three or four times, or more if necessary. If he indicates pain below the knee towards the leg, cauterize there with one knife-shaped cauterization.
And be careful in all your cauterizations not to burn a nerve or a large artery, lest you cause the patient a serious or long-lasting injury.
I have witnessed one and another who were cauterized above the heel, and the cauterization was excessive; the leg became gangrenous, the gangrene reached the foot, the whole foot was perforated and decayed, then diarrhea and death followed. If the pain is in both sides, cauterize both in the same manner.
Some learned physicians have mentioned a cauterization of the hip of this kind:  A cup-shaped iron instrument is made, half a span in diameter, and its mouth is the thickness of a date pit or slightly less, and inside this cup is another cup, and a third.
The distance between each cup is the width of a thumb joint; the cups are open on both sides; their height is about one or two finger joints; and a handle of well-secured iron is attached to them.  This is its image.
Then it is heated in the fire until it glows red and throws off sparks, then it is placed on the hip, the patient leaning on the sound side, and three round cauterizations are performed at once; then it is left for three days, and dressed with butter, and the wound is left open for days.
Then treat it with ointment until it heals.  The author of this book says: We have rarely used this type of cauterization because of its ugliness and the horror of its appearance, and because few are found who can endure it; however, it is a good cauterization for those who endure it and in whom it hits its mark.
As for cauterization with burning drugs, it is done by making two cup-like rings, similar to those through which the pulp of the pomegranate passes, of copper or iron.
Their rims are about two finger joints high, and the distance between them is about the thickness of a finger. They are open at the bottom and open at the top, and they are held together in this manner.
Then lower it onto the hip joint, with the patient lying on his sound side, and firmly hold your hand, then pour between the two circles some strong water, which has been slightly warmed by the fire, and hold it for the time of a sandglass. The patient must endure its stinging and burning, for he will feel a burning like fire.
Until the stinging subsides, then raise your hand with the instrument and wipe the strong water from the entire hip with fresh water. Then leave it for three days, applying butter to it until the blackness of the burn disappears. Leave it for a few days, so that pus may drain from it, for this is more effective.
Then treat it with ointments until it heals. If the pain extends to the thigh or leg, make a mold for it that holds the water, in the same way that you did for the hip. This is the description of the strong water, and I have described it in the chapter on the preparation of medicines.
Take one part of alkali salt and one part of unslaked lime, crush them, and put them in a new pot which has a small hole in its bottom, just big enough for a probe to enter.  Place another glazed pot underneath the bottom of the pot.
Pour fresh water over the alkali and lime to cover them by a finger's breadth, after you have pressed them well with your hand. Leave the pot until the strong water drips into the glazed pot below, then collect all that water and pour it onto more fresh lime and alkali.
Then it will be very strong and sharp, useful in many medical procedures and in cauterizing various members, for it acts exactly like fire.  Among the substances that cauterize the hip are also thapsia, linseed oil, and lime with soap, well mixed.
Galen recounts a story from the ancients about a treatment for hip pain and sciatica, greatly extolling its virtues and claiming that no other treatment is needed and that it cures with a single application.
To the extent that one might enter the bath carried and leave cured.  This is done by taking green verdigris—if green is unavailable, take fresh dry verdigris—and finely grinding it with some fat, then applying it to the hip where the pain is, or to the leg or thigh.
Then bind it on and leave it for three hours, or however long the patient feels the burning subside. Then have him enter the bath; when his body is moist, have him enter the pool. The pain will then cease, and he will be cured, God willing. If not cured, reapply the poultice after ten days.
Then he will be cured, God willing. Know that one should not cauterize with these medications except after purging the body. Dioscorides mentioned that goat hair, when used to cauterize sciatica, is beneficial.
Cauterization is performed in this manner: take wool, soak it in old oil, and place it on the deep place between the thumb of the hand and the forearm, closer to the forearm. Then take dry goat hair.
Heat it in the fire until it becomes a coal, then place it on the wool and leave it until it goes out. Then take another and continue to do this until sensation reaches, via the humerus, to the hip, and the pain subsides, God willing. This type of cauterization is called cauterization with goat hair.
Chapter forty-two.
On cauterizing back pain.
Pain in the back may occur from many causes, either from a fall, a blow, excessive vomiting, and the like. It is caused by the effusion of a cold, moist substance, and cauterization is only applied in this type.
That which is caused by the effusion of a cold substance. After the patient has vomited with hellebore and the like, three rows should be cauterized on his back where the pain is, across the breadth of the table itself, after marking the spot with ink.  In each row, five cauterizations or more, according to the patient's tolerance and strength.
The cauterization should be done with a needle cautery; or if you wish, cauterize three or four times with a medium-sized nail cautery, in this manner.
Chapter seventy-three.
On cauterizing the beginning of a hump.
This ailment frequently affects young children.  Its initial sign in a child is shortness of breath upon standing and movement, and you will find at the end of his spinal vertebrae a bead that has protruded and stands out from the other beads.
If you see this and wish to stop it, cauterize it with a circular cautery iron in this manner. Apply the cautery evenly to each side of the vertebra; and if you wish, cauterize around the vertebra with a pointed cautery iron in two or three rows, letting the points be close to one another.  Then treat the area until it heals as we have mentioned.
And be careful not to use cautery in a hump that is due to a nerve spasm.
Chapter Forty-Four.
On cauterizing gout and joint pains.
If joint pains are due to cold humors that settle in any member of the body, and if the pain occurs in the legs, physicians usually call this gout in particular.
If the gout, which is cold in origin, is treated with the types of treatment that we mentioned in the classification, and the pain does not go away, then cautery will remove it.  This is done by cauterizing around the joints of the legs with many cauterizations after vomiting. The cautery iron should be olive-shaped and medium-sized, in this manner.
And if you need to cauterize the surface of the leg, do so with a pointed cautery iron. If the pain ascends to the knees or to other joints, and this often happens, cauterize each knee three or four times on each side with this same olive-shaped cautery iron.
If you need more cautery than this, cauterize, but do not deepen your cauterization, but rather let it be to the thickness of the skin only. If the pain ascends to the hips or to the back, use what we mentioned regarding cautery in its chapter.
If the pain is only in the hands, cauterize around the forearms as if making two rows. If the pain remains in the fingers, cauterize each knuckle and the metacarpus. If the pain ascends after days to the elbows or shoulders,
cauterize them on each side. The patient should not be without good management and taking medicines, for if he improves his diet and expels phlegm, he will be cured with this cautery, God willing.
Chapter Forty-Five.
On the cauterization of hernias.
If a hernia appears in the groin and some intestine and fat descends to the testicle, and this is recent and beginning, then you should order the patient to abstain from food that day and use laxatives to move the stool from his bowels.
Then he should lie on his back in front of you, and you should tell him to hold himself so that the fat or intestine protrudes, then you should return it with your finger. Then mark with ink below the hernia on the pubic bone a mark resembling a semicircle, its extremities towards the upper part of the body.
Then heat a cautery of this shape.
Until it becomes white and throws off sparks. Then return the intestine or fat to the abdomen. Then a servant should place his hand on the place lest the intestine protrude.  And you have spread the patient's legs apart and placed a cushion under him, and another servant ties his legs.
And another on his chest holds his hands. Then lower the cautery onto the same mark, and your hand with the cautery should be upright and straight, and hold it until it reaches the bone, or repeat it again if it did not reach the bone the first time.
And take care to prevent the protrusion of the intestine while cauterizing, lest you burn it, which would cause the patient either death or a great calamity. And know that if you do not reach the bone with the cautery, your work will not succeed. And the cautery should be gentle for children according to their size, and for adults according to their size.
Then treat the cauterized area after three days with fat until the scab from the fire disappears. Then treat it with other ointments until it heals. And let the patient lie on his back for forty days until the wound is closed.
And you should make his diet during his treatment such that it softens his bowels, lest the intestine protrude during defecation. Then, if he wants to get up after forty days, use a tight bandage and keep it on for another forty days.  And he should reduce exertion, overfilling himself with food and drink, and loud crying.
For if this treatment is used in this way, he will recover completely, God willing. And I will mention the treatment of hernias by incision in its chapter, God willing. As for a hernia that occurs in the rest of the abdomen and is recent, if you wish to prevent it from increasing, cauterize a round mark around it. Let what you burn of the skin be about two-thirds of it, then treat it as we have mentioned, for it will not increase, God willing. And some of the ancients mentioned cauterizing the hernia with a triangular cautery in this manner.
After you mark the hernia with ink, making the horizontal line at the top of the hernia and the other line downwards, and you apply a single nail-like cautery in the middle. The first cautery is easier and better, God willing.
Chapter forty-six.
On cauterizing fistulas.
If pain occurs in some member from a fall or a blow, and that pain persists for a long time and medication does not relieve it, then it should be cauterized with a pointed cautery.  The cauterization of each member should be according to its size, whether large or small, and its weakness or strength.
And if the pain and fistula persist, then if it heals from the first cautery, well and good; otherwise repeat the cautery, because it is the nature of these pains to move from one member to what is near it; therefore it is necessary to follow them with cautery until the patient is cured.
Chapter forty-seven.
On cauterizing leprosy.
As for lepers, they may benefit greatly from cautery, especially the type of leprosy which comes from the corruption of phlegm and black bile.
If you wish to cauterize, then look: if the leprosy is beginning, and you have treated it with what we mentioned in the classification, and it has not subsided, nor stopped, and you fear that corruption will take over the whole temperament of the patient, then cauterize him on the head with five cauterizations. One in the middle of the head, as is usual; the second below it towards the forehead at the end of the hair; two on the temples; and one at the back on the nape of the neck.  And press your hand with the cautery a little, until it affects the bone slightly.
And scales will come off from it, so that the thick vapors may more easily escape from it.  And cauterize it also on the same spleen as before. But if the leprosy has continued on the patient and appeared clearly, then it is necessary to cauterize it with these cauterizations which we have mentioned on the head. And a cauterization on the tip of the nose; two cauterizations on the cheeks; two cauterizations on the vertebrae of the neck; six on the vertebrae of the back; one large one on the coccyx at the base of the spine; another above it in the same place; and two on the hips, one on each hip. And two on the knees, one on each knee; and two on the shoulders; and two on the elbows; and two on the breasts; and cauterize on each joint of the joints of his fingers and toes with one cauterization; and on each heel of his feet and forearms.
And be careful of the nerve which is on the back of the heels, lest you burn them. And it may be cauterized with one cauterization on the pubic bone, and another on the stomach, and another on the liver. And know that the more cauterizations you do, the more useful and effective it will be.
And know that the patient does not feel the pain of the cautery as much as the healthy person, because his body is numb.  And the cauteries should be of varying sizes, according to the limbs and joints, as mentioned before concerning the descriptions of the cauteries.
Then treat the cauterization with finely ground  cress mixed with honey and other treatments until it heals, God willing.
Chapter forty-eight.
Concerning the cauterization of numbness: when a limb becomes numb and is treated with medication, ointments, and bandages, but does not heal, then cauterize the numb limb according to the size of the limb, whether large or small. Let your cauterization be deep, penetrating the thickness of the skin slightly.
Then treat it with ointment until it heals.  And some numbness that occurs in the hand and foot, in the vertebrae of the back at the exit of the nerve that moves that limb, may be cauterized, and the numbness will go away.
And let none undertake this except one who is knowledgeable in the anatomy of the limbs and the exits of the nerves that move the body.
Chapter forty-nine.
Concerning the cauterization of leprosy.
If leprosy is longstanding and no medical remedy is effective, cauterize it slightly, to the depth of the thickness of the skin, until the whiteness disappears and its color changes.
Then treat it with lentil flour, rose oil,  plantain leaves, and pigeon or dove blood; one part of each. Mix everything together, apply it to a cloth, and bind it to the place until it heals.
Chapter fifty.
Concerning the cauterization of cancer.
If the cancer is incipient and you wish to stop it, cauterize it with a circular cautery around it, as it grows. Some scholars have mentioned that a thorough cauterization should be done in its middle, but I do not consider this, because I expect that it will ulcerate, and I have witnessed this many times.
Therefore, it is correct to cauterize around it in a circle, as we said, or with many cauterizations.
Chapter fifty-one.
Concerning the cauterization of hemorrhoids.
If a hemorrhoid occurs in someone, and it is slow to mature, either because of the potency of its cause, or because of the age of the patient if he is old and anemic, or because of time, and you wish to hasten the maturation of the hemorrhoid, cauterize around it with many small cauterizations, punctually.
Then leave it, for it will hasten maturation. If you wish to slow it with cauterization, then take the cautery whose image is this.
And place it in the middle of the hemorrhoid until it penetrates the skin, and let the cauterization be from what is below, so that the flow of pus is easy, then treat it as is appropriate until it heals.
Chapter fifty-two.
On cauterizing the eating sore.
The eating sore is a corruption that spreads in the member and eats it, just as fire eats dry wood. If you see the eating sore in a place that can tolerate cauterization with fire, then take many small and large, nail-shaped cauteries according to what suits that place where the eating sore is.
Then cauterize it from every side until all the corruption is eradicated and nothing of it remains at all, then leave it for three days and apply to the cauterized areas ground sulfur with oil until all the eschar and all the corruption are removed.
Then treat it with ointments that grow flesh. If you see after three days that the flesh grows healthy growth with no corruption in it, otherwise repeat the cauterization on what remains of the corrupted areas.  And the eating sore may be treated with a sharp medicine.
For it acts in place of fire, more quickly beneficial. And I have mentioned its treatment with the sharp medicine in the classification, so take it from there when you need it.
Chapter Fifty-Three.
On the cauterization of inverted and non-inverted nails.
This condition often occurs in the soles of the feet; it is a rough thing that pains the man, and its cauterization is in two ways: either cauterization with fire or cauterization with a sharp liquid.
As for cauterization with fire, it is that you heat a hollow cautery similar to an eagle's feather, made of iron to the extent that it surrounds the nail from every side, and it should be thin-edged; then you lower it, hot, onto the nail, then you turn your hand with the cautery around the nail until the cautery reaches the depth of the nail.
And you leave it three days, it will suppurate with pus, then you dress it with crushed wild bread mixed with salt, and you leave the dressing on it overnight; then it will be extracted from its roots. Then you treat the wound site with a flesh-growing ointment until it heals, if the nails are not inverted.
And it often occurs on the surface of the body, especially in the hands and feet.  Then you should take a tube of copper or iron or eagle's feather and lower it onto the nail or wart, then you pour a small amount of sharp liquid into the tube.
And you hold your hand while you turn it, with a slight twitching of your hand, so that the edge of the tube affects the root of the nail, and the sharp liquid finds the way to penetrate to the root of the nail. And the patient endures a little the stinging of the sharp liquid for a while.
Then you leave it, and the nail will be extracted by its roots.  You do this one by one until you have treated all of them in the body; then you treat their locations after they are extracted with ointments that grow flesh.
Chapter fifty-four.
On cauterizing the falling sickness.
If someone suffering from the falling sickness is afflicted by cold in the nerves, or by a quartan fever or something else, then it is necessary to cauterize him with four or five cauterizations on the vertebrae of the back, between each vertebra a cauterization, and a cauterization on his chest. And on his stomach a cauterization with the olive cautery, for the falling sickness is calmed and the cold illness is hastened to ripen.
Chapter fifty-five.
On cauterizing pustules occurring in the body.
Ugly pustules may erupt in the body, being caused by cold, thick, and corrupt materials.  At their first appearance, it is necessary to cauterize each pustule delicately with a cautery-iron whose end has been heated in the fire, or with the long root of the ziraund, or with a lenticular cautery.
And boils may be cauterized at their first eruption in this manner, so that the active cause does not increase, and the ailment disappears, except that this should be done after the patient has been bled.
Chapter fifty-six.
On cauterizing hemorrhage occurring from a severed artery.
Often, bleeding occurs from a severed artery during a wound inflicted from the outside, or when an abscess is incised, or a member is cauterized, and so forth, making it difficult to stop.
If this happens to someone, quickly place your index finger on the mouth of the artery and press it firmly until the blood is contained under your finger and nothing comes out.  Then place several small and large olive-shaped cauteries in the fire and heat them until they are very hot.
Then take one, either small or large, depending on the wound and the location where the artery is severed.  Place the cautery on the same vessel after quickly removing your finger, and hold the cautery until the bleeding stops.
If, upon removing your finger from the mouth of the artery, the bleeding resumes and the cautery is extinguished, quickly take another cautery from those prepared in the fire, and continue to do this, one after another, until the bleeding stops.
Be careful not to burn a nerve that is there, lest you cause the patient another affliction.  Know that if an artery bleeds, it cannot be stopped, especially if it is a large artery, except in one of four ways: either by cauterization, as we have said; or by amputation, if it has not already been severed; for if it is severed, its ends contract and the bleeding stops; or by tightly tying it with threads; or by applying medications that stop the bleeding, and tightly binding it with bandages.
And as for anyone who attempts to stop it with a ligature, or by tightening with cloths, or applying cauterizing agents, and so forth, it will not be stopped at all except rarely.  If this happens to someone and a physician or medication is not available, he should immediately place his index finger on the mouth of the wound itself, as we described.
He should press it very firmly until the blood is contained and flows from above the wound and onto the artery; and the finger should not be removed, always applying very cold water to it until the blood coagulates, thickens, and stops. During this time, consider what further cauterization or medication is needed.
Chapter Two.
Concerning Incisions, Punctures, Bloodletting, Wounds, and the Like.
Khalaf said: In the first chapter we mentioned every illness for which cauterization with fire and burning medication is suitable, its causes, its reasons, its instruments, and the forms of cauteries; and I made that into sections from the head to the foot.
And I follow in this chapter the same method, to make it easier for the student to obtain what he seeks.
Before I begin that, you should know, my sons, that this chapter contains more subtleties than the first chapter on cauterization.
And because of that, caution should be greater in it, for the work in this chapter often involves the evacuation of blood upon which life depends, when opening a vein or making an incision on a tumor, or puncturing an abscess, or treating a wound, or removing an arrow, or incising a stone, and the like; all of these are accompanied by danger and fear, and death frequently results.
And I advise you against undertaking what is doubtful to you, for in this craft various kinds of people will come to you with various kinds of illnesses; and among them will be some who are weary of their illness and to whom death is insignificant.
Because of the severity of his illness and the length of his affliction, and because the illness shows signs of death, and because some will give you their money and enrich you with it in hope of health, and their illness is fatal, you should absolutely not assist anyone who comes to you with these characteristics.
Let your caution be greater than your desire and eagerness, and do not undertake anything of this sort unless after certain knowledge that assures you of a favorable outcome. And in all the treatment of your patients, use foresight and warning of what leads to safety.
For in that you will have help in acquiring praise, glory, mention, and thanks. May God inspire you, my sons, with His guidance, and may He not deprive you of correctness and success, for that is in His hand; there is no god but He.
And I have arranged the chapters of this section in the same order as the previous section on cautery, from head to foot, so that what you seek from it may be easier for you, God willing.
Chapter One.
On the treatment of the water which collects in the heads of infants.
This ailment frequently occurs to infants at birth if the midwife presses the infant's head without gentleness, and it may also occur from a hidden cause which is not known.
And I have not seen this ailment in anyone other than infants, and all those whom I have seen afflicted with it have died quickly; therefore I considered abandoning treatment of it.  And I saw an infant whose head was filled with water and whose head grew larger every day. Until the infant could not sit up by himself because of the size of his head, and the moisture increased until he perished.
And this moisture either collects between the skin and the bone, or it collects under the bone on the dura mater.  The procedure in this case: if the moisture is between the skin and bone, and the swelling is small, then it is necessary to make one transverse incision in the middle of the head, and the length of the incision should be about two fingerbreadths, so that the moisture flows out.  This is the image of the scalpel.
If the moisture is greater and the swelling is larger, then make two intersecting incisions in this manner:
And if the moisture is under the bone—and its sign is that you see the sutures of the head open on every side, and the water recedes if you press it inward with your hand, and this is not hidden from you—then it is necessary to make three incisions in the middle of the head in this manner.
After the incision, all the moisture comes out, then you tighten the incisions with rags and bandages. Then you bathe it from above with wine and oil until the fifth day, then you untie the bandage and treat the wound with lint and ointments. Do not neglect to bind the head moderately, and feed the patient with all dry food, little moisture.
Until the member strengthens and heals. Another description of the incision is that you look where the bone of the swelling and the collection of water appear, for it may be in the back of the head more, or in its front, or on the right, or on the left.
Then you aim the incision where the swelling and the fullness of water appear to you, and you incise it as much as you can, and be careful not to cut an artery, lest bleeding occur and the patient die from that bleeding, along with the evacuation of the moisture.
Chapter Two.
Cutting the two arteries behind the ears, known as the  hassisayn.
When someone experiences severe colds in the eyes or chest, and this persists and medication does not work, then the best treatment is to cut these two arteries.
So if you want to cut them, you should shave the patient's head with a razor, then rub the area with a rough cloth to reveal the artery, then tighten the patient's neck with the excess of his cloth, then look where the pulse beats and their locations, the two low-lying places behind the ears, and they rarely hide except in some people.
Then mark them with ink, then cut them with a sharp scalpel, cutting to the bone. This should be done across the head.  If you wish, insert the scalpel under the artery and cut upwards; the length of the cut should be about two fingers breadth.
If the artery is severed, the blood will come out in a pulsating flow, leaping forward repeatedly. If the artery is not palpable, you should measure three fingers breadth from the ear, then mark it with ink and incise to the bone.  What should be...
...sent from the blood six ounces on average, and perhaps more or less, all this depending on the strength of the patient and the fullness of his arteries. Then look at the wound; if there remains anything of the peritoneum on the bone, cut it away.
Lest a hot swelling appear. Then bind the wound with a linen thread, and treat it with ointments until it heals.
Chapter Three.
In the ligation of the two arteries in the temples.
If a person suffers from chronic migraine or acute attacks caused by sharp humors and heat in the muscles of the temples, or severe chronic headache and the like, and he has been treated with various medical treatments without success, then we have tried in these diseases the ligation of the arteries of the temples, or their cauterization as we have described.
And the method of ligating them is that the patient's hair in the temples should be shaved, and the artery apparent in the temple should be sought, for it is apparent to you from its pulsation, and it is rarely hidden except in a few people.
Or, in case of intense cold, if it is hidden from you, let the patient tighten his neck with the excess of his garment, then you rub the area with a cloth or compress the area with hot water until the artery appears clearly and obviously. Then take the scalpel, whose image is this. Then you incise the skin gently with it until you reach the artery, then you place a hook in it and pull it upwards until you bring it out of the skin and free it from the membranes underneath it on every side; and if the artery is thin, then twist it with the end of the hook. Then cut off a portion of it to the extent that its ends separate and contract, and do not cause bleeding, for if it is not severed and cut, the blood will not clot at all; then the blood is evacuated from six ounces to three.
If the artery is large, then it is necessary to tie it in two places with strong doubled thread; and let the thread be either of silk or of lute strings, lest corruption quickly reach it before the wound heals and bleeding occurs.
Then cut the portion between the ligatures; do this at that time or after another time; and if you wish to cauterize it with a knife-like cautery to the bone until its ends are severed, this will suffice for this same work or be better, as we have said.
Unless the patient has a fever or a hot temperament, because cauterization is something that helps in destroying humors and will thus be more beneficial. After tying off the arteries, the area should be packed with old cotton and firm bandages applied. After the healing, it is treated with drying medicines that promote flesh growth and with bandaging until it heals, God willing.
If bleeding from the artery occurs during your work, immediately cut it, either by cauterization or by filling the area with vitriol and compressing with your hand until the bleeding stops. If you do not have any of that, place your finger there until the blood clots.
And wash the area with very cold water until the sharpness subsides, and bind it as necessary.  Easier and simpler than ligating the artery is to cauterize the vein with this double-bladed cautery after marking the two locations with ink.
Apply it very hot until it reaches the bone and the vein is severed in two places so that its ends are separated, for it will not reunite with this cauterization at all. This is the image of the cautery.
The blades should be sharp, resembling small lancets, but much less sharp than a scalpel; for if they are as sharp as a scalpel, they cool more quickly and the flesh is not severed rapidly. If they have some thickness, the heat of the fire will remain in them.
And the flesh is severed quickly. This method is better than any other, and is lighter and easier. Let the distance between the blades be the width of a finger.
Chapter Four.
In the treatment of a constant flow of hot tears into the eyes.
If the tears are constant and their flow is from the veins on the outside of the skull, and nothing from medical treatment with drugs has been beneficial, and you see the patient's face is red. And he feels a crawling sensation on his forehead like the crawling of ants, and his eyes are sunken and moist, their rims eroded and his eyelids clinging together from the severity of the tears.  Therefore, those who first treated this condition resorted to this procedure, which they call treatment with the sword. It is to instruct the patient to shave the hair from his forehead.
Then make three parallel incisions in the forehead along its length.  The length of each incision should be about two fingers' breadth. One incision is parallel to the length of the nose in the middle of the forehead, the second a little distance from the movement of the muscle in the temple, and the third on the other side.
And be careful not to cut the arteries on either side, and keep your hand away from the joining of the jaws. Let the distance between each incision be the width of three closed fingers.  Have ready pieces of prepared sponge or many dry cloths to wipe away the blood.
Then insert the double-edged scalpel, whose image is this. From the incision near the temple to the middle incision, and with it flay away all the skin between the incisions, together with the membrane on the bone. Then do the same from the middle incision to the third incision. Then remove this scalpel. Then insert into the first incision another instrument called a scalpel, sharp on one side and smooth, not sharp, on the other; and this is its image:.
Place its sharp side upwards, towards the flesh attached to the skin, and its smooth side towards the bone; and push it until it reaches the middle incision, cutting through all the vessels which descend from the head to the eyes without the cut reaching the surface of the skin.
Then do the same in the middle incision to the other incision. After a moderate amount of blood has flowed, squeeze the places of the clotted blood. Then place in each incision a pledget of cotton, and place over it a compress moistened with a drink and oil, or vinegar and oil.
Lest a hot inflammation occur. On the third day, remove the bandage and use plenty of irrigation with lukewarm water. Then treat it with basilicon ointment with rose oil and whatever else you treat wounds with, until it heals, God willing.
Chapter Five.
On the treatment of tears and discharges to the eyes from inside the head.
When someone experiences frequent, sharp, severe, persistent discharges, and you see their eyes weak, small, their vision weakened, and their eyelids ulcerated, with the eyelashes falling out. And there is severe, painful pain deep in the head and continuous sneezing. Know from these symptoms that those materials and discharges come from many deep vessels. The best treatment is this: order the patient to have his forehead shaved, then make one incision in the middle of the forehead.
And there is severe, painful pain deep in the head and continuous sneezing. Know from these symptoms that those materials and discharges come from many deep vessels. The best treatment is this: order the patient to have his forehead shaved, then make one incision in the middle of the forehead. Or a little higher transversely, beginning the incision from the left temple to the right temple.  The incision should be to the bone, and keep your hand away from the temporal muscles that move when chewing. Then, when the bone is exposed and all the blood is dried with a sponge,
separate the edges of the incision with old cotton or linen threads. Then bind it from above with pledgets, and moisten the pledgets with a potion and oil, lest a hot swelling occur. When you remove them and see that the hot swelling has subsided, you should scrape the bone until the growth of flesh begins.
Then treat it with a drying preparation that makes flesh grow, such as taking two parts of wheat flour and four parts of colophony, preparing an ointment from them, and using it for flesh growth in such wounds.
Chapter Six.
In the treatment of what falls into the ear.
Whatever falls into the ear is one of four types: either a metallic stone, or something like stone such as iron and glass; or a plant seed such as chickpeas and kernels and the like; or a flowing thing such as water, vinegar, and the like.
Or an animal. When a stone or a kind of stone falls into the ear, which does not grow in the ear, then expose the ear to the sun.  If you see the stone, then instill some violet oil or cerate into it, then try to remove it by moving the head or sneezing with a sternutatory. And close the nostrils when sneezing comes, after you have placed a ring of rags or wool around the ear and extend the ear upwards. Often it comes out with this treatment. If it does not come out otherwise, then try to remove it with a gentle probe, whose image is this.
If it comes out with the probe, otherwise try to remove it with a gentle, slightly curved, blind probe. If it does not come out with that, then make a tube of copper and insert the end of the tube into the hole of the ear gently.
Seal what is around the tube with pitch softened with oil, lest there be a way for the wind other than the tube. Then draw it with your breath strongly, and often it comes out with that. If it does not come out with what we have described, then take a little bit of gum arabic or of prepared gum with which birds are caught, and place it on the end of the probe.
After you have wrapped cotton tightly around it, then insert it into the hole of the ear gently after you have dried the ear of moisture. If it does not come out by all that we have described, then hasten to incision before hot swelling or spasm occurs.
The description of the incision is that you first bleed the patient in the cephalic vein and take out blood from him according to his strength. Then seat the patient before you, and turn his ear upwards, and make a small incision at the base of the ear near its lobe, in the lower part of it.
And the incision should be crescent-shaped until you reach the stone, then remove it with whatever instruments you can. Then suture the incision immediately and treat it until it heals.
And if the thing that has fallen into the ear is one of the seeds that grow and swell, then try to remove it with what we have mentioned.  If it does not respond to removal, then take a thin, delicate scalpel of this shape.
And try with it to cut that type of seed that has fallen into the ear. But you do this only if you are certain that that seed has become moistened by the vapor of the ear until it becomes many small pieces, then remove them with the blind probe or with a soft sponge or by suction.
As we mentioned, then it is easy to remove it. As for water entering the ear, the patient should first use sneezing with a snuff, having filled his ear with some old cotton while lying on the ear in which the water is. If it comes out with that,
otherwise, take many small, smooth, flat stones the length of the fingers, warm them slightly by the fire, and let the patient insert one into the hole of his ear. He should then hop on one foot on that side and strike the stone in the ear with another stone.
He should continue doing this, stone by stone, until all the water comes out.  The water may also be removed by taking a piece of papyrus or a feather, inserting one end into the ear, and applying fire to the other end until most of it burns, then repeating with another feather.
Do this repeatedly until all the water comes out or draw it out with the tube as previously mentioned for the stone. As for removing an animal that has entered, see if it is small, like a flea, etc., treat it as mentioned in the classification, but...
If its body is large and perceptible to the touch, try removing it with lint and hooks; this is easier than anything else that gets into the ear. As for removing worms that develop in the ear, if you treat it with what we mentioned in the classification in the chapter on instillations and your treatment is not effective,
you should look into the ear in the sun. If you see anything of the worms, remove them with lint or fine hooks. If you do not see anything, take a tube of this shape.
narrow at the bottom and wide at the top, and insert the thin end into the ear as far as the patient can tolerate. Then suck strongly with it; do this repeatedly until all the worms come out. If they do not come out, seal around the tube with wax, as I mentioned to you for the stone.
If they do not come out with what we mentioned, use the instillations that I have mentioned, which the ancients have tried in killing worms; you will find this in the chapter on instillations.  Pouring the ointments and medicines into the ear is done with this instrument, and this is its shape:
As you see, make it of silver or copper, narrow at the bottom with a small hole, and wide at the top. If you wish, the nozzle inside the tube can be of tightly fitting copper; if you wish, take a reed and wrap cotton tightly around its end.
Then pour the ointment or juice or whatever medicine you want into the tube while it is in the ear, then insert the reed with the cotton from above and squeeze it moderately with your hand until the ointment is propelled into the interior of the ear and is felt.
The patient feels it going in.  Whatever you pour into the ear should be warmed a little in the fire.  Be careful that what is instilled is neither very cold nor very hot, for the ear cannot tolerate that.
Chapter Seven.
On the treatment of accidental blockage of the ear.
Some children may be born with their ear canals not perforated.
It may also happen that some people experience a blockage in the ear canal due to a wound or growing flesh; and this blockage may be deep within the ear canal, invisible to the eye.
It may also appear slightly outside the opening and be visible to the eye. That which appears deep within the ear and is not visible to the eye is, in most cases, difficult to cure; but that which is visible to the eye should have the patient's ear exposed to the sun. And examine it; if you see the blockage outwardly, open it with a delicate scalpel, which is of this shape:
Its tip should be slightly broad, its edge limited, and the rest of the scalpel smooth on both sides, lest it injure the ear. If the blockage is due to flesh that has grown in the ear canal, grasp it with a delicate hook and cut it gently and carefully until all the flesh is removed.
If the blockage is deep within the ear, take a smooth, delicate probe, warm it slightly in the fire, and insert it into the ear canal. If you feel the blockage, and the patient feels a heaviness in hearing, remove it gently.
Take care not to injure the membrane of the ear. Then insert into the ear a wick to fit the size of the opening, having coated it with Egyptian ointment. Do this for several days until you are sure the wound will not close up again, or take a wick, moisten it in water, and sprinkle powdered vitriol on it.
Use this. If you see that the ear has swollen with a hot inflammation, you should remove the wick and replace it with another wick coated with an ointment made with rose oil until the hot swelling subsides; then treat it until it heals.
If bleeding occurs, dip a sponge or cloth in cold water and apply it to the ear. Use the other treatments for stopping bleeding mentioned in the chapter on haemostatics.
Chapter Eight.
On the treatment of warts which appear on the eyelids.
These warts which appear on the eyelids may be moist or dry.  You should grasp them with forceps or a hook and cut them from their roots with a scalpel; then apply powdered verdigris to the area.
If it bleeds, cauterize it with a gentle lentil-shaped cautery.  Cauterization is best after cutting.  They often return if anything of their roots remains; but if cauterized with fire, those roots are burned and it does not return.
Chapter Nine.
On the treatment of the cold affecting the eyelids.
Something resembling a cold in its intensity and hardness often occurs in the eyelids.
Therefore it is called a cold, which is a gathering of thick moisture in the upper and lower eyelids.  The treatment is to look: if the cold swelling is prominent on the surface of the eyelid and moves to every direction, then the matter is easy; make a transverse incision upon it.
Then gently peel it from every side until it is released, then suspend it with a hook and cut it. If you are not able to cut it except after it has penetrated the eyelid by the cut, this will not harm the patient. If the incision is large, close it with stitches and treat it until it heals.
And if it is small, there is no harm from it, for the ointment will heal and join it. If the cold swelling is inclined towards the inside of the eyelid, towards the inner surface, then turn the eyelid back and suspend the cold swelling with a hook without needing an incision, and excise it from every side.
If it penetrates the eyelid with the cut, that will not harm. Then wash the eye after cutting the cold swelling with salt water and treat the area with that which heals until the patient recovers.
Chapter Ten.
In the treatment of the sharnāq which appears in the eyelid.
Sharnāq is a fleshy growth which forms in the layers of the upper eyelid.  This most often occurs in children, and it weighs down their eyes, causing them to suffer from colds in the mornings, and they are unable to look at the sunlight. Because the tears flow quickly to them.
Therefore you see them always leaning on their faces, and on them they sleep, and their eyelids under the eyebrows are moist, and a swelling has arisen over them, and the sharnāq is clearly visible.  When you press the area with your fingers, you feel the sharnāq between them. The method of treatment is that the patient should place his head in your lap.
Then you take a linen cloth and prepare a wick from it, and you make a circle from that wick, the size of which encompasses the sharnāq from every side, then you place it on it and press with your fingers from every side to gather the sharnāq in the middle of the circle.
Then you make an incision in the middle of that moisture with a lancet, a transverse incision, and the incision should not be larger than the incision which is made in bloodletting, and as for the depth, you should incise all the skin until you reach the sharnāq.
Then, in most cases, the sharnāq protrudes from the incision in the form of a piece of white fat.  You draw it out with a cloth that you have wrapped between your fingers, while you turn your hand to the right and left until it heals. And beware of increasing the incision, lest the lancet reach the eye and harm it.
If the sharnāq does not appear to you in the first incision, then you should increase the incision a little gently until the sharnāq appears, then you draw it out as we said, then you dip cloths in vinegar and water and place them on the area and bandage it tightly. And some people crush salt.
And they place it inside the incision so that what remains of that moisture dissolves, then you treat it until it heals. If a hot swelling occurs in the area, then treat it with soothing poultices until it heals.
Chapter Eleven.
On types of eye injuries.
If superfluous membranes grow on the eyelid, contrary to the natural course, under the natural membranes and eyelashes, then they harm the eye and cause various diseases, such as constant tearing, relaxation of the eyelids, whiteness, and thickening, until this becomes a cause of blindness.
Eye injuries are of four types: either cauterization with fire, or with a caustic medicine as previously mentioned in the chapter on cauterization, or the injury may be treated by cutting and suturing, or with a reed, as I will describe.
You should place the patient's head in your lap, then turn the eyelid with your left hand. If it does not turn, insert a needle with a thread from beneath the eyelid and pass the needle with the thread from above, close to the hair itself, and pull the thread upwards with the eyelid.
Turn it with a probe, then incise the inside of the eyelid, avoiding the superfluous hair, with a sharp scalpel from the larger canthus to the smaller canthus. Then remove the thread and place a small pledget of cotton or cloth under the eyelid. Then mark the eyelid with ink.
Like the shape of a laurel leaf, except that the shape should be according to how much you want to raise the eyelid, because this varies among people. Some may need a portion of the eyelid to be cut according to how much the eyelid is relaxed.
Some may need less to be cut; all of this depends on the relaxation of the eyelid. Then incise with the scalpel along the two lines that you marked, beginning from the larger canthus to the smaller canthus, and each incision should be near the natural hair, about the thickness of a probe.
Then insert the hook into one corner of the skin and remove it all. Then join the edges with stitches using a fine wool needle and thread. Wipe away the blood and stick the remaining threads to the eyebrows with some adhesive substance.
If you wish to do so, otherwise it does not matter. Then leave the stitches and threads for about three or four days, then treat it. If you wish, you can leave the wound without stitching and treat it with things that dry and constrict, for the eyelid will rise when the wound is closed and healed; stitching is better.
This method of blepharoplasty was mentioned by the ancients, although it is burdensome for the patient. It is a good procedure and there is no danger in it. Another method of blepharoplasty is to mark on the eyelid a shape like a laurel leaf, as we described. Then raise the eyelid with three hooks, either separate or grouped in this manner:
Then cut away the excess eyelid with small scissors in this manner, cutting moderately.
If you cannot hold the hooks and they do not stay in place, take a needle with thread and insert it into the middle of the shape, and insert another thread near the larger canthus and a third thread near the smaller canthus, and gather the threads together with your fingers moderately, then lift it with a moderate lift.
Lift the marked skin entirely as we described, then bring the edges of the wound together with sutures and treat it until it heals. If hot swelling appears when you cut or incise, then calm that swelling with qirūtī and similar soothing ointments.
It may also happen that the lower eyelid inverts its edges, so you should use what we mentioned of cutting, suturing, cauterization with fire, and with strong medication; cauterization with fire or with strong medication is more effective and gentler on the patient than cutting and suturing, and you should do the cutting and suturing in both.
Cauterization with a reed is done in this manner: you invert the eyelid and make an incision on the inside as described, then you make two thin reeds or pieces of wood, their length equal to the length of the eyelid and their width less than the width of a scalpel.
And you carve notches at their ends on both sides where the threads will be attached, then gently bring them together on what remains of the eyelid and tightly pull the reeds from both sides and leave it for days; the tightly drawn skin will die, blacken, and decay.
Until it falls off by itself; if it is slow, cut it with scissors, then treat it until it heals.  When it unites, the eyelid will be raised and the edges of the eyelids will not be inverted. This is an image of the two reeds; make them in this shape and this exact size in length and width.
Chapter Twelve.
On raising ingrown eyelashes from the eye with a needle.
If it is one or two hairs, the procedure is to take a thin needle, thread it with a smooth, fine silk thread, then bring the two ends together and tie them in a very gentle knot, and let the length of the thread be about a span.
Then attach another fine thread to the needle, shorter than the first, and tie its ends if you wish. Then have the patient put his head in your lap, and let it be near the sun so that the work may be clearly seen, for it is delicate work. Then insert the needle with the thread into the root of the ingrown hair.
And quickly pass it through the eyelid until you bring it out above the natural hair. Then pull the thread upwards on the needle and draw into the needle that hair, whether it is one, two, or three, but no more.
Then pull it with your hand until you extract the hair with the needle from the eyelid along with the natural hair. If you pull the needle and the hair does not come out with it, pull the needle downwards with the thread that you had attached to it until you bring the needle out from the upper opening.
Then return the hair to it and pull both until it rises to the upper opening and you see it clearly. Then remove the needle and thread, and pull and bind the eyelid, leaving it bound for two or three days until the hair settles in place and flesh grows over it.
If the hair is short, either add to it a long hair from the natural hair so that it rises with it, or leave it until it grows longer, then raise it.
Chapter Thirteen.
In the treatment of the stye which occurs in the upper eyelid.
The stye that affects this area is called arnabiyya.  This stye is either natural or accidental. The accidental one results from the healing of a wound, incision, cauterization, or the like.
The method of treatment is to incise that adhesion and separate its edges, then place a linen wick between them and tie it until it heals.  It is not advisable to use things that dry and constrict in its treatment.
For if you do that, the stye will return more severely than it was.  Rather, use things that relax, such as fenugreek and a poultice with water in which mallow and flaxseed have been boiled, and a diachylon ointment dissolved with some fat, then apply it to the wick and treat it with this.
The key to its treatment is to try by every means to prevent it from adhering in its original state. This treatment that we have mentioned is only a partial repair of the stye, not a restoration of the area to its original appearance.
Chapter Fourteen.
On the treatment of a stye which forms in the lower eyelid.
This stye which forms in the lower eyelid is what is truly called a stye. It can be natural or accidental.  The accidental type results from a wound, incision, cauterization, or something similar.
The method of treatment is to take a needle with doubled thread and insert it into the flesh, passing it from the left canthus to the right canthus, so that the thread is at both ends of the flesh. Then stretch the flesh upwards with the needle and cut it with a wide scalpel.
If the eyelid returns to its proper shape, that is sufficient. Otherwise, take a probe and place it on the site of the incision, using it to turn the eyelid inside out. Then make two incisions on the inner side of the eyelid. The ends of these incisions should meet at the corners of the previous cut, forming an angle. Until, when they meet, their shape resembles this shape:
This is the Greek letter lambda. Then remove that flesh, so that the sharp edge is below what lies next to the eyelid.  Then bring together the separated parts with two stitches, sewing it with a wool thread. Then treat it with the emollient and astringent medications previously mentioned until it heals.
If the fistula resulted from an incision, suture, or cauterization, it is necessary to make a simple incision without affecting the eyelashes, as previously described, then separate the lips with a probe, as mentioned.
In short, in treating a fistula, whether above or below, you should proceed according to the nature of the fistula, for they vary greatly in appearance.  The skilled surgeon devises a solution by whatever means possible.
Until the shape returns to its natural form or approximates it.  The disease itself, in most cases, will indicate the appropriate treatment and instrument.
Chapter Fifteen.
On the adhesion of the eyelid to the conjunctiva or cornea.
This adhesion may occur in many people, whereby the upper eyelid adheres to the white of the eye, preventing easy movement and hindering its natural functions.  It is necessary to insert the tip of a probe under the eyelid.
And lift it upwards or stretch it with a hook, then cut the adhesion with a delicate scalpel, not sharp like the cutting scalpels, but rather somewhat blunt, lest the patient be disturbed during the procedure and the scalpel slips, injuring the eye with its sharpness.  Your cutting should be as if you are peeling off that adhesion.
Wait until the eyelid returns to its natural state and the adhesion is completely healed, then pour saline water into the eye to wash it, or instill a solution of vitriol in water, then separate the eyelid from the eye with a linen wick.
And place on top of the eye wool moistened with egg white, and after the third day use the astringent eye drops until it heals.
Chapter Sixteen.
On cutting the pterygium and the fleshy excrescences.
The pterygium is of two kinds: either nervous, resembling a thin, hard membrane; or non-nervous, resembling a thick, white moisture; if touched with iron or attempted to be removed with a hook, it breaks up.
And a hook does not become fixed in it. Both kinds begin from the greater canthus, gradually extending until they cover the pupil and obstruct the light and the movement of the eye. The method of cutting them is that the patient should place his head in your lap.
Then he opens his eyes, and you raise the eyelid with your hand; then you seize the pterygium with a slightly curved hook and stretch it upwards; then you take a needle and thread it with a horsehair or oxhair and strong thread, and bend the point of the needle slightly and pierce it into the middle of the pterygium.
Then you pass it through with the needle and tie the pterygium with the thread, and stretch it upwards, and dissect with the hair the side of the pterygium next to the pupil, as if you were spreading it with the hair to its end; then you cut the remainder at the root of the canthus with a fine scalpel or small scissors, and leave the natural flesh of the canthus.
So that there may not result from its cutting a constant flow of tears.  The pterygium may be stretched with the hook alone, or with the thread as we have said, then the smooth scalpel dissects the end, the picture of which is this:
And be careful that the scalpel does not touch the cornea, lest it cause a wound and injure the pupil. Then, after the cutting, throw into the eye some powdered salt or  zink sulphate powder and leave it until the next day, then treat it as is appropriate until it heals.
If the pterygium is not vascular and you are unable to insert a needle into it or to fix a hook in it, this type of pterygium is often treated with medicine and heals as described in the classification.  If you wish to cut it, open the patient's eye.
Take a fine, smooth scalpel with a weak edge, in this manner: And dissect the pterygium from above gently with it. If you see that it is loosening and breaking up and the dissection has affected it, then instill into the eye immediately zinc sulphate powder or red sulphate powder or powdered salt and bandage the eye until the next day.
Then resume work on it until it is all gone, unless a hot inflammation intervenes in the eye; then leave it and treat the hot inflammation until it heals, then resume working on it by dissection until it heals. As for the fleshy excrescence of the caruncle…
If the excrescence harms the eye excessively, then hook that excrescence with a hook and cut some of it, but do not overdo the cutting lest it cause a flow of tears; then instill into the caruncle red or zinc sulphate powder until it heals.
Chapter Seventeen.
On the excision of the pterygium and what grows of excessive flesh in the eye.
In the eyes of some people, a red, fleshy growth may develop, covering the pupil, or approaching it, or overflowing onto the eyelids, and sometimes the eyelids turn outward, resembling a rose flower.
The procedure is that the patient should place his head in your lap, then open his eyes, and you should remove all that red flesh with suitable hooks.
Or grasp it with a scalpel or forceps, then cut the flesh little by little until you have removed it all by cutting, being careful not to injure the eye during the operation.  Your cutting should be done either with the scalpel we described for cutting the membrane, or with small scissors. Like those with which one plucks hairs, as their image follows in the chapter after this one.
When you have finished cutting and removed all the growth, fill the eye with crushed salt, or instill into it some red vitriol or similar caustic medicine, and apply a cotton pledget soaked in egg white to the outside of the eye to prevent inflammation.
If some of the growth remains and the bleeding is excessive, and you fear inflammation, leave the eye and treat it with remedies that alleviate inflammation, then resume the procedure until it is healed.  Do the same with excessive flesh of this type that appears in the eye.
However, you should avoid treating any eye that is weak by nature or by circumstance with instruments of iron, and do not undertake any of these procedures until you are sure that the organ can tolerate the operation.
Chapter Eighteen.
On the removal of pterygia from the eye.
Pterygia are red vessels that grow over the eye, obstructing vision and weakening the eye over time.  First, you should examine; if the eye with pterygia is strong and has no other disease besides the pterygia,
then removal is appropriate. You should instruct the patient to place his head in your lap, then hook the vessels with one or two hooks, depending on your skill. The hooks should be delicately curved in this manner:
Or they may be two double hooks in a single piece, in this manner:
Then, delicately, cut those vessels with fine scissors, wiping away the blood from time to time until you see that the vessels have been removed from the eye and the bleeding has stopped. Be careful not to injure the eye with the tips of the scissors, and perform this procedure during midday, facing the sun.
Be very careful in your work so as not to cut anything other than those vessels.  When finished, instill green or red vitriol into the eye; its sharpness will destroy any remaining pterygium. If you cannot remove it all at once, bandage the eye with something that soothes the pain.
Leave it for a few days until the pain subsides and the inflammation is gone. Then repeat the procedure in the same manner until it is healed. This is an image of the appropriate scissors.
Leave it [and let the patient's head rest on the pupil's lap, while another wipes away tears and checks the front and back of the eye, and you]. The basic procedure is to open the eye with fixed or triangular openers that the pupil holds.
Sharp, and let the patient's head rest on the pupil's lap, while another wipes away the tears and checks the front and back of the eye, and you have the choice to begin cutting from the top or bottom of the eye.  It is preferable to cut two strands on the upper side, one at the end of the crown and the other at its beginning.
Grasp it between the middle and index fingers, then hook it from below opposite them.  Then grasp it between the little and ring fingers, and lift your hand gently until you see the whole pterygium raised. Cut it from the smaller side if you wish, with scissors or with a delicate scalpel.
Then thread the needle and lift the entire pterygium until it is raised above the conjunctiva. Do not cut the strands, for the tears and blood will obscure your vision.
Then cut with scissors whatever extends beyond the cornea from above and below, so that nothing remains attached except to the cornea. If you can lift it from the cornea with a needle, that is best; this may be possible in some people.
And when you have cut it, let the wound heal for several days until the pain subsides and the inflammation disappears, then resume the operation.
Chapter Nineteen.
On replacing a deviated nasal bone.
Physicians call a deviated nasal bone a "nasal polyp". If you treat it with cauterization or a strong, burning medicine as described above, and it does not heal, then there is no remedy except to incise the swelling when it is ripe and to evacuate all the moisture or pus within it.
Until the bone is exposed.  If the bone is exposed and you see corruption or blackness in it, scrape it with an instrument of this shape:
The rasp head, made of Indian iron, is called *khushnah*. Its head is round like a button, finely engraved with the pattern of a file or rasp. You place it on the corrupted part of the bone and then rotate it between your fingers, applying gentle pressure, until you know that the corruption has been removed.
Do this repeatedly, then dress the wound with drying, astringent medications. If the wound closes and flesh grows over it, and the discharge ceases, and forty days pass without recurrence, suppuration, or further incident,
know that it is healed. Otherwise, there is no remedy except to return the fistula to the nasal cavity in this manner:  Expose the bone again with an instrument or strong medicine.  Once the bone is exposed, take a probe of this shape:
The tip of the instrument is triangular, and its shaft is conical, tapering to the tip, as you see. Then place it on the bone itself, near the ethmoid bone, but slightly away from the eye. Then rotate the hand with the probe until it penetrates the bone and the patient feels it.
He will feel air escaping from it if he holds his hand over his nose. Then dress the wound with the drying astringent medications, as I have taught you. If flesh grows and the area hardens, the matter which used to flow outwards will return to the nose, which will be easier for the patient, God willing.
Chapter Twenty.
On returning a protruding eye.
If the whole eye protrudes, and no harm or defect occurs in the vision, then the patient should be relaxed, and then cupped on the temples. Then apply a cupping glass to the nape of the neck without restriction, and gently suck.
Then apply a plaster made from acacia, aloe, frankincense, and mastic. Then bind the eye from above over the dressing with many pledgets.  The method for making the pledgets is to take many soft lint pieces and fold each one into four layers, making many of them.
Then place them one on top of the other as much as the eye needs, then bind it firmly with a strong cloth. Repeat the cupping with suction without restriction. Then remove the cupping glass and leave the eye bound for a day and a night.
If the bandage loosens during that time, it should be tightened gently. Then remove the bandage after a day and a night, as we said. If you see that the eye has returned, well and good. Otherwise, repeat the application of the dressing, pledgets, binding, and cupping until it returns.
Chapter Twenty-One.
On cutting the uvula.
If a hernia occurs in the uvular layer, then it protrudes and emerges outside the eyelids like a grape, and the person's appearance is disfigured because of it, and you wish to cut it, then the procedure is as I describe.
It is that you insert a needle into the base of the uvula from below upwards, then insert another needle with a doubled thread from the side of the uvula, and pass it through, and leave the first needle as it is.
Then you cut the place where the doubled thread bends and tie some of the uvula around the needle with it and pull it gently, then you remove the needle and place on the eye wool moistened with egg white and leave it until the threads fall out with the uvula, then you treat the eye with what strengthens it.
Until the wound heals.  You may also pull the uvula from each side with a circle of cloth until the eye is further protruded gently, then you cut with a fine scalpel reaching to the depth of the eye, so the white moisture flows and the eye descends and wilts in place, then you pull it until it heals.
Chapter Twenty-two.
In the treatment of coma.
This ailment which is called coma is a fluid that gathers in the eye resembling descending water, but it is not. The method of treatment is that you seat the patient on a chair upright, then you take his head in your hands from both sides.
And move it until you see the fluid go to the bottom with your eye, then it becomes fixed and does not move, and the light departs and the patient sees things as he used to see them. And if it does not descend to the bottom, we know that it is water. If the descent of the fluid is not achieved by what we have mentioned,
otherwise, seat the patient before you, then take a thin scalpel and make a small incision with it above the cornea at the junction of the conjunctiva with the cornea in the ciliary region until the material comes out.
Then, when it has come out, instill into the eye warm water in which honey has been mixed, or water in which fenugreek and honey have been boiled, then treat it with other treatments until it heals.
Chapter Twenty-Three.
We have already mentioned the types of water in the classification and which of them is suitable for cupping, in a detailed and explained statement, so take it from there correctly. Then, you should seat the patient before you, sitting squarely facing the light near the sun.
And you bind his healthy eye and bind it tightly, then you lift the eyelid of his eye with your left hand if the eye in which the water is the left eye, or with your right hand if it is the right eye.
Then you place the tip of the cupping instrument near the cornea, with the thickness of a probe, in the same white of the eye on the side of the smaller canthus, then you push the cupping instrument forcefully while rotating it with your hand until it penetrates the white of the eye and you feel with the cupping instrument that it has reached something empty.
And it should be that the extent to which the cupping instrument goes into the depth is the distance that is from the pupil to the end of the blackness, which is the cornea. For the copper is seen by the observer himself in the eye due to the clarity of the corneal membrane. Then you move the cupping instrument upwards to the place where the water is.
Then you press it downwards again and again. If the water descends immediately, then the patient will see what his sight has been opened to immediately, with the cupping instrument in his eye. Then it rests a little. If the water rises, then lower it again without removing the cupping instrument.
If it settles and does not rise, then remove the cupping instrument gently, while twisting it with your hand little by little. Then dissolve some clean Andarani salt in water and wash the eye with it from the inside, then place outside the whole eye a compress or wet wool.
With rose oil and egg white, and you bind it with the healthy eye. As for us and the people of our time, we place crushed cumin with egg white on it. If the cupping instrument does not enter the eye due to its hardness—for some people have very hard eyes— Then you should take the scalpel called the *barīd*, whose image is this:
Then pierce with it only the adherent part and do not overdo the piercing.  It is only that you make a slight opening for the cupping instrument, then insert the cupping instrument as we mentioned. When your work is complete, prepare for the patient a firm lying-down position in which he lies on his back in a dark room.
And he must abstain from all movements and from coughing, and you make his food whatever softens his nature, and he does not move his head to the right or left at all. The bandage remains in place until the third day, then you untie it in that dark room and test his vision.
And you show him things, then you reapply the bandage until the seventh day.  And it is not appropriate to do that during treatment or after cupping at your time, but you should avoid that before the water rises quickly with intense vision.
If a hot swelling appears, then it is necessary to untie the eye before the seventh [day] and treat that with what calms the swelling, until when it calms then at that time you release his vision and place a kerchief on his face so that his sight may be trained from under it for days while he is in that dark room, then...
He gradually leaves the house and manages his causes. And know that in cupping, the learner cannot do without observation many times, then afterwards he proceeds to the work. And it has reached me from some Iraqis that he mentioned that they make in Iraq a cupping instrument that is perforated which draws out the water with it.
And I have not seen anyone in our country make that, nor have I read it in any book of the ancients. And it is possible that this is recent. And this is an image of types of cupping instruments for one who is ignorant of them to look at:
It is made of copper especially, and its end is with this very thinness, triangular-ended, sharp.
Chapter twenty-four.
In the treatment of the flesh that grows in the nose.
Various superfluous flesh may grow in the nose; some of it resembles a scorpion with many legs, and some is cancerous flesh, hardened and dark in color, and some is soft flesh, not dark in color.
If any of this flesh is soft, not malignant nor cancerous, then the patient should sit before you facing the sun, and you should open his nostril and insert the snare into that flesh, then draw it outwards, and then cut what you have seized of it with a sharp, delicate scalpel from one side.
Until you know that all the flesh has gone; if any remains that you could not cut, then remove it gently with one of the delicate instruments, so that nothing remains. If the bleeding overcomes you, or a hot inflammation appears,
then treat it accordingly.  If it is one of the malignant tumors, then act quickly to cauterize it until the bleeding stops and all the flesh is gone. Then, after cutting, place vinegar and water, or a potion, in the nose. If the nose opens and the moisture passes into the throat,
know that he is healed. If the moisture does not flow as it should, know that inside there is flesh growing on the weakened bones that the instrument did not reach in cutting. Then you should take a linen thread of some thickness.
and tie many knots in it, making the space between each knot the width of a finger or less. The patient should then carefully insert one end of the thread into his nose with a probe, or with whatever is available after making it like a button, and draw it with his breath until it reaches the pharynx.
and emerges from his throat.  Boys often do something similar in school, and it is easy for anyone who wants to do it. Then gather together the two ends of the thread, the one that emerged from the mouth and the other that remained in the nose.
Then use the knots in the thread to saw at the flesh, doing this until you know that the flesh has been cut by the knots of the thread. Then remove the thread and, after wiping away the blood, place a wick soaked in Egyptian ointment in the nose. Do this for three days or more.
until the ointment consumes all the remaining flesh. Then, as a final step, place a lead tube in the nose for a few days until it heals. If it needs drying treatment, use that.
This is an image of the instrument with which ointments and medicines are dropped into the nose:
It is made of silver or copper, similar to a small, open oil lamp, and its spout is also open.
And if you wish, make the tube closed like a reed, and the spout of the instrument flat.
It has a handle at its end, as you see, to hold it when you heat oil or whatever you wish of juices or liquids in it.
Chapter Twenty-Five.
On warts growing on the tip of the nose.
Often a wart grows on the tip of the nose, and it increases and grows larger with the days until its appearance becomes unsightly.
Therefore, it is necessary to cut it off at its first appearance and to excise all of it, then apply to the place either cautery or a burning medicine that acts in place of cautery. If you fail to cut it off until it becomes large, then look: if it is hardened, solid, dark in color and insensitive,
then do not apply iron to it, for it is a cancerous tumor, and I have often seen the cutting of this tumor followed by great harm to its sufferer.  But if the tumor is soft to the touch, not dark in color, and you see that complete excision is possible, then empty the patient's bowels and cut it off without hesitation or delay, and treat the place with what dries and constricts until it heals.
Chapter Twenty-Six.
On suturing the nose, lip, and ear. If their connection is severed by a wound or something similar, know that when a severance of connection occurs in one of these cartilages, the treatment rarely works except in some people.
Then, if any of this happens to someone, look: if the wound is fresh with its blood, bring together the edges of the wound with sutures and then treat it until it heals. And if the separation of the connection has separated its edges and each part is whole, then you should scrape each part to the thickness of its outer skin until it bleeds.
Then bring together the edges with sutures, tighten them, and sprinkle on them mastic and frankincense, powdered, and place on top of the sutures a plaster of walnut ointment or another of the consolidating ointments. Leave it bandaged for two or three days, then unbind it.
And change the medication and leave it until the threads separate by themselves, then treat it with ointment until it heals.  The method of suturing is to bring together the separated connection either with needles, as we described in suturing the abdomen, or with thread, as I explained there.
Chapter twenty-seven.
On removing the knots which appear in the lips.
Many people develop in the inside of their lips small, hard tumors; some resemble a lentil, some are smaller, and some larger.  It is necessary to turn back the lip and incise over each knot and hang it with a hook.
And cut it from each side, then pack the area after cutting with powdered alum until the bleeding stops, then rinse with vinegar and salt, and treat the area with something astringent until the wounds heal.
Chapter twenty-eight.
On cutting away excess flesh in the gums.
Often, excess flesh grows on the gums, which the ancients called epulis.  It is necessary to hang it with a hook or grasp it with forceps and cut it at its base, and leave it a while to drain or bleed, then apply powdered alum to the area.
Or one of the astringent drying powders. If that flesh returns after treatment—for it often does—cut it again and cauterize it, for it will not return after cauterization.
Chapter twenty-nine.
On extracting teeth with iron.
Rough, unsightly scales may gather on the surfaces of the teeth, inside and out, and between the gums.  They may blacken, yellow, or green, even causing damage to the gums and making the teeth unsightly.
The patient should sit before you with his head in your lap.  Clean the tooth or teeth showing scales and anything resembling sand, removing it all completely. Do the same with blackness, greenness, yellowness, and anything else until clean.
If the scaling is removed at the first attempt, well and good. Otherwise repeat the scaling on another day, and then a second and third, until you achieve your goal.  Know that different shaped and numerous tools are needed for scaling teeth, depending on what is required.
For the instrument used to scale a tooth from the inside is not the same as that used to scale it from the outside, nor that used to scale between the teeth, which is of another form.  These are several forms of scaling instruments, all of which should be ready at hand:
Chapter Thirty.
On the Extraction of Teeth.
You should treat a painful tooth by every means possible and delay its extraction, for there is no replacement if it is extracted, because it is a noble substance, except when its extraction is unavoidable.
If the patient is determined to have it extracted, you should ascertain that the tooth is the source of the pain. For often the patient is deceived by the pain and thinks that it is in the healthy tooth, and he extracts it, but the pain does not go away until the diseased tooth is extracted.  We have seen this done repeatedly by barbers.
If you ascertain which tooth is causing the pain, then you should incise around the tooth with a moderately strong scalpel, so as to separate the gum from all sides, then move it gently with your fingers or with delicate forceps little by little until you loosen it.
Then firmly grasp it with the large forceps, and hold the patient's head between your knees, having steadied it so that it does not move. Then pull the tooth straight out so as not to break it. If it does not come out, then take one of those instruments and gently insert it under it from every side, and move it as you did before.
And if the tooth is perforated or decayed, you should fill that hole with a piece of cloth and pack it tightly with the end of a thin probe, lest it crumble when you pull on it with the forceps.  You should also thoroughly incise around the gum on all sides.
And take care not to break it, for if some of it remains, it will cause the patient a greater affliction than his original pain. And beware of doing what the ignorant barbers do, in their haste and rashness in extracting it without using what we have described.
For they often inflict great harm on people, the least of which is that the tooth breaks and all or part of its roots remain. Or that it is extracted with part of the jawbone, as we have witnessed many times. Then, after its extraction, let him rinse his mouth with a potion or vinegar and salt. If bleeding occurs, which often happens, then crush some alum and pack the site with it.
Otherwise, cauterize it if the alum does not help. The image of the delicate forceps with which you first move the tooth:  they should have long ends, short handles, and be thick so that they do not bend when you grip the tooth with them. And this is the image of the large forceps:
They should be, as you see, thick in the handles so that when you grip them, they do not yield or bend, and short in the ends.  Let them be of Indian iron or of well-tempered steel, with polished ends, and at the end, teeth that interlock to provide a firm and secure grip.
And the ends may be made in the shape of a file, which will also provide a strong grip.
Chapter Thirty-one.
On the extraction of the roots of molars and the removal of fractured jaw bones.
If, when extracting a molar, a root remains broken, you should place cotton soaked in butter on the area for a day or two until the area relaxes, then insert the forceps or hooks. whose ends resemble the beak of the bird called the balaraja.  This is an image of the hooks:
They are made like a file on the inside or like a scalpel. If you are unable to remove it with these hooks, you should drill into the root and expose all the flesh with a scalpel, then insert an instrument that resembles a small lever, which is depicted here:
short and somewhat thick at the end, and not too slender, lest it break. If the root comes out with this, well and good; otherwise, use these other instruments, which are depicted here: the first has a triangular end and is somewhat thick.
Another fine triangular image:
And we may also use this instrument with two branches, which is also depicted here:
and other instruments and tools previously mentioned in the extraction of molars.  We may also use this instrument which resembles a large hook, which is depicted here:
triangular, with a curved end, somewhat thick, so that it does not break, and not too slender. Know that the instruments for molars are numerous, as are all the other instruments; they are almost innumerable, and a skillful and clever craftsman may invent for himself instruments according to what the work and the diseases themselves indicate.
For there are diseases for which the ancients did not mention instruments, due to the variety of their types.  If a bone of the jaw or one of the bones of the mouth is broken or decays, then search for it in its place with one of these instruments and hooks mentioned for extracting roots.
And we use a curette, its image is this:
It should be somewhat thick to control the bone so that it does not slip until the bone is removed. And we treat the area with appropriate medicines. If the bone has slight decay, remove its decay and blackness until it is clean, then treat it until it heals.
Chapter thirty-two.
On the extraction of molars that grow upon others.
If molars grow other than in their natural course, they are unsightly, especially if this happens in women and slaves.  It should be examined; if the molar has grown behind another molar,
and its extraction or pushing back is impossible, extract it. And if it is attached to another molar, cut it with this instrument, whose image is this:
It resembles a small beak and should be made of sharp Indian iron, very sharp at the point.  Your cutting should be done over many days because of the hardness of the tooth, lest you shake other teeth. But if it is protruding and you are able to file it down, file it with an Indian file, whose image is this:
It should be entirely of Indian steel, and its point very finely engraved, like the file with which needles are made. File the tooth little by little over many days gently, lest you shake the tooth and it falls out. Then smooth it further and remove it with some forceps.
And if a tooth is broken, and it hurts the tongue when speaking, then it should also be filed until the roughness of that fracture is removed, it becomes smooth and even, and does not hurt the tongue or impair speech.
Chapter Thirty-Three.
On binding loose teeth with silver or gold threads.
If the front teeth become loosened and move as a result of a blow or fall, and the patient cannot bite on anything to eat for fear that they will fall out, and you have treated them with astringent medicines but the treatment has not worked.
The solution is to tie them with a gold or silver thread; gold is better because silver tarnishes and rots after a few days, while gold remains unchanged forever and is not subject to this. The thread should be of moderate thickness, according to what fits between the teeth.
The method of binding is to take the thread and insert its loop between the healthy teeth, then weave the ends of the thread between the loose teeth, whether one or more, until you reach a healthy tooth on the other side by weaving.
Then weave back to the side where you began and gently but firmly tighten the thread so that it does not move at all.  The tightening should be at the roots of the teeth so that it does not come loose. Then cut the excess ends of the thread with scissors, gather them together, twist them, and hide them between the healthy tooth and the loose tooth.
So that it does not injure the tongue. Then leave it tied as it is for as long as it remains. If it loosens or breaks, tie it again with another thread. In this way, he will enjoy it his whole life. This is a picture of the teeth and the method of binding between two healthy teeth and two loose teeth, as you see.
One or two teeth, after falling out, may be returned to their place and bound as described, and they will remain.  A skilled dentist does this. He might carve bone from cattle bone to make a tooth-like shape and place it where the tooth has gone. And it is tightened as we said, and it remains, and he enjoys it.
Chapter Thirty-Four.
Concerning cutting the ligament which appears under the tongue and prevents speech.
This ligament which appears under the tongue may be either natural, with which a person is born, or accidental, from a healed wound.
And the procedure is that you open the mouth of the patient and place his head in your lap and raise his tongue, then cut that nervous ligament transversely until the tongue is released from its restraint.  If there is some stiffness and complexity, and this is from the healing of a wound, then place a hook in it and split it transversely until the ligament is severed and the knot is undone.
And beware that the incision is not deep in the flesh, lest you cut an artery there and bleeding results. Then let him rinse his mouth after the cutting with rose water or with vinegar and cold water, then place under the tongue a pledget of linen which the patient holds in each night.
Lest it unite again.  If bleeding occurs, place powdered alum on the place. If the bleeding overcomes you, cauterize the place with a lentil-shaped cautery suitable for this. Then treat it with the rest of the treatment until it heals.
Chapter Thirty-Five.
On the removal of a frog generated under the tongue.
A swelling resembling a small frog sometimes occurs under the tongue, preventing the tongue from its natural function, and it may grow large enough to fill the mouth. The procedure is to open the patient's mouth toward the sun and examine the swelling.
If you see it dark in color or black, hard, and the patient feels no sensation in it, do not interfere with it, for it is a cancer. But if it is whitish and moist, insert a hook into it and incise it with a fine scalpel, freeing it from all sides.
If the bleeding is excessive during the procedure, apply powdered vitriol until the bleeding stops, then resume the procedure until you have completely removed it. Then rinse with vinegar and salt.
Then treat it with other appropriate remedies until it heals.
Chapter Thirty-Six.
In the treatment of tonsil tumors.
And what grows in the throat from other tumors; sometimes glands appear inside the throat, similar to those that appear outside, called tonsils. If you treat them with what was mentioned in the section and they do not heal,
then look: if the tumor is hard, dark in color, and insensitive, do not use the cautery; and if it is red in color and its base is thick, do not use the cautery either, for fear of hemorrhage, but leave it until it matures; then either you will incise it or it will burst on its own.
And if it is white in color, round, and its base is thin, this is what should be cut.  The procedure is that you should look before operating whether its hot inflammation has completely subsided or has somewhat diminished.
Then seat the patient facing the sun, his head in your lap, and open his mouth.  Have an assistant hold his tongue down with an instrument of this shape:
Make it of silver or copper, thin like a knife. When you depress the tongue with it and the tumor is visible, take a hook, pierce the tonsil with it, and pull it outward as much as possible, without pulling along any of the membranes.
Then cut it with an instrument of this shape, resembling scissors except that its two ends are curved, each end very sharp and close to the other, made of Indian iron or Damascus steel:
If this instrument is not available, then cut it with a scalpel of this shape:
sharp on one side and blunt on the other. After cutting one tonsil, cut the other in the same manner. Then, after cutting, have the patient gargle with cold water or vinegar and water.
If bleeding occurs, gargle with water in which pomegranate peel or myrtle leaves, or similar astringents, have been boiled until the bleeding stops. Then treat it until it heals.  Other tumors besides the tonsils may grow in the throat; cut them as described for the tonsils.
I treated a woman with a tumor that had grown inside her throat, resembling a polyp, somewhat insensitive to the touch, and which almost blocked her throat. The woman breathed through a narrow passage and was prevented from eating and drinking water.
She was near death if she remained a day or two. Two branches extended from the tumor, emerging from her nostrils. I acted quickly, inserted a hook into one of them, and pulled; a suitable piece was extracted.
Then I cut it where I reached it through the nostril. I did the same with what protruded from the other nostril. Then I opened her mouth, depressed her tongue, inserted the hook into the tumor itself, and cut some of it; only a little blood flowed.
The woman's throat opened, and she immediately began to drink water and eat. We continued to cut away parts of the tumor repeatedly over a long period; the tumor replaced what was cut, until it lasted a long time for both of us.
Then I devised a plan and cauterized the tumor inside the throat with a cautery iron; it stopped growing. Then she traveled away, and I do not know what God did with her afterwards.
Chapter Thirty-Seven.
On the excision of a uvular tumor.
That which is called an `anba' if it descends as a growth to the uvula and swells, and is white and oblong, is called a pillar; and if it is thicker at the bottom and round, it is called an `anba'. If it is treated with what we mentioned in the classification and the treatment is not effective,
and I saw that the hot tumor had subsided from it and it was thin, then it should be cut, and whatever is gathered together and round, and does not have length, and is bloody or the color of pus, or black, or insensitive, then it should be avoided cutting it.
For there is danger to the patient.  Therefore, if you see it in the way described, of its whiteness and length, you should seat the patient facing the sun, and press down his tongue with the instrument which we described previously, then insert the hook into the `anba'.
And pull it downwards and cut it with one of the two instruments which we mentioned in cutting the tonsils.  And you should not cut from it except that which exceeds the natural state without excess, for if you cut more from it, you will harm the voice and speech.
Then after cutting, use what we described in cutting the tonsils and treat it until it heals. If the patient is afraid of cutting it, then you should use a way to cauterize it without fear or caution.  The way of cauterization in it is with a strong medicine, and that is that you place the patient's head in your lap.
Then press down his tongue with the instrument we mentioned, then take from the strong water which we mentioned in the chapter on cauterization, and mix it with unquenched lime, and make it neither thick nor thin, and fill the concavity of this instrument with it. And this is its image:
Its end, in which you place the medicine, has a concavity like the concavity of a spoon, and place the instrument with the medicine on the uvula itself, and the patient lying on his side, so that the saliva flows from his mouth from inside his throat, lest something descend from it into his throat and harm him.
Then hold your hand with the medicine while you press it on the uvula for about half an hour until you see that it has blackened and the sting of the medicine has subsided. And if you wish, take cotton and wrap it around the end of a probe and wet the cotton in the medicine.
And insert the probe with the cotton into the tube from above until the cotton adheres to the uvula. Do this repeatedly until you achieve what you want from cauterizing the uvula, then leave it. For it will wither and fall after three or four days. If you need to reapply the medicine, reapply it.
And after cauterization, wipe around the uvula with cotton soaked in butter and dry the medicine around it, then rinse with cold water and treat from the outside with poultices and from the inside with gargles until it heals. This type of treatment is safer than cutting and further from fear.
The uvula may also be treated with something gentler than cauterization and cutting; it is treated with fumigation in this manner: take  fenugreek, hyssop, thyme, savory, wormwood, chamomile, and gum tragacanth, and similar herbs. Gather them all or some of them in a pot and immerse them in vinegar.
And boil it, the pot being coated with philosopher's clay, and there should be a hole in the middle of the lid through which a hollow instrument is fitted, made in this manner, of silver or copper.
And insert the end containing the pomegranate into the patient's mouth until the steam rises to the uvula through the tube, until the uvula is well moistened. Then repeat it several times until it withers. And beware of performing this treatment at the first onset of the swelling.
For it often increases the swelling.  Rather, it should be done when its hot swelling subsides. If you do not have this instrument, take a reed and fit an eggshell to its end, lest the patient's mouth be burned.
For the eggshell prevents the heat of the steam from burning the mouth, and this is a good and safe treatment.
Chapter thirty-eight.
On removing thorns and other things that lodge in the throat.
Often a bone, fishbone, or something else lodges in the throat.  You should remove what is visible to the eye after you have depressed the tongue with the instrument, towards the sun.
So that you may see what is in the throat.  And if it does not appear to you and is hidden in the throat, you should make the patient vomit before his food is digested in his stomach, for perhaps the lodged object will come out with the vomit. Or the patient should swallow a piece of beet or a stalk of lettuce.
Or he should swallow a mouthful of dry bread, or you should take a piece of soft sea sponge, tie it to a string, and then have him swallow it. When it reaches the place of the thorn, pull the string quickly.  Do this several times.
Often the thorn or bone will stick to it and come out. If it does not come out by these means, then use a lead instrument of this shape:
It should be slightly thicker than a probe, and at its tip a hook. The patient inserts it into his throat gently, raising his head upwards, and being careful not to touch his throat, lest he cause coughing and thereby push the bone or thorn further in. Or the physician inserts it with his hand.
And it is better for the patient to insert it himself, as he knows the location of the lodged object.  He pushes downwards or pulls upwards with the instrument, doing all this as much as he is able, until it comes out.
Chapter Thirty-Nine.
On removing leeches lodged in the throat.
If you treat the leech with what we mentioned in the section on medicinal treatment and it is not effective, then look into the patient's throat in the sunlight, after you have depressed his tongue with the instrument I described to you.
If you see the leech, pull it out with a small hook or a gentle, firm probe. If you cannot do so, take a hollow tube and insert it into the patient's throat near the leech, then insert a heated iron into the tube's interior.
Do this several times, and the patient should abstain from water for the whole day.  Then he should take a jug full of cold water, open his mouth into it, and rinse his mouth with it without swallowing a drop, moving the water from time to time with his hand.
The leech will fall out when it feels the water. If it does not come out as described, fumigate the throat with urine and asafoetida using the instrument described for fumigating the tonsils; do this several times, and it will fall out.
The method of fumigation is as follows: Take a pot containing hot coals and cover it with a lid having a hole in the middle.  Fit the end of the instrument into this hole, then add the fumigant. The patient places his mouth on the end of the tube and closes his mouth tightly so that the fumes do not escape, until it is known that the fumes have reached his throat.
Then the leech will fall out. If it does not, repeat the fumigation several times. The patient should endure thirst, eat salty food and garlic, and not drink water; the leech must come out with this treatment.  This is an image of an instrument used to extract a leech from the throat when it is visible.
It resembles forceps, as you see, except that it has this curve which enters the throat, and its tips resemble a bird's beak; they are as rough as a file, so that when they grip something, they do not let go.
Another instrument is used to compress the tongue. It is a wide iron ring, large enough to fit over the tongue in the mouth.  It is inserted into the mouth standing on its side, so the mouth remains open without the patient's will, and he cannot remove it at all until it is removed.
Description of the instrument with which the mouth is opened in this very way.
Chapter Forty.
It will speak of the cauterization of tumors and their incision.
Tumors are numerous and varied in kind, as will be described one by one in this book.  They differ in their cauterization and incision in two ways: one, from the type of tumor itself and what it contains of humors.
The second type is due to the locations in the body where they occur, for a tumor occurring in the head is not like a tumor occurring in the anus, and a tumor occurring in a fleshy place is not like a tumor occurring in a joint; each has its own treatment.
Some tumors should not be cauterized except after the pus in them has matured and is complete; others should be cauterized while they are raw and have not fully matured, such as tumors that are close to the joints.
Because if a tumor occurs near a joint and its condition persists until it putrefies what is around it, it may corrupt the ligaments or nerves of that joint, thus causing the crippling of that limb, or the tumor may be near a vital organ.
For if you delay its cauterization until it matures, you will harm that vital organ; or it may be near the anus, so cauterize it raw.  It is necessary to cauterize a raw tumor, not fully matured, which is near the anus, lest it putrefy the depths and penetrate into the interior of the anus, becoming a fistula.
And it becomes to a degree incurable.  And you should know the time for cauterizing tumors that have fully matured; it is when the pain of the tumor subsides, the fever goes away, the redness and throbbing decrease, the head of the tumor softens, and all other signs appear.
And you should apply the cauterization to the lowest part of the tumor if that is possible, so that the flow of pus may be easier downwards, or in the thinnest and most prominent part of the tumor.  And let the cauterization extend along the length of the body if the tumors are in the hands or feet.
And the places of muscles, tendons, nerves, and arteries, and in general all flat places which do not bend. But as for those which bend, let the cauterization be done according to that place.  And if the tumor is in fleshy places it is best to leave it uncauterized.
Until its maturation is complete, as we have said. For if you cauterize it before that, the flow of pus from it will be prolonged, and it will be very harmful and dirty, and perhaps its lips and depths will harden.  And some tumors may be cauterized across the body, if necessary, or according to the needs of the member.
And you should use a single cauterization for small tumors, and for large tumors a wide cauterization or many incisions, according to the size of the tumor.  And there may be tumors which should have their skin scraped and cut if they have become like a rag.
And it has reached the point where it has died, as happens in many abscesses and collections. And some of them are incised with a three-cornered incision, and some have a piece cut from it in the shape of an ivy leaf, like the inguinal tumor.
And some use a circular incision and a crescent-shaped incision and similar incisions. And if it does not have a head, like smooth flat tumors, then it should only be cauterized simply.  And if the tumor is large and has been collected for a long time, and you cauterize it, you should not rush to remove all the pus at that time.
Rather, remove some of it, then dress the tumor until another day, then remove some of the pus also. Do this repeatedly gradually until you remove all of it.
Especially if the patient is weak, or a pregnant woman, or a small child, or an old man, for the vital spirit often dissolves with the sudden exit of pus, so the patient may die and you are unaware. Therefore, be extremely cautious in this matter.
After cauterizing these tumors, you should wipe the wound and look. If the wound of the tumor is small, or the incision is single and simple, then use a thread of linen or old cotton. And if the tumor is large and the incisions of the cauterization are many…
then you should insert into each incision a tent, until some of them reach each other. And if some of the skin of the tumor has been cut or eroded, then you should pack it with old cotton or linen lint without moisture, and dress it until the third day.
Then remove it and treat it with the appropriate ointments until it heals. If bleeding occurs during your work, use cold water and vinegar after soaking a linen cloth in them and applying it to the bleeding site repeatedly.
If the bleeding persists, you should use the procedures, treatments, and styptics that we have described in many places in this book and in the division. If you are in winter and the location of the tumor is very sensitive, you should moisten the bandages with a warm syrup and oil.
And place them on the site. And if you are in summer and the locations are fleshy, you should apply the bandages soaked in water and oil or in syrup and oil, all of it cold, until the third day, as we said. Then you should unwrap the tumor and wipe it.
And use similar treatments until it heals. This is what you need to know about the general treatment of tumors. As for the detailed method, I have described the treatment of each tumor in a categorized and summarized way.
Chapter forty-one.
On the incision of tumors that appear on the scalp.
Small tumors appear on the scalp; they are a type of boil contained in sacs, similar in appearance to a chicken's crop.  There are many types, some fatty, and some containing a moisture resembling mud.
Some contain a moisture resembling pus and broth, and so on, and some are hardened and solid.  There is no danger in incising and removing all of them, unless you encounter an artery during the incision.
The procedure for incising them is to first probe them with the instrument whose image follows, which is called the *muddass*, so that you know what they contain. If what they contain is moisture, incise them longitudinally with a simple incision in this manner:
Begin the incision from point B to point C. When the moisture is emptied, remove the sac that contained the moisture and cut it completely; do not leave any of it at all, for it often recurs if any remains.
Then, dip cotton in yellow ointment, if available, otherwise in salt water, and fill the wound with it. Leave it until the next day, for it will consume what remains of the sac. Then, apply the cotton with the yellow ointment again and a third time if necessary.
Until you are certain that nothing of the sac remains. Then treat the wound with ointments until it heals.  If the swelling contains fatty matter, incise it in this manner:
Make a firm incision and place hooks in the edges of the wound, and peel it from every side.  Make every effort to remove the membrane which contains it. If an artery obstructs you, do as I described before; and likewise do if the swelling is hardened from the incision.
The treatment is the same as I have described. The incision on a hardened swelling is easier because it has little blood and moisture. Some of these swellings in the head in some people may have no moisture at all.  For I incised a swelling in...
the head of an old woman, and I found the swelling like hard, rough, white stone, impossible to break; if anyone were to throw it, it would cut him.  It was unlike other swellings occurring in the head, except for those which appear in the heads of children.
And at the roots of the ears, incise them all with a simple incision, and make their bottoms from their lower parts so that the flow of matter to the bottom is easy.  Then treat them with whatever treatment suits them.
Chapter forty-two.
Concerning the incision on the swellings which frequently appear in the neck. These swellings frequently appear in the neck, under the armpits, and in the groins; they may appear in the rest of the body. That which appears in the neck may be single or multiple; some may develop from others.
And each swelling is within a special membrane of its own, as is the case with the abscesses and the swellings of the head as we described. And the types of these swellings are many: some are calcified, some contain fluids, and some are malignant and do not respond to treatment.
I have not seen any of them in good condition to the touch, and their appearance was close to the color of the skin; they moved in every direction and were not attached to a nerve of the neck, nor to a vein, nor to an artery, nor were they deep-seated. It should be incised with a simple incision from above to below the body, in this manner, from line J to line B.
And peel it from every side and stretch the edges of the skin with a hook or two hooks, or many hooks if needed, as we said in the case of the swellings of the head. Remove it little by little, and be careful not to cut a vein or nerve. And let the scalpel not be very sharp.
Lest your hand exceed in cutting, or the patient be disturbed, and you cut what you do not need to cut.  If you cut a vein or artery and it hinders you, place in the wound powdered vitriol or some styptics which stop the blood.
And tighten the wound and leave it until the intensity of the swelling subsides and the wound relaxes and begins to suppurate; for the bleeding then stops. Then return to your work until you finish. Then search with your index finger if anything remains, then other small worms; cut them and clean them out.
If at the root of the worm there is a large vein, then it should not be cut from its root, but it should be tied with a doubled tight thread and left until it falls off by itself without harm. Then stuff the wound with old cotton soaked in Egyptian ointment, and then treat it.
And if you cut the whole worm, then you should bring together the edges of the wound and stitch it immediately after you ascertain that no part remains.  If you see that a part of the worm's body remains,
then you should aim to cut to its root and base, and use sutures and what we have mentioned.  And as for worms containing fluids, cauterize them slightly where their ripeness appears, and make the cauterization from below, as we said.
Then, after cauterization, use a dressing with Egyptian ointment or similar to consume what remains of the corruption, until you see that the wound has been cleansed. Then treat it with ointments that promote flesh growth until it heals.
Chapter Forty-Three.
Concerning the incision of the throat for a tumor that occurs inside the throat.
The ancients mentioned this incision in the throat, but I have not seen anyone in our country perform it. This is the account of their words. As for those with angina, they should avoid incision of the throat, for they will not benefit from it.
Because all the veins and the lung will be weak.  But those with a hot tumor in the mouth, throat, or tonsils, if there is no ailment in the windpipe, then it is necessary to use incision of the throat to escape the harm that results from suffocation.
Then, if we wish to do this, we should incise the throat below three or four rings of the windpipe, a small transverse incision between two rings, to the extent of the incision in the peritoneum, not in the cartilage. This location is suitable for the incision.
Because it is devoid of flesh and the blood vessels are distant from it. If the physician is timid, he should extend the skin of the throat with a hook, then incise the skin until he reaches the windpipe, avoiding the blood vessels if he sees any.
Then he should incise the peritoneum which we have described.  The incision of the windpipe is indicated by the phlegm which comes out of it along with what is excised, and by the interruption of the voice.  The wound is left open for a time. When the time in which strangulation was feared has passed, the edges of the wound are brought together from the skin.
And its outline alone, without the cartilage. Then use medicines which cause flesh to grow until it heals. The author of this book said, the explanation of this statement which we have related is only if they see that the patient's throat is obstructed by one of these tumors which they have mentioned.
And the patient was close to death and his life was about to end, they went to incise the throat so that the patient might breathe somewhat through the site of the wound and be saved from death. They were ordered to leave the wound open until the crisis of the illness is over, and its crisis is three days or so.
Then they ordered the wound to be sutured and treated until it healed. What I myself witnessed is that a maidservant took a knife and ran it across her throat, cutting some of the windpipe. I was summoned to treat her, and I found her gasping like one who is slaughtered.  So I uncovered the wound.
Then I found the blood which came out of the wound to be slight, and I was certain that she had not cut a vein nor an artery. Breath was coming out of the wound, so I proceeded, I sutured the wound, and treated it until it healed, and nothing happened to the maidservant except for a slight hoarseness in the voice.
And after days she returned to her best condition. From this, we say that an incision of the throat is not dangerous.
Chapter forty-four.
Concerning the incision upon the tumor which appears in the throat from the outside and is called the elephantiasis of the throat.
This tumor which is called elephantiasis of the throat is a large tumor of the color of the body, and it is frequent in women, and it is of two kinds.
Either it is natural or accidental. As for the natural, there is no remedy for it; as for the accidental, it is of two kinds: one resembling fatty swellings, and the other resembling the tumor which arises from the complication of the artery, and in its incision there is danger. Therefore, one should not at all use the iron upon it, except that which is small of it, if you probe it and examine it with the probe and you find that it resembles a fatty swelling and is not attached to anything of the veins, then incise it as you incise upon swellings. And remove it with what contains it of the cyst if it is in a cyst, and otherwise, remove it completely, then treat the place with what is appropriate of treatment.
Chapter forty-five.
Concerning the incision of various swellings.
Swellings are numerous in types, and I have mentioned all their types in the classification. It is necessary that we explain here the difference between a swelling and an abscess, since it is difficult.  So I say that with an abscess there is heat and fever and frightening pains until the boiling of the matter subsides. And the putrefaction is completed, then the fever and intensity subside.  A swelling has neither heat, nor fever, nor pain, and it is contained by a serous cyst which is its special covering, and it is the color of the body, and its beginning is like a lentil, and it becomes like a blister, larger and smaller.
And it is of two types: either fatty, or it contains moisture. The colors of the moisture are many, as I mentioned in the classification.  Therefore, if you come to treat a swelling, you should probe and examine it first with the instrument called the probe, as its image comes in the chapter after this.
Assess the size of the swelling, then remove the probe and look at what comes out after it. If fluid of any color comes out, then incise it with a simple incision as I mentioned in the case of other swellings. If no fluid comes out after the probe, then know that it is fatty.
Then make a firm incision on it in this manner as I have taught you, and attach it with hooks, and peel the skin from every side gently, and preserve the cyst if you are able to remove it intact with the swelling.
If the cyst is ruptured during the procedure and you are unable to remove it intact—and this often happens—then remove it piece by piece until nothing remains. For if any part of it, however little or much, remains, the swelling will return in most cases.
If it overcomes you and a little remains, cauterize the wound at the end with some sharp cautery irons, and tighten the wound and put on it something that cools hot swelling and treat it with other treatments until it heals. If the swelling is large, then stitch its lips and treat it with that which heals.
If you encounter a bleeding or non-bleeding vein and bleeding occurs, immediately cauterize the area with powdered vitriol and leave it constricted for two or three days until the wound becomes infected and the flow of blood ceases. Then return to removing what remains of the swelling.
Chapter forty-six.
On the forms of instruments.
Those which are used in incision and cauterization; among the forms of the probes, there are three types: large, medium, and small.
Image of a large probe.
Image of a medium probe.
Image of a small probe.
They are made of steel, square-ended and tightly fitting, to facilitate entry into tumors. These are images of probes, called *bard*, and they are also of three types: large, medium, and small. Image of a large probe.
Image of a medium probe.
Image of a small probe.
They are suitable for examining tumors, wounds, fistulas, and cavities for what is inside them, such as bones and other things. They are made round, polished, and smooth like styluses, from Chinese copper, or *ispadruwiya*, or from copper, or from iron, or from silver. The best are those made from *ispadruwiya*.
Probes may also be made of black lead. They are suitable for probing fistulas which have curves in their depths, so that they may flex gently with that curve.  They are also of three types: long, medium, and short.
According to the need of each fistula's depth, and its thickness is made according to the fistula's width and narrowness. Image of a large lead probe.
Image of a medium-sized lead probe.
Image of a small lead probe.
Images of hooks. They are numerous types, for there are simple ones, meaning those with one hook.  These are of three types: large, medium, and small. And there are blind hooks, which are of three types. And there are hooks with two hooks, which are of three types. And there are curved hooks with two hooks. They are of three types. And there are hooks with three hooks, which are of three types.  And all these types, each one is needed in its place. Image of a large simple hook. Image of a medium simple hook. Image of a small simple hook.
Image of a large blind hook. Image of a medium blind hook.
Image of a small blind hook.
Image of a large hook with two hooks. Image of a medium hook with two hooks. Image of a small hook with two hooks.
Image of a large hook with three hooks.
Image of a medium hook with three hooks. Image of a small hook with three hooks.
And these are images of the scalpels with which one incises and excises boils and tumors.  They are of three types, for there are large ones, medium ones, and small ones. Image of a large scalpel.
Image of a medium scalpel.
Image of a small scalpel.
Their blades, with which one incises, are sharpened, and the other ends are not sharpened.  Rather, they are made this way so that one may use them in excising the boil when there is fear of cutting a vein or nerve, and so that the patient may be somewhat comfortable and find a little relief from the burning he feels when the tumor is excised.
And these are images of the probes. They are of three types, for there are large ones, medium ones, and small ones. Image of a large probe.
It is made of copper, similar to the style used for kohl, and at one end is something like a wide spoon of two layers, which has in its head a hidden scalpel blade, resembling a bird's tongue, that moves in and out as desired, as you see.
Images of the scalpels which are hidden between the fingers when lancing tumors, so that the patient does not feel them.  They are of three types, for there are large ones, medium ones, and small ones. Image of a large scalpel.
Images of the cupping instruments with which blood is drawn. They are of three types, for there are large ones, medium ones, and small ones. Image of the large cupping instrument.
They are made of copper or china, slightly elongated as you see, and thin.  These types of cupping instruments should be at hand, large and small, to quickly draw blood when necessary and when medicine is not available.
But they are not used to draw blood from every part of the body, but rather from fleshy areas, such as the muscles of the leg and thigh, the muscles of the arm, the breast, the abdomen, the groin, and similar moist fleshy parts.
And other small instruments can be made from them, resembling pistachio shells, in this manner:
Blood is drawn with them if it flows from a phlebotomy site or when a vein or artery is cut, and they may be made round in this manner:
Chapter Forty-Seven.
On treating the breasts of men.
The breasts of some people may swell at puberty, resembling women's breasts, remaining swollen and unsightly.  Whoever dislikes this should make a crescent-shaped incision on the breast, in this manner.
From line B to line C. Then remove all the fat, then fill the wound with cauterizing medication, then bring the edges of the wound together with sutures and treat it until it heals. If the breast droops and relaxes because of its size, as happens with women,
then it should be incised in its upper sides with two crescent-shaped incisions, each connecting to the other at their ends so that the larger line encircles the smaller, in this manner: From line B to line C, then remove the skin between the incisions and remove the fat, and use what we mentioned of sutures and dressings and whatever treatment is needed until it heals.
If you cannot remove all that needs to be removed because of the patient's anxiety or because of bleeding, then you should pack the wound with cotton soaked in caustic ointment and leave it until it consumes the remaining fat, then treat it until it heals.
Chapter forty-eight.
On the treatment of tumors that appear under the armpit.
These tumors which appear under the armpit are of the kind of hard swellings contained in a sac, and some contain fluids.  Those containing fluids should be incised with a crescent-shaped incision in this manner.
From line B to line C.  If all the fluid in the tumor is evacuated, pack it with used cotton and leave it until the next day, then remove the cotton.
And treat it with a suitable ointment until it heals. If the tumor is of the kind of hard swellings, incise it as we mentioned in the incision for swellings. If the wound progresses to the point where pus forms, cauterize it as we mentioned previously.
Chapter forty-nine.
On incising a tumor that appears near an artery or vein, called an aneurysm.
If an artery is injured and the skin above it heals, a tumor often results from this; similarly, a vein may also develop a swelling and tumor.
The signs by which one knows whether the tumor and swelling are from an artery or from a vein: if the tumor is from an artery, it is oblong and deep-seated in the body; and if you press the tumor with your finger, you feel as if it has a creaking sound.
That which is from a vein, the tumor is round on the surface of the body, and incision of these tumors is dangerous, especially those in the armpit, groin, and neck, and in many other places in the body where they are very large; therefore, one should avoid treating them with the iron.
And those that are also in the extremities or in the head should be avoided. As for those that are from a swelling of the mouth of an artery, make a longitudinal incision on the skin, then open the incision with hooks, then dissect the artery and free it from the membranes.
Until it is exposed, then insert a needle underneath and pass it to the other side, and tie the artery with a doubled thread in two places, as I have shown you in ligating the two arteries in the temples; then incise with a scalpel the area between the ligatures until all the blood in it is removed.
Then the tumor will resolve, and you use the treatment that produces pus until the ligatures fall off, then treat it with appropriate ointments until it heals.
If the tumor is from a severed vein, then you should grasp with your hand as much of the tumor as possible together with the skin, then insert a needle below the place you grasped with your hand and pass it through with a doubled thread until you bring it out on the other side. Then tie the tumor tightly with it, as I have described to you in tying the aneurysm from both sides with the ends of the thread. If you fear that the threads will slip, then insert another needle with another thread under the whole tumor at the intersection of the first needle.
And tighten your threads in four places, then incise the tumor in its middle until what is inside comes out. Then cut away the excess skin and leave what was tied. Then place on it a dressing that you have soaked in a syrup and oil. Then use treatment with twisting and ointments until it heals.
Chapter Fifty.
On the tumor which occurs from the twisting of a nerve.
Just as a tumor appears in an artery and vein, so a tumor appears in a nerve if a blow occurs to it or it occurs from excessive exertion or the like.  This is more common in the wrists and heels.
And in every place where the joints move, it is a  firm tumor, its color resembling the rest of the body. In most cases it is painless, and if pressed hard the patient feels something like numbness. The tumor is not deep within the body.
Rather, it is under the skin and moves in every direction, neither forward nor backward. As for that which is in the joints, it should not be treated with iron, for it may cause gangrene. As for that which is in the head or forehead...
then incise the skin with a scalpel. If the tumor is small, grasp it with forceps and cut it from its root. If it is large, suspend it with a hook and peel it off, then remove it and close the wound with sutures and treat it until it heals.
Chapter fifty-one.
Concerning the excision of warts which appear on the abdomen.
Many people develop warts on their abdomens and on the rest of their bodies. These are called fungal warts because of their resemblance to mushrooms. Their base is thin and their head is thick; their edges may be transformed, and some are small while others become very large.
I once saw a man who had two warts on his abdomen that were very much like mushrooms, white and thin at the base, their edges transformed and cracked, with moisture constantly flowing from them. I excised them; one weighed about eighteen ounces, the other about six.
In excising them, observe that if the patient is moist and the wart is white, moist, and thin at its base, then excise it with a broad scalpel. Have cautery irons ready in the fire, for often much blood flows when they are cut.
If the bleeding overwhelms you, cauterize it immediately. If you see that the patient is cowardly and fears being cut with iron, then take a strong lead thread and tie it tightly around the wart of this description, leaving it for two days, then increase the tightness of the lead, continuing to tighten it.
Do this until it affects the wart, until it is severed and falls off by itself without trouble. If the wart is thick at its base, there is some fear and risk in cutting it, especially if it is in the abdomen, but it may be possible to cut off half of it or a part of it.
Then cauterize it so that it does not return, and then treat it until the wound heals. Beware of attempting to cut a wart that is dark in color, insensitive, and unsightly, for it is a cancerous tumor, and we shall discuss cancer later.
Chapter fifty-two.
In the treatment of umbilical hernias.
An umbilical hernia has many causes: either from a rupture of the peritoneum of the abdomen, from which fat or intestine protrudes, as occurs in other hernias; or from blood emanating from a vein or artery, as previously mentioned; or from gas accumulating in it.
If it is due to a rupture of the peritoneum and protrusion of fat, then the color of the swelling will be similar to the color of the body, it will be soft without pain, and will appear in various positions. If it is due to the protrusion of the intestine, its position will be, as we have described, more variable. If you press it with your fingers, it disappears, then returns; and sometimes there is a gurgling sound. It increases greatly with the entry into the bath and with severe exertion. If it is due to moisture, it will be soft.
It does not disappear when you press it with your hand, nor does it increase or decrease. If it is due to blood, then, along with these signs, the swelling appears dark. If it is due to a growing flesh, then the swelling is firm, hard, and remains at a constant size.
If it is due to wind, its touch will be soft. The procedure in this case is that you should look: if the umbilical hernia is due to blood from an artery or vein, or wind, then you should refrain from treating it, for there is danger and deception in that, as I have informed you in the chapter where I mentioned the swellings which arise from the artery and vein.
If the umbilical hernia is due to the intestine or fat, then you should instruct the patient to restrain himself and stand erect, then you should draw a line with ink around the entire umbilicus. Then you should order him to lie on his back before you, then you should incise with a wide scalpel around the umbilicus at the place which you marked with ink, then you should extend the center of the swelling upwards with a large probe, then you should tie the incised area with a strong thread or silk tendon, tightly.
The knot of the ligature should be a slip-knot. Then you open the constricted center of the swelling above the ligature and insert your index finger, and seek the intestine. If you find that the ligature has grasped it, then loosen the slip-knot and push the intestine into the abdomen. If you find fat, then extend it with a probe.
And cut its excess. If an artery or vein obstructs you, then ligate it well and return to your work. Take two needles and thread them with strong threads, and insert the needles into the incision which you made around the swelling, crosswise, having passed them through. Then tighten the swelling in four places on the needles.
And if you wish, remove the needles and leave the area until the constricted flesh mortifies and falls off by itself, or cut it if it becomes thin and mortified. Then treat it with the appropriate ointments until it heals. If the umbilical hernia is from flesh that has grown there,
or from moisture, then it is necessary that you constrict the swelling as we said, and remove the blood or moisture that you find in it, then treat it with what will unite the area.
Chapter Fifty-Three.
On the treatment of cancer.
We have mentioned in the classification the types of cancer and how to treat it with medication, and the warning against treating it with iron, lest it ulcerate, and we mentioned the cancer that develops in the uterus and the warning against treating it.
And the ancients mentioned that when the cancer is in a place that can be completely excised, like the cancer that is in the breast or in the thigh and similar easily removed organs, especially if it is small and beginning, but when it is old and large, then you should not approach it.
For I have not been able to cure anyone of it, nor have I seen anyone before me achieve that, and the procedure, if it is possible as we said, is that you should first purge the patient of black bile several times, then you should bleed him if there is obvious fullness in the veins.
Then you should position the patient in a way that allows you to work, then you should apply to the cancer the appropriate hooks, then you should scrape it from every side with the skin completely, until nothing of its roots remains, and let the blood flow and do not stop it quickly.
Rather, squeeze the areas and drain all the thick blood with your hand or with whatever instruments you can, and if during the procedure you encounter great bleeding from a severed artery or vein, then cauterize the vessel until the bleeding stops, then treat it with other treatments until it heals.
Chapter fifty-four.
In the treatment of the bubo.
We have explained in the classification the types of dropsy, how the accumulation of water occurs, and the signs of each type and its treatment with medications.  That which is treated with iron is only the ascitic type, and the tympanitic type and the fleshy type are not at all approached with iron.
For that is deadly, if you have treated this ascitic type of bubo with medication and your treatment has not been effective, then look: if the patient has become extremely weak, or if he has another illness besides the bubo, such as…
cough or diarrhea or the like, then beware of treating him with iron, for it is dangerous. But if you see that the patient is strong, with no illness besides the bubo alone, and he is neither a child nor an old man, then the proper procedure is to have the patient stand before you. and an attendant behind him squeezing his belly with his hands and pushing the water downwards towards the pubic region, then you take a pointed scalpel in this manner:
pointed at both ends, long, with a defined tip like a scalpel, except that it has a slight curve so that it does not penetrate the intestine during the procedure and injure it. Then observe if the bubo has originated from the side of the intestines.
Then it is necessary to make the incision three fingers' breadth below the navel, parallel to it and above the pubic region. If the bubo has originated from liver disease, then let your incision be three fingers' breadth to the left of the navel; and if its origin is from spleen disease, then let the incision be on the right side by three fingers' breadth.
Nor should the incision be on the side on which the patient wishes to lie down, lest the discharge flow to that weak area. Then pierce the entire skin with the instrument, and insert the instrument into that incision, and raise your hand.
with the scalpel between the skin and the peritoneum, as if you are stripping it off, and the amount you strip off should be about the size of a fingernail or so. Then pierce the peritoneum until the scalpel reaches an empty space, which is where the water is. Then remove it and insert into the hole the instrument which has this shape.
It is like a tube made of a thin cane, made of silver or copper or smooth polished lead, having a small hole at its lower end and three holes in its sides, two on one side and one on the other, as you see.
And one may put its sharpened end in the form of a pen nib, in this shape:
At its upper end is a ring.  If the instrument reaches the water, it will immediately descend onto the instrument and drain a moderate amount of water. For if you drain more than necessary at once, the patient may die from the dissolution of his vital spirit.
Or he may suffer a faintness close to death. But drain it according to his strength and what the patient's condition indicates to you of the strength of his pulse and the good color, then remove the instrument and the water will be retained, for it will be retained immediately.
Because of the skin which covers the hole in the peritoneum, which I instructed you to prepare in that manner. Then return the instrument another day if you see the patient able to bear it.
And remove also a little of the water; do this for several days, being watchful and cautious against error, until only a little water remains. If you fear for the patient and leave a large quantity of water, treat him by burial in hot sand.
And profuse sweating in the bath and sun, and accustom him to thirst, and treat him with drying medicines until he recovers. And cauterize the stomach, liver, and spleen after removing the water, as I described above.
Chapter Fifty-five.
In the treatment of children who are born with their urinary passages imperforate, or with a narrow or misplaced opening.
Some boys may be born with their rectum imperforate; it is necessary to perforate it as soon as they are born.
With a very fine scalpel, in this manner:
Then place a thin lead nail in the opening, bind it and keep it there for three or four days. When he wants to urinate, remove it, and when he has finished, replace it. If you do not use the lead, the urine that flows to the place may not allow it to close.
As for one whose opening is narrow, it is treated with lead, as we have said, for many days until it widens.  Those whose opening is misplaced—some are born with the opening at the end of the rectum and cannot urinate forward.
until he raises the urethra upwards with his hand, and it is not born before because the semen cannot reach the uterus in a straight line; this is a very bad condition. The method of treatment is that the patient lies on his back.
Then stretch his rectum with your left hand with a strong pull and shave the head of the urethra with a sharp blade or scalpel, the size of a pen, or as if you were carving something so that its middle protrudes, resembling a penis, and the opening is in the middle as it should be.
And be careful during your work not to cause bleeding, for this often occurs; therefore, stop the bleeding and treat the wound until it heals.
Chapter Fifty-Six.
Concerning the ulcer that appears in the foreskin and penis, and the blackness, corruption, and adhesion of the foreskin to the penis.
This ulcer often appears in the urethra; it is a fleshy, rough growth, and there is benign and malignant.  The benign should be snagged with a fine hook.
And cut it until you have completely removed it, then apply a cotton swab soaked in Egyptian ointment, then treat it afterwards with palm ointment until it heals. But if the ulcer is malignant and dark in color, then you should cauterize it after cutting and removing it.
If the ulcer is in the foreskin of an uncircumcised man, and part of the ulcer is inside the foreskin and part outside, then you should remove the inside part first, until it heals; then treat the outside part.
Because if you treat both at the same time, you risk perforation of the foreskin.  Blackness and corruption may also appear in the labia and foreskin; you should excise everything that has blackened and is beginning to corrupt or has already corrupted.
Then apply honey mixed with crushed and sifted pomegranate peel and alum, then treat it with other remedies until it heals. If bleeding occurs, use cauterization with a crescent-shaped cautery iron in this manner:
For cauterization is beneficial in both cases, I mean bleeding and a corrupted wound. If the glans is eroded and completely destroyed at some point, then you should insert a lead tube into the urethra so the patient can urinate through it. As for the adhesion of the foreskin to the glans…
This adhesion occurs in those whose foreskin is intact and who have not been circumcised.  It may also occur from a wound or swelling.  You should separate it with a blunt scalpel until the bond is broken and the glans is freed on all sides.
If it is difficult to distinguish them completely, you should remove some of the glans and some of the foreskin.  Because the foreskin is thin, it may easily perforate due to its thinness. Then separate the foreskin from the glans with a thin linen cloth soaked in cold water so that they do not adhere again.
Then treat with an astringent drink until it heals.
Chapter fifty-seven.
On the cleansing of boys and the treatment of what befalls them of harm.
Circumcision is nothing other than the separation of a connection like other wounds, except that since it is done by our will and is especially used in boys, it is necessary that we describe the best practice in it.
And the easiest way leading to safety, so I say that the ancients did not mention circumcision in any of their books because it was not used in their laws, but rather it is something we have acquired.
by experience, and that is that I found the majority of surgeons and barbers using purification with the scalpel and scissors, and they use the curette and ligature with thread and cutting with the nail.  And I have tried all of these methods.
So I found nothing better than purification with scissors and ligature with thread, because purification with the scalpel often causes the skin to retract, because the skin of the foreskin is two layers, so perhaps the upper skin is cut and the lower layer remains.
He is forced to make another cut and renewed pain, and purification with the curette does not guarantee against cutting the end of the urethra because it might enter its opening. As for purification with the nail, the skin might slip and your work is spoiled or the boy's skin is naturally short...
so often they are born like that and do not need purification, and I have seen that.  As for purification with scissors and ligature with thread, experience revealed its advantage to me, because the cut of the scissors is even, because the blade above is like the blade below.
So when you squeeze your hand with the evenness of the two blades, you cut to a uniform measure and in one time, so the ligature of the thread becomes like a wall for the skin of the urethra from all sides, with no mistake at all. And the method of work first is to reassure the boy.
Especially if he is one who understands a little that you are only tying the thread in his urethra and leaving it until another day, then cheer him up and please him in every way you can and that he accepts with his mind, then make him stand before you upright.
And let him not be sitting, and hide the scissors in your sleeve or under your foot, so that the boy's eye does not fall upon it at all, nor on any of the instruments. Then you insert your hand into his urethra and inflate the skin and lift it upwards until the glans penis emerges.
Then you clean it from whatever dirt gathers there, then tie the marked place with a doubled thread, then tie a second ligature a little below it, then hold with your thumb and forefinger the lower ligature firmly, and cut between the two ligatures. Then quickly raise the skin upwards and bring out the glans penis, then let the blood flow a little, for it is better and reduces swelling of the urethra. Then wipe it with a damp cloth, then sprinkle on it some ash of burnt dry gourd, for it is the best I have tried, or finely ground alkanet, for that too is excellent.
Then quickly raise the skin upwards and bring out the glans penis, then let the blood flow a little, for it is better and reduces swelling of the urethra. Then wipe it with a damp cloth, then sprinkle on it some ash of burnt dry gourd, for it is the best I have tried, or finely ground alkanet, for that too is excellent. Then apply to the wound from above a compress of a cooked white egg, beaten with fresh sweet rose oil, and leave it on until the next day, then treat it with the rest of the treatment until it heals.
And this is an image of the scissors suitable for circumcision:
It should be sharp, cutting, not crooked, with a nail-like point, and the length of the two blades should be equal to the length of the handles. As for the mistake that occurs in circumcision, sometimes the entire inner skin or part of it is turned over during the cutting, so you should extend it immediately with your fingernail before the area swells.
And cut it evenly; if you cannot hold it with your fingernail, then pull it with a hook and cut it. If three days have passed and what is under the glans penis remains swollen and inflamed, leave it until the acute inflammation subsides, and then remove it gently.
And cut it as seems best to you, and be careful of the glans penis; for if something of the glans penis is cut, it does no harm, so treat it with that which heals the wound from the medicaments which we described in the chapter on medicaments.
And if more skin than necessary is cut and it retracts upwards, that also does not do much harm; treat it with what we have mentioned until it heals.
Chapter fifty-eight.
On the treatment of urine retained in the bladder.
Urine retained in the bladder is due to its obstruction by a stone, or clotted blood, or pus, or a growth, or something similar.  If you treat this with what we mentioned, the types of treatment described in the classification.
And if the urine does not flow and you see that its retention is due to a stone that has lodged in the neck of the bladder, then it is necessary that the patient sit on his knees, then a man should mount his back and press his belly towards his back, and the patient should hold himself as much as he can.
Then the neck of the bladder will be forced to push the stone backwards, and the urine will flow. If it does not flow with what we mentioned, and the matter becomes severe for the patient, then it is necessary to use its extraction with the instrument called a catheter, whose image is this:
It is made of silver and is thin, smooth, hollow like a bird's quill in thinness, about a span and a half long, with a gentle funnel at its head.  The way to draw off the urine with it is to take a doubled thread and tie to its end wool or cotton firmly.
And insert the end of the thread into the bottom of the catheter and cut with scissors if any of the wool is in excess so that it enters the tube and closes it like a button. Then lubricate the catheter with oil or butter or egg white and seat the patient on a chair.
And cleanse his bladder and urethra with moist ointments or oil and lukewarm water. Then gently insert the catheter into the urethra until it reaches the root of the urethra, then bend the urethra upwards towards the navel, then push the catheter inside.
Until the urethra is completely bent, then push the catheter inside until, when it reaches near the rectum, incline the penis downwards with the catheter inside, then push it until it reaches the bladder and the patient feels that it has reached something empty.
This is done in this manner because the passage through which the urine passes is tortuous. Then gently pull the thread with the wool; the urine will follow the wool. Then remove it and the urine will flow out, and replace the catheter.
Continue doing this until the bladder is emptied and the patient feels relief.
Chapter fifty-nine.
How to inject the bladder with a syringe.
And the instruments suitable for this are made of silver or hollow ivory, having a long tube as fine as pus.  And if you wish to instill waters and medicaments, this is done with an instrument called a syringe, and this is its image:.
It is made of silver or hollow ivory, having a long tube as fine as a hair, entirely hollow except for the tip, which is solid and has three holes, two on one side and one on the other, as you see.
And the hollow part in which the propellant is, should be only as large as to fit it without excess, so that when you draw up something of the fluids, it is drawn up, and when you push it, it is pushed out to a distance, like the syringe used to throw oil in naval battles.
Then if you wish to inject fluids into the bladder, you insert the tip of the syringe into the fluid and draw it upwards with the piston, then the fluid will be drawn into the body of the syringe; then you insert its tip into the urethra as we described in the catheters, and then you push the fluid with the piston.
Then that fluid will reach the bladder immediately, so that the patient feels it. And this is the image of a delicate clyster with which the bladder is injected:
It is made of silver or lead; its upper end resembles a small funnel, and below it is a groove in which the ligature is placed; then take a camel's bladder and put in it the fluid which you wish to inject into the bladder, and then tie it tightly between the two grooves with a doubled thread.
And warm that fluid slightly over the fire, then insert the tip of the clyster into the urethra, then press your hand firmly on the bladder with the fluid until the patient feels that the fluid has reached the bladder.
If you do not have a bladder, take a piece of parchment and make a circle from it and pierce it all around; then insert a strong thread into those holes as it goes round, then gather the circle as you gather a napkin, after having placed in it whatever you want of fluids, ointments and water.
Then tie it to the instrument and do with it as you did with the bladder, pressing with your hand until the fluid reaches the bladder.
Chapter Sixty.
On the extraction of a stone.
We have mentioned in the classification the types of stones and their treatment with medicines, and mentioned the difference between stones generated in the kidneys and stones generated in the bladder, and the signs of all of that, and mentioned the stone in which one operates with the hand and incision.
This is the stone generated specifically in the bladder, and that which lodges in the urethra, and I am describing that with clear explanation and brevity.
I say that the stone generated in the bladder most often affects boys, and among its signs is that urine exits the bladder resembling water in its thinness.
And sand appears in it, and he scratches his penis and plays with it, and often it hangs down, then spreads, and the anus protrudes with it in many of them.  It is easy to remove from boys until they reach fourteen years of age, and difficult in the elderly. As for young men, it is intermediate between those.
And the one whose stone is larger, his treatment is easier, and the small one is the opposite. So if we proceed to treatment, it is necessary first that the patient be given an enema to remove all the feces in his intestines, for it may prevent the presence of the stone upon examination.
Then the patient is taken by his feet, and shaken and jolted downwards so that the stone descends to the neck of the bladder, or he jumps from a high place repeatedly. Then you seat him before you, erect, and his hands under his thighs, so that the whole bladder inclines downwards, then you examine him.
And palpate him from the outside. If you feel the stone in the space, then immediately begin to incise upon it.  If it does not fall under your touch at all, then it is necessary to lubricate the index finger with oil from the left hand if the patient is a boy, or the middle finger.
If he is a fully developed boy, then insert it into his anus and search for the stone until, when it falls under your finger, you move it little by little to the neck of the bladder. Then press upon it with your finger and push it outwards towards the place you wish to incise.
And you order a servant to press the bladder with his hand, and you order another servant to stretch with his right hand the labia upwards, and with his other hand to stretch the skin beneath the labia away from the place where the incision will be. Then take the lancet whose shape is this:
And incise between the anus and the labia, not in the middle, but towards the left buttock. The incision should be upon the stone itself, your finger in the anus, and you press it outwards obliquely, so that the incision is wide on the outside and narrow on the inside, to the extent that allows the stone to exit.
Not larger, for perhaps the finger in the anus will press the stone during the incision, and it will exit without difficulty. And know that there may be stones that have angles and edges, making their exit difficult for that reason.
And some are smooth, resembling an acorn and round, so their exit is easy.  But if it has angles and edges, then increase the incision slightly. And if it does not exit in this way, then you should contrive a way, either to grasp it with a strong forceps whose end is like a file.
To firmly grasp the stone so it does not escape, or else to insert beneath it a delicate instrument with a hooked end.  And if you are not able to remove it, widen the incision slightly. And if you are overcome by blood, staunch it with alum.
If there are more than one, push the largest first towards the opening of the bladder, then incise upon it, then push the smaller one afterwards.  And do likewise if there are more than two.  If it is very large, then it is folly to make a large incision upon it, for it exposes the patient to one of two things.
Either death, or a constant dribbling of urine because the wound will not heal at all. But try to push it out, or contrive to break it with forceps until you remove it in pieces.
When you have finished your work, cauterize the wound with costus, aloes, and myrrh, and bandage it. And place over it a cloth moistened with oil and vinegar, or with rose oil and cold water, to soothe the hot inflammation. Then let the patient lie on his back, and do not untie the bandage until the third day.
When it is loosened, wash the area with plenty of water and oil, then treat it with palm ointment and basil ointment until it heals. If excessive hot inflammation, ulceration, and the like occur in the wound, such as blood clotting in the bladder and preventing the flow of urine – which is known by the passage of blood with urine –
insert your finger into the wound and remove that blood, for if it remains it will lead to the corruption and putrefaction of the bladder. Then wash the wound with vinegar, water, and salt, and treat each type of [problem] with its appropriate treatment until it heals.
In all these treatments, it is necessary to bind and draw together the thighs to secure the medicines that are applied to the area. If the stone is small and has lodged in the passage of the penis and prevented the flow of urine, treat it as I have described before it necessitates incision.
Often I have dispensed with incision by this treatment, which I have tested, and it is that you take a probe of steel, which is of this form:
The end is triangular, sharp, and fixed in a shaft; then take a thread and tie it around the penis below the stone, lest it return to the bladder; then gently insert the steel probe into the urethra until the probe reaches the stone itself.
And turn the probe in the stone itself little by little, aiming to pierce it until you pass through it to the other side; then the urine will flow immediately.  Then press your hand on what remains of the stone outside the penis, for it will crumble and be expelled with the urine, and the patient will recover.
If this treatment is not feasible for you due to some impediment, then tie a thread below the stone and another thread above the stone, then incise upon the stone in the penis itself between the two ligatures, and then remove it.
Then untie the ligature and clean the clotted blood which has formed in the wound.  The reason for tying the thread below the stone is to prevent it from returning to the bladder, and the other ligature from above is so that when the thread is untied after removal of the stone, the skin may return to its place and cover the wound.
Therefore, when you tie the upper thread, you should lift the skin upwards so that it will return when you are finished and cover the wound, as we said.
Chapter sixty-one.
On the removal of stones in women.
Stones rarely develop in women. If a woman does develop a stone, its treatment is difficult and impossible for many reasons. One is that the woman may be a virgin, and another is that you will not find a woman who permits herself to a physician.
If she is chaste or one of those with whom marriage is forbidden, and thirdly, you will not find a woman skilled in this craft, especially in working with the hands; and fourthly, the place of incision for the stone in women is far from the location of the stone, thus requiring a deep incision.
And in that there is danger. If necessity demands it, then a skilled female physician should be sought, but they are rarely found. If you cannot find one, seek a chaste and gentle male physician, or bring a skilled midwife experienced in women's matters, or a woman who knows something of this craft.
Then prepare her and instruct her to do everything you order her to do, first examining for the stone.  If the woman is a virgin, the finger should be inserted into her rectum to search for the stone; if found, press it with the finger.
Then order the incision. If she is not a virgin but a married woman, instruct the midwife to insert her finger into the patient's vagina and search for the stone after placing her left hand on the bladder and pressing it firmly.
If she finds it, she should move it from the mouth of the bladder downwards as far as possible until she reaches the groin.  Then she should make an incision opposite the middle of the vulva at the root of the thigh, whichever side allows it and where she feels the stone.
Her finger should not leave the stone, pressing it downwards. The initial incision should be small, then the dilator should be inserted into that small incision. If she feels the stone, she should enlarge the incision as much as is needed for the stone to come out. Know that there are many kinds of stones.
Some are small, some large, smooth, rough, long, round, and branched.  Know their types so you can know what to do. If bleeding is excessive, sprinkle powdered verdigris on the area and leave it for an hour until the bleeding stops, then resume your work.
Until the stone comes out.  Prepare the instruments mentioned for removing stones from men, to assist you in your work. If bleeding is excessive and you know from the pulse that it is from a severed artery, apply styptics to the area.
And bind it tightly with bandages, leave it and do not return to it, and leave the stone and do not remove it, for the patient may die. Then treat the wound. If the severity of the bleeding subsides after a few days and the area becomes infected, return to your work until the stone comes out.
Chapter Sixty-Two.
On the incision on the water bladder.
Hydrocele is an accumulation of moisture in the tunica vaginalis, which is under the skin of the scrotum surrounding the testicle.  It may be in a special membrane prepared by nature in one part of the testicle.
So that one might think it is another testicle.  It is between the skin of the scrotum and the tunica vaginalis that we mentioned, but this only rarely occurs. This hydrocele is generated from weakness affecting the testicles, so that this substance collects there. It may also arise from a blow to the testicles.
This moisture is of many colours: it may be yellowish, or bloody red, or dark, or white and watery, which is most common.  The signs by which it is known are:
Where the water collects, if it is in the tunica vaginalis that we mentioned, then the swelling is somewhat elongated and round, like the shape of an egg, and the testicle does not appear because the moisture surrounds it on all sides.
If the moisture is in a special membrane, then the swelling is round on one side of the testicle.
Therefore, one imagines that it is another testicle. If the moisture is between the skin of the scrotum and the tunica vaginalis, then it is palpable. But if you wish to know the colour of the moisture, puncture the swelling with the square trocar whose image we have shown previously; then judge what is inside according to what comes out through the trocar.
If we proceed to treatment with cautery, you should order the patient to be bled if he is able and you see that his body is full. Then he should lie on his back on something slightly raised, with many cloths placed underneath him. Then you should sit on his left.
And you should order a servant to sit on his right, stretching his penis towards one side of the scrotum and towards the groin. Then you take a broad scalpel and incise the scrotum lengthwise in the middle, close to the pubis.
Make the incision straight, parallel to the line that divides the scrotum in half, until you reach the tunica vaginalis.  Then dissect it and be careful not to tear it. Your dissection should be more from the side attached to the testicle, and continue the dissection as much as you can.
Then widely evacuate the watery tunica vaginalis and remove all the water. Then separate the edges of the incision with hooks and stretch the tunica upwards, without touching the containing scrotal skin. Cut the tunica however you can cut it, either all at once or piece by piece.
Especially its thin side, for if you do not completely cut it, you cannot be sure that the water will not return. If the testicle protrudes outside its skin during your work, then, after you finish cutting the tunica, return it, then join the edges of the scrotal skin with sutures.
Then treat it like other wounds until it heals. If the testicle is already corrupted by another disease, you should ligate the vessels in the spermatic cord for fear of bleeding, then cut the testicle from the spermatic cord and remove the testicle, and treat it as we have mentioned.
If the fluid is collected on both sides, know that there are two hydroceles. Incise the other side as you did the first, or if it is easier to do it all at once, do so.  Then wipe away the blood.
And insert into the incisions wool that you have soaked in oil or rose ointment, and on the outside place more wool that you have soaked in wine and oil, and spread it over the testicles and the abdomen, and place folded cloths, which are the pledgets, on top. And tie it on top with a bandage which has six ends, in this manner:
Then two cloths are taken, sewn together, and stuffed with fluffed wool in this way.  Make the ends that bind it from wet cotton or wool, and gather them tightly in the waistband of the trousers; one end is taken to the buttocks towards the back.
The second is taken towards the pubis, and the two ends to the thighs below, and the remaining two ends to the groins, and all the binding is gathered in the waistband of the trousers. This hydrocele can also be treated by cauterization instead of incision with an iron.
This is done by taking a smooth, knife-like cautery and incising the skin of the scrotum with it while it is hot, as we have described, until the white peritoneum containing the water is exposed. Then take another cautery of this shape:
It resembles the Greek eye.  Then sear that peritoneum with it while hot until all the moisture is expelled. Then stretch the peritoneum with hooks and flay the containing layer with the cautery and cut it as much as you can until you excise it all, taking care that the testicle is not touched by the fire.
Know that this procedure is safer and prevents more bleeding, and is better than the procedure with incision. If during the incision or cauterization you encounter a hot swelling, bleeding, or something else, then you should treat whatever arises according to the appropriate treatment as described before.
If the patient is cowardly and cannot endure this procedure because of its ugliness, then use cauterization as I describe, if it is confirmed by the evidence presented earlier.
If the hydrocele is watery, then the patient should sit on a high chair, then sear the lower part of the swelling with a wide scalpel, making the cauterization along the length of the body. The opening should be wide so that all the water flows out.  Then place cotton on the area and bind it.
Leave it to drain the remaining water, then treat it until the wound heals. If the water does not flow out during cauterization, it is because the tunica albuginea obstructs the opening of the wound and prevents the water from flowing out.
Then you should insert a goose feather or the instrument for extracting the water of hydroceles, the image of which has been shown previously, or slightly enlarge the opening of the wound.
Know that the water may return and accumulate after six months or so. If it accumulates, cauterize it in the same manner, and the patient should protect himself during those days.
Chapter Sixty-Three.
On the incision on the fleshy membrane and its treatment.
Know that an incision on this membrane is one of the dangerous things leading to death in most instances; therefore, we advise leaving it alone and being safe from it. I will mention the treatment and the types of swelling.
I say that many swellings may occur in the bodies which are composed of the testicles, and this is due to many causes, either from a sharp humour which descends to the testicles, or from a blow. The color of the swelling is the same as the color of the body and it does not contain water.
And the swelling may be hard, and perhaps the swelling may be hardened, its color being like lead and without feeling.  It may be from the complication and swelling of the arteries, as has been mentioned before, or from swelling of the veins. That which is from the swelling of the arteries is known by the spreading of the swelling.
If you press it with your fingers, it does not spread.  It should not be incised at all. As for that which is from the swelling of the veins, nothing of it spreads when pressed with the fingers. This type can be incised, as well as the other flesh.
And that is to incise the skin of the testicle, then extend the testicle upwards and bring it out from the white peritoneum, and free the spermatic cord from the vessels, and tie the vessels, and cut the spermatic cord after freeing it from every side of the testicle; if the testicle has adhered to that growing flesh.
Then it is necessary to remove the testicle and cut it. And if the adhesion is between some of the peritonea or between the vessels, then it is necessary to free all that adhesion and cut it with a circular cut.
If the growth of flesh is in the place of adhesion which is from behind, then it is necessary to cut all of it and remove the testicle as we said. When your work is completed, dress the wound with wool soaked in rose oil and syrup, then treat it with other treatments until it heals.
Chapter sixty-four.
In the treatment of hydrocele with a hernia.
A hernia is a twisted tumor, somewhat twisted, resembling a bunch of grapes, with relaxation of the spermatic cords and difficulty for the patient in movement, exercise, and walking.  The treatment of this condition is similar to what has been mentioned previously.
However, it is necessary to mention the procedure as the ancients did. I say that it is necessary that the patient sit on a high chair, then push the spermatic cord downwards, then grasp the skin of the testicle with your fingers along with the vessels which are near the penis.
And let your assistant hold it and stretch it tightly. Then incise with a wide, sharp scalpel, making an oblique incision along the vessels until the vessels are exposed. Then dissect from each side as I described to you in the dissection of the arteries in the armpits, then insert a needle with a doubled thread.
And tie it at the first point where the hernia appeared and tie it also at its end, then incise it in the middle with a vertical incision along the body and remove what has collected in it of the foul, putrid fluids.
Then treat the wound with the treatment of other wounds that you want to heal, to allow the vessels that nourish one of the spermatic cords to fall away, there is no harm in that. If the hernia affects all the vessels, then it is necessary to remove one of the spermatic cords with the vessels, lest the testicle be deprived of nourishment. before cutting the vessels, so that they wither and are of no use.
Chapter sixty-five.
On the treatment of intestinal hernia.
This hernia occurs from a fissure that appears in the peritoneum extending over the abdomen towards the groins from the abdominal cavity, so the intestine descends from that rupture into one of the spermatic cords.
And this rupture is either from a fissure in the peritoneum or from its extension, and these two types occur from many causes, either a blow, a jump, a shout, or lifting something heavy, and so on.  Its sign, if it is from an extension of the peritoneum, is that it occurs little by little over a long time.
It does not occur suddenly, and the swelling is even towards the depth because the peritoneum constricts the intestine. Its sign, if it is from a fissure in the peritoneum, is that from its beginning it causes great pain suddenly, and the swelling is visibly different under the skin nearby.
That is by the exit of the intestine and its passage outside of the peritoneum.  The omentum may also exit with the intestine; this hernia is then called intestinal and omental. It may be with wind, and feces may flow into the intestine and be retained there, resulting in the death of the patient.
Because it causes severe pain and gurgling, especially if constricted. Treatment of this type of ailment with cautery is dangerous, so one should be wary of resorting to it. The method of treatment is to instruct the patient to return the intestine into his abdomen by hand if it is possible for it to return.
Then he lies on his back in your hands and raises his legs. Then you stretch the skin next to the groin upwards and incise all the skin of the scrotum lengthwise. Then you insert hooks into the edges of the incision to the extent needed to open the incision with them.
The incision should be large enough to allow the testicle to emerge. Then you dissect the membranes under the skin of the scrotum until the white, hard peritoneum is exposed on all sides. Then you insert your index finger next to the testicle.
Between the white peritoneum under the skin of the testicle and the second peritoneum, and you separate the adhesions behind the testicle. Then you draw it inward with your right hand into the scrotum's skin, while simultaneously stretching the white peritoneum upward with your left hand and lifting the testicle with the peritoneum toward the incision.
You instruct the assistant to pull the testicle upward, and you completely separate the adhesions from behind. You explore with your finger lest there be any twisted intestine in the hard white peritoneum; if you find any, push it down into the abdomen.
Then you take a needle with thick thread twisted from ten threads and insert it at the end of the peritoneum under the scrotum's skin next to the incision. Then you cut the ends of the thread's loop so that there are four threads. Then you place some of them on top of each other in a firm manner and tie the peritoneum—which we said is under the scrotum's skin—tightly on two sides.  Then you also twist the ends of the threads and tie them tightly so that nothing from the vessels that nourish it can reach it. Lest a hot swelling result from that, and make a second ligature outside the first ligature, less than two fingers away from it. After these two ligatures, leave the amount of a finger's bone width of the peritoneum under the scrotum's skin.
Lest a hot swelling result from that, and make a second ligature outside the first ligature, less than two fingers away from it. After these two ligatures, leave the amount of a finger's bone width of the peritoneum under the scrotum's skin. And cut all the rest in a circular manner and remove the testicle with it. Then incise the lower part of the scrotum's skin, making an incision from which blood and pus flow, as we described previously. Then use wool soaked in oil and place it in the wound, and use the ligature which we described.
And the white peritoneum, which we mentioned after cutting it, may be cauterized to guard against bleeding, for that often occurs.  And leave the ligature until it falls off by itself. If it is slow to fall off, then loosen it with warm water and apply something that causes it to sweat until it falls off.
Then treat the wound with all the treatments for wounds until it heals.
Chapter sixty-six.
Concerning the windy hernia.  This windy hernia—I have not seen anyone dare to treat it with iron. The ancients mentioned that it should be done as we described in the hernia with a sac, that is, that the vessels should be gently ligated below after the incision.
Then incise in the middle and treat the tumor with what opens it until the vessels fall away, and treat the wound as we mentioned until it heals.
Chapter sixty-seven.
Concerning the hernia which is in the groin.
A hernia may appear in the groin, as we said, so that the place swells but nothing of the intestine descends into the scrotum; and if it descends, it is slight and returns at all times.
But if time passes, the fissure in the peritoneum increases until the intestine and epiploon descend into the scrotum; and this happens from the extension of the peritoneum which is in the groin, as we said. That is because the peritoneum extends, then relaxes and the place swells and protrudes, and its treatment is by cauterization, as I have previously described.
It may also be treated with an iron instrument in this manner: the patient lies on his back between your hands, then you incise the swollen, protruding hernia transversely to the extent of three fingers, then you loosen the peritoneal membranes which are under the skin.
Until, when the white peritoneum which follows is uncovered, you take a suture and place it on the protruding part of the peritoneum and press it into the depth of the abdomen, then you sew the two protruding parts together at the end of the suture of the peritoneum, and you join one to the other with the suture.
Then you pull the end of the suture and do not cut the peritoneum at all, nor touch the testicle or anything else, as I have taught you in the treatment of intestinal hernia, then you treat it with the treatment of wounds.
If the sutures break, I clean them and dress the wound until it heals, for the peritoneum contracts and the protrusion of the hernia does not increase.
Cauterization is better in this location because it is closer to safety.
Chapter sixty-eight.
On the relaxation of the skin of the scrotum.
The skin of the scrotum often relaxes in some people without the flesh inside relaxing, and its appearance is unsightly.  Whoever wishes to treat it should lay the patient on his back.
And he cuts all the relaxed skin over the thick skin, then brings the lips together. And if you wish, first sew the relaxed excess skin with three or four stitches, ensuring the stitching is secure, then cut between the stitches.
Then treat it like any other wound until it heals and the stitches fall out.
Chapter sixty-nine.
On castration.
Castration is forbidden in our religion.
Therefore, I should not mention it in this book. However, I have mentioned it for two reasons:  one, so that the physician may know about it if asked and know how to treat someone who has undergone it; and the other, because we often need to castrate some animals for our benefit.
Such as lambs, goats, cats, and similar animals.  I say that castration is of two types: either by crushing or by incision and cutting.  That which is by crushing, its method is that we place the animal in hot water until its testicles relax, soften, and hang down.
Then crush them with your hand until they dissolve and are not perceptible to the touch. As for castration by incision and cutting, you should hold the animal and squeeze the skin of its testicles with your left hand, then tie the suspensory ligaments and make a single incision on each testicle.
So that when the testicles emerge, cut them after you have peeled them and do not leave on them any of the membranes except the thin membrane that is on the vessels. This type of castration is better than that which is by crushing.
Because crushing may leave something of the testicles, so the animal may desire mating. Then treat the wound until it heals.
Chapter Seventy.
In the treatment of the hermaphrodite.
The hermaphrodite in men is of two types: one is that which appears in the area behind the scrotum or in the skin of the scrotum between the testicles, a shape like a woman's vulva, with hair, and urine may flow from that which is in the skin of the scrotum.
As for women, there is one type, and it is above the vulva on the pubis like small male testicles, protruding outwards; one is like a man's penis, and the two are like testicles. And the treatment of the three types.
The two types in men and the one type in women: those superfluous tissues should be cut away until their trace is gone, then treated with the treatment of other wounds until it heals. As for the second type in men, from which urine flows, which is in the skin of the scrotum, there is no action to be taken, nor is there any benefit in seeing the testicles.
Chapter seventy-one.
On the excision of the clitoris and the protruding flesh from the vulvas of women.
The clitoris may exceed the natural amount, so that it becomes large and ugly in appearance, and in some women it may grow large until it resembles that of men and becomes suitable for intercourse.
You should grasp the excess of the clitoris with your hand or with forceps and cut it off, and do not be excessive in cutting, especially in the depth of the root, lest bleeding occur.
Then treat it with the treatment of wounds until it heals. As for the growing flesh, it is flesh that grows in the mouth of the womb until it fills it.
And sometimes it protrudes outwards like a tail. Therefore, some of the ancients call it the "tail" disease.  You should cut it off in the same way as you cut off the clitoris and treat it until it heals.
Chapter Seventy-Two.
In the treatment of prolapse.
Prolapse is when a woman's vagina is not perforated, or the perforation is small. This can be either congenital or acquired.  The acquired type results from a previously existing condition, and it may be due to excessive growth of flesh.
or a thin or thick membrane. This may be located in the depth of the uterus, or in its sides, or above or below it. It prevents intercourse, conception and childbirth, and may also prevent menstruation.  This is diagnosed by a midwife's examination.
If the obstruction is visible and near, then if it is not visible, she should examine it with her fingers or a probe. If the obstruction is a thin membrane and is close to the labia, then proceed to pierce it.  This is done by placing something like pledgets on the labia, then placing both thumbs together.
The woman lies on her back with her legs spread. Then the labia are strongly stretched until the thin membrane is pierced and the obstruction is opened. Then take wool, soak it in oil, and apply it to the area. The woman should have intercourse every day so that the area does not close again.
If the membrane is thick and dense, it should be incised with a wide scalpel resembling an Asian leaf. If the obstruction is due to excessive flesh growth, then hang it up with hooks and cut it.  You should have styptic medicines at hand which do not sting, such as kaolin, acacia, and frankincense, mixed with egg white.
Then use a wide lead tube so that the wound does not close quickly. Keep it in place for several days, and use a dry linen wick, then treat it with other healing methods until it heals.  Other flesh growths may occur in the uterus; these should be cut in the same way.
Unless it is a cancerous tumor. A cancerous tumor in the uterus should never be treated with iron instruments.
Chapter Seventy-Three.
On the treatment of hemorrhoids, warts, and red sores that appear in the vulva of women.
As for hemorrhoids, they are a swelling of the mouths of the veins, so that much blood constantly flows from them. If hemorrhoids persist, they become warts.  Their types and symptoms were mentioned in the classification, and we will mention them here.
What accepts treatment and what does not accept treatment. I say that hemorrhoids and warts, if they are deep within the uterus and do not appear to the touch, have no treatment with iron instruments.  Those that are at the mouth of the uterus and can be felt are the ones that are treated.
Then the woman should enter a cool place, then stretch the warts with a scraper or a rough cloth, and cut them at their base. Then apply to them, when the blood flows, one of the styptics that stop blood without causing ulceration.
Such as acacia, alchemilla, frankincense, and the like. Then raise her legs to the wall for an hour, then lower them into cold water. If the bleeding continues, seat her in a decoction of sumac, pomegranate peels, oak galls and the like. Then take barley flour, knead it with honey and vinegar.
And apply it as a compress to her back. If the bleeding stops, otherwise, apply cupping glasses to the loins and breasts without restriction. Then take wool, dip it in the juice of the plantain, or the juice of verbascum, or the juice of willow branches with oak gall decoction, and apply it to the area.
If the swelling subsides, treat the area with ointment until it heals. As for the red pimples, they resemble the heads of millet, rough in appearance.  It is necessary to cut off what appears of them, as I have described for warts, and treat them until they heal.
Chapter Seventy-Four.
On the suppuration which occurs in the uterus.
Many types of tumors may occur in the uterus, such as cancer, hard tumors, ulcers, fistulas, phagedena,  fistulas, hemorrhoids, fissures, warts, and hot tumors. I have mentioned all these diseases, their types and signs in the classification.
It is necessary to mention in this chapter the hot tumor which occurs in the uterus, if it is one of the tumors which collect for a time, how its suppuration is done with iron.  You should look, for if the pain of the tumor is initially sharp, with throbbing, inflammation and fever,
and you see it red when touched, do not hasten to its suppuration, and treat it with what aids in maturation, until these symptoms subside. Then you should make the woman sit on a chair with two seats and lean on its back.
and bring her legs together towards the lower abdomen, her thighs being apart, and her arms under her knees, and bind them with a suitable bandage.
Then the midwife sits on the right side and uses the instrument with which the mouth of the uterus is opened, the image of which comes later. If you wish to use this instrument, you should estimate with a probe the depth of the woman's uterus, lest that which enters from the instrument be more than the depth of the uterus.
This harms the patient. If the instrument is longer than the depth, then pledgets should be placed on the lip of the cervix to prevent the entire instrument from entering the depth of the uterus, and the spiral which runs in the instrument should be on the upper side.
And you hold the instrument, and the attendant turns the spiral until the cervix is opened.  When the abscess appears and is touched by hand and is soft and thin, then you should incise it at its head with a wide scalpel. When all the matter has been evacuated,
a soft tent soaked in rose oil or green oil containing some astringent should be placed in the wound. The tent should come out from the incision in the cervix, and clean wool soaked in water in which alum has been boiled should be placed externally on the uterus and on the pubis.
Then treat it after two days with the ointment which is suitable for that until it heals.
And the uterus and wound may be washed by injecting with honey and water, then with water in which licorice root or long zedoary has been boiled, then return to the ointment, if the abscess is hidden inside the uterus.
Then you should refrain from treating it with iron, but it should be treated with what we mentioned in the classification.
Chapter seventy-five.
In teaching midwives how to treat living fetuses if they emerge in an unnatural manner.
The midwife should first know the form of natural childbirth.  Among its signs is if you see the woman straining downwards and yearning to breathe the air, and what she suffers from in childbirth becomes easier for her.
And the expulsion of the fetus is quickened. Know that this childbirth is in the natural manner, and its expulsion is head-first, with the placenta attached to it or hanging from its navel. If you see these signs, then you should press her abdomen so that the fetus comes out quickly.
For if it descends head-first, the placenta descends with it and is cleansed of those impurities in a good way. Whatever is other than this childbirth is unnatural and blameworthy, for the fetus may emerge feet-first, or its hands and feet may emerge before its head.
Or one hand or one foot, or its head and hand may emerge, or it may emerge folded, and perhaps it may be turned on its back, and similar blameworthy forms.  The midwife should therefore be skillful and gentle with all these things, and beware of slips and mistakes.
And I am explaining each form and how to deal with it, so that you may understand and deal with it. If the fetus emerges head-first – the natural emergence – and this is difficult for the woman and the labor pains are severe for her, and you see that her strength has weakened, then seat her on a chair and instruct women to support her.
And pack her womb with cooked fenugreek and moist ointments, then the midwife inserts a small scalpel between her fingers and cuts the placenta with it, or cuts it with her fingernail, until the moisture within flows out, and she presses the woman's abdomen until the fetus descends.
If it does not descend, then she should inject the woman with fenugreek saliva mixed with shirāj ointment, then after the injection she should instruct her to cough and sneeze her with a kandaś, and hold her mouth and nose, for the fetus will emerge immediately. If the hands of the fetus emerge first, then they should be gently returned little by little.
If they do not readily enter, place the woman on a raised platform and raise her legs upwards, then shake the platform on the ground while the woman holds on so that she does not fall when it is shaken. If the hands do not enter and the fetus is dead, cut them off and pull out the rest of the fetus.
Or tie his hands with a cloth and pull them moderately, then he will emerge.  The emergence of the fetus with its feet: If the fetus emerges with its feet, then they should be pushed upwards, then the fetus should be turned little by little until it is straightened, then take one of its feet and extend it little by little.
If they emerge to the thighs, instruct her to cough and sneeze her with the kandaś, then he will emerge. If he does not emerge as we described, otherwise return the fetus little by little until you make it into its natural form, then it will emerge smoothly. If it is prevented by all that we described,
Take some saliva of the Khatmi plant and saliva of fenugreek and shirāj ointment and dissolved gum arabic, and grind everything well in a mortar, then apply it to the woman's vulva and lower abdomen, then seat her in lukewarm water until it reaches the sharasif.
If you see that her lower part has softened, make a pessary for her from myrrh and she will tolerate it. If the pessary stays for an hour, seat her on a chair, then make her sneeze, close her mouth and nose, and gently squeeze her lower abdomen, then the fetus will emerge immediately. The emergence of the fetus on its knees and hands:
If it emerges in this manner, gradually insert its hands, then the woman lies on her back and hangs her hips downwards while lying on a bed and clasps her hands, then gently squeeze above her abdomen. Then remove the pillows from under her legs so that her lower part is raised. If the fetus does not emerge, take both her legs and move them vigorously, then gently squeeze above the sharasif until the fetus ascends upwards, then the midwife inserts her hand and straightens the fetus little by little.
And order the woman to strain until the fetus emerges. The emergence of the fetus sideways, hanging by one of its hands.  Gently try to return its hand; if you are unable to return it, raise the woman and make her walk; if she is unable to walk, let her lie down.
on her bed and shake her legs vigorously; then use the poultice which I described from the saliva. If labor pains seize her, seat her on a chair, then work at returning the hand and straightening the fetus into its natural form, and make the woman sneeze and order her to strain until it emerges.
The emergence of the fetus on its back, extending its hands, and its face towards its mother's back. The midwife should grasp the hand of the fetus, then turn it little by little and gently straighten it. Once straightened, apply to its anterior what we described of the ointment and poultices.
Then tell her to move little by little. If she does that, seat her on the chair and tell her to lean to the right side, then tell her to strain and make her sneeze with the kands [sneezing powder]; then it will emerge. The emergence of the fetus erect on its side.
If it descends to the mouth of the womb in this manner with the placenta, split the placenta with your fingernail until it is emptied of moisture. If it adheres to the face and neck of the fetus, cut it from the navel lest it suffocate and die; then push the fetus inwards until it is as it should be.
And tell the woman to strain repeatedly; then it will emerge easily. The emergence of twins or multiple fetuses. Know that twins are often born, and three or four may be born and live, although that is rare; as for five, it is something outside of nature and they do not live at all.
And they are surrounded, even if numerous, by one placenta, and they are separated by a membranous partition between them, attached to the navel of each one.  They may emerge like a single fetus, naturally and easily, or they may emerge in a difficult manner as we described.
If some of them are difficult at birth and become as we have described in the unnatural forms, treat them as we described. And let the midwife be gentle and do what she does with gentleness and slowness, and devise for each form what means are available to her that lead to safety.
Mention of what is conceived in the womb of fetuses that are aborted. One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, and more than ten may be conceived in the womb. It has been confirmed to me that a woman aborted seven, and another fifteen, all of them conceived.
By the estimation of the All-Mighty, the All-Knowing. All of this should be in the knowledge of the midwife, for perhaps such a thing may occur to her someday, so she may confront it appropriately.
Chapter seventy-six.
In the extraction of the dead fetus.
If you treat the dead fetus with what I mentioned in the section on treatment and it does not come out, and you are forced to use your hand, then you should look. If the woman is strong and healthy and has none of the symptoms that one fears may cause her harm, then the woman should lie on her back on a bed.
And her head should be inclined downward and her legs raised, and a servant should support her from both sides, or she should be tied to the bed, lest her body be pulled when the fetus is extracted.
Then moisten her vulva with moist ointments along with the saliva of the mallow and fenugreek and flaxseed. Then the midwife should anoint her hand with these ointments and saliva, then gently insert it into the womb, then seek with it a place to insert the hooks into the fetus, and the suitable places for that.
See, if the fetus is positioned to descend headfirst, then insert the hooks into its eyes or the nape of its neck or its mouth or its palate or under its chin or collarbone or in the areas near the ribs or under the clavicles.
But if it descends feet first, then [insert the hooks] in the groin and the middle ribs.  It is necessary to hold the hook with the right hand and place its bend between the fingers of the left hand, and gently insert the hand and insert a hook into some of those places we mentioned.
Until you reach something empty, then insert another hook opposite it, or a third if needed, so that the traction is even and does not lean to one side. Then pull with a straight pull, and the pull should not be straight only, but should be moved to every side.
So that its exit is facilitated, as is done with a tooth when it is extracted.  It is necessary during this to relax the pull; if it is obstructed on one side, then the midwife should anoint some fingers with ointment and insert them from that side to rotate what is obstructed. If some of the fetus emerges, then move the hooks to other places.
It is slightly elevated. Do this until the entire fetus emerges. If a hand emerges before anything else and cannot be returned because of its compression, then it is necessary to wrap a cloth around it and then pull it until, when it is completely out, you cut it.
Either at the joint of the wrist or at the elbow.  Thus it is necessary to do in the other hand and in the feet. If the head of the fetus is large and experiences pressure in its exit, or if there is collected water in its head, then it is necessary to insert a hooked scalpel between the fingers.
And split the head with it so that the water emerges, or extract it with the instrument called the *mishdaakh*, whose image comes with the images of the other instruments in the chapter which follows this.
Similarly, do this if the fetus is naturally large-headed. Then it is necessary to split the skull or crush it with the *mishdaakh* as we said, then extract the bones with hooks. If the head emerges and is compressed at the clavicle, then let it be split so that the moisture in the chest is poured out.
For then the chest will be constricted. If the chest is not constricted and its removal is not possible, cut it as much as you can. If the lower abdomen is swollen or if there is a swelling in it, then it is necessary to incise it so that the moisture flows from it.
If the fetus is on its feet, then pulling it is easy and straightening it to the mouth of the womb is simple.  If it is compressed at the abdomen or chest, then it is necessary to pull it with a cloth which you have wrapped around your hand, and split the abdomen or chest until what is in them flows out.
If all the limbs are extracted and the head is retracted and retained, let the midwife insert her left hand. If the mouth of the womb is open, let her insert her hand into the neck of the womb and seek the head with it and pull it with her fingers to the mouth of the womb, then insert a hook or two hooks into it and pull it with them.
If the mouth of the womb has constricted due to a hot swelling affecting it, then it should not be forced.  Instead, it is necessary then to use pouring of moist, fatty things, and to use compresses, and to sit in waters which relax and moisten.
And if the fetus is on its side, if it is possible to straighten it, then let what we mentioned for the living fetus be used. If this is not possible, then let it be cut and extracted.  It is necessary that nothing of the placenta be left inside at all.  When you have finished your treatment, use what we mentioned of the treatment for the hot swellings which appear in the wombs.
If bleeding occurs, let her descend into astringent waters and use all other treatments. I have witnessed a woman who had conceived, and the fetus died in her womb, then she conceived again upon it.
Then the other fetus also died.  After a long time, a swelling appeared in her womb, and it swelled until it opened and began to discharge pus. I was called to treat her, and I treated her for a long time, but the wound did not close, so I placed on it some strong, drawing ointments.
Then a bone came out of the place. Then days passed, and another bone came out. I was amazed by this, since the abdomen is a place where there is no bone. I considered that it was from the bones of the dead fetus, so I examined the wound and extracted from it many bones from the bones of the head of the fetus.
I continued doing this until I extracted many bones from her, and the woman was in the best of health.  She lived like that for a time, discharging a little pus from the place. And I have only related this unusual case here.
because in it there is knowledge and aid for what the skillful physician attempts with his hand in treatment.
Chapter seventy-seven.
In it are the images of the instruments which are needed in the extraction of the fetus.
Image of a screw to open the mouth of the womb.
This is the binder with which books are bound; it has two screws at the ends of the two pieces of wood, except that this screw should be finer than the binder and should be either of ebony or of boxwood, and the width of each piece of wood should be the thickness of two fingers.
And their width is about a finger and their length is a span and a half, and in the middle of the two pieces of wood are two guides of the same kind of wood which have been fastened in them; their length is half a span or a little more, and their width is about two fingers or a little more, and these two guides…
are those which enter into the mouth of the womb to open it by turning the screws; an image of another instrument for the same purpose, finer and lighter:
It is made of ebony or boxwood in the shape of hooks, except that it has two guides at its end, as you see; the length of each guide is about a span, and their width is two fingers.  If you wish to open the womb with it,
then seat the woman on a bed with her legs hanging down and spread apart between her thighs, then insert these two guides, close together, into the mouth of the womb, while you hold the end of the instrument below between her thighs, then open your hand with the instrument as you do with hooks, as much as you want to open the womb. until the midwife does what she wants. An image of another screw mentioned by the ancients:
An image of the instrument which pushes the fetus:
Image of the forceps with which the head of the fetus is grasped.
It resembles scissors, with teeth at the end as you see.  It may also be made rectangular like hooks, in this image as you see, it has teeth like saw teeth to cut and tear with.
Image of an instrument also.
Image of a hook.
This hook should be somewhat thick so that it does not break when pulling the fetus with it. Image of a hook with two points.
Image of two wide scalpels for cutting the fetus.
All these instruments, the more numerous their types and the better prepared they are by the craftsman, the quicker his work and the higher his standing among people. Therefore, do not despise any instrument that you have prepared, for there will certainly be a need for it.
Chapter seventy-eight.
On removing the placenta.
If the placenta is retained after childbirth, you should instruct the patient to hold herself, then sneeze using a  (sneezing) powder and press your hand on her mouth and nostrils. If it comes out this way, well and good; otherwise, use a [forceps].
And pierce a hole in the lid and place in it herbs that open the mouth of the womb, such as rue, henbane, dill, chamomile, wormwood,  [a plant] and centaury; all these medicaments or some of them. Submerge them in water and place them over the fire, then place a silver tube on the hole in the lid of the pot and the other end in the mouth of the womb.
And hold it until the steam reaches the bottom of the womb, then cause her to sneeze as we said; then the placenta will come out quickly. If it remains after this treatment and does not come out, instruct the midwife to dip her left hand in  [a type of oil] or mallow sap.
Then insert it into the vagina and search for the placenta.  If she finds it, she should grasp it and gently pull it little by little until she removes it. If it is attached deep in the womb, insert the hand as we described, until, when she finds the placenta, she pulls it little by little, being careful.
Lest the womb fall out with strong pulling, but it should be moved gently to the sides, right and left, then the amount of pulling should be increased; then it will yield and free itself from the adhesion. If the mouth of the womb is constricted, we have described the treatment with sneezing and the treatment with the pot and herbs.
If it does not come out with all that we have described, avoid violence in pulling it again, but it should be tied—what has come out of it to the mouth of the womb—to the woman's thigh, then inject it with the four-component ointment, for it will cause it to rot after a few days.
And it will dissolve and come out, except that if it becomes putrid, a foul odor will ascend from it to the stomach and head, and this will harm the patient.  Therefore, suitable fumigations should be used.
Therefore, and some of the ancients have tried the fumigation of rue and dried figs.  The image of the instrument with which the woman is fumigated when menstruation and the placenta are retained, and the like:
It is made of lead, resembling a funnel, or it is made of copper; the thin end is placed in the vagina, and the wide end over the fire, and the incense is placed on the embers; it is held until that incense is gone, and another is added.
Chapter Seventy-Nine.
In the treatment of the non-perforated fistula.
Many boys may be born with their rectums imperforate; a thin membrane may have closed it.  It is necessary for the midwife to perforate that membrane with her finger; otherwise, let her incise it with a sharp scalpel, and let her beware of the muscle, not to touch it.
Then she places on it wool soaked in syrup and oil, then treats it with ointments until it heals. If she fears that it will close up, let her place a lead tube in the opening for many days, removing it whenever the child wishes to defecate.
The occlusion of the rectum may also occur from the healing of a wound or a tumor; it is necessary to incise that closure, then treat it with the treatment and the lead tube we mentioned.
Chapter Eighty.
In the treatment of fistulas which occur in the lower parts.
Fistulas which occur in the lower parts are a complication and thickening which occurs near the rectum, externally or internally in the space from one of the sides, and the fistula may be one or more.
If this complication becomes chronic, it opens and a watery white moisture or thin pus flows from it.  Some of these fistulas may penetrate to the bladder and to the intestine, and some may not penetrate.  Those which penetrate may be recognized by what comes out of them of feces and wind when the patient uses the privy.
And perhaps worms come out of them.  And there may be fistulas among them, if they are in the space, penetrating to the bladder and to the urethra. And there may be some penetrating to the hip joint and to the sacrum.  And what distinguishes the fistula which penetrates to the rectum from that which does not penetrate is also known.
That you insert your index finger into the rectum and insert a thin probe into the fistula, of copper or iron, if the fistula is not tortuous. But if it is tortuous, then insert into it a thin lead probe or a horsehair.
Until you feel the probe or the hair with your finger. If you do not feel it at all, and nothing of feces, nor wind, nor worms, as we said, emerges from the opening, then know that it is not penetrating, so proceed to treatment.
And if the fistula penetrates to the bladder or to the urethra, its sign is the emergence of urine from it and the inability of the place to heal with medications.  And as for if it penetrates to the hip joint or to the sacrum, its sign is the arrival of the probe there.
If it is not tortuous to the bone, and there is pain in that direction, and pus constantly comes out of it, and no treatment works, and it does not heal with ointment—these penetrating fistulas, all of them—there is absolutely no cure for them.
And their treatment is futile effort for those who attempt it among ignorant physicians. As for those that are not penetrating and not chronic, recovery is hoped for with cautery, as I describe and as I have tried.  It is that you lay the patient on his back between your hands.
And raise his legs upwards, and tilt his thighs towards his abdomen, then insert the copper or lead probe if there is tortuosity in the fistula until you know where the probe ends. If the patient feels it towards the rectum, then you should insert your index finger into the rectum.
If you feel with your finger that the probe has penetrated by itself, uncovered, without feeling peritoneum or flesh between your finger and it, then know for certain that it is penetrating, so do not exert yourself on it, for there is no cure for it, as we said.
And they have said that it heals in some people rarely. And of the treatments from which benefit is hoped for is that you heat a thin cautery iron according to the width of the fistula, as has preceded, and insert it hot into the fistula until it reaches towards the rectum, then repeat it two or three times.
Until you know that all that excess, matted flesh resembling the tube of a bird's feather has been burned. Then treat it with lint soaked in fat until the burned flesh comes out, then treat it with healing ointments, and if it heals.
Otherwise, it will never heal with any other treatment. But if you insert the probe and it does not penetrate to your finger which is in the rectum, and there was between it and the probe a thick partition of flesh or peritoneum, and you saw the fistula near the surface of the skin, then incise the skin at the beginning of the fistula. And you pass with the incision with the probe, while it is in the fistula, until you reach with the incision where the end of the probe has reached, and the probe is freed and falls out. Then you cleanse that matted flesh resembling the tube of a bird's feather and leave nothing of it.
Then treat it with healing ointments until it heals. If the bleeding overcomes you and prevents you from cutting that flesh, the best and quickest remedy is cauterization with fire or a caustic medicine, because cauterization with fire combines two good things: burning that excess flesh.
And cutting the blood and drying the moisture. Then treat it with lint soaked in fat or sulfur powdered with oil until the place suppurates and that burned flesh comes out in the pus. Then treat the wound with healing ointments that grow solid flesh.
These are medicines which constrict and dry, for if it is closed, it has healed and there is no fear of recurrence. If the fistula has reached the depth of the rectum and is distant from the surface of the body, then insert your finger into the rectum and explore with it.
If you feel the probe and between you and it a partition of peritoneum or flesh, and it was near to penetration, then the action in it is only by way of hope, that is, that you use in it one of three methods: either cauterize it as we said.
Or incise it until you reach its bottom so that you can easily insert the lint and treat it from nearby. Do not extend the incision lest you cut the muscle surrounding the rectum and cause the patient involuntary bowel movements.  Then treat it as we mentioned, and perhaps it will heal as we said.
Or penetrate that partition and pierce it after you incise it near the rectum as we said, either with a probe or with another sharp-pointed instrument. Then cleanse all the adherent flesh in the incision as far as you can, completely.
Then close the whole wound with the incision and the upper opening until it is sealed, and the fistula remains open inside the rectum, which is easier for the patient.  The fistula may be perforated in this manner.
And if you insert the probe into the fistula and it is in a side of the rectum towards the surface of the body with the skin and the ring of the rectum, then take a probe with a perforated end like a shoemaker's needle in this manner:
And insert into it a twisted thread of five or so threads, then insert the probe with the thread into the fistula until it reaches its bottom. If it is penetrating into the margin of the rectum from inside nearby.
Then bring the thread out through that hole by inserting your finger into the rectum and bringing out the end of the thread, and bring both ends together and tighten them and leave it for a day or two.  Whenever the thread cuts into the flesh, tighten it well until that flesh between the ends of the threads is severed and falls out, then treat the wound until it heals and recovers.
If the opening of the fistula is not penetrating, penetrate it however you can, except that it should not be very deep, for you should not do that on account of the muscle lest you cut it. Then do with it as we have mentioned until it heals.
The image of the hooked bistoury with which fistulas are incised: its hook is very sharp and the other side is not sharp, lest you cut what is not needed, as you see.
Chapter eighty-one.
Concerning the opening of hemorrhoids from which blood flows, and their excision, and the treatment of fissures.
Hemorrhoids are of two kinds: either they are inside the rectum, resembling red bladders or like grapes, and there are small and large ones among them, and blood constantly flows from them.
And they may be one or many, and they may be outside the rectum and at its edges, except that those which are outside the rectum are, in most cases, less moist, with a constant flow of yellow water or a little blood, and they are the color of the flesh.
The treatment for those which are inside the rectum is that you should order the patient to strain and bear down until the rectum is protruded and the growths appear to you.  Then quickly grasp them with hooks or seize them with your fingernail, then cut them at their base. If the hooks do not hold because of their moisture and laxity,
then rub them with a rough cloth or a piece of a tanned hide, or pull them with your fingers, then cut them. Then, after cutting, sprinkle on them some sharp powders to act as a cautery, or cauterize them as described in the chapter on cautery.
Then treat it with the rest of the treatment until it heals. If the rectum does not protrude, inject the patient with an enema containing a little irritant to wash what is in the rectum and cause it to quickly protrude when the patient strains. As for the growths outside the rectum, their treatment is easy and simple.
This is to seize them with your fingernail or hook them with a hook and cut them, then treat them as we have mentioned until they heal.  And whoever dislikes cutting with iron should use a ligature in this manner: take a twisted thread and insert it into a needle.
Then pull the growth upwards and pass the needle through its base from the other side, and twist the ends of the thread below the needle while it is crosswise and pull the growth tightly. Then tie the thread and remove the needle. Do this to all the growths, leaving one unligated.
so that the excess blood flows from it. Then place a cloth soaked in rose oil or kyroton on the rectum, and tell the patient to remain still. Then leave it until it falls off.  If the growths fall off, treat them with ointments and other treatments until they heal.
As for the treatment of fissures, they often result from dryness of the feces and retention of the temperament. If they become chronic and medicine does not work, then it should be scraped with a scalpel blade or your fingernail until it becomes moist and the upper crust that prevents it from healing is removed.
Then treat it until it heals properly. If it does not heal, repeat the scraping more severely than before until it bleeds well and peels, then treat it, for it will heal.
Chapter Eighty-Two.
On the treatment of ingrown and non-ingrown nails, dry warts, and nits.
A corn is a round nodule, the color of the body, resembling the head of a nail. It occurs on the whole body, but especially on the soles of the feet and the toes, and causes pain when walking.
It should be incised around the corn, grasped with a hook or forceps, and pulled out by the root, then treated.  If you wish, cauterize it as explained previously in its chapter. As for dry warts, each one is a small, rough, matted, round protrusion on the surface of the body.
They often appear on the hands of children.  Its treatment is to stretch the wart and cut it, or pierce it with a silk thread or hair until it falls off. If you wish, cauterize it with fire or a caustic medicine, as previously explained.
Ingrown and non-ingrown warts may be removed with the instrument I have mentioned in the treatment of nits. As for nits, they are also a small, matted, thick protrusion on the surface of the body, extending deeply.  If cold affects them, a sensation similar to the sting of ants is felt.
They occur all over the body, but most often on the hands.  Its treatment is to take a tube made of a strong goose or eagle feather, and place this tube over the nit so that the circumference of the tube surrounds it on all sides. Then rotate your hand with the tube until you incise around the nit.
Then insert it into the depth of the flesh, and the nit will be pulled out by its root. If you wish, you may do this with a copper or iron tube in this manner:
The top of the tube should be solid and twisted to facilitate gripping and turning it with the fingers. If you wish, cauterize the nit as previously explained in the cauterization of warts in the chapter on cauterization.
Chapter Eighty-Three.
On the shapes of instruments used for injections in cases of rectal disorders, diarrhea, and colic.
The syringe may be made of silver, china, or cast or beaten copper.  Small and large versions of this instrument may be made, according to the users. Those used in the treatment of small children should be small, and those for patients with narrow or painful rectums should be very gentle.  Image of a large syringe:
Its upper funnel, to which the bladder is tied, is wide in this manner; it has a stopper where the bladder is tied, as you see.  Its lower end, which is inserted into the rectum, is solid and very smooth, except that on one side there are two holes and on the other side one hole.
The size of the hole should be the thickness of a probe, or slightly larger. The bladder, in which the medication is placed, is made from an animal's bladder or sheepskin, shaped like a small flask, its diameter being one cubit.
Many holes are pierced in a circular pattern, the distance between each hole being the thickness of a finger. Then, a strong thread of twisted yarn, composed of ten or so strands, is inserted into these holes, and the bladder is gathered together like a pouch. Then, once the medication is placed inside, it is tightly bound at the top of the syringe between two stones, and then injected. This is an image of the circle of the bladder and the hole.
The method of injection is to fill the bladder or skin with warmed medication, to an extent the patient can tolerate. Beware of it being too hot or too cold. Then the patient lies on his back with his legs raised.
A sheet or blanket is placed under him. Then the end of the syringe is lubricated with oil, egg white, fenugreek saliva, or something similar. Then it is gently inserted into the rectum. Then an assistant takes the bladder in both hands and squeezes it forcefully until everything inside the syringe is emptied into the intestine.
Then the syringe is removed, and the patient raises his legs to the wall. If the medication stimulates evacuation, he should hold it as long as possible. If he sleeps with it all night, it is more beneficial.  If it is injected for diarrhea and its exit is hastened, the injection should be repeated until he is cured.
If there are hemorrhoids or painful tumors in the rectum, the syringe should be very gentle and smooth, smoother than those used to inject children. This is an image of a gentle syringe with its skin stretched over it.
Chapter eighty-four.
In the treatment of wounds.
I have mentioned in the classification the treatment of what resembles cauterizations, and I am now mentioning here its treatment by hand and by medication completely.  I say that wounds differ according to the thing by which the wound is made and according to the location where the wound occurs.
The things that cause wounds are many, such as a blow from a stone, or a cut from a sword or knife, or a stab from a spear or stick or arrow, and so on from many things.
As for wounds according to the locations on the body, there are wounds that occur on the head, or neck, or chest, or abdomen, or liver, and similar organs.
And I am describing the treatment of some wounds to make them a measure and rule for all wounds, and I begin with simple head wounds especially because the complex ones will be mentioned at the beginning of the third chapter of this book.
I say that when a simple wound occurs in the head and there is no fracture of the bone, I look; and if it is from a blow from a stone or the like, and it has only torn the skin, and the wound is large and I fear for the patient the occurrence of hot inflammation, then I hasten and incise the cephalic vein in that place. And do not delay that, and let blood be drawn from him according to his strength, if nothing prevents bloodletting, especially if the blood that comes out of the wound is little, and let the bloodletting be from the opposite side of the injured area.
And warn the patient against fullness, drinks, and thick foods; and if something prevents him from bloodletting, let him reduce food, and not approach meats or drinks. And apply to the wound, if hot inflammation occurs in it, cotton soaked in rose oil alone or with a drink that has astringency.
And if you are safe from hot inflammation, apply to the wound, if it is fresh and the air has not changed it, the powder that I will describe to you shortly; but if the air has changed it, apply some ointments to it.
Until pus forms, then treat it until it heals. If the wound is large and is from a sword cut or the like, and its lips do not come together by themselves, then join it by suturing, as I describe in suturing abdominal wounds.
If the skin exposes the bone and hangs, and its attachment is only by a small connection, cut it off, then treat the wound with medicines that produce firm flesh in place of the skin, and instruct the patient to eat foods that have firmness, such as heads and brains and the like.
If decay occurs in the skin and does not adhere to the bone, cut away all that is decayed and throw it away, then treat it. If in these wounds there is an artery or vein bleeding blood, and the bleeding is not stopped by medicines, then search for the artery.
If you find it and it is not severed, sever it with the scalpel and tie it. If necessity demands, if what we mentioned does not work, cauterize it until the bleeding stops. If these wounds are small and superficial, their treatment is easy; it suffices to treat them by sprinkling this powder on them while they are still bleeding.
before the air changes them.  The recipe for the powder is: take one part frankincense, two parts of acacia, and three parts of slaked or unslaked lime.  Grind all together, sieve it, and fill the wound with it, binding it tightly so that it adheres well.
It will coagulate with the blood; then bind it from above with bandages and leave it; do not unbind it as long as it does not swell, for the medicine will not be removed from it until it heals.  The lime alone may do this if you do not have frankincense and acacia.
This action may also be done with alum in many large wounds if its application and binding are skillfully done, and the wounds are fresh with their blood, as long as the air has not changed them; but if the air has changed them somewhat, especially in summer,
then applying this powder is meaningless. Treat it as mentioned, by applying some ripening ointments or a poultice of barley flour made with water and honey until the pus is drawn out, then treat it with other treatments until it heals.
But if a fracture of the bone occurs with the wound, and it is slight, pull it with the forceps. I have described the treatment of head fractures in what follows, in the surgery of the neck. If the wound occurs in the neck, there is no difference in treatment from a head wound if it is slight.
But if a nerve or artery of the neck has been severed, if it is a nerve, there is no remedy except to avoid treating it with things that cause strong constriction, such as verdigris and vitriol and the like, because they harm the nerve and cause it to spasm.
And nothing cold should be placed on the wound at all, because the essence of the nerve is cold, and its connection is with the brain, which is the noblest of the organs. What you treat it with should be from soft medicines, such as ceruse washed many times with fresh water, moistened with oil or rose ointment and tutty.
If it is also washed with fresh water and other mineral stones in this manner, and moist ointments, but if the wound is large, use stitching or bind its edges with bandages, then treat it until it heals.
If the wound has depth and a cavity forms at its bottom where pus collects, lance it in its lowest place. If an artery has been severed in the wound and you see its blood flowing, ligate it or cauterize it, or if necessary, amputate it.
If the wound has severed some or all of the cartilages of the larynx, and the vessels are unharmed, join the edges of the skin by stitching over the windpipe, do not touch the windpipe itself, but straighten it and restore it to its natural shape, then bind it tightly and leave it for some days.
Then treat it with ointments that have astringent and drying properties until it heals. If the wound has affected the bone, examine it; if there are bone splinters, extract them all, or as many as possible; what you cannot reach, leave until the wound suppurates and heals, and it will be easier to remove them.
If the wound is fresh, sprinkle on it the powder we have described. If a bone becomes suppurative in the wound and forms a fistula, treat it with what will be mentioned in its chapter, in the surgery of the chest and between the shoulders.
If it is a wound from a spear or knife and you see depth to it, observe: if air escapes from it when the patient breathes, know that it is a mortal wound. If it does not have depth and is fresh with blood, do not at first apply powder to it nor bind it tightly, lest the blood be retained in its depth.
It will then recede to the heart and kill the patient. But put on it an attractive ointment and dress it twice a day.  If you do not have ointment, put in the mouth of the wound old cotton to absorb the moisture that comes from it, and have the patient sleep on the wound.
so that what gathers there may flow out. And if three days or more have passed since the injury and the patient has not experienced convulsions, a bad palpitation, or shortness of breath, and you see all his other conditions to be good, know that the wound is safe; then treat it with cauterization and other treatments until it heals.
If it is difficult to see it and the pus flows constantly, know that it has become a fistula, and treat it in its chapter. The patient should lie on the wound so that what gathers there may flow out.  If it is a wound of the chest or back, treat it with the stitching described above.
If it is large, cauterize it; if it is small, use powder. If it has affected the bone and broken off fragments, explore the wound and proceed to remove those fragments if they are clean. If they are not clean, leave them until…
the wound becomes foul, for then it is easy to remove them. As for the other wounds occurring in the other members, their treatment is governed by what we have mentioned.
Chapter eighty-five.
On wounds of the abdomen, the protrusion of the intestines, and their suturing.
The wound which occurs in the abdomen may be large, or it may be small, or medium.  The large one may have one or several intestines protruding from it, so the replacement and suturing of them is more difficult and arduous.
The small wound also may be difficult in another way; it is necessary that its replacement is more difficult. And the intestine, if it is not immediately returned to its place at once, swells and thickens, so its replacement becomes difficult. For this reason, the medium wound has become preferable, because with it, the replacement of the intestine is not difficult as in these two types.
And know that the suturing of the abdomen is in four ways. The two sutures are general, suitable for suturing the abdomen and for suturing all other wounds of the body. The other two sutures are specific, used for all wounds, but they are more specific to suturing the abdomen.
And I will describe them to you one by one with explanation and clarification. I say that if the wound is small and something of the intestine has protruded from it and its replacement is difficult, that is for one of two reasons: either because of the smallness of the wound, as we said, or because the intestine has been affected by swelling due to the cold air.
If that is the case, then it should be warmed by dipping a sponge or a wet cloth in lukewarm water alone, or in which anise, rue, and spikenard have been boiled, and wipe the intestine with it until the swelling resolves.
A drink containing astringents may also do this; it is better than water alone in resolving the swelling.  If you see that the swelling has resolved, then moisten the intestine with water in which comfrey or mallow has been boiled, for it will make its entry easier.
If its return is still impossible after this treatment, then make a small incision in the wound with the instrument with which you incise fistulas. The first treatment, if successful, is better than the incision.  One only resorts to incision after necessity and failure of other methods. This is an image of the instrument:
One side of it is curved and limited, the other side is unlimited. The thin end is not as fine as a lancet, but is slightly blunt. It is an instrument resembling a small forceps, as you see. If the wound is widened and the intestine has entered, then it should be returned to its natural form.
And its proper place, if you can manage it, is best. But if the wound is wide and is in the lower abdomen, then the patient should lie on his back with his legs higher than his head; and if it is in the upper abdomen, then his head and chest should be higher than his lower body.
Similarly, if the wound is on one side of the abdomen, always aim to make the side with the injury higher than the other side.  This should be used in major and moderate surgeries.
As for minor surgeries, position it as best you can. Then have a skilled assistant ready to hold the entire wound with his hands and bring its edges together, then reveal it to the person performing the suturing, little by little.
This is the description of a single general suture: Take one needle, or several needles, according to the size of the wound. Then leave a space from the edge of the wound equal to the thickness of the little finger, and insert a single needle without thread into the edges of the skin. along with the edges of the peritoneum under the skin from the inside, until you pass through it from that side, having brought together the edges of the skin and the edges of the peritoneum, making four layers. Then you tighten a doubled thread around the needle several times from both sides until the edges of the wound are tightly joined.
Then leave a space equal to the thickness of a finger, and insert another needle, then connect it with the thread as you did with the first needle. Continue doing this with as many needles as you need until you complete the entire circumference of the wound. Let the needles be of moderate thickness.
Because very thin needles quickly cut the flesh, and thick ones are difficult to insert into the skin. Therefore, they should be moderate in thinness and thickness.  And the needle should not be inserted into the edge of the skin too deeply.
lest the flesh quickly tear and the wound open before it heals, nor should you space the sutures too far apart, lest the wound fail to unite. Then cut off the ends of the needles lest they injure the patient during sleep, and make for him pads of linen cloth on each side to hold the ends of the needles.
And leave them until you know that the wound has healed. This type of stitching with needles is most suitable for small wounds, because one or two needles, or thereabouts, may suffice for stitching them.
As for the method of stitching for the second type of wound, it is to bring together the four edges—that is, the edges of the skin and the edges of the peritoneum—at once with a needle threaded with a moderately thick and thin twisted thread. Then, when you have passed the needle through these four edges, return the needle through the same point from which you began.
So that the thread lies interlaced from the top of the wound, so that the stitching is like the stitching of a purse with which goods are tied. And make the distance between each stitch the width of the little finger. This stitching is known to everyone.
With this stitch, I sewed a wound that appeared on a man's abdomen; he had been wounded with a knife, and the wound was more than a span long; and about two spans of the midgut had protruded, and the wound was in the middle of the abdomen.
I returned it after his intestines had remained outside the wound for twenty-four hours. The wound healed in about fifteen days, and I treated him until he recovered. He lived many years thereafter, managing all his affairs, while the physicians had judged that he would never recover at all.
And it is remarkable that I did not treat him with an ointment, because I was in a place where there were no medicines.  I would apply worn cotton to the wound twice a day and dress it by washing with honey water until it healed.
As for one of the two types of special stitching, I mention it according to Galen's words: you begin the stitching from the skin, and insert the needle from the outside to the inside; then, when you have passed the needle through the skin and the muscle which runs straight along the whole length of the belly.
leave the edge of the peritoneum on the side into which you inserted the needle; and pass the needle through its other edge from the inside to the outside, into the other edge of the peritoneum; then, when you have passed it through, pass it again through this same edge of the peritoneum, from outside to inside.
And leave the edge of the peritoneum on that side; and pass the needle through its other edge from inside to outside, and as you pass it through, pass it also into the edge of the peritoneum on its side, until you have passed it completely through.
Then begin also from this same side and sew it together with the edge of the peritoneum on the other side, and bring the needle out through the skin nearby; then return it into that skin and sew the edge of the peritoneum on the other side together with this edge of the peritoneum.
And bring it out through the skin on its side, and do that again, and do it repeatedly until you have sewn up the whole wound in that way. The general description of this stitch is that it is sewn like the stitching of furs together.
That you sew the peritoneum once from one side with the edge of the skin, and leave it once from the other side until you are finished.  As for the second type of special stitching which Galen also mentioned, this is his exact wording.
And that is to sew it in the manner that some practitioners sew it, by bringing each part to its natural counterpart, so they join the edge of the peritoneum to its other edge, and the edge of the intestine to its other edge; and that is as I describe to you.
You should insert the needle into the edge of the intestine nearest to you from the outside and pass it to the inside in it alone, and leave the edges of the peritoneum; then return the needle and pass it from the outside to the inside in both edges of the peritoneum, then return it again.
And pass it from the inside to the outside in the other edge of the intestine which is on the opposite side. This type of stitching is better than the easy general stitching, which is the stitching previously mentioned. This is Galen's exact wording. Some have said that the stitching of the abdomen may be straightened with two needles. That is, you insert a single thread into them, and begin by inserting the needle from your side and pass it to the other side, and insert the other needle from the opposite side, and pass it from your side, according to the stitching of the tentmakers.
Know that if the wound is in the middle of the abdomen, then its stitching is more difficult than in other places of the abdomen. As for the treatment of the wound, its rule in its treatment is the rule of all other wounds; that is, if you find the wound fresh with its blood before the air alters it, and you return the intestine and sew it and tighten it, then apply to it the medicated lint.
If the wound has been altered by the air, then apply to it some of the ointments that you prepare until it suppurates and the stitches fall out and the peritoneum and intestine unite, then treat it as you treat other wounds until it heals.
If you do not have medicines, then apply to it, from the time it begins to suppurate, used cotton and change it twice a day, as I have taught you, until it heals.  For you do not need other treatment in most cases if the wounds are simple. If you fear that the wound will involve the principal organs in pain,
then it is necessary that you dip soft wool in moderately warm oil or in rose oil and place it around the areas between the groin and the armpit. If he feels pain or putrefaction in his intestines—and that often occurs—then inject him with a lukewarm astringent black drink.
Especially if the putrefaction has reached the intestine and become a penetrating wound into its cavity. And know that what is thick of the intestines is easier to heal, and what is thin of them is more difficult to heal.
And as for the intestine known as the jejunum, it does not at all accept healing from a wound that occurs in it. This is because of the multitude of its veins and their size, and the thinness of its substance, and its proximity to the nature of the nerve. But if what protrudes from the wound is omentum and you catch it fresh, then replace it according to your replacing of the intestine, similarly.
If a period of time passes and it has turned green or black, then it is necessary that you tie it with a thread above the place that has blackened, lest bleeding occur, for in the omentum are veins and arteries. Then cut below that ligature.
And leave the ends of the thread hanging from below the wound, outside of it, so that it is easy for you to pull it and remove it upon the falling away of the omentum and the suppuration of the wound.  Mention of the wound that occurs in the intestine. But if a rupture occurs in the intestine and it is small…
it may be possible that it heals in some people, for I have seen a man who had been wounded in his abdomen by a spear thrust, and the wound was to the right of the stomach.  The wound became chronic and became a fistula from which feces and wind emerged.  So I treated it although I did not hope for its healing. And I continued to treat him gently until it healed and the place rejoined. When I saw the place had rejoined, I feared for the patient that an ill event might occur in his abdomen, but no ill event whatsoever occurred to him, and he remained in the best of conditions. He rightly eats, drinks, copulates, enters the bath, and exerts himself in his work. And some experienced people have mentioned that whenever a wound occurs in the intestine and it is small, then it should be sutured in this manner.
And it is that large-headed ants are taken, then the edges of the wound are brought together, then one of them, with its mouth open, is placed on the edges of the wound.  When it closes its mouth and tightens, its head is cut off, for it will adhere and will not loosen. Then another ant is placed near the first.
And you continue to do that with several ants according to the size of the wound, then you cover it and suture the wound. For those heads remain adhering in the intestine until the intestine heals and recovers, and no harm whatsoever occurs to the patient.  And it is also possible that the intestine may be sutured with fine thread.
That which is drawn from the intestine of the animal adhering to it after it is entered into a needle is that the end of this thread is taken from the intestine, then it is drawn gently, then a fine twisted linen thread is tied to its end, then that thread is entered into the needle. And in it is the intestine thread, and with it the intestine is sutured, then it is returned to the abdomen. And this type of suturing with ants and intestine is only by way of hope and expectation.
But if the perforation is large and wide, especially if it is in one of the small intestines, then there is no remedy and no healing whatsoever.
Chapter eighty-six.
In the treatment of catarrh and fistula.
Know that every wound or swelling, if it becomes chronic and prolonged and becomes an ulcer and does not heal, and continuously discharges pus that does not stop, is generally called, in whatever organ it may be, a fistula, and we call it catarrh, and fistula.
It is in reality a hardened, matted, white lump, painless, with a cavity like the cavity of a bird's feather.
Therefore, some have called it a feather; and sometimes it is moist, constantly discharging pus, and sometimes the moisture may cease; and this moisture may be abundant or scanty, thick or thin.
And I have already stated in the classification, when mentioning wounds, that every ulcer which does not heal and in which flesh does not grow is due to one of nine causes: one of them is either due to a deficiency of blood in the body, or to its poor quality, or because there is hard flesh inside it and on its edges which prevents the growth of good flesh. Or because it is full of pus and dirt; or because the ulcer itself is foul and the substance it discharges is of poor quality; or because the treatment is unsuitable; or because of a pestilence affecting the locality; or because of a specific property of the locality.
Or because it is full of pus and dirt; or because the ulcer itself is foul and the substance it discharges is of poor quality; or because the treatment is unsuitable; or because of a pestilence affecting the locality; or because of a specific property of the locality. As was observed in the city of Saragossa, where the maturation of diseases is difficult and the healing of tumors is naturally slow; or because there is one or several bones in it.  I have explained all these causes, their signs, and their treatments with medicines in the classification.
It is appropriate here that I inform you of the treatment of fistulas and abscesses which is done by hand. Know that fistulas can occur in all parts of the body; some of them end in large veins and arteries or in a nerve.
Or to the peritoneum, or to the intestine, or to the bladder, or to a rib, or to a vertebra of the spine, or to a joint of the compound joints like the hand and foot; and some lead to the vicinity of a principal organ and so on.
Now, those fistulas of this nature are among the difficult-to-cure diseases, which do not accept treatment and working on them is troublesome and ignorant.  If there are fistulas which have not reached these places which I have mentioned, and I have hoped and trusted in their treatment,
And you wish to arrive at knowledge of that, then take a probe of copper or iron. If the fistula runs straight, then examine it with it.  If there is a bend in the fistula, then examine it with a probe of thin lead, because lead is soft in its body.
It will become smooth upon entering and will bend towards the bend. If the fistula has many openings, you cannot ascertain them with a probe; then inject one opening of its openings, for the moisture which you inject with it will pass towards the other openings and will flow.
from them, then thoroughly investigate in any way possible, to know if there is bone or nerve, or if the bottom of the fistula is far or near, or if it is one fistula with many openings.  Ascertain all that to the extent of your ability by questioning the patient and by the presence of his pain when you touch the place.
And in a similar way from the signs and causes incident to the swelling.  If you have ascertained all this truly, then turn to treatment confidently. It is that you look, if it is…
the fistula is apparent, near, or in a safe place far from a joint or nerve or artery or vein, or one of the places I mentioned to you, then incise the fistula according to what I described, and remove what is in it of the clot and the corrupt flesh and the excess flesh.
And whatever grows in its opening of flesh or wart and the like, and treat it until it heals. If the fistula is deep-seated and is straight, then it is necessary that you incise it in depth as much as you can, then cleanse it of all its corrupt flesh.
Then use a twisted thread coated in strong medicines and insert it to the bottom of the fistula which you reach with an instrument; do this repeatedly until that strong medicine eats away all that remains in the bottom of the fistula of corruption.
Then bind it with ointments which produce healthy flesh until it heals. If it does not heal by this, cauterize it according to what was previously described. If the cause of the fistula is bone, and this is confirmed for you, then probe it and incise it according to what I told you, if nothing prevents you from…
a vein or nerve or principal member as we said, then if the bone is exposed to you and there is some corruption and blackness in it, then remove it until its corruption goes away, then treat it with what will heal it until it heals. If it does not heal and the pus continues as it was doing…
know that you have not reached the complete removal of the corruption; uncover everything on it again and thoroughly investigate its removal and cleansing with the utmost effort, then bind it. If it heals, otherwise know that that corruption is in a deep recess of corruption; uncover everything on it again.
and thoroughly investigate its removal and cleansing with the utmost effort. If the corrupted bone is small and you can pull it out, then pull it out with the delicate forceps which are suitable for that.
If there are many bones, thoroughly extract them all and do not leave anything of them. If something of the ligaments obstructs you and there is no danger in cutting them, then cut those ligaments and the flesh if it is there, and free the bones.
If you are not able to extract the bones at the time, then apply to the wound what will cause it to rot, and leave it for some days until it rots what is around those bones of flesh and ligaments, and keep the wound from healing, the incision that you made during your work.
Rather, if you fear that, place on it cotton soaked in powdered sulfur with oil, or cotton soaked in Egyptian ointment or one of the green ointments; for when those ligaments have rotted and the bones have become loosened, it will be easy to extract and pull them out.
If it is one large bone, like a bone of the leg or a bone of the thigh or similar, and only its surface is corrupted, then remove it thoroughly until that blackness and corruption disappears, then set the wound.  If a large part of it is corrupted and the corruption has reached the marrow of the bone, then it is necessary to spread it [the corruption].
And cut it all away to where the corruption ends. Then treat it until it heals. And I will tell you of a case of gangrene that occurred in a man's leg to make it an example and aid in your treatment. This man was young.
About thirty years old, he experienced pain in his leg due to a cause moving within his body, until the materials reached the leg and it swelled with a great swelling, and there was no external cause. Then time went on with the mistakes of the physicians until the swelling opened.
And much material flowed from it, and it was treated badly until the leg became gangrenous and many openings appeared in it, all discharging pus and the body's humors. A number of physicians treated him for about two years, and among them was no one skilled in surgery.
Until they came to me. I saw his leg and the material flowing from those openings in a great flow, and the man's body was emaciated and his color yellow.  Then I inserted a probe into one of those openings, and the probe reached the bone. Then I examined all the openings.
And I found that some led to others from all sides of the leg. So I began by cutting open one of those openings until I uncovered some of the bone. And I found it corrupt, eroded, blackened, putrefied, and perforated until the perforation reached the marrow. Then I spread open what was revealed to me.
And I proceeded to remove the corrupt bone, and I thought that there was no corruption in the bone other than what I had cut and spread open, and that I had excised it. Then I set about closing the wound with vulnerary medicines for a long time, but it did not heal. Then I returned and uncovered the bone again, beyond the first uncovering.
And I found the corruption connected to the bone. So I spread open what was revealed to me also of that corruption. Then I attempted to close it, but it did not close nor heal. Then I uncovered it again, and I continued to cut away the bone piece by piece and attempted to close it, but it would not close, until I had cut away about a span of bone.
And I removed it with its marrow. Then I closed it with medicines, and it healed quickly and completely.  This repetition in the procedure and its opening was necessary because of the patient's weakness and his inability to withstand much, and my fear for his death, because he frequently suffered from severe fainting spells due to excessive vomiting.  Then he recovered completely.
And in the place of the bone, firm flesh grew, and his condition in his body improved, and his strength returned, and he managed his affairs, and in his walking he suffered no harm whatsoever.  If a projecting bone in any part of the body is broken…
then it should be spread open in this way: you take a ligature and tie it to the end of the projecting bone, and you instruct someone to pull it upwards, and you make another ligature of thicker wool than the first ligature.
Then you tie it to the flesh under the bone and pull its end so that the flesh is drawn downwards, and you uncover the flesh from the place you want to spread open lest the saw injure the flesh, and you place a piece of wood or a board firmly under the bone from below.
Because if you do that, the saw will not be prevented from cutting the decayed bone.  The sawing should be slightly above the location of the decay, lest there be decay in the cavity of the bone that does not appear on its surface to the senses, requiring you to saw it again.
If the bone is decayed and not projecting, but its parts are connected to each other and the decay is in its middle or in some part of it, then uncover the flesh from all its sides. Then place the wood underneath, and then saw it from the first side where the decay is.
When you have finished sawing it, saw it from the other side, and let the sawing be a little distance from the decay, as we said. If the decay is in a joint, cut the decayed joint itself and saw the bone where it connects from the other side.
If the decay is in the connection of two joints, there is no remedy but excision. If the decay is in the metacarpus of the hand or foot, its treatment is very difficult, but you should peel away the decay however it appears to you, excise it, and cleanse it in whatever way you can.
And by whatever method it is straightened for you, provided that a vein or nerve does not obstruct you. And know that the saws and instruments for cutting these bones are numerous, according to the position, setting, thickness, thinness, size, smallness, hardness, and porosity of the bones. Therefore, it is necessary to prepare for each type of work an instrument similar to that work.
And know that the operations themselves may indicate to you the type of instrument you need, if you have long practice and knowledge of the arts of this profession, because that is from the skill of the profession and seeing many types of diseases. He may therefore devise for himself instruments similar to those for each disease, and I have illustrated for you at the end of this chapter several instruments.
Making them examples to be imitated and a measure by which you measure others, God willing. Image of a saw:

Chapter eighty-seven.
On the amputation of limbs and the sawing of bones.
Limbs may become putrid, either from an external cause or from an internal cause. If you treat this corruption with medicinal treatment and the treatment is ineffective, and you see the corruption spreading in the limb, nothing preventing it,
then it is necessary to amputate that member to where the corruption has reached, so that the patient may thereby escape death or a great calamity which is greater than the loss of the limb.  A sign of this occurring in someone is that the limb will blacken until you think that fire has burned it.
Or it may become putrid after the blackening, until that putridity spreads to what is next to that limb and affects the whole body; therefore, hasten to cut it off.  Likewise, if the cause of the putrefaction is the sting of some venomous creature, like a sea scorpion, or a snake, or a tarantula, or the like.
If the corruption or sting is in the tip of a finger, cut off the finger and do not allow the corruption to spread to the hand. Likewise, if it has affected the hand, cut it off at the base of the forearm, and do not allow the corruption to spread until it affects the bones of the forearm.
Likewise, if it affects the arm, cut off the arm at the elbow in the joint itself. If the corruption spreads and you see it reaching toward the shoulder, do not amputate the shoulder at all, for in that is the death of the patient; rather, use other treatments to the best of your ability.
And you do likewise with the leg: if the corruption affects the toe, cut off the toe at one of the joints; and if it affects the metatarsus, cut off the whole foot.  If it ascends to the knee, cut off the leg at the knee joint.
And if the corruption has reached above the knee, there is no recourse but to leave it and abandon the patient to death. The method of cutting off or excising a limb is to tie a ligature below the place you wish to cut and another ligature above the place.
And one assistant pulls the lower ligature downwards, and another assistant pulls the upper ligature upwards, and you yourself dissect the flesh between the ligatures with a broad scalpel until all the flesh is exposed, then cut or excise it. And it is necessary that you place linen cloths on all sides.
Lest the saw touch the healthy part, causing the patient additional pain and hot swelling. If bleeding occurs during your work, quickly cauterize the area or apply some styptic powder, then return to your treatment until you finish.
Then bind the injured limb with a suitable bandage and treat it until it heals. And I will tell you about a case which occurred in a man’s leg, the same condition that I describe to you. That is, a blackness occurred in his leg with burning like fire.
And that corruption first occurred in his toe until it took the whole leg. So the man, of his own accord, when he saw the corruption spreading in the limb with the intensity of the pain and burning, cut it off at the joint and healed.
When a long time passed, that same corruption appeared in the index finger of his hand. So he came to me. I intended to repel that corruption with the medications I applied to the hand after cleansing his body. But the corruption did not subside and continued to spread to the other finger.
Until the corruption took hold of the hand.  He asked me to amputate his hand, but I refused, hoping to repel that corruption, and also fearing death for him if his hand were amputated, because the man's strength was failing.  When he despaired of me, he returned to his town.
Then I heard that he cut off his entire hand and healed.  And I have told this story to help with what occurs of this type of illness and to be an example to be relied upon and acted upon.
Chapter eighty-eight.
In the treatment of fistulas and the method of injecting them with medication.
If a swelling occurs in one of the fleshy members, and the duration of the swelling is prolonged until it gathers matter, then bursts or is lanced, and all the matter within it comes out, and the place remains empty as if it were a vessel.
And the skin over it is like a rag, thinned, and its corruption has not reached the point of affecting bone, or nerve, or ligament. From this it deserves to be called a fistula, and not a sinus, except that its duration is prolonged until the corruption affects something of these members.
Then it is called a sinus or fistula, and its treatment is to cut away all that skin as it goes around, especially if it has thinned and become like a rag, and you are certain that it will not adhere to the place because of its corruption.
But if you hope that the skin will adhere, and its corruption has not reached that point, and there is thickness of flesh in the skin, then treat it with injection.  This is that you look at the fistula; if it is large and the pus that flows from it is foul-smelling, then inject it with the Egyptian medicine.
which is vinegar, oil, honey, and verdigris, equal parts, gathered in a vessel and cooked over the fire until the medicine thickens and comes to the consistency of honey. Then take what you need of it and thin it with water and honey, and inject it into the fistula, and bind its mouth, and leave the medicine in it for about two hours.
Then remove it by pressing.  Do this for several days until the fistula is cleansed and the foul smell is gone.  You may inject it with ash water if this medicine is not available to you.  This is that you take the ash of grapevine wood or the ash of oak wood and pour water over it.
Then filter it and inject it until you are certain that the fistula has been washed. If the patient cannot tolerate the Egyptian medicine or the ash water, then inject it with water and honey in which some powdered verdigris has been mixed.
Or inject it with honey and syrup mixed, for honey cleanses and washes, and the syrup adheres to the fistula, especially if the syrup has astringent and drying properties. When you have done this several times and are certain that the fistula's corruption has gone, then inject it with something that will grow flesh in it.
Such as taking some palm ointment and dissolving it in rose oil and an astringent syrup, or inject it with some other medicines and ointments whose descriptions we have given in the chapter on ointments. If the mouth of the fistula is narrow and does not allow the injection tube to enter,
widen it slightly with an iron instrument, or place in it a wick soaked in Egyptian ointment or theriac ointment until it widens.  Similarly, if the opening is also wide, bring its edges together with sutures, leaving only enough space for the injection tube to enter, no more.
Similarly, if the opening from which the pus flows is high up, incise it in the lowest part so that the pus flows downwards, for if the pus is retained in the depth of the fistula it prevents the growth of flesh.
If you cannot incise the fistula downwards as you wish, then position the limb so that the pus flows out easily as best you can, so that no pus at all is retained in it.
As for the cauterizing medicines which are applied externally to the fistula and how to apply them: take some of the cauterizing ointments suitable for what you want and spread it on a linen cloth; let the cloth be large enough to cover the whole fistula. Then, with scissors, cut a hole opposite the mouth of the fistula, slightly larger than the mouth of the fistula. Then spread some soft ointment on another cloth, to the size of the hole, and place it there, keeping it away from the mouth of the fistula to facilitate the discharge of pus; and do not remove the larger cloth until afterwards.
several days; but the one on the mouth of the fistula, you remove at all times so that what has collected there of pus may come out, and you may know whether what flows from it of pus is much or little, mature or immature.
And also with this, examine the fistula itself: does its owner feel pain in it or not, and is there swelling in it or not? If your treatment continues like this and you see that the matter which comes out is slight at the mouth of the fistula,
know that the fistula has adhered or is close to adhering; then, resolve it on the morrow or on the third day. And when you open the wound, replace the cloths with others and renew the ointment. If, after a long time, thin pus comes out of the fistula, do not despair of its closing.
Its healing is near, for some people are slow in the growth of flesh in their wounds, and others the opposite. If, after many days, immature pus comes out of the fistula, know that the fistula has not closed. If the closing of the fistula is slow,
increase the drying medications, and let them be medications that are moist in their consistency and dry in their strength, like palm ointment if an excess of extract of henbane has been added to it. And among the most effective things to treat it with is that palm ointment is taken.
and it is resolved with rose oil, and sprinkle on it old wine of moderate consistency, then mix it with it and use it. He may do something similar if you do not have palm ointment: honey, if you cook it until it thickens and use it; or take myrrh, aloe and olibanum, crush everything and sprinkle it on the honey while it is on the fire. Then spread it on a cloth and bind it to the fistula; or it is spread with the cooked honey until it thickens, and sprinkle on it the drugs and place the cloth on it and bind it.
And long rhubarb, the root of the asphodel, and the flour of costus and centaury may be used in such a case, singly or together, crushed, sifted, and sprinkled on the honey as described, and used. If the fistula persists and does not heal with this treatment, know that there is corruption in its depth.
And if it affects the bones, or other hard nerves, or ligaments, treat it as a fistula, as previously described.
Chapter eighty-nine.
On the treatment of the felon, the injured nail, the amputation of the superfluous finger, and the separation of adherent fingers.
A felon is an excessive growth of flesh under the nail of the thumb of the hand or foot, and it may grow in other fingers. If it persists and its treatment is neglected, it swells into a hot tumor.
Or it becomes putrid and foul until it eats the root of the nail, and perhaps destroys it entirely, and perhaps the corruption reaches the bone, until it has a foul odor and the tip of the finger becomes wide and its color becomes livid. If you treat it with what we mentioned in the division and your treatment is not effective,
then it is necessary to cut away with iron all the superfluous growth which grows from the nail, and then cauterize the wound afterwards, for cauterization is very beneficial in this. And if the bone is sound and the nail is also sound,
and the corner containing the nail has pinched the flesh inwards and caused it to be ulcerated and injured, then it is necessary to place a thin pledget under the corner of the nail which pinches the flesh and raise it upwards and cut away that flesh gently.
And you place on what remains of the flesh of the cauterizing corrosives until it is all gone, then you treat it with ointments until it heals. And if the corruption has affected the bone, then it is necessary to cut away that bone and remove it, for it will not heal as long as there is corrupt bone at all.
If you see the erosion and corruption spreading in the finger, then cut it off at one of the joints as mentioned before, then treat it until it heals. If the nail receives a blow or injury and severe pain occurs in it, then it is necessary to bleed the patient first.
Then you incise the nail with a sharp scalpel, an oblique incision from above downwards, and be careful not to reach with the incision to the flesh under the nail, for by doing so you cause the patient severe pain, and it will be a cause for the growth of excessive flesh in the place, then treat the place with what relieves pains.
As for the supernumerary finger which develops in some people's hands, it may be entirely fleshy, and it may have bones in some of it, and it may have a nail, and the growth of some of them is at the root of the joint of some of the fingers.
Or its growth may be in some of the finger joints. Those which grow in some of the finger joints do not move, and those which grow at the finger joint may move.  As for that which is fleshy only, its cutting is easy, and that is to cut it at its base with a wide scalpel.
As for that whose growth is at the root of the joint, its treatment is difficult, so avoid cutting it. As for that which grows in the finger at one of the joints, it is necessary first to cut its flesh in a circular cut to the bone, then to saw the bone with one of those saws suitable for that.
Then treat it until it heals. As for the adhesion which occurs to the fingers, some to some, this often occurs, and this is from what a person is born with, and it occurs when a wound heals or a burn from fire and the like.  Then it is necessary that you incise that adhesion.
Until the fingers return to their natural form. Then place between them a pledget or a piece of linen soaked in rose oil, lest it adhere quickly, and separate them, or place between them a thin lead plate until the place heals as it should.
Similarly, if adhesion occurs to some of the fingers with the palm, incise that adhesion according to what is suitable and improves the shape of the member.
Chapter Ninety.
On the cutting of polyps.
Polyps are thick, twisted veins filled with black, viscous matter which occur in most parts of the body, most frequently in the legs, especially in the legs of vine-dressers, reapers and porters. Firstly, strong rubbing of the body with black hellebore should be employed.
Then bleed the patient in the basilica vein.  As for treating it with iron, there are two methods: one is to incise and evacuate the black blood; the other is to extract the vein and remove it entirely. As for incision, the leg should first be bathed in hot water.
until the thick, turbid blood becomes liquefied. Then the patient's leg is bound from above the thigh to below the knee with a bandage, and then the vein is incised in one, two or three places with a wide incision.
Then you evacuate the black blood with your hand from the lower leg upwards and from above downwards until you remove the amount of blood you consider sufficient or what the patient's strength can bear.  Then you bandage it and instruct him to avoid foods that generate black bile.  The purging and bloodletting are repeated.
When the veins are full and this harms the patient. As for its extraction, this is how it is done: shave the patient's leg if it has much hair, then put him in the bath and bathe his leg in hot water until it reddens and sweats, or he performs vigorous exercise.
If a bath is not available, heat the limb. Then incise the skin over the vein lengthwise, either at its end near the knee or at its lower end near the heel.  Then open the skin with hooks and dissect the vein from every side until it is palpable.
When it appears, you will see it is dark red. When it is freed from the skin, it also looks like a tendon. Then insert a probe under it until it is raised and emerges from the skin; suspend it with a smooth, blunt hook. Then make another incision near that incision, about three fingers' breadth away.
Then dissect the skin from over the vein until it appears. Then raise it with the probe as you did before and suspend it with another hook as you did initially.  Then make another incision, or several incisions if needed.
Then extract it and cut it at the end of the incision near the heel. Then pull and extract it until it comes out of the second incision. Then pull it to the incision above it, and do this until you pull it from the third incision, the highest of all the incisions, until when it is all extracted, cut it.
If it does not yield to traction and dissection, insert a needle with strong doubled thread, tie it, and pull it. Insert the probe underneath and twist it with your hand in every direction until it emerges. Be careful that it does not break; if it breaks, it will be very difficult for you to extract it.
And harm will come to the patient from it. When you have extracted it completely, apply wool soaked in a medicament and rose oil or olive oil to the site of the incisions, and treat it until it heals. If the varicose vein is tense, tortuous, and twisted in places,
and not straight as we said, then it is necessary to incise it at each bend and twist. Then suspend it with hooks until you extract it entirely. Be careful when incising it not to cut or injure the vein, for it will make its extraction difficult for you; therefore, be careful.

Image of the blind hook.
It should not be hooked like other hooks, nor should it have a sharp point, lest it injure the vein. It should be thick, smooth, and curved. For if it is thin, it will cut the vein with its thinness. Rather, it should have a considerable thickness, as we said.
Chapter ninety-one.
On the removal of the varicose vein.
This vein develops in the legs in hot countries like the Hijaz and the lands of the Arabs, and in hot, barren, and sparsely fertile lands.  It may also develop in other parts of the body besides the legs, and its development is due to an infection that occurs under the skin.
As happens with living creatures and worms inside the bodies, and the gourd worm, and the worm that develops between the skin and the flesh.  A sign of the beginning of this vein is that intense inflammation occurs in the leg, then the area swells, and then the vein begins to emerge from the place of that swelling.
As if it were the root of a plant or animal; when its tip appears, it should be wrapped around a small piece of lead weighing one to two drachms, and tied, leaving the lead hanging from the leg.
Whenever something emerges from it to the outside, wrap it in the lead and tie it. If it becomes very long, cut some of it and wrap the remainder.  Do not cut it from its root before it has all emerged, for if you cut it, it will retract and enter the flesh, causing swelling and infection in the area and a foul ulcer.
Therefore, it should be carefully and gradually drawn out until all of it emerges and nothing remains in the body.  From this vein, in some people, something may emerge that is five or ten cubits in length.
It has been reported to me that it emerged from a man to a length of twenty cubits. If it breaks while you are treating it, insert a probe into its hole and gently probe it along the body until all its material is emptied.  Then attempt to cleanse the area with medicines for some days.
Then treat it as you would treat a tumor. This vein may have many branches, especially if it appears in a joint of the leg or in the leg itself, causing many openings. From each opening, a branch emerges. Treat it as we have mentioned in the classification and as previously described.
Chapter Ninety-Two.
Concerning the incision for the worm that is generated under the nail, which is called the cow's disease.
This disease is called in some of our countries "the cow's disease," because it frequently affects cows. It is a small single worm that is generated between the skin and flesh and moves throughout the body, ascending and descending.
Its movement from one member to another can be felt until it breaks through the skin at some point and emerges.  Its formation is from the corruption of some humors, as happens with worms, snakes, and gourd-like growths in the abdomen.
The danger from it is that if it moves in the body and ascends to the head and reaches the eye, it may open it and emerge, destroying the eye. This happens frequently. If you want to treat it and remove it, this should be done when it is moving and its presence is felt.
It is necessary to tightly bind above and below it with a strong ligature, then incise over it and remove it. If it has sunk into the flesh and you cannot find it, apply cautery with fire to the area until you burn it. The greatest danger, as we said, is its damaging the eye.
If you see it has reached the head near the eye, then bind tightly below it on the forehead, then incise over it and remove it. The patient should also be treated by purifying his body with purgative medicines for bad, corrupt humors, and should abstain from foods that produce corruption.
Chapter Ninety-Three.
Concerning the incision for the disease known as the *nafir*.
This disease, which in our country is called *nafir*, is a pain that appears in some organs and then moves from one organ to another; I have seen it as I describe to you.
I was called to a sick woman in the countryside. She uncovered her arm and showed me a slight swelling in a vein of the forearm. After a short time, I saw that swelling moving with the ulna, like a worm, ascending to her shoulder as quickly as possible, like mercury.
When it moved from one place to another, the pain disappeared from that place and settled in the shoulder. Then, after a while, it ran throughout the body until it reached the other arm. Then she told me that it went around her whole body, as I had witnessed.
I was amazed by the speed of its movement from one organ to another. I had never before seen this disease with my own eyes in this way, except that I had seen several people whose pain moved from one organ to another, but I had not seen it with my own eyes as I saw it in this woman.
I judged this to be because the woman was from the countryside, dry-bodied, with visible veins.  Therefore, that moving wind was perceptible, and it would not appear similarly in people of comfort and those with moist bodies and hidden veins.
If you wish to treat it and the patient feels pain, and if it appears to you visibly as we have mentioned, then bind above and below it tightly with a bandage and make an incision so that the collected wind escapes and cauterize the place.
If you do not see it with your eyes, then treat it by shaking the body and with things that dispel and disperse the wind, such as the seeds of  *Asafetida* and *Scabiosa* and similar medicines.
Chapter ninety-four.
On extracting arrows.
Arrows differ according to their types and according to the locations in the body where they are found. As for their differences according to their types, there are large and small ones, hollow glass ones and solid glass ones, and some have three points and some four.
Some have barbs and some have splinters. As for those according to the organs in which they are found, they are of two kinds: either the organs are hollow principal organs such as the brain, heart, liver, lung, kidneys, intestines, bladder, and the like; If an arrow has entered one of these organs and you see the signs of death which I will describe to you later, then you should avoid extracting that arrow from it, for death will overtake its owner in most instances. But if these bad signs do not appear to you and the arrow has not disappeared into the depth of the organ, then extract it and treat the wound.  And of the signs [of injury to] the brain, if an arrow strikes it and penetrates the bone and wounds the membrane upon the brain, then there will result from that a severe headache, stupor, and dizziness.
But if these bad signs do not appear to you and the arrow has not disappeared into the depth of the organ, then extract it and treat the wound.  And of the signs [of injury to] the brain, if an arrow strikes it and penetrates the bone and wounds the membrane upon the brain, then there will result from that a severe headache, stupor, and dizziness. And redness in the eyes and redness of the tongue, and convulsions, and confusion of the mind, and vomiting, and perhaps blood will come from the nostrils or ears, and perhaps speech will be lost and the voice will be gone, and a white moisture resembling gruel will come from the place of the wound, and from it will flow something like the water of flesh.
If these signs appear to you, then refrain from treating the patient and from extracting the arrow if it has not come out. As for the signs [of an arrow striking] the heart, if it is near the left breast and you feel it as if it has been driven into something solid and not into something empty,
and perhaps the arrow will have a movement resembling the pulse, and black blood will flow from the wound, and this will be followed by coldness of the extremities, and cold sweat, and fainting; then know that death is inevitably approaching. And a sign [of an arrow wounding] the lung is the outflow of frothy blood from the wound.
And the vessels which are next to the neck will swell, and the color of the patient will change, and he will breathe heavily and will seek to inhale cold air. If the arrow strikes the diaphragm which is in the chest, then it will be near the small ribs, and the breathing will be labored with severe pain.
And he will sigh and all the members of the shoulders will move. And if the arrow strikes the liver, severe pain will follow, and blood resembling the liver in its redness will come from the wound. And if the arrow strikes the stomach, then perhaps something undigested from the food will come from the wound.
And its condition is obvious. And if the arrow strikes the abdomen and becomes embedded in it, and something of the excrement or fat or intestine which has been perforated comes out from the wound, then there is no hope for its treatment or for extracting the arrow. If the arrow strikes the bladder and urine comes out,
and something protrudes from it to the outside and the pain becomes severe for the patient, then know that he is doomed. As for the other members, like the face, eye, throat, shoulder, arm, vertebrae of the back, clavicle, thigh, leg, and the like of the members, they are usually spared.
When the arrow does not encounter an artery or nerve and the arrow is not poisoned. And I inform you of some of what I have witnessed concerning these arrows so that you may thereby be guided in your treatment. And that is that an arrow once struck a man in the corner of his eye at the root of the nose.
Then I extracted it for him from the other side under the lobe of the ear and he recovered, and nothing untoward happened to his eye. And I extracted another arrow for a Jew which had struck him in the lobe of his eye under the lower eyelid, and the arrow had become hidden, and I seized only its small tip which is attached to the wood.
And it was a large arrow of the composite bows, square-headed, smooth, without barbs.  Then the Jew recovered, and no ill befell his eye. And I extracted another arrow from the throat of a Christian, and the arrow was Arabian.
And it is the one which has barbs; so I made an incision for him between the jugular veins, and it had sunk into his throat. So I gently manipulated it until I extracted it, and the Christian was saved and recovered. And I extracted another arrow for a man which had struck him in the abdomen, and we judged that he would die from it.
Then when thirty days or so had passed, and nothing in his condition had changed, I made an incision upon the arrow and maneuvered it, and extracted it, and he recovered, and no ill befell him. And I saw a man struck by an arrow in his back, and the wound had closed over it.
Then, after seven years, the arrow emerged at the root of his thigh. And I saw a woman who had been struck in her abdomen by an arrow, and the wound had closed, and the arrow remained.  Nothing in her condition changed, nor did she experience any harm from it in any of her natural functions.
And I saw another man struck by an arrow in his face, and the wound closed, and he felt little pain from it. And there are many similar cases. And I extracted an arrow for a man from the Sultan's bodyguard, which had struck him in the middle of his nose, leaning slightly to the right side.
And the entire arrow was hidden. I was called to treat him three days after the arrow struck. I found the arrow wound very narrow, so I explored it with a thin probe, but I did not feel it. He felt a stinging pain under his ear on the right side of the wound.
I hoped that this stinging pain was from the arrowhead, so I dressed the wound with a dressing possessing drawing and ripening power, hoping that the area would swell and the arrow’s location would be revealed, so I could incise it.  But nothing happened in the area to indicate that the arrow had reached that place.
I continued the dressing for many days, but nothing happened. Then, during that time, the wound closed, and the patient despaired of the arrow's removal for a time, until one day he felt the arrow inside his nose and told me.  I then applied a strong, corrosive medication to the wound for many days.
Until it opened, and I probed it. I felt the thin end of the arrow that adheres to the wood. Then I increased the opening of the wound with that strong medication until the arrowhead appeared before us.  I spent about four months dealing with this.
Then, when the wound widened and I could insert forceps into it, I pulled and moved it, but it did not come out.  I continued to gently manipulate it and devise ways using various instruments until one day I grasped it with strong forceps, as its image is shown at the end of the chapter.
The physicians judged that the cartilage of his nose would not heal, but I healed it, and the wound closed, and the patient recovered completely, without any further harm. I tell you how to extract some arrows to make this a measure and a guide for what I have not mentioned.
Because the parts and details of this craft cannot be grasped by description nor contained in a book.  Rather, the skillful artisan judges the much from the little, the absent from the present, and devises a new work and a new instrument for strange emergencies.
If we descend from this craft, then I say that arrows are extracted from the members in which they are lodged in two ways: either by pulling from the point of entry, or from the opposite direction, and those that are extracted from where they entered.
Either the arrow is protruding in a fleshy place, in which case it is pulled out.  If it does not readily come out at the time, then you should leave it for a few days until the flesh around it putrefies, making it easier to pull out. This also applies if it is lodged in bone.
And if it does not readily come out, leave it also for days and return to pulling and moving it every day, for then it will come out.  If it does not come out after days, then you should pierce around the arrow in the bone itself from every side with a delicate borer, until you widen the space for the arrow, then pull it out.
If the arrow lodged in the skull has penetrated deeply into one of the ventricles of the brain and some of those symptoms I mentioned appear in the patient, then refrain from pulling out the arrow and leave it until its condition improves after a few days.
then proceed to pull out the arrow. If it is very firmly lodged and does not come out easily, use the borers around the arrow as I described to you, then treat the area until it heals.  As for if the arrow has disappeared into a part of the body, and is hidden from sensation, then probe for it with a probe. If you feel it, pull it out with some instruments suitable for pulling it out. If you cannot reach it because of the narrowness of the wound and the depth of the arrow, and there is neither bone, nor nerve, nor vein,
then incise it until the wound is widened and you can reach the arrow so that you can remove it. If it has barbs, grasp them, and free the flesh attached to them from every side by every means you can.  If you cannot free the flesh, break the barbs and twist them until you succeed.
And when you attempt to remove the arrow, wherever it may be, use the forceps to twist your hand in all directions until you free it. Be extremely gentle, lest the arrow break and it becomes difficult for you to pull it out. If you cannot remove it at once,
leave it for a few days until the flesh around it becomes putrid, then try again; it will then be easier. If bleeding occurs, use the treatments mentioned in their respective chapters.  Guard against cutting a vein, nerve or tendon, and use skill.
By any means you can, free the arrow; let this be done gently, slowly and firmly as I have described to you. It is necessary that when you pull out the arrow, you place the patient in the position he was in when the arrow struck him; this is most suitable.
If you cannot do that, use whatever positions you can. As for an arrow that exits on the opposite side, either a part of it will have emerged, or you will feel the tip of the arrow just under the skin, and see it protruding.
Incise it, and let the incision be large enough for the forceps. Then pull it out; it will be easy to remove. If it is stuck in a bone, twist your hand circularly so that the arrow affects the bone and makes room for itself, then pull it out.
Otherwise, leave it for a few days, then return to it until it comes out. If the arrow shaft is still there, push it with it. If the shaft has fallen off and you wish to use pushing, insert the hollow instrument so that its cavity enters the end of the arrow, then push it with that.
If the arrow is hollow, push it with an instrument that enters that cavity; the arrow will then easily come out. If the arrow is poisoned, it is necessary that you cut away all the flesh in which the poison is, if you can, and then treat it with what is suitable for that.
If the arrow is lodged in the chest, abdomen, bladder, or flank, and is near enough to be felt with a probe, and you can incise it, then incise and be careful not to cut a vein or nerve, and remove it.
Then suture the wound if it needs suturing, and treat it until it heals.  A picture of the forceps with which arrows are extracted:
Their ends are like a bird's beak; they are made like a file, so that when they grasp the arrow or anything, they do not let go.  Large, small, and medium-sized ones can be made, all according to the size of the arrow and the width and narrowness of the wound.
A picture of the hollow pusher:
A picture of the solid pusher:
This has a solid end like an awl to facilitate its entry into the hollow arrow and its pushing.
Chapter ninety-five.
In the incision of veins.
The veins which it is customary to bleed in the body number thirty; of these, sixteen are in the head: the two pulsating veins behind the ears, known as the “sensitive ones,” and the two arteries in the temples which are apparent, and the two veins in the corners of the eyes known as the “visual ones.”
And the vein rising in the middle of the forehead, and the vein at the tip of the nose, and the two jugular veins in the neck, and the two veins in the upper lip of the mouth, and the two veins in the lower lip—these veins are known as the “jugarks”—and the two veins under the tongue.
As for the veins which are bled in the arm and hand, they are five veins; one of them is the cephalic, which is on the ulnar side, and the common people call it the vein of the head; and the median, which is the middle vein, and it is composed of a branch of the basilic and a branch of the cephalic, and the common people call it the vein of the body.
And the basilic, which is situated on the medial side, and it is also called the axillary, and the common people call it the vein of the abdomen; and the vein of the arm, which is situated on the ulna, and to which it adheres, and which appears clearly above the thumb; and the azygos.
And this is the vein which is between the little finger and the ring finger; it has two branches. And in the leg and foot there are three veins: one of them is that which is below the hollow of the knee on the ulnar side; and the second is the saphenous, and its place is at the heel on the medial side; and the vein of the sciatic nerve, and its place is at the heel on the ulnar side.
And in the other leg there are three veins similar to them. As for the two veins which are behind the ears, the benefit of bleeding them is for chronic colds, migraine, ringworm, and chronic, bad sores of the head; and their method of bleeding is as I describe.
And that is to shave the head of the patient and rub his scalp well in the place of the two veins with a rough cloth, then the patient's neck is constricted with a turban until the two veins and their location behind the ears appear in the two lowest places of the head; then you search for them with your finger, and where you feel their pulse under your finger, there you mark with ink.
Then you take a lancet, which is known as the *nashal*, and you insert it under the vein in the skin until the lancet reaches the bone; then you lift your hand with the vein and skin upwards and cut the vein along with the skin, a cut that is severed, and the length of the cut should be the amount of two closed fingers.
Or something similar, and you let out the amount of blood that you want, then you bind them with bandages and leave them until they heal.  Cutting and cauterizing them has been discussed earlier in the book. As for the two arteries which are in the temples, the benefit of bleeding them is for chronic migraine, severe headache, persistent ophthalmia, and the flow of sharp humors directed towards the eyes.
And their method of bleeding is as I describe to you: the patient's neck is constricted with a turban until the veins appear clearly to the touch, and their pulse becomes apparent under your finger; then you mark with ink. Then you lift the skin from above the vein upwards with your index finger.
And you insert the lancet (*nashal*) from below and lift the vein upwards and sever it as you did with the other two veins, and you let out blood according to your need; then you loosen the patient's neck constriction and place your finger on the vein for a while.
Then you place cotton and a bandage on it and bind it tightly from above and leave it until it heals.  Their mention, cutting, and cauterization have been discussed earlier in the book. As for bleeding the vein of the forehead, its benefit is, after bleeding the cephalic vein, for chronic facial ailments such as ringworm, ulcers and persistent redness.
And the method of bleeding it, as I describe to you: the patient constricts his neck with a turban until the vein appears; then you take the instrument called the axe, and this is its image:
You place the projecting point which is in the head of the axe on the vein itself and strike from above with a comb or something similar, and you let the blood flow to the extent you desire; then you loosen the patient's neck constriction and bind it until it heals.
It may be opened with a wide lancet, but it should not be sharp-pointed like other lancets, rather it should be slightly broad-ended, and you should bleed it obliquely, because the bone is near, and the lancet might break in it if it is thin.
As for the two veins in the temples, their benefit is for eye ailments such as ringworm, redness, and blepharoptosis, and facial diseases. As for the method of bleeding them, it is that the patient constricts his neck with a turban, then you bleed them while you are standing over his head, and let the bleeding be slightly obliquely lengthwise with a small, slightly broad lancet.
For the place has no flesh in it; if the lancet is thin-pointed, it might break. Then you draw off the amount of blood you need and put cotton on them and bind them for one night, then unbind them. As for bleeding the vein of the nose, it is beneficial for acute fevers.
And severe headache and facial diseases such as erysipelas which appears in the nose, especially if it is chronic.  The method of bleeding it is that the patient constricts his neck, then you grasp his nose with your left hand and take a thin, long lancet.
And you insert it in the middle of the nasal septum itself, between the nasal partition, straightly, because the vein does not appear to the touch there. Then the blood will immediately appear. You should push your hand a little with the lancet and draw off the amount of blood you need, then bind it for a night, for it clots quickly.
As for the jugular veins, the benefit of bleeding them is for shortness of breath, the onset of leprosy, and melancholic diseases which appear on the surface of the skin, such as black vitiligo, scabies, bad ulcers and sores.  The method of bleeding them is that the patient constricts beneath them in his neck with a bandage, and the surgeon stands at the head of the patient.
And the patient is seated on a chair, then you bleed the vein lengthwise, a somewhat wide bleeding, then you draw off a moderate amount of blood, or according to what you see is necessary. Then you do likewise with the other vein, then you untie the bandage.
And you constrict the two veins moderately, lest the patient suffocate, and you leave him until the next day, for the wound will heal. As for the veins of the temples, the benefit of bleeding them, after bleeding the cephalic vein, is that it benefits from canker sores in the mouth, corruption of the gums, bad ulcers, cracking of the lips, and bad ulcers.
which are in and around the nose.  The method of bleeding them is that you seat the patient before you and constrict his neck with a turban, then you turn back his lips and look at the two veins, one of which you see to the right of the lip and the other to the left, and you identify them by their blackness.
And that is also because around them are small, black veins; so cut them with a cutting incision. If it is difficult for you and you do not know which they are, then aim to cut the largest and most evident of them.  Likewise, do with the two veins in the lower lip.
As for the two veins under the tongue, the benefit of bleeding them after bleeding the cephalic vein is for the inflammations that occur in the throat from disease of the uvula and diseases of the mouth. The method of bleeding them is that you seat the patient before you facing the sun, and you raise his tongue and look under the tongue, on one side one vein and on the other side another vein, and their color is dark.
Then you bleed them, and be careful not to go too far in cutting them, for beneath them are arteries, and bleeding from those arteries may occur. As for the three veins that are bled in the elbow, they are those which it is customary to bleed in all people, and their bleeding is in two ways.
Either by piercing with a wide, wind-shaped or olive-shaped lancet to the depth of the flesh, or by cutting with a knife-shaped lancet, which is the scalpel [and this is its image], the image of the wide wind-shaped lancet:
It is wide, as you see, so that it is suitable for opening hollow, full, prominent, apparent, thick veins which contain thick, turbid blood. And this is the image of the olive-shaped lancet:
And this lancet is less wide and thinner at the tip; it is suitable for bleeding thin veins which contain thin, yellowish blood. And this is the image of the scalpel lancet:
This is the scalpel which is suitable for cutting, and there are wide and narrow types of it, according to the width and narrowness of the veins also. And one may infer from this [description] others [types of scalpels], and it is well-known to the artisans.
And as for the basilic vein, which is one of these three veins, the benefit of bleeding it is that it draws blood from the illnesses which are under the throat and neck, from what is next to the chest and abdomen.  It is necessary for the phlebotomist, when bleeding it, to be cautious and be on the alert, for beneath it is an artery. If he errs and goes too deep with the lancet, he will cut that artery.
Then bleeding will occur, therefore it is necessary that its bleeding should not be done with a lancet for puncturing, but its bleeding should be by incision with the scalpel.  If the basilic vein does not appear clearly, then it is necessary to avoid it and turn to another [vein] or seek one of its branches.
Or bleed in its place the vein of the arm, for it is clear, and incise it with the scalpel lancet as we said. If you wish to bleed it itself, then before tightening the arm it is necessary to feel the place until you recognize the place of the pulse, then mark it with ink.
Then you tie the arm and incise the vein with a sharp incision with the scalpel lancet as we said, and take care that the incision is far from the place of the artery. And when you see, upon tightening the bandage, a swelling in the place which you marked with ink, then that swelling is the swelling of the artery, so avoid it.
If you see the blood, upon bleeding, spurt like the urine of a boy, and the blood is thin and red, then know that it is from the artery.  Then immediately place your finger on it for a long time, then remove your finger. If the bleeding stops—and it often stops—then tighten the bandage.
And leave it, and warn the patient against neglecting it, and let him be on his back and not move for several days until it heals. If the bleeding does not stop and it overcomes you and you do not have medicine at hand, then amputate the artery if it appears to you, for its ends will contract and the bleeding will stop.
Or take a pistachio shell and split it, and take one half and bind it tightly to the place of the vein with a bandage and pledgets until the next day. If the bleeding stops, well and good; otherwise, treat it with what was previously mentioned of applying styptics, and stopping its bleeding is not difficult in most cases.
Because of the smallness of the wound and the tightness of the bandage on the arm, know this. As for the basilic vein, the benefit of bleeding it is that it draws blood from the head and the lower body because it is composed of a branch from the basilic and a branch from the cephalic, as we said.
It is necessary for the one who bleeds him to be on his back when bleeding him, for beneath it is a nerve. If he goes too deep with the lancet and injures the nerve, numbness will occur in it which is difficult to cure, and perhaps it will not heal at all. This nerve is often perceptible to the touch.
If it is hidden in some people and is thin and cannot be distinguished, then you should make your incision with a lancet and avoid the nerve as much as possible. If the vein is between two nerves, then split the vein lengthwise. As for the cephalic vein, the benefit of bleeding it is that it draws blood from the head.
It benefits from eye diseases, and it is necessary in this vein especially, if you wish to bleed it, to make an incision with an olive-shaped lancet or with a broad, basil-shaped lancet because it is the safest of all veins, because there is no artery or nerve beneath it.
Except that it is necessary for you, when bleeding, to avoid the head of the muscle with the lancet and seek the soft place.  It does not harm him if he is not hit by the first incision to be bled again several times, except that perhaps swelling will occur in some people if it is not bled on the first incision.
But that swelling does not harm him at all. As for the method of bleeding, its complications, and what should precede in its treatment, the first of that is that you should know that bleeding is either used only to maintain health.
And it is either used in diseases.  That which is used to maintain health and longevity and to guard against the occurrence of diseases is that bleeding should be in one of the three veins in the elbow, I mean the cephalic, the median basilic, and the basilic, and that the bleeding should be at the beginning of spring if signs of plethora appear.
And the bleeding should be on Sunday or Tuesday after three hours of the day have passed. As for bleeding that is used in diseases, it does not have a limited time, but whenever need and necessity demand it, day or night.
And in every hour and at every time.  Children should not be bled until they reach fourteen years of age, nor should the elderly who have passed sixty years of age be bled. If someone intends to bleed for whatever reason,
he should cleanse his intestines before bleeding with a gentle enema if there is much retained feces, lest there be drawn into the veins from the intestines foul excesses that harm the principal organs. And one who is feverish, or drunk, or intoxicated should not be bled until that passes from them.
Bleeding should also be avoided after dysentery, vomiting, diarrhea, excessive coitus, exertion, exercise, wakefulness, fasting, and everything that weakens the body, whether physical or mental. Then look to the thinning of the humors beforehand if the blood is thick.
with foods, drinks, and medicines if he can, then he should enter the bath if nothing prevents him, or engage in some exercise so that the blood is thinned and make his bleeding in the middle of the day as we said, and he should intend to clear his chest that day of all bad psychological symptoms.
like worries, anger, and fear, and from all physical symptoms like excessive fatigue and exertion, coitus, and the like.  And he should have present in his session the things that people are accustomed to using, such as various perfumes, fragrant herbs, entertainment, and the like, each person as much as he can.
Then the phlebotomist sits on a cushion higher than the cushion on which the patient sits, then he extends his arm and the phlebotomist rubs it with his hand two or three times, then he tightens the ligature with the shackle and twists it two or three times, and let the tightening be moderate.
For if the tightening is not moderate, either by excessive tightening, it prevents the flow of blood, or if it is relaxed, it also prevents the flow of blood. Then, after tightening, the patient should rub both his hands together.
until the veins swell and become perceptible to the touch. Then the phlebotomist wipes the lancet with a little old oil, especially, then he places the index finger of his left hand on the same vein a little below the place he wants to bleed, lest the vein slip away and avoid the incision. Because some veins you find are like a tendon, they slip away during phlebotomy, and some are full of wind, so when you place the lancet on them, they sink under the lancet and deceive the phlebotomist, and the lancet does not open the vein, or if it opens it, it is only a narrow opening.
Therefore, the phlebotomist should be certain and deliberate in all these matters, then he lowers the lancet; if the vein opens from that incision, otherwise he repeats it again a little below or above that place quickly if the place has not swollen.
If the patient swells or is distressed, leave him for a day or two and do not tighten the ligature, for it may cause a hot swelling, and do not enter the bath, then he may repeat the phlebotomy if he wishes. If the lancet is inserted and the opening is small and the flow of blood is thin,
and you fear that the desired amount of blood will not come out, then return the lancet into the same hole gently and straight, and increase the opening slightly, and do this quickly before the place swells, for in many people the place may swell with a small opening.
But if you see it has swollen, do not repeat it at all, for it will not help you. Place something of oil dregs on it, for it facilitates the flow of blood and is better in this place than the oil itself and other ointments as well.
So use oil dregs in all your phlebotomies when the flow of blood is difficult.  And the theriac Pharun and the shekhzenaya may do this if one of them is placed on the place, for the blood will thin and dissolve if it is thick.
If a large swelling occurs at the site of phlebotomy—and this often happens, especially to someone who has been phlebotomized only that one time or the opening of the vein was small—then act quickly and place a sponge soaked in slightly warmed salt water on the swelling and bind it for an hour, for it will resolve.
And it is necessary that you do this after the complete exit of blood from the vein itself or from another vein. If something of blackness or greenness remains in the place after days, it does no harm. If you wish, apply something of aloes and myrrh dissolved.
Or something of the juice of the fudung and the like. Often a swelling and a protrusion occur when phlebotomizing the basilic vein. Place your hand on it; if you find it soft when you poke it, then that is a bad protrusion.  Beware of putting anything on it from what we have mentioned.
For it may bleed arterial blood. But bandage it with something astringent to constrict the place, then treat it with the rest of the treatment until it heals. It is necessary that you remove from each person a quantity of blood proportionate to his strength and what appears of the color predominating in the blood.
For if the blood is black, let it flow until it reddens. And likewise, if you see it thick, let it flow until it thins. And likewise if it is sharp, until its sharpness goes away.  It is necessary for someone who is full-bodied and strong and needs to have blood removed all at once...
...to widen the phlebotomy and the lancet should be wide. And for someone who is weak, the opposite. It is necessary that you remove it in several times and that the hole be narrow.  The best thing to use in phlebotomy is something sharp, well-honed, incised, not pierced.
And this type of phlebotomy is safe from bleeding and from cutting a nerve. It is better and safer than phlebotomy across and lengthwise. And if someone is accustomed to fainting during phlebotomy, then it is necessary to give him before phlebotomy something of bread soaked in pomegranate water or oxymel.
If he is feverish and blood is removed from him in three or four times, then if he is cold-natured, let him take before phlebotomy bread soaked in hydromel or in sweetened honey-drink with herbs or in a fragrant rose-water drink.
If fainting occurs during phlebotomy and its cause is the removal of much blood, then it is necessary that he be given meat broth and a light rose-water drink. And he should use fragrant galbanum, and rub his chest with it, and use everything else we mentioned in the section on fainting.
which results from vomiting. And as for someone who wants to relieve his arm and thin his blood again, it is necessary for someone whose phlebotomy was for copious evacuation and whose strength is weak that the blood be thinned little by little according to his strength in successive days.
And as for someone who wants to relieve his arm and thin his blood again and his body is strong, let him do that after seven or nine hours from his first phlebotomy. And as for someone who wants to draw blood from his body to the opposite side from which it inclined, then it is necessary to relieve him on the second or third day.
And as for someone in whose body there is much blood, which has become hot and sharp and caused fever, then it is necessary to remove blood from him in a single instance and remove a large amount, and widen the opening until fainting occurs, after having observed all the conditions of phlebotomy. And that you place your hand on his pulse during the flow of blood, lest death occur instead of fainting, for that often happens if the phlebotomist is ignorant and negligence occurs. And it is not necessary, if you want to open the arm and thin the blood again,
if the mouth of the vein has closed and the exit of blood is difficult, that you prick it forcefully or twist it strongly, for that is very bad. Rather, either you leave it until you phlebotomize it again, or you remove with the blade of the lancet what has frozen of the blood in the mouth of the vein.
Or you apply something of salt dissolved in water, or you apply something of theriac or *shakhzanaya*, and prick it delicately until the blood comes out.  If the vein has swollen, then leave it.
And do not touch it until the swelling subsides. If necessity dictates a second bloodletting, then either you phlebotomize above that place, or you phlebotomize in the other arm or in another vein.
As for phlebotomy of the brachial vein, it is phlebotomized instead of the basilic and cephalic veins if they are not found or are hidden, because it is composed of them.  Its method of phlebotomy is that the patient puts his hand in hot water until the forearm reddens and the vein appears clearly, then it is tied above it with a ligature slightly, with a moderate tightening.
Then you phlebotomize the vein at a slight angle, neither transversely nor longitudinally, and let the opening be wide, and your phlebotomy should be slightly above the wrist joint. If the exit of blood is difficult, return the hand to the vessel of hot water and let the blood flow into the water.
Until it reaches your need. If you are in the summer months, you may dispense with returning the hand to the hot water.  The use of hot water to facilitate blood flow is mostly done in winter. Phlebotomy of this vein is safer than all other veins. Because there is neither a major vein nor a nerve beneath it. As for phlebotomy of the cephalic vein from the right hand, it is beneficial for liver ailments. Its method of phlebotomy is that you tie the wrist with a ligature or with your hand after putting it in hot water until the vein swells.
Because there is neither a major vein nor a nerve beneath it. As for phlebotomy of the cephalic vein from the right hand, it is beneficial for liver ailments. Its method of phlebotomy is that you tie the wrist with a ligature or with your hand after putting it in hot water until the vein swells. It becomes very apparent to the touch, then you phlebotomize it at a slight angle; and even if you sever it completely, it will not harm him at all. Be careful not to push your hand deeply with the lancet, for beneath it are the nerves of the fingers, and the location is devoid of flesh. Then return the hand to the hot water.
And leave it to flow.  If you do not return it to hot water, the blood will clot in the opening of the vein and will cease flowing. When you have drawn the required amount of blood, apply fat and salt to the vein, lest it close quickly.
And similarly you should act with every narrow branch. As for the benefit of phlebotomy from the left hand, it is beneficial for ailments of the spleen; and you act in its phlebotomy just as you did in the second, the same. As for phlebotomy of the saphenous vein, its benefit is for diseases in the lower part of the body, such as uterine ailments.
And retention of menses, and kidney diseases, and chronic ulcers of the thighs and legs, and similar diseases.  Its method of phlebotomy is that he puts his leg in hot water and you massage it until the veins swell, then you tie above the ankle joint with a ligature, and the vein is located at the heel, apparent towards the great toe.
And many branches extend from it on the instep of the foot.  Therefore, phlebotomize it in the widest branch, or at the heel, at its confluence; this is best and safest. If you phlebotomize it on the instep, then beware of the nerves that lie beneath it on the instep.
And make your phlebotomy of it by twisting, as if you want to cut it off, and let the lancet be sharp. If the blood's exit is difficult, let him return his foot to the hot water and let the blood flow until it is emptied. If the phlebotomist misses the vein at the first attempt...
let him return to phlebotomizing a little higher, for the place is safe and there is no fear of harm from it if you avoid the nerve, as we said. And similarly you act with the saphenous vein of the other leg, the same. As for the sciatic vein, its location, as we said, is at the heel from the lateral side.
And its benefit is for hip pain, if that is from hot blood. And its method of phlebotomy is that you place the patient in the bath and hasten, and you bind his leg from the hip to above the heel with four fingers' breadth of a thin, long bandage, for it does not appear except in this way.
Then, when it appears, phlebotomize it in any way that suits you; either by twisting, which is best, or by cutting it off completely, or by incising it, for its location is safe.  And in most people it is very hidden; if you do not find it...
and it does not appear at all to the touch, then phlebotomize some of its branches, which are those that appear on the dorsum of the foot toward the little finger and ring finger, and be careful of the nerves, and let out the amount of blood you want.
Then loosen the binding and place cotton on the site of phlebotomy and bind the place, for it quickly heals.
Chapter ninety-six.
On cupping and its method of use.
Cupping vessels may be made of horn, wood, copper, or glass, and cupping is of two types: one is cupping with incision and evacuation of blood, and the other is cupping without incision.
And this cupping without incision is of two types.
And cupping of the two sides of the neck, on both sides completely; and cupping of the chin, which is under the lower jaw; and cupping of the shoulders; and cupping of the coccyx, on the sacrum; and cupping of the forearms, which are the middles of the arms; and cupping of the legs; and cupping of the heels.
Cupping draws blood from the small veins scattered in the flesh, and for this reason it does not weaken as much as phlebotomy.  And cupping, whether with fire or without, should not be used in any of the illnesses that result from fullness until the whole body is purged.
If cupping is needed because of illness or custom, we use it at any time, at the beginning of the month, at the end of the month, in the middle of it, and at any time.
That is because some people, when their blood increases to the point that it needs to be removed by cupping, find heaviness and headache in their heads. And some find fullness and redness in their face, head, and neck. And some find itching in their face and sides, darkness and pain in their eyes. And some itch at the site of their cupping.
And some laugh a lot. And some find the taste of blood in their mouths, their gums swell, and they spit blood. And some sleep a lot. And some see blood, redness, pus, and wounds in their sleep, and things like that. So whenever we see any of that...
Especially if it is in the middle third of the month, we order cupping then after two or three hours of the day have passed. As for the benefit of cupping the temples, it benefits from heaviness in the head and water flowing into the eyes.
But it should be after emptying the whole body. And this cupping can be a substitute for phlebotomy of the cephalic vein. And it is warned against using it for someone who has a cold brain or has a cold, for it harms him greatly.
Therefore, the elderly and those with cold diseases in their heads should not use it.  And whoever frequently uses it will develop forgetfulness.
Therefore, you should instruct the cupper to lower his hand with the cupping glass a little lower, for fear of causing forgetfulness. As for cupping the nape of the neck, it is a substitute for phlebotomy of the basilic and cephalic veins.
Therefore, it benefits from asthma, shortness of breath, rupture of the respiratory apparatus, cough, and fullness.  The cupping of the nape of the neck should be raised a little, for if it is lowered, it causes weakness in the heart and stomach.
As for cupping the temples, it benefits from headaches, ophthalmia, migraine, angina, and toothache. It is a substitute for phlebotomy of the basilic vein. You should instruct the cupper not to deepen his hand in the incision, lest he cut a vein and cause bleeding.
As for cupping under the chin, it benefits from thrush in the mouth, corruption of the gums, and similar diseases in the mouth. It may replace phlebotomy of the veins in the lips. As for cupping the shoulders, it benefits from palpitations that result from fullness and heat.
As for cupping the forearms, it benefits from what benefits phlebotomy of the three veins—the basilic, cephalic, and median—because it draws blood from all those small veins in the flesh, and it draws those small veins from other thicker veins until the drawing reaches the three large veins.
You should instruct the cupper not to deepen the incision, because the area is devoid of flesh and beneath it are nerves and arteries. As for the single cupping applied to the coccyx, it benefits from hemorrhoids and lower sores.
You should instruct the cupper that the cupping glass be large and made of copper, because the area requires strong suction, and a glass cupping glass might break and require much incision. As for cupping the legs, it visibly reduces fullness.
Because it draws blood from the whole body, it benefits from chronic pains in the kidneys, uterus, and bladder; it promotes menstruation; it benefits from boils and abscesses; and it replaces phlebotomy of the saphenous veins and the veins of the ankles, except that it greatly weakens the body and causes fainting in most people.  The benefit of cupping the ankles is similar to the benefit of cupping the legs.
The method of applying cupping glasses is that the cupping glass is first placed empty and moderate suction is applied. Do not prolong the application of cupping glasses, but rather apply them quickly and remove them quickly so that the humors flow to the area evenly. Continue to repeat this until you see the area has reddened and opened.
When the redness of blood appears, then incise and resume suction slowly. Then look at the condition of the bodies; if a person has thin flesh with porous skin, then you should incise only once, lest the area ulcerate.
And instruct the cupper to widen the incision and deepen it slightly, and to adjust the suction gently and with a light movement. If the blood is thick, then it should be incised twice; in the first incision, to open a path for the thin watery blood, and in the second, to completely extract the thick blood.
If the blood is very turbid, repeat the incision a third time to achieve the goal. In short, if we want to extract a little blood, we are content with one incision; if we want to extract a lot of blood, we make more incisions, especially if we judge the blood to be thick.
It is necessary that we make a deep incision; the moderate limit in the incision is only the depth of the skin. What ointments should be used when applying cupping glasses, and what waters, and what the cupped person should avoid. As for someone whose skin is thick, hard, dry, and whose pores are narrow,
then the places of the cupping glasses should be anointed with opening, softening, resolving ointments; and if it is in the summer time, then with such as the oil of hypericum, or oil of violet, or oil of sweet almond, or oil of pumpkin seed.
And if it is in the winter, then such as oil of narcissus, or oil of iris, or oil of chamomile, or lily, and the like. If the waste is thick and cold, let the ointment be oil of germander, or oil of savory, or oil of pennyroyal, or oil of rue, and the like.
If the cupped person has wide pores and soft flesh, then the ointment should be avoided. These should wash their cupping places after cupping with rose water, or with cold water, or with water of fox grapes, or with gourd water, or with water of chickweed, and the like.  As for someone whose blood is very moist,
he should wash his cupping places with vinegar, or with water of asafoetida and sumac, and the like. As for someone whose waste is thick, he should wash his cupping places with old wine, or with water of germander, or a decoction of rue, or chamomile, and the like.  Cupping should be avoided in the bath and after the bath.
Rather, it should be used after leaving the bath by an hour or two. No one should sleep after cupping.  What the cupped and bled person should manage before and after cupping.
First, it must be considered: if the cupped or bled person is choleric, and sharpness and inflammation predominate in his blood, then he should take refrigerants such as pomegranate and dandelion with vinegar, lettuce, oxymel, and sherbet, and the like. And he should make his foods of fowl and lamb stews, and sour things, and the like.
And if his temperament is cold, then he should be given honeyed drinks and drinks of myrobalan or seed oxymel, and he should consume moderately perfumed wine, that which is between old and new. He should be ordered to eat little, and he should make his food of fowl, partridges, sparrows and squabs, stews.  On the day of cupping and bleeding, drink should be more than food.
And it may be necessary to give some people, at certain times, some of the theriac of Avicenna, or musk medicine, or silphium, before cupping and before or after bleeding, to strengthen the principal organs and thin the blood.  It should not be given to those who are feverish.
As for cuppings which are without a condition, they are those which are placed on the liver, spleen, breasts, abdomen, navel, the region of the kidneys, and the hip joint, for these organs do not tolerate being conditioned, but they are desired either to draw blood from one organ to another.
Such as placing the cupping glass on the breasts in a case of epistaxis, or we use it to remove a cold humor which has settled in an organ, such as placing the cupping glass on the abdomen and navel, for it loosens the organ, warms it, and removes the pain by resolving that humor.
It may be placed on the kidneys if there is an obstruction or stone present there, for by the strength of its drawing it may open the obstruction or dislodge the stone from its place.  Likewise it acts if it is placed on the liver and spleen when there is a humor that disturbs them.  These cuppings may be used empty, by suction only.
It may be used with fire, or it may be used filled with lukewarm water in cases of inflammation. That is, fill the cupping glass, and let it be large, with hot water alone, or with water in which some herbs suitable for this purpose have been boiled.
Then it is placed full on the place, held, and removed, and repeated several times according to need. And this is the image of the cupping glass which is used with fire:
Its mouth should be the width of two open fingers, as we have pictured, and its depth half a span. And there should be in its side, about halfway up, a small hole about as large as an awl can enter. It is made of Chinese copper or yellow copper, with a thick rim.
Smooth, even, and polished, lest it injure the member when placed upon it. And in its middle there should be a transverse groove of copper or iron, where the burning candle is placed. This cupping glass may be made larger than we have described or smaller, according to the diseases.
And the manner of its use is that the cupping glasses for boys and thin people are not the same as those for men and stout-bodied people. As for the manner of placing this cupping glass with fire on the member, it is to prepare a burning wick of tightly woven linen or a small candle of pitch and to place it on the middle of the solidified rod which is in the middle of the cupping glass.
So that the ascent of the fire will be upwards towards the bottom of the cupping glass, lest it burn the body of the patient. Then it is placed on the member, and the finger on the hole which we mentioned, until, when we have cupped as much as we need, the finger is removed.
And the vapor will exit through that hole, and the cupping glass will adhere to the place. Then prepare the wick in the manner described and replace it if you need to.  As for the cupping glass which is used in the treatment of phlegm with water, it does not have a solidified rod nor a hole.
It is only used by being filled with water and placed on the member.  And this is its form:
And this cupping glass, the larger it is so that it holds much water, the better it is.
Chapter ninety-seven.
On the suspension of the leech.
Leeches are used mostly in cases where cupping glasses cannot be applied, either because of the small size of the member, like the lip and gum and the like, or because the member is devoid of flesh, like the finger and nose and the like.
And the method of using them is that you should choose leeches which are in fresh, pure water, free from impurities, then leave them for a day and a night in fresh water until they are hungry and nothing remains in their bellies. Then the body is first purged by bloodletting or cupping, then the affected member is wiped.
Until it reddens, then it is applied; and when it is full, it falls off. And if it is possible to cup the place, it is more effective; otherwise, wash the place with vinegar, then with plenty of water, and rub and squeeze it.  If the bleeding continues after the leech falls off, and it is a trickle, then let a linen cloth be dipped in cold water.
And place it on top until the trickle stops. If the bleeding is profuse, sprinkle on it powdered vitriol or gallnuts or the like of astringents until the bleeding stops, or apply halves of peeled lupins to the place.
And leave it until the lupin adheres to the place, for then the blood will stop.  And it is preferable, if it is necessary to reapply leeches, not to use those leeches if others are available.  If the leeches refuse to attach, let the place be wiped with fresh blood.
Or stick a needle into the place until some blood comes out, then apply them; for when they sense some blood, they will attach themselves. And if you want to make them fall off, sprinkle on them some aloes or salt or ashes, for then they will fall off.
Chapter Three.
On Setting (bones).
This chapter also is from and about what is needed in the art of medicine, which is the setting of fractures and dislocations occurring in bones.
Know, O my sons, that this chapter is claimed by the ignorant among physicians and the common people, and by those who have never looked at any book of the ancients on it, nor read a single word thereof.
For this reason, this art of knowledge has become nonexistent in our country, and I have never encountered anyone at all who was skilled in it. And I only derived what I have derived from my long study of the books of the ancients and my eagerness to understand them, until I extracted knowledge of it from them; then I devoted myself to experimentation and practice throughout my life.
And I have described for you in this chapter everything that my knowledge encompasses of it. And my experience has passed over it after I have brought it closer to you and freed it from the branches of prolixity, and shortened it to the utmost, and clarified it to the utmost, and depicted for you therein many images of the instruments used in it.
For it is from an increase in explanation, as I did in the preceding two chapters, and there is no strength except in God, the Most High, the Most Great.
The first chapter.
In it are summaries and collections concerning the matter of fractured bones, and it is necessary to present them. And before we begin to mention the fractured and dislocated members one by one, it is necessary that we mention at the beginning of this chapter summaries of speech and sections. It compels you first to understand them and stand upon their truth, you and whoever else is eager to learn this noble craft.
Then I say that when a fracture or dislocation or wound or fall occurs to someone, it is necessary to hasten first to bleed him or purge him or both. Unless something prevents it, such as weakness of strength, or the one to whom this has happened is a child or a very old man, or the time is extremely hot or extremely cold.
Then he should restrict his diet to cold vegetables and the meat of birds and kids, and he should avoid drinks and strong meats and overfilling with food, and every food that fills the veins with blood, until the swelling is safe and the flow of material to the place is not expected.
Then let the patient return to his first regimen to which he is accustomed.  When the fractured bone begins to knit, the patient should be nourished with foods that provide abundant, thick, strong nourishment, which possesses viscosity, such as porridges, rice, heads, necks, and cow tripe. And eggs and soft fish and thick drinks and the like, for by this regimen the consolidation of the fracture will be quicker and better. And know that fractured bones, if they are in strong men and old men, cannot ever unite and join together in their first nature.
Because of the dryness of their bones and their hardness. And it may unite and join what was of bones in the utmost softness, like the bones of small children. But nature produces on the fractured bone from all its sides something resembling glue, thick, which adheres to it and tightens it until some of it adheres to the other.
And it binds some of it to the other until it comes to the utmost strength and firmness as it was at first, until nothing hinders him from his actions.
For this reason it is necessary to give the patient foods which possess solidity, viscosity, and thickness, as we have said. And know that fractures differ in their types according to the differences of the members, for a fracture of the tibia is different from a fracture of the skull, and a fracture of the chest is different from a fracture of the back.
And so all the other members are different from one another. And we shall come to the mention of each type of fracture, explained in its chapter, detailed from the others. And the type of fracture of the bone may also differ in itself.
For it may be its fracture a splintering without fragments occurring in it, and it may be its fracture along the length of the bone, and its fracture may have fragments and excrescences, separated and not separated. And the fracture may be with a wound and a perforation in the skin, and the fracture may be a slight crack.
And for each type there is a special method in its setting, as will be mentioned in detail in its place. And of what makes known the fracture of the bone is its crookedness, swelling, and its appearance to the touch, and its creaking when you probe it with your hand.
Then when there is not in the place an apparent crookedness, nor creaking, nor do you feel upon touching the bone a disturbance, nor does the patient feel much pain, then there is not a fracture, but it is possible that it is a sprain, or a slight fracture, or a slight crack.  Therefore, it is not necessary to move it by stretching and probing at all.
Rather, apply to it of the medicines whose mention will come after a while, what is suitable for the place, then bind it gently. And know that if the bone is fractured and broken into two without fragments occurring in it, then each part has only separated from its fellow.
Then it is necessary for you to hasten at once to straighten and align it before a hot swelling occurs to it.  If a hot swelling occurs to it, then leave it for days until the hot swelling subsides, then align it in whatever way you are able to do so gently and skillfully.
And know that its setting and alignment is easier than a bone in which fragments have occurred. Then it is bound as will be mentioned. If the bone has fragments in it, then it is necessary to stretch the broken limb from both sides, whether hand or foot.
Either with your hands if the limb is small, or with two ropes, or with a rope and the hand. And let your placing of the limb be on a level surface in its natural shape, until when the parts of the broken bone are extended, then return those fragments to their places in whatever way you are able to do so skillfully and gently.
And strive with all your effort that you do not cause the patient pain or suffering by your actions, and strive with all your effort to unite one of the bones with its fellow in the best manner.  And it is necessary at that time to touch and feel them with your hand; and if you see there something contrary, correct and align it to the best of your ability.
And beware of strong stretching and forceful probing, as many ignorant people do; and they often cause by their actions a hot swelling or inflammation in the limb, as I have witnessed repeatedly from their actions.
Then, after the alignment, perfection, and binding, keep that limb still and quiet, and warn the patient not to move it while awake or asleep, and during his turning and restlessness, and during his defecation and all his movements, to the best of his ability, and that he should strive to keep the limb in a position where pain is avoided.
And that is because, whenever he feels pain or suffering in the position of the limb, he should move it to another position where he does not feel pain, and he should strive to make that position even and straight.
Lest crookedness occur in the limb if it is set, and as for the manner of binding the broken limb, it is as I describe to you. Know that broken limbs differ in their smallness and largeness and their shapes; and those that are small, such as the arm, finger, forearm, and the like.
Then it is necessary that the bandages of the cloth be soft and gentle, and those that are thick, such as the thigh, back, and chest, then it is necessary that the bandages be wide and firm, for the wide bandage is necessary for the large limb, and it tightens it from every side with equal tightness, so that no defect intervenes.
Then, after you have finished the alignment, you begin to apply the appropriate plaster. In a soft manner on the place of the fracture, then you begin to wrap the bandage on the place of the fracture itself, three or four turns, according to what the limb requires, and you tighten your hand a little with the bandage, then you take it to the upper side of the place of the fracture.
With less tightening than your tightening of the broken place, then you spread out the wrapping from the place of the fracture a little, and loosen the tightening little by little until you take from the correct place something suitable, then you take another bandage and wrap it also on the broken place.
turns, then you take the bandage to the lower side of the fracture, and let your action in tightening and loosening the bandage be as we mentioned in the first upper bandage, then you place between the bandages from the soft lint or cloths what evens out the crookedness of the fracture.
If there is crookedness, otherwise do not put anything in it, then you wrap another bandage around it, then you align on these bandages the firm splints at once if there is no swelling or hot inflammation in the limb.
If there is swelling or hot inflammation, then apply what calms that inflammation and removes the swelling, and leave it for days, then tighten the splints on it at that time, and let the splints be from wide, carved, skillfully prepared halves of reeds, or let the splints be from sieve wood.
which are made from pine or palm leaves or  reed or  boxwood and similar things which are available, and let the width of each splint be in this form and this shape exactly.
Except that the splint which is placed on the fracture itself should be a little thicker and wider than the other splints, and as for the length of the splint, it is made according to what suits the broken limb in its size and smallness.  Image of the splint:
Then you tighten the splints with another bandage according to your first tightening exactly, then you tie from above with strong threads according to what we mentioned of the tightening, which is that your tightening on the place of the fracture should be more. And the farther it is from the fracture, the less the tightening.
And the threads should be moderate in thickness and thinness, and let them be of wet linen especially, because if the threads are thick, as I have seen done by the ignorant, who make their threads from twisted linen strips, this is a great mistake.
Because the tightening with them becomes excessive, and thin threads are also unsuitable because you do not achieve with them the tightening you want, and there should not be less than a finger between the splint and the splint.
If the patient is harmed by the edges of the splints after tightening in the healthy places, then place under them soft tow or fluffy wool so that nothing harms him from that. As for if the fracture is with a wound and a rupture in the skin occurs, we will mention it separately.
Know that not every broken limb should be tightened with splints from the first day, and that if the limb is large, then the splints should not be placed on it except after five or seven days or more, according to your assurance of the absence of hot swelling.
And this is a description of the bandages with which the ancients used to bind fractures, dislocations, and sprains.  A description of a common, concise bandage that binds fractures and is suitable for most temperaments, especially children and women, because it is something that is not overcome by heat or cold.
And it is that you take from the dust of the mill, which is the core of the flour that adheres to the walls of the mill during the movement of the millstone, then knead it as it is without sifting it, with egg white, and make its kneading neither thick nor thin, then apply it.
A description of another bandage that binds fractures, dislocations, and sprains: Take of mastic, leadwort, acacia, orris root, gum arabic, and sugar, ten drachms of each; of myrrh and aloes, five drachms of each; of acacia, twenty drachms; and of Armenian or Roman clay, twenty drachms. Pound all together and mix with acacia water or with egg white if the patient's temperament is hot, then use this bandage; for it is of good composition, quickly binds broken bones, and is suitable for most people because of its moderation.
A description of another bandage that is also useful for fractures and sprains: Take gum arabic, mastic, and white leadwort, ten drachms of each; myrrh and aloes, five drachms of each; acacia, six drachms; Armenian clay, twenty drachms. Pound all together finely, sift, and knead with water or egg white and use.
A description of a bandage for joints and bones that have shifted from their positions, and which alleviates the pain arising from them, and from bone fractures and breaks: Take carded wool, dip it in vinegar and cooked oil, and place it on the affected area. This bandage has no binding strength.
But it is excellent in relieving hot swelling and especially in relieving pain. A description of another bandage that binds broken bones: Take the leaves of the black mulberry and the leaves of wild poppy, pound them together, and apply them moist. A description of another brief bandage used when a bone fracture is being set.
And you want to resolve the remainder of the swelling, take of the root of leadwort, chamomile, violet flowers, and crushed lentils, one part of each. Pound everything together and knead it with white of egg if the member is not hot; but if it is hot, knead it with coriander water or with water and apply it.
A description of another bandage stronger in resolution than the first, used when a hard swelling occurs when a bone is being set: Take of the root of leadwort, flaxseed, fenugreek, rosemary, germander, violet flowers, and chamomile, one part of each.
Pound everything together and knead it with vinegar water or with fresh water or with white of egg, all according to the heat of the member and the state of its inflammation. As for Hippocrates, he did not mention in his book that it should be placed on the broken member when it is being set.
Except for the cerate made from wax and oil only, and he described it as being moderate between thickness and thinness. As for Galen, he thought that things which contain dryness along with some heat, such as myrrh, aloes, frankincense, and what we have mentioned, should be placed on the broken member when it is being set.
A description of a bandage which benefits weakness and pain: Take of comfrey, chickpea flour, human hair clippings or bird feathers, leadwort, and salt, equal parts. Pound, sift, knead, and bandage with it. As for the amount which the bandage should remain…
Then loosen it; this is to look: if no pain, itching, or movement of the broken bone from its place occurs in the affected part, do not loosen it for many days.  If severe itching or distressing pain or swelling occurs in the place…
then hasten to loosen it at once and do not delay that at all, and remove the bandage from it. Then take a soft rag or a wet sea sponge, dip it in lukewarm water, and wash the place with it until the itching and pain subside, then leave the member to rest for an hour.
Then apply wool, moistened and dipped in vinegar and oil or rose oil, and bandage it for a night, until you are safe from hot swelling, and the swelling of the member subsides and its pain goes away. Then return it to gentle tightening and a light bandage, and do not tighten it as in the first instance.
And treat it gently until it heals. If you see that the swelling, redness, pain, and puffiness, and all the symptoms have completely gone, and you need a bandage and tightening, then prepare it as you did at first, equally. If nothing of what we have mentioned occurs in the member…
then do not loosen it except after three, four, five, or seven days, and it may be left for twenty days; all this depends on what appears to you of the state of the member, as we said, until the fracture is set and the flesh approaches consolidation around it.
Then also increase the tightening more than your first tightening, and also increase the thickening of the patient's food to what was previously mentioned. If you see that the place of the fracture has dried and become thinner than it should be, then know that food is prevented from reaching it.
Then bathe it with lukewarm water each time you loosen it, and let that be every three days, and loosen the tightening a little. For by this action, food flows to the member and it heals quickly. As for what ignorant bone-setters do, of breaking the member again…
if it is not first set properly, and is set crookedly, that is an error of their action and a great deception. And if it were correct, the ancients would have mentioned it in their books and acted upon it, and I have not seen any trace of it from any of them at all. and the correct thing is not to do it.
Chapter Two.
Concerning fractures occurring in the head.
The types of fractures occurring in the head are numerous, their forms varied, and their causes diverse.  Some fractures are caused by a sword blow, and this may either completely sever the bone until it reaches the membrane beneath the bone. Just as an axe does to wood.
Therefore, this type of fracture is called an axe-like fracture.  Or else, the sword may cut some of the bone, severing only its surface, and the cut not penetrating to its end; this type of fracture is called a complete avulsion. The wound in these two fractures may be either large or small.
And some fractures are comminuted or contused; their cause being a blow with a stone, or a fall onto a stone, or something similar. This fracture may either penetrate and nearly reach the membrane beneath the bone, or else be located on the surface of the bone.
And the wound in these two fractures is also either large or small.  And some fractures are hidden in the bone, as thin as a hair, being a slight fissure.
Therefore, this type of fracture is called a hair-like fracture. And there is a fracture which results from a fall or a blow from a stone or the like, which drives a section of the bone inwards, and makes a concavity in that place, as happens to a copper pot when struck, a part of it being driven inwards.
This occurs most frequently in the soft bones of the head, such as the heads of children.  All these types of fracture may have loose or impacted fragments. We shall describe the treatment of all of them in their proper place, and we shall recognize all these types of fracture by examining them.
And examining them with probes, and removing the corrupted flesh from them. As for the hair-like type, it is recognized by exposing the bone, and wiping it and smearing it with ink; then the fracture will appear black. As for the treatment of fracture, first look at the symptoms of the patient.
If you see in his symptoms that which clearly indicates danger, such as vomiting bile, convulsions, loss of consciousness, loss of voice, fainting, high fever, sinking of the eyes and redness, and similar symptoms, then do not approach the patient nor treat him, for death is inevitable in most cases with these symptoms.
But if you see symptoms that do not alarm you and you hope for his recovery, then begin his treatment.  And if the wounded man comes to you at the very beginning of his injury and it is in the winter.
Then you should strive to remove the bone before the fourteenth day in any case. And if it is in the summer, then you should hasten to remove the bone before the seventh day, before the membrane under the bone is corrupted, and those symptoms which we described appear.
If the fracture of the bone has reached the membrane covering the brain, and there is shattering and bruising, then you should cut away the shattered and bruised part as I describe to you. That is, shave the head of the wounded patient.
And uncover the bone in whatever way is possible for you, and according to the shape of the wound and what is easiest for the patient.  If, upon uncovering the bone, you find bleeding or a hot swelling, then treat that as is appropriate.
That is, pack the area with cloths soaked in a syrup and rose oil, and dress the wound until the swelling subsides and the bleeding stops. Then begin to scrape away and remove the bone; this can be done in one of two ways.
The first method is to cut the bone with a fine, narrow-bladed saw.  And this is its image:
Then use another saw, slightly wider than the first. And this is its image:
Then also use another saw, wider still than the second.  It is necessary that you have several saws of different sizes, some wider than others, and some shorter than others, and that they be extremely sharp. Let them be made of Indian steel or good quality iron.
And use gentle strokes with the saw, lest you shake the head and injure it. If the bone is strong and hard, it is necessary that you bore holes around it before using the saws, with the drills called non-immersive drills, or rather, they are called non-immersive drills.
Because they do not go beyond the edge of the cranial bone to what is beyond it, because the drill has a round edge below its sharp head, similar to a ring or small circle, preventing it from penetrating and going beyond the thickness of the bone.
And you should have many of these drills, each suitable for the thickness of that bone, so that you have for every skull a drill whose sharp point is appropriate in length and shortness to the thickness of that skull. And this is an image of three types. of the drills: large, medium, and small.
As for the method of drilling around the fractured bone, it is that you place the drill on the bone and rotate it with your fingers until you know that the bone has been penetrated, then you move the drill to another place, and you make the distance between each hole about the thickness of an awl or similar.
Then you cut between each two holes with the cutters, and you do this with the utmost gentleness as we said, until you remove the bone, either with your hand or with something else from some of the instruments that you have prepared for that.
such as forceps and fine hooks. And you should be very careful that the drill or cutter does not touch anything of the peritoneum. If the bone is removed and is clear of the peritoneum, if it was adhering to it, and you have taken it out, then it should be cleaned.
And you smooth the roughness of what remains of the bone with another instrument similar to the cutter, except that it should be thinner and finer than the other cutters. If any small bones or fragments remain, then take them gently with the instruments you have.
Then you treat the wound afterwards with cauterization and ointments which will be mentioned. As for the other method of the procedure, it is a very easy method, far from danger; Galen mentioned it and praised it greatly, and this is what he said. You should first begin by exposing the part of the bone where the fracture is most severe and prominent, until, when you have exposed that part, you place the end of this lenticular cutter under it, and this is its image:
The lenticular part of it is smooth, so that it does not cut anything, and the sharp part of it is on its sides going lengthwise, as you see, so that the lenticular part rests against the peritoneum and the face of the sharp cutter on the bone, then you strike the cutter from one side.
with a small hammer until you cut all the bone gently as it turns, and you are safe from the membrane, and nothing frightening happens to it at all, even if the surgeon were the most ignorant and cowardly of people, yes, even if he were sleepy.
If anything of the membrane remains attached to the bone in some parts of the bone, then scrape it off with the end of the lenticular cutter itself and detach it gently, for it will detach without harm or fear.
But if the fracture of the bone did not penetrate to the membrane, and what was broken of the bone was its surface, and roughness and small fragments remained in it, then it is necessary to remove that roughness and extract those fragments with fine forceps, of which various sizes have been made, so that you can use in each place the most suitable and appropriate of them, according to what the work leads you to.
and the broken bone itself and its shape, and you should use first in your scraping of the bone the widest of those forceps, then use after it a finer one, and continue to do that successively until you come to use the finest and thinnest of them all.
As for the other small, hair-like fissures and slight fractures, it is necessary to use for each one a treatment according to what leads to its improvement, which is something not hidden from anyone who has the least skill in this craft and has understood what we have written and explained in the large fractures.
If the membrane remains exposed when you extract the bone, then you should take a linen cloth the size of the wound and dip it in rose oil and place it on the mouth of the wound, then take another folded or triangular cloth. and dip it in a syrup and rose oil and place it on the first cloth, and do this as gently as you can, lest you weigh down the peritoneum, then use a wide bandage on top and do not tighten it except to the extent that it only holds the wound.
And leave it with this treatment for a day or two until you are safe from the hot swelling, then untie it and use afterwards the medicines which have the virtue of drying, such as the roots of iris, and crushed birthwort, and crushed spikenard and zedoary and the like.  And you should make from these medicines powders.
And sprinkle them on the wound as they are dry. And in general, use in that a medicine which cleanses and does not burn, and strive with all your effort during your treatment of the wound that it be clean, that there be no excess of oil, nor dirt, and do not allow pus to accumulate in it at all.
Because if pus collects on the membrane of the brain it spoils and corrupts it, and from that a great calamity befalls the patient, and it may occur in the peritoneum of the head when the bone is exposed, especially if one neglects its treatment.
Blackness on its surface. If the patient shows the symptoms which we have mentioned, then know that he is inevitably doomed. And if the blackness occurred only from a medicine which was placed on it, and it was in the power of that medicine to cause that blackness.
Then you should take one part of honey and three parts of rose oil, and mix them well, and smear them on a cloth, then place it on the peritoneum, then treat it with the kinds of treatment which are necessary until it heals.
Chapter Three.
On the setting of a broken nose.
Know that there is no fracture of the nose except its upper two parts, both of them, or one of them, because they are bones, for the lower part of it is cartilaginous and does not fracture, but rather there occurs to it contusion, crookedness, and flattening.
If one of its parts is fractured, then it is necessary to insert the little finger into the nostril and to set that fracture from the inside with your index finger and thumb from the outside, until you return the nose to its natural shape, and let that be done by you gently, and be careful that your action does not cause the patient pain.
If the fracture is at the top of the nose and the finger does not reach it, then it should be set with the end of a probe of moderate thickness. If the fracture is on both sides, do likewise, and let him attend to its setting on the first day of the fracture.
If possible; otherwise, after the seventh or tenth day, when the hot swelling subsides, then insert into the nostril a tent of linen rag if the fracture is on one side, or insert two tents if the fracture is on both sides.
Let the tents be of a thickness such that they fill the nostril.  Some of the early bone-setters mentioned that the tents should be moistened with fat and changed every day, but I do not think that is so; rather, the tents should be moistened with egg white mixed with mill dust.
Then leave the tents until the bone sets and the cartilage hardens.  Goose quills, after having been wrapped with soft rags, may be inserted into the nose at the place of the tents; this will make the retention of the fractured nose firmer and will prevent the patient from being unable to breathe.
This is not necessary; if you wish, do it; if you wish, make tents. If hot swelling should occur in the nose during your work, apply a compress to the nose with  kypros or cotton soaked in vinegar and rose oil or some diachylon ointment.
If no hot swelling occurs, then you should dress it externally with fine semolina and powdered myrrh kneaded with egg white, then apply a soft pad, and do not bind the nose at all if the nasal bones are fractured only slightly.
Or if they are shattered, you should incise over them and remove them with the appropriate instrument, then suture the incision and treat it with appropriate ointments which heal and cicatrize. If a wound occurs inside the nose, you should treat it with tents and use lead tubes. until it heals.
Chapter Four.
On the setting of the lower jaw if it is fractured.
If the lower jaw is fractured and the fracture is not accompanied by a wound, then if the fracture is only from the outside and is not fractured in two parts and is not depressed inwards, then its identification is easy.
Then it is necessary, if the fracture is in the right side, that you insert the index finger of the left hand into the mouth of the patient, and similarly if the fracture is in the left side, then insert the index finger of the right hand and gently raise the prominence of the fracture from the inside to the outside.
And with your other hand from outside the bone, you control it to straighten it. If the fracture of the jaw has been broken into two, then it is necessary to use traction from both sides in a straight line until you are able to straighten it. If it has happened in the teeth, loosen them.
Or separate them, then tie what you hope of them to remain with a gold, silver, or silk thread. Then place a splint on the fractured jaw, then place a folded cloth over it, and place over the cloth a tight large splint or a piece of leather the length of the jaw. Then tie it from above according to what suits you to tie it and agrees with its binding so that it does not become undone, and order the patient to rest and be still, and make his food soft drinks. If you think that something of the shape has changed in any way, then hasten to untie it on the third day.
Then tie it from above according to what suits you to tie it and agrees with its binding so that it does not become undone, and order the patient to rest and be still, and make his food soft drinks. If you think that something of the shape has changed in any way, then hasten to untie it on the third day. Then you repair what you have bandaged with mill dust mixed with egg white or with semolina flour after removing the splint from it, and place a soft poultice on the bandage. As long as that bandage adheres to it and the condition of the bone does not change, leave it.
Do not untie it until it heals and the fracture solidifies. Often this fracture solidifies in three weeks. If a hot swelling occurs during that time, use what we have repeatedly mentioned to soothe it until that swelling goes away.
And as for if the fracture is with a wound, look; if a splinter or splinters have separated from the bone, be gentle in extracting those splinters with whatever instrument suits you for their extraction. If the mouth of the wound is narrow, widen it with the scalpel to the extent of your need.
Then, when you have extracted those splinters and none remain, stitch the wound if it is wide; otherwise, apply one of the ointments suitable for that. And stitch the wound until it heals.
Chapter Five.
On the treatment of the clavicle if it is fractured.
The clavicle is most often fractured in front, at the end of the shoulder, and its fracture is one of three types: either it is fractured and broken into two without splinters, which is easiest to set;
or splinters occur in the fracture, which is more difficult to set; or the fracture is accompanied by a wound.  The procedure, if the fracture is without a wound, is that you prepare two assistants, one to hold the arm next to the fractured clavicle, and the other to extend the neck towards the other side.
Then you set the fracture with your fingers until its shape is as it should be, and there is no protrusion or irregularity. If you need more extension, you should place under the patient's armpit a ball of rags or wool.
And its bone will be to your need, and you extend and raise the clavicle and press the ball with your hand until the fracture is set as it should be. If you cannot pull the end of the clavicle outwards because it has gone inwards, then the patient should lie on his back.
And a moderately sized pillow is placed under his shoulder, and the assistant presses his shoulder downwards until the clavicle bone which is deep rises upwards. Then you set the fracture and align it with your fingers.
If you feel that a splinter of the clavicle has broken and is moving, you should incise over it and remove that splinter gently. If the splinter is lodged in the bone, try to cut it with one of the cutting instruments prepared for that purpose. After you place under the clavicle the instrument which supports the peritoneum, which is an instrument of wood or iron, and this is its image:
It resembles a spoon without a curve; its width is according to the size of the bone, whether large or small; and as for its length, it is also according to what allows you to work. And let it have two ends, as you see; one end wider and the other narrower.
If the wound opening which you incised when removing the bone splinter is wide and you are safe from hot inflammation, then join the edges of the wound by suturing.  If the opening is small or you fear hot inflammation, then cauterize the wound with a cautery and styptics, according to the extent of the incision.
If hot inflammation appears, moisten the cautery in rose oil and vinegar or wine and apply it. As for setting the bone if it is without a wound or incision, it is to apply to the bone a plaster made from mill dust with egg white. And you place the soft splint on it, then place the ball under his armpit if he needs that. Then take a bandage that is very long, and its width is a cubit or so. Then apply a folded compress over the splint and plaster, then take a splint from a thin board. Let its width be three fingers and its length likewise. Then wrap it in a cloth, then wrap that cloth together with the splint in the part of the bandage that lies on the place of the fracture, then tighten the bandage on the fracture as you wrap it. And pass it over his neck and under his sound armpit and under his injured armpit, and wrap it repeatedly on each side, and as you see that the tightening controls the fracture securely, which is not hidden from you.
And the aim of all this is that the splint does not move from the broken bone. Therefore, you should check on the patient every day; whenever the bandage loosens and you see that the splint has moved, correct that and tighten the bandage. Then have the patient sleep on his back, and place a small pillow under his armpit when he sleeps at night.
So that his arm may be raised from his side, and the clavicle fracture will be raised with the raising of the shoulder; or tie his arm to his neck. And do not untie the bandage unless something happens at the site, such as itching or swelling, until twelve days.
Then renew the dressing if you see a reason for it. And return to the tightening, and leave it until the clavicle fracture heals and consolidates, and it strengthens and becomes more solid in twenty-eight days. And it may be in some people in less than that.
Chapter Six.
Concerning the setting of a fracture of the humerus.  The humerus rarely fractures in its wide part; rather, its ends fracture.  When a part of it is fractured or it is fractured in its middle, this is known by touch.  Then, according to what the shape of the fracture is, treat it accordingly.
Straighten it and return it to its natural shape in every way you can, then apply to the area mill dust with egg white and soft lint. Place on top of that a pad of folded cloth, then apply a wide splint of wood.
Thin enough to fit the whole shoulder or slightly wider. If there is a lump under the splint at any point on the shoulder, smooth out that lump with soft lint until the splint lies flat, then bind it from above with a long bandage.
Bind it tightly and ensure the splint does not move from its place. Check the bandage every day; whenever the bandage loosens, tighten it and straighten the splint if it has moved. Let the patient lie on his healthy side. The shoulder heals in twenty [days].
days or twenty-five days. When this time has been completed, remove the bandage safely, for it is among the bones which are not feared for shattering or displacement. If a fragment of bone protrudes and is pressing against the skin, incise it and remove it. And do what was mentioned in the fracture of the clavicle to soothe the hot swelling if anything of that occurs.
Chapter Seven.
On the setting of a fracture of the chest.
The chest may be fractured in its middle, and this rarely occurs; but its extremities are more frequently fractured and shattered. Among its symptoms, if its middle is fractured, is that it inclines downwards, and there occurs severe pain, difficulty in breathing, and coughing.
And perhaps blood is expelled and the depression in the fractured bone is apparent and not hidden from touch.  Its treatment is that the patient lies on his back, and a pillow is placed between his shoulders, then his shoulders are compressed, and the ribs are brought together with the hands from both sides, and gentleness is used in straightening it in every way that is possible.
And continue until the shape of the bone is restored as it should be; then apply a bandage and a splint, and place over it a splint made of a thin board of willow or elm or the like, that is light, after wrapping it in a cloth. Then gently bind it to the fractured bone lest it shift, and pass the bandage around to the back several times, and tighten it firmly; then examine the bandage at all times, and whenever it loosens, tighten it.
And if necessity dictates its removal because of an abscess that appears in the area, or pain, or swelling, then proceed to remove it, and take off the bandage, and treat whatever has occurred by its appropriate treatment, then reapply the bandage if you see fit to do so. And face it and keep it tight until it heals.
Chapter Eight.
Concerning the setting of ribs when they are fractured: Know that fractures of the ribs occur in the thickest parts which are next to the back, and their ends in front are subject to contusion because they are cartilaginous; and the knowledge of this is not hidden from the sense upon examination with the fingers.
And its setting is that you straighten the fracture with the fingers in the accessible way until the shape is made even as it should be, then bandage it, and bind the fractured bone with a splint if it needs that.  If the fracture of the ribs is inclined inwards, then intense pain occurs to the patient.
And it is punctured like the puncture which occurs to one who has a wound of the lung, because the bone punctures the diaphragm, and difficulty of breathing and coughing and the ejection of much blood also occur to him; and this is difficult to treat, and the ancients devised many stratagems for it.
And some of them said that it is necessary to make the patient's food that which produces flatulence and wind, so that the abdomen may swell and expand and the fracture may be driven outwards. And we dislike this, lest it be a confirmation of the occurrence of hot inflammation if it has not occurred; and if it has occurred, then it increases it and confirms it.
And some of them said a cupping glass should be placed on the place, then sucked strongly; and this is more like the correct method, except that it is feared that the cupping glass will draw impurities to the place on account of its weakness. And some of them said that it is necessary to cover the place with wool which has been dipped in hot oil.
And it becomes a pad between the ribs until it is full, so that the bandage is even when you wrap it around circularly. Then you treat the patient with the treatment of a wound, in food and medicine. If the patient is afflicted by a severe matter that he cannot bear, And the bone punctured the diaphragm a harmful puncture, and we feared for the patient; therefore it is necessary that we incise the place and uncover the broken rib, then place under it the instrument which protects the peritoneum, which has been described before, and cut the bone gently and take it out.
Then we bring together the edges of the wound if it is large by stitching, and treat it with ointments until it heals. If a hot inflammation occurs during this, then act quickly: wet pads in rose oil and place on the place, and treat the patient with what cools the inflammation from the inside also.
And he lies on the side on which sleep is easier for him until he recovers.
Chapter Nine.
On the reduction of the vertebrae of the back and neck.
As for the bones of the neck, if a fracture affects them—and this rarely happens, and contusion happens to them more often, and likewise to the vertebrae of the back also—if this happens to someone and you want to know whether he will recover or not, then look; and if you see that his hands have become relaxed, numb, and dead, and he is not able to move them, nor extend them, nor contract them, and if you pinch them or prick them with a needle, he does not feel it and does not find pain in them, then know that in most instances he will not recover; he is doomed.
But if he moves them and feels the pinching and pricking in them, then know that the marrow of the bone is safe and that the patient will recover with treatment. If the vertebrae of the back are similarly affected and you want to know whether he will recover or not,
look at his legs; and if you see that they have become relaxed and that what happened in the hands has happened in them, then if he lies on his back, wind and feces are passed involuntarily, and if he lies on his stomach, urine is passed involuntarily, and if he lies on his back and wants to urinate, he is unable to do so, then know that he is doomed; do not trouble yourself with his treatment. If none of this happens to him, the matter is less serious. The treatment of what has happened is that you aim to alleviate the hot swelling.
by placing on the injured vertebra rose oil alone, or with roasted egg yolks; apply this three times a day, until the hot swelling subsides. Then apply to the place one of the strengthening, drying poultices, and bind it tightly with a bandage, and order him to remain still and quiet.
And let him sleep only on the side where he feels no pain, until he recovers. If, at the time of the injury, a splinter or something has become embedded in the bone, from which he has not recovered, then it is necessary to incise the skin and remove that bone. Then bring together the edges of the wound, if it is large, with sutures, then treat it with healing ointments until it heals. If the last bone of the coccyx is broken—that is, the tip of the tailbone—then it is necessary to insert the thumb of the left hand into the rectum.
and set the broken bone with the other hand, as much as is possible and the setting allows, then apply a poultice and splint if necessary, then bind it.
If you feel a broken splinter in it, then incise it and remove it, and treat the wound with the previously mentioned treatment until it heals.
Chapter Ten.
On the setting of a fracture of the hip.
The hip bones rarely fracture; if they do fracture, it is only by their extremities being shattered and split lengthwise, and they incline inwards.  The patient experiences pain in the affected area, numbness, and tingling in the leg on the side of the fracture.
Its treatment is that you pass your hand over it until you ascertain the nature of the fracture. If the fracture is only in its extremities, then set that fracture according to what seems best to you for its reduction, until its natural shape is resembled.
If the fracture is lengthwise, or if it has inclined inwards, lay the patient on his stomach so that the setting of that fracture may be facilitated for you. When you have set it, apply a bandage, then place a splint of wood or leather upon it and bind it firmly.
Do not fear for him the displacement of the fracture or the loosening of the splint.  Fill the hollows of the loins with something to fill them, so that the binding may be even. Instruct the patient to lie on his back or his sound side. If hot inflammation should occur,
desist from setting and binding it until the hot inflammation subsides. Apply what will alleviate it, as previously described; then return to setting and binding it as is proper. If splinters or shattered fragments of bone are present, they should not be removed.
They should not be touched, but smoothed from the outside as we have said, and the binding should be left until healing occurs.
Chapter Eleven.
On the setting of a fracture of the humerus.
The humerus is that which is between the elbow and the shoulder joint. If it is fractured, it is set in one of two ways. One is to take a smooth, curved stick of medium thickness, in this manner:
And you tie two bandages to its ends, then it is hung from a high place, and the patient sits on a chair, then his broken arm is placed on the stick until his armpit is touching the middle of the curve of the stick, then something heavy is hung from above it.
Or a servant stretches it downwards, then the physician sets the fracture with his hands together until he sets the fracture as it should be.  The other method is that the patient lies on his back and his hand is hung from his neck with a bandage.
Then you order two servants, one to hold above the fracture with his hands and the other to hold below it, and each stretches to his side. And if you want the traction to be stronger, then tighten below the fracture with a bandage and above it with a bandage, and each of the servants stretches to his side.
If the fracture is near the shoulder joint, then the middle of the bandage should be under the armpit and the other under the fracture towards the elbow. Similarly, if the fracture is near the elbow, then the bandage should be in that place and on the elbow itself.
Then you set the fracture gently without violence, until the fracture is set as it should be and is well united. Then you bind it if no hot swelling appears; if a hot swelling appears, then leave binding it until the seventh day, and apply moistened wool soaked in vinegar and rose oil.
Until the swelling subsides, then bind it.  The method of binding is to apply the dressing to the fracture, then apply a bandage of new cloth over the dressing, then gather the arm against the upper arm itself and place the hand open on the shoulder.
And apply the cloth and binding to the upper arm and forearm so that the forearm acts as a splint, unless something prevents you from doing so, and nothing changes in the broken bone; if you fear that something will change, then use splints.
This is to place on the fracture itself a splint that is wider and stronger than the other splints, and let there be the width of a finger between each splint, and let the length of the splints be according to the fracture, with the addition of three fingers on each side.
Then bind the splints with the binding that I mentioned at the beginning of the chapter.
And that your binding on the site of the fracture should be tighter.
And the further from the fracture, the less the binding should be; if you see that the placement of the splints and the binding, as we said, are suitable at the time of your setting of the limb, then do so.
And if you fear hot swelling, leave off the binding and splints until the seventh day, as we said; then examine the bandage every three days, lest there occur at the site an irritation or swelling, or the nourishment be prevented from reaching the limb because of excessive tightness; and rectify all this as we have described.
But if you are confident that none of that will occur, do not loosen the bandage except after many days; and let the patient lie on his back with his hand on his stomach, and a moderately full cushion of wool be placed under the arm.
And examine at every time, night or day, lest the shape of the broken limb be disarranged or the bandage become loose; then rectify all this with your effort, and make the patient's diet in the order which we have presented, that the food should be light at first, until the bone is about to consolidate.
Then it is necessary to increase his food; for it is the nature of the arm and leg to consolidate in forty days; then it is necessary to loosen [the bandages], and he should use the bath and be treated with ointments which are suitable for this; if the fracture is extensive and comminuted.
Then do not loosen the bandage from him until fifty days or two months.
Chapter Twelve.
On the setting of a fracture of the arm.
The arm is composed of two bones, and they are called the ulna; one of them is small, and it is that which is next to the thumb, and the other is large, and it is situated below the small one from below.  Therefore, perhaps the larger ulna is broken alone, or the smaller one alone, and perhaps they are broken together.
When the smaller upper ulna is broken, then its setting is easy, and its healing is quicker. When the lower ulna is broken, then its fracture is bad, and its healing is difficult.  And the worst is if the two bones are broken together. If the bone which is broken is the smaller upper ulna,
it is necessary for the physician, when setting it, to make its extension easy and gently until he straightens it. If the large ulna is broken, then it is necessary to make its extension stronger. And if both ulnas are broken, then it is necessary to make the extension much stronger.
And it is necessary that the shape of the hand, when it is set and extended, is extended on a cushion, and the thumb of the hand is above, higher than all the fingers, and the little finger is lower than the rest of the fingers, and the patient sits squarely on his own.
And let the cushion be opposite him in height, lest the patient suffer difficulty.
Then a servant extends the arm from below, either with his hand or with a bandage, and another servant extends from above likewise. Then the physician straightens the bone until he returns it to the best shape he can. If there are splinters in the fracture of the bone, then they are removed.
Return each splinter to its place to the best of your ability. If a splinter appears detached and it pierces the skin, and there is no hope of setting it, then incise upon it and extract it in the manner we have previously mentioned. If the fracture is accompanied by a wound, then a separate chapter has been devoted to it.
Then take treatment for that from there. If a hot swelling appears at the beginning of your setting, then apply a cloth with  kyrati prepared with rose oil and white wax, and let it be moderate between thickness and thinness, and bind the cloth to it gently until the swelling subsides.
Then remove the kyrati and apply the prepared plaster of mill dust with egg white. Then apply the splints, and let the splint that is placed on the fracture itself be somewhat wider and stronger. And know that the number of splints for the arm is six in most cases.
Whether the fracture was in one forearm bone or in both forearm bones together, then make your binding on the site of the fracture stronger and tighter. And the further you go with the binding upwards or downwards, make the binding slightly looser, as previously mentioned at the beginning of the chapter.
And let the cloths that are wrapped around the fracture be soft and moist, not very hard. And let the thread with which it is bound be of special flax, moderate between thinness and thickness, as we have described. And examine the limb and the bandage after a few days.
If something happens that needs to be corrected, such as an itching that appears in the limb, then the limb should be washed with warm water until that itching subsides. And the limb should be left unbandaged for a night so that it may rest, then the binding should be resumed.
If the binding has become loose and the bone has shifted or something like that, then correct all of that to the best of your ability. And look also, if the nourishment is prevented from reaching the limb due to excessive tightness, then it should be loosened a little and left for a few days until nourishment flows to it, then tighten it.
If nothing of what we have mentioned happens to the patient, then it should not be undone except after twenty days or so. Then suspend the patient's hand to his neck, and let his arm be straight. And he should guard against strenuous, agitated movements, and let his sleep be on his back.
Know that this fracture of the arm heals in thirty days, or in thirty-two, and perhaps it heals in twenty-eight days; all that according to the conditions of the temperaments and the conditions of strength.
Chapter Thirteen.
On the setting of a fracture of the hand and fingers.
The metacarpus of the hand and the phalanges of the fingers rarely suffer fracture, but rather they frequently suffer contusion.  So when a fracture or contusion occurs to the hand...
The patient should sit cross-legged, and in front of him a chair evenly placed.
Then he places his hand upon it extended, then the assistant extends the broken bones and the physician sets them, until when they are well-set; then it is necessary to apply a bandage and a splint if there is no hot inflammation. Then a splint is applied above according to the place.
And it is inserted into a soft cloth.  If the fracture is towards the lower part, towards the palm of the hand, then make a kind of sphere from a cloth and tell the patient to grasp it with his broken hand, then it is tightened with a long cloth.
And let the splint be of leather, soft so that it conforms to the skin with the bending of the whole hand, and tighten it as necessary. If the fracture is outward, then it is necessary to place a splint above and another splint below in the hand so that the hand is open and upright.
Then the bandage is applied as the hand rotates and interlaces between the fingers with the ligature. If the fracture affects one of the phalanges of the fingers, if it is the thumb, then let it be set as necessary, then it is bandaged with the hand. And if you wish, make for it a small, upright splint to support the fracture.
And it does not move. If the fracture is in the other fingers, such as the middle, index, little, or ring finger, then let them be set and bandaged with the healthy finger next to it, or all are bandaged together which is better, or a small, upright splint is placed on them.
As we said in the case of the thumb, and examine during your setting and afterwards for hot swelling, and counter it as necessary whenever anything of that occurs, as has been repeatedly described.
Chapter Fourteen.
On the setting of a fracture of the thigh.
The thigh bone frequently breaks and is apparent to the touch because it moves forward and backward, and its setting is done by tightening a bandage above the fracture and another bandage below the fracture, the patient lying on his stomach.
Then each bandage is extended to its side moderately; this if the fracture is in the middle of the bone. But if it is near the head of the thigh, then it is necessary to tighten a soft bandage, either of wool or similar.
At the head of the thigh towards the groin so that the extension is upwards, and the other bandage below the fracture.  Likewise, if the fracture is near the knee, let the bandage be near the knee so that the extension is downwards. Then the physician straightens the bone with both his hands until he restores it to its natural form.
And the bone unites well. Then it is necessary to maintain the bandage and tightening, if a hot inflammation does not occur in the limb. But if the inflammation occurs, leave it for some days until the hot inflammation subsides, then return to its treatment.
As for its tightening, it is necessary to wrap around the fracture a firm, wide bandage twice or three times, and what remains is left. Then the leg is twisted until the heel is at the origin of the buttock, and a long thread is inserted between the thigh and leg near the knee from below, and the ends of the thread are above on both sides.
Then you wrap around the leg and thigh what remains of the bandage. Then you place splints on the thigh at the place of the fracture itself, and you place one splint on the bone of the leg. Then stuff the space between the thigh and leg with soft cloths so that the tightening is even.
Then begin with strong tightening from the middle at the place of the fracture, three or four turns. And the further the bandage is from the place of the fracture, let your tightening be less, softer, and looser.
Then take the ends of the thread that you inserted between the thigh and leg, and tie with it what is next to it of the splints from above. Then pass the ends of the thread downwards until you reach the heel of the foot, and tighten with them also the ends of the splints from the other side.
Lest the bandage move from its place. Then leave the tightening on it as long as no pain, swelling, or puffiness, and the like, occurs in the limb. If any of that happens, hasten to untie it and correct whatever occurred of all that as we have repeatedly mentioned.
If there is a splinter in the bone that is sunken, then it is necessary to straighten that if you can. Otherwise, incise upon it and remove it, and treat the wound as previously mentioned until it heals.  And this fracture of the thigh may be bound without adding the leg to it with splints.
As we mentioned in the humerus and forearm, except that its treatment in this way does not result in lameness for the patient.  But if it is set alone without adding the leg to it, then it is necessary that its owner will always limp.
Know that the thigh heals in fifty days, or a little more or less; all that according to the differences in temperaments and other conditions.
Chapter Fifteen.
On the fracture of the kneecap.
Fracture of the kneecap rarely occurs, but it is frequently bruised. If a fracture does occur, it is either a crack or a shattering into pieces, and this happens with or without a wound.
You will ascertain all this by touch, and you will set it by aligning the separated fragments with your fingers until they are united and joined, as far as the alignment, gentleness, and skill allow. Then apply a dressing and, if necessary, a circular splint.
Then tighten the appropriate bandage over it, and treat all the conditions that we have described in other fractures, such as hot swelling and the like, counteracting each complication with the appropriate treatment until healing occurs.
Chapter Sixteen.
On the treatment of leg fractures.
The leg has two bones; one is thick and is called the tibia, and the other is thin and is called the fibula.  They are subject to the same types of fractures as the bones of the arm. Therefore, its treatment is the same as that of the arm, and the procedure is identical. If both bones are fractured, the leg is displaced in all directions; if the thinner bone is fractured, the leg is displaced forward; and if the thicker bone is fractured, especially in the lower part, the result is obvious.
Therefore, use traction and reduction, and apply splints accordingly, except that if the leg fracture is severe with many fragments, the traction should be less and gentler, and you should be careful in its treatment.
In treating the leg, there is something in addition to what is done for the arm:  When you have set the splints and completed all your work, take two small pieces of pine wood, the kind used in smoothing the floors laid between the cracks of planks, or use date-palm leaflets or something similar.
Choose pieces of moderate thickness, not thin ones, and let their length equal the length of the leg from the knee downwards. Then wrap each one with two layers of cloth lengthwise, and place one on one side of the leg and the other on the other side.
Let them extend from the knee to the lower part of the foot. Then bind the two small pieces of wood in three places: at both ends and in the middle. By this means, the leg is prevented from tilting to either side and is well supported.  A wooden gutter along the length of the leg may also be used.
It is placed in it to keep it from moving, and this is mostly necessary in fractures accompanied by wounds. Then examine the leg every day and take the greatest care to prevent swelling, inflammation, or anything else. If any of this occurs, treat it appropriately until it heals. A leg fracture heals in about thirty days, or so.
Chapter Seventeen.
On the fracture of the bones of the leg and toes.
As for the heel, it is never fractured; as for the bones of the leg, they may be fractured; and as for the toes, they are rarely fractured, but rather are more often bruised.
If a leg bone is fractured and you see that some of the bones are overlapping, then have the patient stand with their foot on the ground, as if walking.  Then, you place your foot on the elevated bone and press down on it to straighten it.
Until they return to their proper places. Then apply a bandage and splint from above, placing a small board with two flat ends under the sole of the foot.  Then bind the foot tightly after wrapping it with cloths and whatever else is needed.
If three or four days have passed, untie the bandage; you will find the bones straight, whether they were fractured or dislocated. The procedure is as you see. As for a fractured toe, set it and straighten it according to what I have described for you in the setting of the fingers of the hand.
Then make a splint for the fractured toe, the length of the toe and slightly wider. Then place the board I described under the foot and bind it tightly. If two, three, or more bones are fractured,
make a splint for each toe, of appropriate size, layered in soft cloth, and bind the board to the bottom of the foot. Let each end of the board rest outside the sole of the foot to secure it properly.
You should not forget to attend to all that we have mentioned to you in other fractures, the symptoms we have mentioned, and treat each symptom as it should be.
Chapter Eighteen.
On the fracture of the woman's pubis and the man's penis.
When a woman's vulva is fractured, seat her cross-legged, then gently lean her backward.  Let her be held from behind, then let the midwife pack her vulva with cotton until it is full and forms a ball within her vulva.
Then the woman is shaken and her hip is raised little by little; the cotton will come out until it is at the opening of the vulva like a ball, and the fractured bone will return to its place.  Then a dressing is placed on her back. When she wishes to urinate, the cotton is gently removed so that she may urinate.
And it is returned in the manner in which it was initially inserted, then she returns to her first dressing.  This is done for seven days or so, and it will heal. And if you wish, take a sheep's bladder, tie a reed tube to its mouth, and insert the whole bladder into her vulva.
Then blow forcefully into the tube until the bladder inflates inside the vulva; the fracture will be reduced. Then pack it with cotton and keep it as we described until it heals. As for when the pubic bone of a man or woman is fractured, the same treatment is used to set it.
And its treatment is as we described for the hip bone. The correct procedure for these unusual fractures, which rarely occur, especially for one who has some experience and understands this book well, will not be hidden from you, for the fracture itself will indicate the treatment in most instances.
Understand the correct way to set and bind it. As for a fracture of the penis, take a goose's windpipe, insert the penis into it, then apply a bandage of cloth, bind it, and leave it for three days or so until it heals.
Chapter Nineteen.
On setting bone fractures when accompanied by a wound.
Whoever suffers a fracture with a wound, especially if the bone is large, such as the femur or humerus or similar, should proceed immediately to bloodletting if the conditions for bloodletting, as we have previously explained, are favorable.
If the wound is bleeding, you should immediately stop it by applying powdered vitriol if nothing else is available, then set the fracture that same day and do not delay.
If no hot swelling occurs, then good.  If hot swelling occurs, delay setting it until the ninth day until the hot swelling subsides. Do not touch it at all on the third or fourth day, for it will be exposed to unfavorable symptoms.
If the fractured bone is protruding and exposed through the skin, you should try to reduce and align it gently with your hands with a slight pull. If you are unable to reduce and align it with your hands, reduce it with this instrument. It is an instrument made of iron, seven or eight finger-lengths in length. And its width is according to the wound.
Therefore, the physician should prepare three or four of them, according to what he needs for treatment of each type of fracture. Let them be round, and slightly thick so that they do not bend when pressure is applied during use.
And let the ends be sharp, with a curve at the end. The upper part should be thicker, and from the middle to the lower part much thinner.  This is its image:
It is called in Greek *peron*, meaning a small lever.  The sharp, curved end should be placed on the end of the protruding bone, and it should be pushed gently until the bone returns and is somewhat aligned. Then, align the ends of the fracture with each other.
If the broken end is thin and the instrument does not grasp it well, then the end of that bone should be cut until the instrument can grasp it. If you are not able to reset the bone in the manner described, then cut it with a similar cut to those we have mentioned.
Or saw it apart however you can. Then, remove any roughness and thin layers remaining on the bone. If, after resetting it, the patient experiences severe, persistent pain, then know that the bone has not returned to its natural position.
If you are able to return it to its natural position, then do so, for you will greatly benefit the patient. When you have completed the setting of the bone, dip a cloth in a black astringent drink, especially if it is summer, and do not apply any ointment or anything greasy to the wound.
lest putrefaction and corruption occur. Then, apply the splints after you have finished setting the bone, and leave the wound exposed by cutting a hole in the bandages with scissors, the size of the wound.
And be very careful not to bind the wound tightly with the fracture, for many ignorant physicians have done this, causing their patients either death, or gangrene, or tetanus. Let your binding be gentle and loose, unlike the binding of other fractures.
If the wound is bad, or if it is a large wound and you fear some of the bad symptoms we have described, and he feels disturbing pain in the area, then you should not apply splints, but make bandages from firm cloths in the place of the splints and bind it with them.
If after a day or two you see that pus is beginning to form in the wound, remove the cloth that you applied with the astringent drink, then use lint and ointments which we customarily use to treat wounds, such as the tetrapharmacon and the like, and you should loosen the bandage.
And examine the wound every evening and morning until it heals, and you should position the limb so that the pus flows downwards easily. If many days pass and the wound does not unite and the pus does not stop, then know that there are small bone fragments there.
Then you should probe the wound; whatever of those fragments is loose, remove and extract it; and whatever of them is not loose and is injuring the limb and causing pain, then strive to cut and extract it in every way you can.
If the wound develops inflammation, gangrene, or another type of corruption and putrefaction, then you should counter each symptom with its corresponding treatment, which we have previously described in its chapter.
And what you should pay attention to and keep in mind is that if a large bone is fractured and projects from the limb, such as the thigh bone, the humerus, and similar large bones, do not attempt to pull or extract it. For death often results from this; rather, leave it until it putrefies, for perhaps it will fall out by itself after twenty or thirty days.
Then treat the wound if you see a place for treatment; otherwise, leave it.
Chapter Twenty.
In the treatment of complications which occur after some fractures.
This complication often occurs after the healing of a fracture, especially those near the joints, and it disfigures the limb and may prevent the limb from its natural function.
Examine it; if the complication is fresh, use astringent medications such as aloes, frankincense, myrrh, gum tragacanth, acacia, and the like. Take some or all of these and mix them with an astringent syrup, egg white, or vinegar.
Apply it to the complication with a bandage and bind it tightly. Leave the bandage in place for many days, then remove it and reapply another until, God willing, the complication disappears, or fasten a tight lead plate upon it.
For lead has the property of removing all that is superfluous in the limbs. If the complication has hardened and become severe, and necessity dictates its removal, incise it from above and cut away the excess growth, or shave it off with some sharp instrument until it is gone, and then treat the wound until it heals.
Chapter Twenty-One.
In the treatment of a fracture if it has healed, and the limb remains thin and not as it was originally.
If a bone fracture has healed and the limb remains thin and weak, this is due to many causes. One of them is either from excessive loosening and binding of the bandages, or from excessive tightening of the bandages so that nourishment is prevented from reaching the limb, or from excessive and repeated rubbing, or from excessive movement at the wrong time, or from a deficiency of blood and weakness in the patient's body.
And the treatment of this is to nourish the patient and enrich his body so that the blood increases in it, and to use the bath and to bring him joy and happiness and the like; then to apply pitch to the limb so that the pitch draws much nourishment to it, or to repeatedly rub it with lukewarm water. until nourishment flows into it and it returns to its natural form.
Chapter Twenty-Two.
In the treatment of fractured bones if they are set crookedly and prevented from functioning properly.
If, after a limb has healed, a crookedness or a projection of the fractured bone or a complication appears, and because of that the appearance of the limb is spoiled. However, if the limb does not prevent its natural function, then one should not accept the opinion of those who claim that the limb should be broken from the head, as many ignorant physicians and bone-setters used to do in our country.
And this action is highly reprehensible, leading to great harm, the least of which is damage. But if the crookedness and complication are recent, then it should be treated with water in which emollient herbs have been cooked, such as mallow leaves and root, and rosemary, and the like.
And it is bandaged with emollient bandages such as well-made diachylon, or the sap of the mallow root is taken and beaten with chicken fat and sherbet oil and bandaged with it, or ripe figs are taken and pounded with pigeon droppings and similar medicines called anti-inflammatory.
And sometimes the complication resolves with constant gentle massage by hand, and the movement of the limb in every direction at all times is used. If the crookedness has become old and severe and hardened, and treatment with iron is necessary.
Then it should be incised above and the connection of the bone released, and the excess of the complication or bone cut with fine cuts, and gentleness should be used with effort and care, then the wound is treated as previously mentioned until it heals.
Chapter Twenty-Three.
A dislocation is the displacement of a joint from its place, hindering movement, disfiguring the limb, and causing the patient severe pain and suffering.  When a dislocation occurs, one should immediately attempt to reduce it.
One should not delay at all, for if delayed, the area will swell and make reduction of the dislocation difficult. Therefore, one should not delay, move, or stretch it while it is swollen, because this often causes the patient spasms and harmful pain.
But if this occurs, one should immediately bleed the patient, then wait until the swelling subsides somewhat, then bathe the limb in warm water and oil, and then gently reduce it, treating each limb as described in its proper place.
The chapters on dislocations are also arranged, as with fractures, from the top of the body to the bottom.
Chapter twenty-four.
On the treatment of dislocation of the lower jaw.
The jaws rarely become dislocated, and their dislocation occurs in one of two ways: either they are slightly displaced and relax a little, or they are completely dislocated so that they relax completely. towards the chest, so that the saliva of the patient flows and he cannot restrain it, nor can he close his jaw, and his tongue stumbles in speech. But if its dislocation is slight, it often returns of its own accord very easily.
But if the dislocation is complete, it should be reduced quickly and not delayed at all.  A servant should hold the patient's head, and the physician should insert the thumb of one hand into the base of the jaw inside the mouth, if the jaw is dislocated on one side.
or he should insert both thumbs if the jaw is dislocated on both sides, and the rest of his fingers from outside to align them, and he should order the patient to relax his jaw and release it to go to every side, while the physician aligns the jaw and pushes it until it returns to its place.
If its reduction is difficult, especially if both jaws are dislocated, then apply a warm water and oil compress until it is easy to reduce them, and do not delay their reduction at all, as we said. When they have returned and become aligned and the patient's mouth is closed and they are not relaxed, then apply compresses of rags with a plaster made of wax, oil, and rose water.
Then bind it gently with a loose bandage, and let the patient sleep on his back with his head raised between two pillows, so that he does not move it to the right or left, and let him not strain to chew anything, but let his food be soft gruel.
Until the pain subsides and the jaw is set, let him eat whatever he wishes, and let him use it gently and not force the opening of his mouth when eating, drinking, or yawning, until the jaw is set and healed.
If the reduction of the jaws is difficult, if they are dislocated at some time and do not return to their places, fevers and persistent headaches often result from this, and the patient's abdomen may become distended, and he may vomit pure bile. If you see this, know that it is damaged.
And many die from this within ten days.
Chapter Twenty-Five.
In the reduction of the clavicle and the tip of the shoulder.
As for the clavicle, it does not dislocate from the inner side because of its connection to the chest. It may dislocate outwards, and this is apparent to the touch. Its reduction is that the patient lies on his back and extends his arms.
Then press the place with your hand strongly, and it will return. Then apply a bandage and pads and tighten it. As for its end which is near the shoulder and connected to it, it does not dislocate except rarely. If it dislocates at some time, then it should be reduced and set as we have mentioned and as is possible for you.
Then apply to it a bandage and pads and tightening, and you should order the patient to observe rest and stillness until it heals. By this same treatment you reduce the tip of the shoulder if it also moves from its place.
Chapter Twenty-Six.
In the reduction of the shoulder joint.
Know that the shoulder dislocates in three ways: one is that it dislocates towards the armpit downwards; the second is that it dislocates towards the chest; and sometimes it dislocates upwards towards the shoulder, and this happens rarely.
It does not dislocate to the back because of the shoulder blade, nor does it dislocate to the front because of the nerve. Most often it dislocates and goes downwards towards the armpit, especially in those whose flesh is little, because it goes out quickly in them and enters quickly.
But as for those whose flesh is abundant, it is otherwise, I mean that it goes out with difficulty and enters with difficulty. And sometimes a blow or a fall happens to some people, and the shoulder swells with a hot swelling, so they think that it has dislocated.  It is necessary to examine this until you ascertain its truth.
Then you proceed in its treatment.  The dislocation is recognized if it is downwards towards the armpit; if you compare the dislocated shoulder with the sound shoulder, you will find a clear difference between them, and you will find the head of the humerus in it to be twisted; and under the armpit, on palpation, the head of the humerus is like an egg.
And the patient is not able to raise his hand to his ear, nor to move it in all movements.  Similarly, if it dislocates towards the chest or upwards, you will find this apparent to the touch, not hidden.
And this dislocation is easy to reduce if it is recent or if the patient is a child.  Its reduction is that a servant raises his hand upwards, then you place the thumbs of your hands under his armpit and raise the joint forcefully upwards to its place, and the servant raises his hand and extends it upwards.
Then he lowers it downwards, and it returns quickly. If it does not return by what we have mentioned, and the dislocation has been for many days, then the patient should bathe in hot water and use things that relax and soften, such as boiling the root of mallow, fenugreek and myrtle in water and using it.
Then the patient lies on his back, and you place under his armpit a ball of wool that is moderate between soft and hard; then the physician places his heel on the ball and holds the patient's hand with his hand and extends it downwards.
And he pushes the ball with his foot, and it returns to its place. And if you wish, reduce it in this way: you bring a taller man than the patient and station him on the side, and he puts his shoulder under the patient's armpit and raises his armpit upwards until the patient is suspended in the air. And another servant pulls the patient's hand downwards towards his stomach. If the patient is light, then something else should be hung on him to weigh him down, and the jaw will return immediately. And it may also be reduced in another way.
And that is to firmly place in the ground a long piece of wood, its head being round in shape like the pestle of a mortar, neither thick nor thin, then it is placed under the patient's armpit after placing a soft cloth on the head of the wood, and the patient standing along the length of the wood.
Then you extend his hand downwards from the other side, and also extend his body from the other side forcefully, and the joint will return to its place quickly. If its reduction is difficult with all that we have mentioned, then use this treatment: you take a piece of wood about two cubits long. And its width is the size of four fingers and its thickness the size of two fingers; it has a round head to facilitate its entry deep into the armpit in this manner:
Then you tie a soft cloth to the round head so that the wood does not hurt the patient; then it is placed under the armpit, and the whole hand and arm are extended along the wood downwards, and the wood is tied to the upper arm, forearm and hand.
Then the arm is placed on a horizontal beam, the hand is extended downwards, and the rest of the body is left hanging from the other side. Then the joint will enter immediately. If it enters in any way possible, then a moderately sized ball of wool should be placed under the armpit.
Then the prepared bandage, made from mill dust, frankincense, and egg white, is applied to the whole shoulder as it rotates from above. Then the ball under the armpit is tightly bound, and the bandage is rotated from above, and his hand is suspended to his neck.
He is left without moving his hand for seven days, and the patient's food should be light so that the limb may strengthen, for this is quicker for healing. Then, after seven or five days, it is untied and exercised; if it is firm and does not relax, then it is healed.
If the joint dislocates repeatedly due to dampness or some other cause, then cauterization with three cautery irons should be used as described in the chapter on cauterization. If all this has been done, and the bandage is removed after seven days and the joint is not stable…
…then the bandage and binding are repeated many times, but it does not stabilize, and it falls and relaxes, and you cannot raise it upwards; then know that the nerve in the head of the humerus has been severed, stretched, or relaxed. Then know that the joint will never be stable in its place.
As for a dislocation which is towards the chest and breast, and backwards, its reduction is by pushing and pulling with the hands until it returns.  All the binding and treatment are used until it heals. If, after healing, there is stiffness in the limb and slowness of movement…
…then the patient should use the bath repeatedly until that stiffness softens and returns to its original nature.
Chapter Twenty-Seven.
On the treatment of dislocation of the elbow.
The elbow joint is difficult to dislocate and also difficult to reduce. It is dislocated in all directions, especially forwards or backwards.  Its dislocation is not hidden from you because it is visible and palpable, whichever way it is dislocated.
And if you compare the dislocated elbow with the sound one, it will be clearly evident to you by the depression of the joint, and he will not be able to bend his arm or touch his shoulder with it. And you should act quickly and reduce the dislocation immediately, before a hot inflammation occurs.
For if a hot inflammation occurs, reduction is difficult, and it may not heal at all, especially if the dislocation is backwards, for this is the worst of all types of dislocation, and the most painful, and often death ensues.
And its reduction, if it is of a kind that can be reduced, is that an assistant extends his hand with both hands and his arm extended, and the physician's hands are above and below the elbow, and he pushes the joint with the thumbs of both his hands or with the base of his palms until it returns to its place.
But if the dislocation is forward, it may be reduced by bending the hand sharply until the base of the hand strikes the corresponding shoulder. If the dislocation does not reduce, use very strong traction, that is, let two assistants extend the arm.
And let two assistants also hold the patient so that he does not move during traction. Then the arm is rotated in every direction after wrapping a folded cloth or wide bandage around his hand. And when the physician touches the joint with his hands, let him anoint them with oil so that it helps in easily slipping the joint.
Then he pushes the joint strongly until it returns. After its return, it is necessary to apply a bandage containing astringents and drying agents with egg white, and it is tightened firmly, and the arm is suspended from the patient's neck and left for several days.
Then it is untied. If the joint is stable in its place, untie the bandage and leave it. But if you see that the joint is not firm, reapply the bandage and leave it for several days until it becomes firm, then untie it. If swelling occurs after the reduction of the joint and its untying,
and difficulty in movement occurs, use moist applications in the bath and gentle massage and manipulation until it softens, or place a poultice of fat mutton on the joint, then bandage it and leave it on for a day and night, then remove it and put him in the bath. When he sweats, massage the joint moderately.
Then reapply the poultice once, twice, and three times with a bath until it softens. And if you wish to apply a moist, light poultice of cow dung with fat and tighten it, do that several times, for it will soften and return to its former state.
Chapter Twenty-Eight.
In the treatment of the fractured wrist.
The wrist often becomes dislocated, and its reduction is easier than that of other joints, except that it is necessary to hasten its reduction at the time it is dislocated, before the area becomes inflamed or a hot swelling appears.
To reduce the dislocation, place the patient's wrist on a board, and have an assistant extend his hand.  The physician should place his hand on the prominence of the joint and push until it returns. However, it is necessary to observe whether the dislocation has shifted to the palm of the hand.
If the dislocation is prominent towards the back of the hand, let the patient place the palm of his hand on the board during extension and reduction. If the dislocation is prominent towards the back of the hand, let him place the back of his hand on the board so that the physician's hand falls on the prominence of the joint itself. If it returns immediately, well and good; otherwise, bind it with a bandage that soothes the swelling.
Leave it and do not manipulate it again, for it will not tolerate it, and you will not be able to reduce it after several days have passed, except that the joint will remain crooked and will not harm the patient in any way, unless the hand becomes weak and unable to grasp anything.
Then you will know that the nerve has been severed or crushed; there is no remedy for this except cauterization, which may or may not be effective. When the wrist has been reduced, apply the bandage we described, then tighten it and leave it for five days.
Then unbind it and exercise the hand. If its movement is difficult and there is any stiffness, soften it with warm water and massage repeatedly until it softens.
Chapter twenty-nine.
On the treatment of dislocated fingers.
Fingers may be dislocated in any direction. If a finger is dislocated towards the back or palm of the hand, extend the finger and push the dislocation with your thumb until it returns. Then bandage the tip of the finger and suspend it towards the direction in which it was dislocated.
Leave it for two days, then release it and extend it until it is straight that day. If it is nighttime, bandage it in the same way; keep releasing it during the day and exercising it with movement, and bandaging it at night. Do this for several days until it strengthens.
Do the same if it is dislocated towards the palm of the hand; bandage it towards that same direction and do as you did before until it heals.  Do likewise if it is dislocated in any other direction.
Chapter Thirty.
On the treatment of the dislocation of the vertebrae of the back.
If a vertebra of the back or neck is completely dislocated, or if many vertebrae are displaced from their positions, there is no treatment, for death swiftly overtakes the patient.
The sign of this is that the patient's excrement is passed involuntarily, and he cannot retain it; and often some of his limbs become relaxed, either his legs or his arms, or one of them. But if only one vertebra is displaced from its position, it often returns to its place.
And its displacement is in four directions. That which is displaced backwards is called a hump. As for its treatment, you should observe: if the hump has occurred from childhood, there is no treatment for it, and there is absolutely no cure for it. But if it has occurred from a fall or a blow or the like,
the ancients have mentioned it with various treatments in lengthy descriptions, most of which are of no benefit. I have abridged this, taking what is sufficient from the much they have presented, by approaching the meaning and explaining it, and I have depicted the instrument differently from what they have explained and described.
I say that the hump which occurs in the front of the chest cannot be helped, and there is no cure for it; the same applies to that which occurs to the sides. Only that which occurs in the back is treated, specifically with what I describe, which is that you extend the patient on his face.
on a level bench near a wall, and spread a damp mat underneath so that his chest is not harmed. Then you place a vertical piece of wood, planted in a hole in the ground at the end of the bench towards his head, and another piece of wood towards his feet at the other end of the bench.
And a servant holds the wood, and let it not be secured in the hole, and another servant holds the other in that manner. Then wrap around the chest of the patient and under his armpits with a soft, tight cloth, and extend the end of the cloth to the wood at his head and tie it there.
Then tighten with another cloth above his hips and above his knees and at his ankles. Then gather all the bandages and tie them to the other piece of wood at his feet. Then each servant pulls on his side of the wood with the bandage, and the two pieces of wood do not move from their planted positions.
except that they are not fixed, as we said. And the physician places his hands on the hump forcefully until it returns, or he places a board on it, then he leans on the board with his feet until it returns. If it does not return with this treatment, then take a board whose length is about three cubits.
And dig in the wall, which we said should be near the patient, a place into which the end of the board enters. Then place the middle of the board on the hump, and the physician places his feet on the other end and pulls strongly until he presses the hump.
And it returns to its place. And if you wish to make it with a screw that is twisted by hand, it is that you plant in the ground at the head of the patient at the end of the shop two pieces of wood whose length is a cubit, and at his feet at the end of the shop also two pieces of wood.
And let the distance between each piece of wood be a cubit. And a hole is made in each piece of wood through which the screw passes. And all the wood is firmly secured in the ground so that it does not move at all. And insert a round stick, which is the screw in which the bandage is twisted, into the holes of the two pieces of wood.
And at its end is a hole in which a stick a cubit long is secured by what is twisted. And in the other two pieces of wood, likewise. Then tighten the bandage that you tightened in the chest of the patient in the screw that is at his head, and the bandages that you tightened in his legs in the screw that is at his feet.
Then a servant stands at each screw, twisting his hand with the instrument with which he twists the screw, and the physician straightens the hump as we have explained. And this is an image of the screw, the shop, and the patient:
Then, after the vertebra returns and the place is straightened, it is necessary to apply a drying compress with egg white, then the pledget, then place on top of the compress a splint of a board whose width is three fingers or so, and its length is as much as it takes the place of the hump.
And on some of the sound vertebrae. Then it is bound with the appropriate bandage, and the patient uses light food until he recovers. If some protrusion remains in the place at the end of the healing, then it is necessary to use medicines that relax and soften, along with the use of the board which we described, for a long time.
A lead plate may be used for this. And a protrusion may appear at the end of the vertebrae of the back, and it may be thought to be a dislocation, and it is an extra bone that has protruded. Do not treat it with this treatment, for death may result.
Chapter Thirty-One.
In the treatment of the dislocated hip.
Know that the hip joint and the shoulder joint are only subject to dislocation, and they are not subject to what happens to the other joints, of slight displacement and depression. The hip joint is dislocated in four ways.
That is, it is dislocated inwards, outwards, forwards, and backwards. Most often it is dislocated inwards, and rarely forwards or backwards. The sign of its dislocation inwards is that if you compare the sound leg of the patient with the affected one, it will be longer.
And the knee will be more bent than the sound one, and the patient will not be able to bend his leg at the groin, and the place next to the groin will be swollen, evidently because the head of the femur has gone there.
And the sign of that which is dislocated outwards is that its symptoms are the opposite of these symptoms. And the sign of that which is dislocated forwards is that he extends his leg completely, but he cannot bend it without pain in the knee, and if he tries to walk, he cannot do so forwards.
And he retains his urine, and his groin is swollen, and when walking, his weight is on his heel. And the sign of that which is dislocated backwards is that he cannot extend the knee, nor can he bend it before bending the groin, and his leg is also shorter than the other.
And the groin is relaxed, and the head of the femur is clearly at the position of the loin. As for the reduction of the types of this dislocation, you should look; if the dislocation is old, having persisted with its sufferer and no attempt at reduction having been made, and it remains in its state, then there is absolutely no treatment for it.
Then you should not attempt it. But as for one whose dislocation is recent, whatever of the four types of dislocation it may be, hasten to twist the joint and stretch it inwards and outwards, and move it to the right and to the left, for perhaps...
it will return and will not need other treatment. If it does not return in this way, then you should prepare a strong and able assistant who will stretch his leg from below, either with his hands or with a bandage tied around his leg above the knee, and another assistant will stretch him from above.
by putting his hands under his armpits, then tightening a soft bandage around the root of the thigh, and another third assistant holding the end of the bandage, and the stretching will be either from the front, from the side of the groin to the clavicle, or from behind to the side of the back.
And their stretching will all be at once, until the patient is raised with his body from the ground and remains suspended. For this type of stretching is a common type for the four types. If the dislocation returns by what we have said, otherwise, each type necessarily needs what I mention of specific treatment.
As for its specific reduction, if the dislocation is inwards, the patient should lie on his sound side, then a bandage should be applied to the root of the thigh between the head of the thigh and the place under the groin.
Then the bandage is stretched upwards from the groin to the upper body towards the clavicle, then another strong and able assistant takes it with his arms and embraces the thick part of the affected thigh and stretches it outwards with a strong pull, for then it will return to its place.
And this type is easier than the other types of treatment by which this member is reduced.  If it is difficult for you and it does not respond to this type of treatment at all, then you should tie the patient's legs together with a strong, soft bandage at the heels and at the knees.
And the distance between each [bandage] and its neighbour will be the length of four fingers, and the affected leg will be extended more than the other by the length of two fingers. Then the patient will be suspended by the head from a wooden beam which is in the house, and his distance from the ground will be the length of two arms.
Then you order a strong boy to embrace the head of the thigh, and another boy will hold onto the patient, and the other boy embracing the thigh will push with force, then the joint will return to its place quickly. As for its specific reduction if the dislocation is outwards.
Then the patient should lie on the bench, as we described for the patient with kyphosis, and a bandage is tightened on his affected leg in particular and on his chest. Then two pieces of wood are placed, one at his feet and the other at his head, then an extra piece of wood is placed in the middle of the bench, very firmly secured.
A wet cloth has been wrapped around it so that it does not harm the patient; the wood is to be placed between his thighs so that he does not be pulled downwards when extended. Then each servant pulls towards his side, and the physician sets the hip with his hands; if it responds to reduction.
Otherwise, place the board on him and press it down as we mentioned in the case of kyphosis, except that the patient should lie on his sound side. And if the dislocation is forward, then the patient's leg should be extended once while he is in this same position on the bench.
The physician places the palm of his right hand on the affected hip, then presses it with the other hand, and with that, he extends the pressure downwards towards the knee. If the dislocation is backward, then the patient should not be extended downwards.
And it is raised from the ground, but rather it should be placed on something solid, just as it should also be if his hip is dislocated outwards, according to what we mentioned of his lying on the bench on his face, and the bandages tightened.
As we said before, and the pressure with the board should also be applied to the place where the joint has gone.  If the reduction of the hip joint is complete, as it should be, and the sign of its reduction is not hidden from you – which is that you extend the patient's legs.
Then if you see them even, and the patient can flex and extend the leg without difficulty, know that the limb has been reduced as it should be. Then, bind the thighs together and apply the bandage, binding it firmly so that the hip does not move in any direction.
The patient must remain still for three or four days, then unbind the bandage and compare the leg with the other. If you see them equal in size, know that the reduction has held, and release the patient to walk.  If you see any laxness in it,
then re-bandage it and tighten it as you did at first, and also leave it for three days, then unbind it, and he should walk slowly on it for days until it strengthens, God willing.
Chapter Thirty-Two.
In the treatment of the reduction of the knee.
The knee dislocates in three ways: inwards, outwards, and downwards, that is, backwards; it does not dislocate forwards at all.  The sign of its dislocation is that you order the patient to bring his leg to his thigh.
If it does not adhere to the thigh, then know that the knee is dislocated. The treatment of all types of its dislocation is that you make the patient sit with his legs extended, if he is able to do so, and a servant sits behind him to hold his waist and twist it slightly backwards, then you sit on his thighs.
And you place your back against his face and put his leg between your legs, then you grasp his knee with your hands and interlock your fingers on his knee, then you press with your hands strongly on the sides of his knee, and another servant extends his leg until the knee returns to its place.
And the sign of its return is that the leg adheres to the thigh smoothly and without constraint. Then bandage it and bind the leg to the thigh, and bind them both together with a bandage for three or four days, then release them. And he should only do a little walking for a few days until it strengthens.
If it is difficult for you to return it by what we have described, then use strong traction with the bandages which I have previously described in the treatment of the hip, until it returns.
Chapter Thirty-Three.
On the treatment of a dislocated heel.
The heel may be slightly displaced, or it may be completely dislocated.  Its dislocation is either inwards or outwards, and the sign of its dislocation is that you see the heel swollen and prominent in the direction in which it was dislocated.
As for the treatment of its slight displacement, it is easy to return it; this is done by gently extending it with the hands and straightening it until it returns. As for its treatment if it is completely dislocated, then it is necessary that you make the patient sit, and a strong servant should hold him from behind his back at his waist.
Then you grasp his foot with your right hand from above, and with your left hand from below the foot at the place of the heel; then pull the foot towards you with your right hand, then with the left, twice; then extend it with the left and push the front of the foot with the right towards the leg without force.
Do this twice as we have described, then push the front of the foot to the leg on the third time while you pull at the heel. If it returns in one or two times in this manner and you see the foot straight, then it is done; otherwise repeat the procedure, for it will return.
If it refuses to return by what we have described, then lay the patient on his back on the ground and fix a strong, firmly secured peg in the ground to be placed between his thighs, having wrapped a cloth around it lest it injure the patient; then a servant should hold his thigh.
Then another servant extends the leg, either with his hands or with a rope which he ties around the neck of the leg; then each servant extends in opposition to the other, the peg remaining between the patient's thighs, holding him so that his body is not drawn downwards during extension; then the physician straightens the joint with his hands.
And another servant holds the sound leg below, for the joint returns quickly; when the joint returns and you see that its return is correct, then apply the bandage and splint, and bind it tightly with bandages, and bind the foot with the bandage below; and it is necessary to protect the nerve which is above the heel from behind.
lest the bandage be tight upon it and injure it; then leave it for two or three days. If the bandage loosens, then tighten it, and then loosen it on the third or fourth day; and the patient must abstain from walking for forty days.
If he attempts to walk before this time, you cannot be sure that the joint will not be dislocated again and spoiled, and will not then accept treatment. If a hot swelling appears, then it is necessary that you use for its alleviation what we have previously described in another place concerning treatment and cleaning, until it disappears.
Chapter Thirty-Four.
In the treatment of the dislocation of the toes of the foot.
It is necessary to set what is dislocated with a slight extension without force; and this is not difficult, but easy. If the dislocation is in some of the joints of the instep, then it is necessary that the patient place his foot on a level surface of the ground.
Or on a board while he is standing like one walking, then you stand and place your foot on what is dislocated from those joints, then press it down with your foot firmly until it returns and you see that it has become straight and no prominence appears in the place.
Then place under the sole of his foot a board which takes the whole foot, which has two ends, then bind it tightly and firmly for three days, then unbind it and keep him from walking for many days until it strengthens and you are safe from a relapse, God willing.
Chapter thirty-five.
On the types of dislocation which occurs with a wound or with a fracture or with both together.
When something of that happens and its treatment and setting are neglected, it often results in death.
Therefore, no one should undertake the treatment of such a thing except one who is skillful in the art, long experienced, gentle, compassionate, deliberate, not rash or reckless, and that he should use in the beginning only those medicines which calm hot swellings and reassure the patient.
For the power of God, except that for which I hoped for safety from harm with mildness of the disease and some hope appeared to you in it, then return it from its place at the first, before the hot swelling occurs.
If the member returns as you wished, then use the treatment which calms hot swellings and treat the wound with what is suitable for it of drying ointments; if the dislocation is with a fracture and there occur in the bone splinters which are separated, then remove them. And observe in that what we mentioned in the simple diseases which preceded in their places.
And strive your best and refrain yourself from entering the path of risk as my advice to you preceded; that is more enduring for your reputation and safer for your honor, God willing.
