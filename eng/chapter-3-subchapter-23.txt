 CHAPTER TWENTY-THREE.
Discourse on dislocations.
 A dislocation is a displacement of any of the joints from its place, whereby the movement of the joint is hindered, the member is deformed, and the patient is caused violent pain and hurt.
When anyone sustains a dislocation he should hasten to have it reduced, not delaying it at all.
For if it is delayed the place will swell up and the reduction will be thereby made difficult.
So it should not be delayed, nor moved or extended during the time it is swollen, for that often leads to spasm and excruciating pain.
Instead, when this occurs, you must hasten to venesect the patient, and then let be until the swelling has subsided a little.
Then massage the member with hot water and oil and let it be gently reduced.
And treat every member with the things that will be mentioned in their place.
I have disposed the chapters on dislocations in the same order as the foregoing ones on fractures, that is, from the upper part of the body to the lower part.
