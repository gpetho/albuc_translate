Chapter 64.
On the treatment of hernia caused by veins.
Vein swelling is a swelling surrounded by a wrap similar to a shoot with softening of the testicles, making movement, exercise, and walking difficult for the patient.
Treating this illness is feared because of the previously mentioned reasons.
However, we must describe the operation on it as the first did.
I say that you should have the patient sit on an elevated seat; push the testicular suspensory to the lower parts; hold the genital covering with your fingers along with the vessels attached to the penis; another assistant should hold and stretch them vehemently.
Then cut with a sharp broad knife transversely over the vessels until they are exposed.
Expose all parts as we have described for artery extraction in the temples.
Insert a needle with a double thread into them, tie it at the first place where the vein problem occurs, and tie it again at the end of them.
Then cut them in the middle with a straight incision along the length of the body, and remove what is accumulated of fetid and corrupt humors.
Then treat the wound as you would other wounds where you want healing to be produced, so that the vessels nourishing one of the two testicles fall off, for there is no harm in this.
But if the vein problem affects all the vessels, the testicles must be removed or the testicles and vessels should be closed off, depriving them of all nourishment through vessel incision, and they should be atrophied, or closed off so they are not beneficial.
