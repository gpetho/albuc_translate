On the treatment of continuous, sharp tears from the eyes.
Chapter IV.
When there are continuous tears, and their flow comes from the veins that are on the outside of the skull of the head: and no medical treatment is effective with medicines, and you see the face of the patient already reddened, and he feels movement in his forehead, like the movement of ants: and his eyes are weakened, moist, so that the hairs of them are already corroded with erosion: and his eyelids are heated from the sharpness of the tears: then the ancients used this procedure in their treatment, and they called it the treatment "with the Knife."
And it is, that you instruct the patient to shave the hairs that are on his forehead.
Then cut three parallel incisions in the forehead along the length of the forehead: and let the length of each incision be about two fingers, and let one incision be aligned with the length of the nose in the middle of the forehead, and the second along the length slightly away from the movement of the muscles, and the third on the other side: and beware of cutting the arteries that are on both sides: and keep your hand away from the connection of the two jaws, and let the space of each incision be the width of three joined fingers: and have a piece of sponge prepared for yourself, or many dry cloths, with which you may dry the blood.
Then insert the "spatumile" with two sharp ends, whose form follows immediately.
From the incision that is on the side of the temple, up to the second incision: and strip with it all the skin that is between the two incisions, with a tool, which is above the bone.
Then do the same also from the middle incision up to the second incision.
Then remove this "spatumile," and insert into the first incision again another instrument, which is called the "sharp cutter," sharp on one side, not sharp on the other side.
And this is its form.
And place its sharp side toward the flesh attached to the skin, and its smooth side toward the bone: and push it until it reaches the middle incision: and cut with it all the vessels that descend from the head to the eyes: except that the incision should continue up to what is visible of the skin.
Then do the same in the middle incision up to the other incision.
And after an equal quantity of blood flows, squeeze the places of the clots of coagulated blood.
Then place in each incision a strip of old cotton, and place over them cushions soaked in wine, oil, or vinegar.
And see to it that no hot swelling occurs.
And on the third day, loosen the bandage, and apply a generous infusion with warm water.
Then treat it with basilicon ointment and the other things by which wounds are treated: until it heals.
