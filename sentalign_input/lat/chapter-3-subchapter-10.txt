Â¶ On the restoration of the hip.
Chapter XI.
The bones of the hip are rarely fractured.
But if they do fracture, the fracture is usually just a breaking at the ends: they split lengthwise and incline inward, causing pain at the site and pricking, and the leg with the fracture becomes numb.
The restoration is to lay your hand over it until you can discern the shape of the fracture.
If the fracture is only at the ends, align it according to the preparations made for alignment, until it resembles its natural shape.
But if the fracture is lengthwise or inclines inward, then make the patient lie on his stomach until the restoration of that fracture is prepared.
When you have aligned it, place a plaster on it, then a splint from wood or leather over it: and bind it with a compression that does not fear displacement of the fracture nor the removal of the splint.
And equalize any hollows with whatever will fill them, until the compression takes hold evenly: instruct the patient to sleep on his back or on his healthy side.
If a hot abscess develops, then cease any extension and restoration until the hot abscess subsides: place on it what soothes it, as described before, then return to restoring it: and bind it as necessary.
But if it occurs in the sciatic bone, or is shattered, remove it.
