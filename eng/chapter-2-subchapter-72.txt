 CHAPTER SEVENTY-TWO.
On the treatment of unperforated female pudenda.
 This condition is when a woman's pudenda have no opening or have only a tiny opening; it may be either congenital or acquired.
The acquired sort is due to some preceding disease; either to a fleshy growth or to a membrane, thick or thin.
It may be in the fundus of the uterus or in its walls or in the upper part or in the lower part; and it prevents intercourse, conception, and delivery; it often also hinders the menses.
This is recognized by inspection by the midwife, if the obstruction be obvious and low.
But if it be not visible she should palpate with her fingers or with a probe.
And when the obstruction is due to a thin membrane near the labia you should lose no time in breaking it down.
This is done by applying some sort of pad to the labia; then put both thumbs upon it.
The woman should be upon her back with her legs spread wide apart; then the labia are to be stretched strongly till the thin membrane is ruptured and the obstruction is laid open.
Then take wool soaked in oil and apply to the place, and let the woman engage in coitus every day lest the place close over.
If the membrane be thick and strong you should incise it with a broad myrtle-leaf scalpel.
But if the obstruction be due to a growth you should catch hold of it with two hooks and cut it away.
And have at hand remedies for allaying haemorrhage without pain, such as acacia and dragon's blood and olibanum, all mixed with egg-white.
Then use a cannula of lead to prevent the wound healing up too quickly.
She should keep it in position for some days and employ a bandage of dry linen.
Then treat with the usual healing dressings until it heals.
 Sometimes other growths of flesh arise in the uterus itself; you should cut away in this manner all except cancerous tumours; for a cancerous tumour arising in the uterus is under no circumstance to be treated with the knife.
