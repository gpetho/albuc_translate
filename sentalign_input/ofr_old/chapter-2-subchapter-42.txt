of scrofula
These abscesses often appear on the neck, and under the armpits, and in the groin, and sometimes they appear elsewhere on the body, and they are many, and are joined together. And each scrofula is properly within its own capsule, like the nuts and abscesses of the head, as we have said; and the appearances of these scrofulas are many. Some contain moisture, and some are malignant and do not respond to treatment. In those that you see with a good appearance to the touch, and resemble the color of the body, and move in every direction and are not attached to the nerves of the neck or to the artery or to the duct, and are not deep; you must cut it from above, and scrape it from every part, and stretch the two lips of the cut with hooks, if needed, as we have said in abscesses of the head; and pull it out little by little, and be careful not to cut the nerve or the vein, and the spatula should not be too sharp or cutting, so that the hand does not slip, and does not go too deep, so you do not cut what you should not.
And if you cut the vein or artery, and this prevents you from working, apply powdered vitriol to the wound, or some powders that stop bleeding, and compress the wound; and leave it until the abscess is calm, and the wound is softened, and begins to rot. And when the bleeding stops, return to your work, until you complete it; then feel with your index finger if any small scrofulas remain, cut and clean them. And if there is a large vein in the root of the scrofula, do not cut that scrofula at its root, but tie it with a strong double thread, and let it fall off by itself, without harm; then fill the wound with old cotton soaked in Egyptian ointment, then treat it.
And if you cut the entire scrofula, you must bring together the two lips of the wound, and stitch them immediately, so that there is no remaining excess because of the size of the scrofula. You must focus on cutting its root and extracting it, and stitch it as we have said. Those scrofulas that contain excess fluid, pierce where it appears mature; and pierce it as the one mentioned earlier, at the lowest point, then administer tents with ointment and similar things, so that it corrupts what remains of the corruption; and when the wound is well cleaned, treat it with ointment that promotes flesh growth, until it is healed.
