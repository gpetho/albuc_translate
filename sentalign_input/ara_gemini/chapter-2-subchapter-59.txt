How to inject the bladder with a syringe
and images of the instruments suitable for that
It is made of silver or hollow ivory, it has a long thin tube, and if you want to instill water and medicine into it, this will be by a tool called a syringe
And this is its image:
It is made of silver or ivory, hollowed out, with a long, thin, hollow tube, except for the tip, which is solid and has three holes, two on one side and one on the other, as you see.
And the hollow place in which the piston is, should be of a size that it fills it without any extra space, so that if you pull something of the fluids with it, it is drawn, and if you push with it, it is pushed to a distance, similar to how the pump is made, which is used to throw naphtha in sea battles.
So if you want to introduce fluids into the bladder, you insert the tip of the syringe into the fluid and pull the piston upwards, then the fluid is drawn into the cavity of the syringe.
Then you insert its tip into the urethra, according to what we described for catheters, then you push the fluid with the piston, and that fluid reaches the bladder at the spot until the patient feels it.
And this is a picture of a nice syringe also, with which you inject the bladder:
It is made of silver or "espadroia", its upper head resembles a small funnel, and below it is a groove in which the bandage is placed.
Then you take a camel bladder and put in it the moisture that you want to inject into the bladder, then tie it between the two partitions tightly with a doubled thread and warm that moisture a little on the fire.
Then you insert the tip of the syringe into the urethra, then tighten your hand on the bladder with the moisture tightly until the patient feels that the moisture has reached the bladder.
If you do not have a bladder, then take a piece of thin leather, make a circle out of it, and pierce it all around, then insert a strong thread into that hole as you turn.
Then gather the circle as you gather the tablecloth after putting in it what you want of moistures, oils, and water, then tie it in the instrument and do with it as you did with the bladder by squeezing your hand until the moisture reaches the bladder.
