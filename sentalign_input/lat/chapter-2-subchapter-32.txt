On Filing Teeth that Protrude Over Others.
Chapter 32.
When teeth protrude unnaturally, they mar the appearance, especially in women and girls, particularly those who are in public view.
Thus, you must consider the approach carefully.
If a tooth has emerged behind another and is misaligned, such that neither filing nor grinding is possible, then extract it. If it is attached to another tooth, cut it using this instrument, which has the following shape.
It resembles a small beak and is made from Indian iron, with a very sharp tip.
Make this cut gradually over several days due to the hardness of the tooth, ensuring it does not disturb adjacent teeth.
If the protruding tooth can be filed down, use an iron file, shaped as follows.
The file should be entirely of iron, with a handle covered in small points, similar to a file used for making needles. Gradually file down the tooth over several days, working gently to avoid loosening the tooth and causing it to fall out. Finally, smooth the tooth with a fine razor.
If part of a tooth breaks off and injures the tongue, file it down until the roughness is removed, leveling and smoothing it so it no longer harms the tongue or impedes speech.
