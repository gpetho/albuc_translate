O you, very dear sons, I have completed this book, which is the last of the science of medicine, along with its completion, and I have made an end by its explanations and by its declarations. And it came to me in a vision that I would complete it with this treatise, which is part of the work of the hands, that is to say, "surgery".
And because the work of the hands is quite strong in our region and is quite strange throughout, the science is lost and cut off, and nothing remains of its strength except the small descriptions in books of the ancients that the hands have moved. And from this came the error and the vanity, and the understandings are closed and the science is distanced.
Now it seems to me that I want to revive it along with the ordering of this treatise according to the way of exposition, declaration, and abbreviation; and will come along with the forms of cautery irons, and other instruments of the work, with the addition of the declaration and preparation of them, as is necessary.
And for the reason of this, that no good masters of hands are found in our time, the art of medicine is distant. And he who undertakes it must surpass in the science of anatomy, as Galen says, so that he knows the arrangement of the members, and their forms and conjunctions and separations, and has knowledge of the bones and nerves and veins and the number of them, and the movement and the flowing and resting veins, and the place of their origin.
And for this, Hippocrates said that the name, with the name, is much, and with the work is little; and especially in the art of hand.
We tell you in the introduction of this book that whoever is not knowledgeable about the aforementioned things must guard against falling into error and killing people;
so that I have many times seen several of those who intervene in this science abandon themselves without science and without experience.
For I saw a foolish fellow who cut an abscess of scrofulous or a woman's neck, and cut the neck's arteries; so that so much blood flowed out that the woman fell dead in his hands.
And saw another fellow who extracted a stone from an elderly man, and the stone was large; and carried away with it a piece of the bladder, and the man died within three days.
And I had already been called to remove it, and I saw the disposition of the sick man and the size of the stone, and knew well that if it were cut out, he would die.
And I saw another fellow who took on the care of a duke of our land who had a broken leg, and with the fracture had a wound;
and the fellow, full of ignorance, pressed the fracture against the wound with tight bandages, and did not leave any space for the wound, and left it like that for a while.
and he commanded him not to loosen it at all;
and it remained like that until the leg, foot, and toes were all swollen and perished.
I was called to come to him, and I hastened to come and untie the leg; and when I loosened it, it was at peace and felt no pain.
But in any case, the corruption had already been confirmed in the limb, and I could not heal it;
and the corruption continued to spread through the limb until the entire limb was lost.
And I saw another mire that opened the festered abscess, and then inflamed because of the malice of its lord.
For a chancre, when it is clear of melancholic humor, it is not appropriate to touch it with iron unless it is in such a place that all the corrupted matter can be removed.
And therefore, my dear son, you need to know that the work of hands is divided into two divisions: that is to say, work where there is peril in many dispositions;
and I will show in every place in this book where there is fear and peril.
Therefore, you must be careful, so that foolish onlookers cannot speak ill of you.
Take your weapons cautiously, and undertake your patients lightly and firmly, and use the best path so that by the grace of God you achieve safety and are praised;
and leave the terrifying illnesses of grievous health;
and remove your weapons from that which makes you fearful, and have faith in yourselves so that you may pass from this world to the next with glory.
Galen said in some of his admonitions: Do not undertake a serious illness, lest you be called a foolish physician.
I have devised this treatise according to three chapters.
The first chapter is of cauteries of fire and cauteries of sharp medicine, and the chapter is ordered from the head down to the feet;
and of the forms of instruments, and the ironwork of cauteries, and of everything necessary in the work.
The second chapter is of cutting and piercing, and of cupping and wounds, and of the extraction of arrows, and of similar things;
and the chapter is ordered and the forms of the instruments.
The third chapter is of restoring dislocations and sprains, and of similar things;
and it is ordered from the head down to the feet, and of the forms of the instruments.
Before we remember the work, it is necessary that I say the quality of the help and the harm of each complexion.
I say that the qualities of help and harm are the longest speech and a subtle science, and the secrets are hidden.
and many wise men spoke of this, and agreed on this.
and their words suffice me little, for I fear length.
I say that cautery helps universally in every complexion where there is matter, except for two complexions. that is to say, a hot complexion without matter, and a dry complexion without matter.
In a hot and dry complexion together with matter, some debated and said that cautery is a great help; and others said the opposite: that cautery is of no value for an illness that comes from heat and dryness. For the nature of fire is hot, and it should not be used to cure a hot illness by heat, nor by dryness;
and the one who said the opposite stated that cautery is a great help for a hot and dry illness that comes upon the bodies of men. For when you compare the body of man and its moisture to the complexion of fire, you find the body cold.
And I agree with this statement. For I have found it on occasion by experiment.
And in any case, do not intervene unless the one who has tested it, and who knows through long use the chapter of cauteries, and the diversity of human complexions, and the dispositions and causes of their illnesses, and the occurrences and the length of time;
of other complexions we have no fear, especially in cold and moist illnesses. And all the doctors gathered and agreed to the cautery.
And know, son, that cautery combined with fire is among the secrets of cures, and of greater goodness than cautery with burning medicine.
For fire is simple, and does not harm except the member that is affected, and does not harm another member much.
Burning medicines spread from member to member, and cause serious illnesses to spread to the other members; and perhaps kill the sick person.
Fire, because of its high temperature and good substance, does not cause harm, unless there is excess.
And this I have found through experimentation and through the length of service and study I have put into the art, and it is based on the truth of things;
and for this I apologize for the length of the speech, because I do not want to deprive you of the secret contained within fire, and the quality of the work, how it expels illnesses from the body, as the philosopher says in his demonstration; or receive it in your thoughts.
And know, son, that they agreed on the time when cauteries should be performed, and chose spring.
And I say that cautery is suitable at all times, because the harm arising is overcome by the aid of cautery; and especially if the cauteries are necessary for pains, strong and fast, so that they cannot wait for the time when greater harm may befall the limb.
And never think about it, dear son, as fools do; for the illness that is cured by cautery has no return; and they say it thus;
and they say it thus; but it is not as they believe, because cautery is only a medicine that changes the constitution, and dries the humours that are the cause of the pain, and is more valuable than medicine for the speed of its value, and for the virtue of its work and its power.
And it is possible that the illness comes sometimes according to the constitution of the sick person and the location of the illness and its virtue;
and if superfluities are gathered in him by the intake of food and similar things, if it is not cautery administered in a place where there is little superfluity and moisture, like cautery of the teeth for pain, and similar things, and such pain does not return; But this happens rarely.
And many people do not understand why cautery is called the last resort of medicine, and this is true;
but they do not believe that cautery is worthwhile after other medicine, but their intentions are false, and cautery is the last resort of medicine because when we administer various treatments for any illness and they are ineffective, then we administer cautery, and it works.
Therefore, it is clear that cautery is the last resort of medicine, not according to the intentions of foolish people.
The ancients said that cautery with a gold instrument is better than one of iron, and they said this only because of the quality of gold and the high value of its substance;
and they said that the place where cautery is used does not cause rot, but this is not true, for I have experienced it, and have found that it is true in some men;
and cautery with gold is better than one with iron, as they said. And yet, when you heat a gold instrument, you do not know when it is hot by the color of the gold, and it cools quickly;
and if it is heated too much; so do they do to the fire; and thus there is enough hindrance.
Or I have ordered this chapter from the head down to the feet, so that the way might be easier to find.
These cauteries are good for moisture and cold on the brain, and there are two of them done for a disease called "soda", and because of many humors that descend from the head to the eyes, and to the ears, and for the multitude of dreams and toothaches and sore throats, and especially for all diseases that come from cold, such as paralysis and soda and apoplexy and similar illnesses.
The form of this cautery is that the patient be purged by a dissolving medicine that purifies the head for three or four nights, according to the strength and age and the patient's tolerance. and then raise the head of the sick person.
And then have him sit cross-legged in your lap, and place his hands on his lap;
Afterwards, place the base of your palm on the base of his nose between his two eyes; and let your middle fingers reach, then draw blood from the inside, and then heat the cautery that is called "olivare," of which this is the form: And place it on the marked spot, and make it descend and tighten your hand little by little, turning it; then quickly lift your hand, and examine the spot if you see the bone slightly protruding; and if you do not see it, then repeat the cautery until you see the bone as I have told you;
afterwards take a little of oil, and put it in warm water and soften some cotton inside it, and place it on the spot, and leave it there for three days;
afterwards put moistened cotton in butter; and leave it on until the burning sensation is gone; afterwards treat the wound with the ointment called "tetrafarmaçon" until it is healed.
And the ancients said that the longer a wound remains open, the more it purges; and for this reason it helps.
And some of them said that the cautery should be applied until a portion of the bone is burned, and then the burned part of the bone should be removed and treated.
And others say that one should apply the cautery for a long time, and press so hard that one knocks off a piece of bone as wide as a spindle that women put in their spindles so that the humours flow outwards.
And one should leave the wound open for a long time; After that, one should treat and close it.
And these two ways of cauterization do not seem to me to be good at all, except in some men where there is a fear of pain.
And I think that I ought to leave it.
For the body is weakened by the continuous solutions of nature, as we testify in other limbs.
And even when the patient's body is weak by nature, the first type of cautery is safer and milder for me, and with this I combine healing work together.
When chronic pain affects the entire head and lasts a long time, the patient should use herbs and pills called "cochie," and head cleansings, oils, and plasters. and if the cautery we have previously mentioned is done to him, and it does not work. Be careful if the patient's head is of strong nature and is not too cold; Then cauterize below that cautery a little as we have mentioned above. Afterwards, cauterize on each horn of the head down to the bone, as we have said before, and perform a cautery on the place called "vessels. and that is the place where leeches are placed; and keep your hand so that you don't see down to the bone: The patient feels much greater pain in this cautery than in the others, and I will speak of it elsewhere;
And the cauteries of the horns should be finer than those with which one cauterizes the middle of the head, and this is the form:
of the cautery of the head When sudden pain arises in a part of the head, and the illness extends to the eye, and the head has been purged by purifying medicines, and the other cures that I have mentioned in the division of illnesses have been applied, and none of this helps: Then one makes cauteries in two ways, that is to say with sharp medicine and with fire.
The cautery of sharp medicine is this: take a piece of garlic, remove the skin and cut it into two pieces, and then cut the temple where the pain is in such a way that you can place the piece of garlic beneath the skin;
and when it is placed there, bind and restrain it well and leave it thus for twelve hours; and then unbind it and remove the piece of garlic, and leave the wound thus for two or three days; then put on cotton dipped in butter until the suppuration stops.
After the treatment with ointment until it is healed;
and if you wish, use some of the burning medicines that I have written about in the twelfth treatise on burning medicines.
The cautery of iron is thus in this manner. Heat the cautery, of which this is the form:
And it is called "clos" because its head is shaped like a closed pot or a small curved container, and in the middle is a small appearance;
and place it on the painful area, and hold your hand and rotate the iron slightly, until half the thickness of the heart is burned;
and lift your hand so that the artery, which is outside, does not burn, and abundant blood flows out.
Afterwards, place cotton in salted water, and apply to the area for three days; then place cotton soaked in butter, and then treat the area with ointment until it is healed;
and if you wish to cauterize this migraine with the cautery called "cultellare", using the very tip, and be careful not to cut the artery in this migraine, which is not ancient.
of migraine
When treating a migraine, as we have previously described in the divisions of illnesses, and it does not help, and you see that the cauteries previously mentioned from medicine and iron do not suffice, then you must heat the cautery called "cultellare" until it is white;
and apply it thus to the painful area, a line of half a finger's length, and remove your hand once, and be careful not to cut the artery and not to reach the bone;
and be wary of the jawbone that moves when one chews, and that the nerve only affects that which moves and that spasm does not come to the patient, and be wary of blood flowing from the artery when it is cut, or that the cutting causes great fear, especially for someone who does not understand, and who is not a student and experienced; and leave the work halfway;
but I will tell you how to stop blood when the artery is cut, and I will show you the place where it belongs in this book.
And if you see that these cauteries do not suffice for the illness, and the patient is suffering, cauterize him in the middle of the head as we have said, and treat the wound until it is healed;
And if you wish, administer the cautery that we have mentioned in the chapter on the extraction of the artery, with the cautery that has two blades; and this cautery is better than that and more helpful.
of the pain in the ears from cold.
When pain in the ear comes from cold, and one has applied solvents and other remedies that we have discussed in the division, and the pain does not change, then heat this cautery which is called "point", of which this is the shape:
Then prick all around the diseased ear, or around both if the pain is in both, and move a little above the root of the ear after you have marked the spot to be treated; and make ten pricks around each ear;
afterwards treat the spot until it is healed.
of the torture of the mouth
Torture which must be treated by cautery is no different than those caused by phlegm, as we have said in the divisions of disease;
and do not apply cautery to those that appear to come from dryness and nerve spasms.
When you treat this type of torture caused by phlegm, from purges and gargles, and this does not work, then you must cauterize the patient with three cauteries: one at the root of the ear, and another a little outside the temple, and the third at the junction of the two lips;
and place the cautery on the apparently healthy area, and apply it to the head of the ear, a little below the horn of the head, and another on the temple as long as a thumb; and leave the cautery in place until half the heart is burned;
and this is the form of the cautery:
And it resembles the scalpel we have placed before, but it is a little more subtle and requires that the knife be a little thicker;
after treating the area as I have previously said, until it is healed.
When the apoplexy is old and you treat it as we have said, and it does not help, and the patient has no fever, then apply four cauteries: Two on the two horns of the head, and one in the middle of the head, and one on the area called "vessels" as we have said before, and the final cautery on the mouth of the stomach;
and be treated as we have said before.
of lethargy
For this illness, you should give the patient large herbs and pills that cleanse the brain;
After that, raise the patient's head entirely, and place the mustard plaster, which is described in the treatise on plasters, on the back of the head;
and this is the manner of cautery: if you do it as I have said.
If he is healed thus, it is good; and if he is not, make three cauteries from within the head, descending down to the neck, and have a space of one inch between each cautery;
and treat it like the others, and if you wish to add more, and the patient is able to endure it, make one cautery in the middle; and if necessary, two others on the two horns, and treat it until he is healed;
and let the cauteries be what are called "olivare," as I have said before.
It is necessary that the head be cleansed of scabs and of what we have said before;
After that, treat the patient's head, then cauterize the middle of the head and on each horn, and one behind and three on the spine of the neck;
And if you need more, and the body is moist and the patient is suffering, and the illness is severe, then you should make four cauteries on the spine of the back; and leave it until the most of the heart is burned, and remove your hand; after treat it until it is healed, and let the cauteries, which are called "olivare" that we have said before, be.
of epilepsy
The epileptic should not use strong cauteries unless they are phlegmatic, and it is necessary first to purify the brain with years and other treatments that we have mentioned in the division when the patient is great and suffering from taking medicine.
And if it is a child who cannot endure it, then make them gargle and chew, purifying the brain often with good foods;
Then the physician places the head in the middle, and applies cauteries according to what we have said before, and applies cauteries on the vessel, and on each horn; And if the patient is strong and enduring, apply cauteries as I have said to those with paralysis and body softening, on the spine of the back and neck, and let the cauteries be olive-shaped according to the method I have described.
If the patient is a child, apply a subtle cautery in this manner:
When superfluities or corrupted moisture and thick phlegm are caused by melancholy, then cauterize with such cauteries as we have described for those with paralysis.
And if, due to melancholy, the superfluities lean toward melancholy, and the patient's body is moist, then give the patient a drink to cleanse the brain, according to what has been previously discussed in the division.
After that, bathe the patient's head. Next, make a well-made linen bandage, like a circle, and place it on the head;
and the patient sits cross-legged, and be well held from all sides;
Then apply the liniment, and use a mixture of old bear's fat; and heat it with a moderate fire, so that the patient can tolerate the heat; Then empty the circle from inside the head, and allow it to cool;
and do this to the patient each week once with other good treatment, until they are healthy.
Or if you want to cauterize it by making many small cuts with the cautery.
This method of cautery weakens the brain equally;
and then place moistened cotton in butter and goose fat.
of the eyes' water When water first comes to the eyes by the signs I have mentioned in the division, then begin and give the sick person something that cleanses the head, and guard it from all moisture, and make him sweat in a bath several times while fasting.
Afterwards, he commands him to rest his head, and performs cautery in the middle of the head, and makes two cauteries on the two temples if the descent of the water is in both eyes together, or in one if the descent is in one;
and cut with the cautery all the veins and arteries that are under the heart, and let the cautery be long according to the width of the temple;
and guard against a discharge of blood, and if you see too much blood coming out, then stop it with whatever power you have.
And I will teach you in the extraction of arteries and in the incision the precaution how you will stop it;
And sometimes cautery or a heated instrument is used under the two bones behind.
and if one sees that it is from cold, phlegmatic superfluities, then do the cautery that I have said at the beginning of the ailment descending to the eyes: One cautery in the middle of the head, and two cauteries on the two temples, and two cauteries or heated instruments under the two bones; and if there is further need, then prudently cauterize above the eyebrow with a single small cautery.
When you treat it according to what we have said in the division, and it does not benefit, then give the sick person three nights' worth of porridge to drink; afterwards, treat the head, and cauterize in the middle of the olive-shaped cautery; and make two cauteries with the cautery called "clavilis" above the two eyebrows, a little below the hair;
and beware of the artery that you do not cut.
And this is the shape of the cautery that is called "clavilis":
When the eyelid is softened by illness and moisture, then cauterize it with this cautery which is called "olivare". of which this is the shape:
And if you wish, make two cauteries on the two eyebrows as long as the eyebrows are;
and do not keep the hand there except for as long as a third of the eyelid is burned, according to the manner that I have said.
from a hair that pricks the eye Sometimes it happens that the hairs of the eyelids turn inward and prick the eye, and cauteries are made according to two methods: that is to say, of fire, or of burning medicine.
For cautery with fire, instruct the patient to let the hairs grow long and even; and if they prick at their base, hold the eyes steady so they do not move until they grow.
When they have grown and are even, then place the patient in your care; afterward, draw on the skin over the eyes a figure that is like a myrtle leaf, and let the beginning of the sign be next to the hairs;
then place cotton soaked in egg white and parsley mucilage on the eye, then heat the cautery, which has this shape:
Afterward, cauterize over the figure you have marked, little by little many times, so that the heart is burned in that place;
and the sign of the healing of the work is that you see the skin retracted, and the hairs raised at the puncture of the eye;
then remove your hand and leave it like this for three days, then apply cotton soaked in butter until the burn is gone; afterward, treat with ointment until it is healed.
And if afterward the hair grows back and the skin is softened, then recommence the cautery on that same place, just as you did first;
and if the hair is burnt off, cauterize it until the skin is raised to its natural position, and is even, and the hair does not prick the eye.
The cautery of burning medicine is that you instruct the patient to let the hairs grow large and even, then make a shape of myrtle leaf from parchment;
then take French soap and live coals, of each one ounce, and grind them together well; and quickly, so it does not cool, then spread it on the shape you have made, like the myrtle leaf, and put it on the skin of the eyes; and if the patient has pain in only one eye, one must work on that one, and if in both, as well; and place under the eye cotton moistened in egg white;
and the patient's head should be in your stead, and place your index finger on the medicine, and press it lightly, and move it every time the patient feels a burning sensation from the medicine, because it feels like burning as from fire.
When you have done this for a long time, remove the medicine from your finger. And when the burning sensation has passed, raise the bandage, and examine to see if you see the paper raised as if it were raised by the constraint of fire or by incision; and if it is so, then it is well.
If not, then reapply the medicine to the area where the medicine hasn't worked, until your work is equal and your eyes are focused;
then apply moistened cotton in butter until the burned area has healed; afterwards, treat the area with the ointment called "diafenis" and others, until it is healthy.
And if you need to, carefully guard yourself in your work so that no medicine gets into your eyes.
And if the paper becomes soft afterwards, and the hairs prick the eye, then reapply the medicine to the area of softened paper properly, as you did before; afterwards treat it until it is healthy;
and this is the form of the myrtle leaf:
And know that human eyes differ in size and smallness, and according to this, let your constrictions be;
and may the right way not be denied to him who studies this art.
of the treatment of fistula by cautery
When you treat a fistula as we have said in the divisions of diseases, and your treatments are of no benefit, then you must cauterize it according to this method.
Instruct the patient to put his head in your lap; and let the attendant hold his head between your hands in such a way that it does not move, nor does he lower his head;
after placing moistened cotton in egg white or in parsley juice over the eye;
after heating the cautery which is such:
and is shaped on the head like the shape of a pointed vault, with which the cautery should be;
if you wish, it may be pointed from one end to the other, and if you wish, it may be like a tent;
however, this one that is shaped is better for your work.
After press the fistula if it is open, and remove the pus, and dry it; and if it is closed, then open it, and remove the swelling;
after put on the hot cautery firmly, and hold your hand to the cautery on the part of the nose above the eye, that your hand does not cause harm; and place the cautery on the fat of the eye, and corrupt it.
If you come to the beginning of the cautery up to the bone, then it would be good. If not, then repeat the cautery once more, and another time if you need it, and leave it for three days;
after put on moistened cotton in butter, and cure it with desiccant ointment until it is healed, and if forty days pass and it is not healed, then apply an acute corrosive medicine until the bone is exposed; and the rest according to what he would come to in his chapter.
And there is a way of cautery of fistula that some of the ancients said. Understand the fistula, and open the place; after put in the fissure a subtle cautery of which this is the form: and there make it the quantity of a .3. of lead; and hold your hand on the cautery firmly, and let the patient not move at all, lest the melted lead run into their eye;
and it is necessary that one put on the patient's eye cotton moistened in egg white or in water:
The lead thus burns the fistula's place, and heals it with marvelous health.
And if the fistula is healed by the cautery that we have spoken of, it is good. If not, it is necessary to administer a hole to the nose, and bring the fistula back to the body of the nose in its proper place.
of cracks in the lips Very often, cracks in the lips, called "poil," occur, especially on the lips of children.
When you treat these cracks with what we have said in the divisions, and the treatment is not effective, then heat a small knife cautery according to this form:
And place it quickly into those cracks until it reaches the bottom;
afterward, treat the area with cerote until it is healed.
When an abscess comes to the root of the throat or in the uvula, or the palate, or the roots of the teeth, afterwards it causes decay and rot and becomes aged and becomes a fistula; and you treat it as we have said in the divisions, and it does no good: then it is necessary that you have the cautery according to the quantity of the fistula; after the opening or perforation of the fistula, and hold your hand until the hot iron reaches the bottom of it, and the back place;
and do so once or twice, after the treatment that we have said in treatments, until it is healed;
and if it is treated thus, it is good; and if not, then it is necessary to uncover the place and remove the corrupted bone, according to what you find in its chapter.
When the gums are softened by moisture and the teeth move, and you treat it with medicine and that is not worthwhile, then place the head of the patient on your lap; afterwards, heat the cautery, whose shape will come later, in such a way that you place a stick on the tooth;
and place the hot cautery immediately on it, and hold your hand so that the patient feels the heat going to the root of the tooth;
afterwards, lift your hand and reapply the cautery according to your will;
afterwards, let the patient fill his mouth with salt water, and let him rinse for an hour and spit out forcefully.
And in this manner, the tooth that was moving is thus strengthened, and the softened gum is restrained, and the corrupted moisture is dried.
Of the pain of the teeth
When toothache comes from cold, or there is cold or true cold, and the cures of medicine are not effective, then there is need for cautery in two ways: and cautery with butter and cautery with fire.
Cautery with butter is such that you take cow's butter, and put it on the tip of an iron or brass spoon; after that take cotton and wrap it around the tip of a tent, and soak it in boiling butter, and put it on the aching tooth quickly and hold it until it cools;
and do this often until its virtue reaches the root of the tooth, and if you want, soak wool and cotton in cold butter, and put it on the aching tooth, and put a hot iron over it until the heat reaches the end of the tooth.
Cauteries together with fire are such that you take a piece of iron or brass, and it should be thick enough that the fire does not reach the mouth of the sick person;
after heating the cautery, from which the shape will come next, and put it on the tooth and hold it with your hand until the cautery is cool;
Do this often, for the pain will be removed either that same day or the next.
And it is necessary for the sick person to fill their mouth with good butter during the application of this cautery, and then to hold it firmly.
And this is the shape of the cautery:
And make a cautery of whatever shape you want, and according to what you have the power to do;
And this is the shape of the chain:
of the scrofulas When the scrofulas are of phlegm and cold moistures, and are not obedient to digestion by medicines, then heat the cautery, the shape of which is mentioned afterwards, and have two openings for the fumes to escape from the cautery on the other side;
and place the hot cautery on the abscess once, or where it is needed, until it reaches the bottom of the abscess;
and if the abscess is small, place the cautery according to the size of the abscess, and leave it like that for three days; and place on moistened cotton in butter until the burning is removed;
afterward, treat the area with ointments and dressings until it is healed.
When moistures overcome the channels of the body, and especially when this comes from a cold constitution, then it is necessary that the patient be first purged by solutive medicines;
Afterward, apply cautery to the root of the throat, and be careful not to come all the way down to the throat, and do not burn the heart, but only a little.
Afterward, apply another cautery to the joint of the neck at the top of the spine, and let the cautery be the one called "clavile," of which we have the form before.
and treat the place as we have previously said until it is healed.
When coughs and lung illnesses are from cold moisture, and the patient has no fever or dryness, and the illness is longstanding, apply two cauteries on the ribs in vacant places; and another cautery in the middle of the chest between the two breasts;
and let the cauteries, which are called "clavile," be according to the form previously described.
And if you wish, apply a cautery, puncturing throughout the cautery called "poins," the form of which is described previously in the illness of the ears;
and let the punctures be up to thirty, or thereabouts.
After treating the location according to what was previously stated, and let the cauteries be in three rows according to this form:
And for this, the cauteries are lighter, because you make three at a stroke.
of the dislocation of the shoulder
When the head of the shoulder is dislocated due to moisture, and it is reset but cannot stay in place, repeatedly dislocating with slight movement as we have experienced, then you must first reset the dislocation. Afterwards, let the patient be supported on their back and side; Afterwards, lift the heart that is within the titillite with the fingers of your left hand;
and if the joint is dislocated inward, then heat the cautery which has two nerves, of which this is the form:
and cauterize the heart until it pierces the side, and the shape of the cautery would be like four cauteries combined;
and for this, a cautery with three nerves is made, so that the shape of the cauterization is six cauteries;
and the nerves are according to the subtlety of a tent, and this is the form of the cautery with three nerves:
And sometimes one nerve is added to this, so that there are eight cauteries.
After that, put the cautery on the bruised area with a bandage; Afterwards, make the patient rest, and let the limb not be moved for a long time until it is well supported.
And if it is dislocated above, which rarely happens, then apply cautery on the thick part of the clavicle, or many cauteries in pricking.
For the joint is closed, and the moisture is removed, and the patient is healed.
When colds and much moisture enter the stomach, so that it is contrary to its temperament, and the phlegm is multiplied within him, and the usual methods of treatment do not benefit him, then it is necessary that the patient be placed on his back, and stretch out his legs and arms. From this, afterwards, apply three cauteries: one under the breastbone, the size of a finger, one on the entire clavicle, and two cauteries outside the two ribs, such that the arrangement of the cauteries forms a three-sided figure, and there is enough space between each so that when they discharge pus, they are not joined together.
and let the cauteries be so deep that they reach the two sides of the heart, and let the shape of the cauteries be in this form, without joining:
And if you wish to cauterize with a large cautery in the middle of the stomach, according to this shape;
and whoever is afraid of this cautery, cauterize by pricking and applying a cauterization on the stomach at various points according to the quantity you desire. then cauterize it with the entire cautery that is called "points".
After the treatment of the treatment that we have had before, until it is healed.
When the liver experiences pain from cold and moisture and excessive windiness, so that it is forced out of its natural disposition by superfluities; and if the patient is treated as we have said in divisions, and it does him no good, then the patient must be examined closely. and mark three cauteries according to this form and this figure and this quantity on the liver, to ward off the hypochondria, the place where the man's ribs come.
and have a space between each cautery the width of a finger. and the cauteries should be the length of the body, and do not press your hand too much on the entire cautery.
and only half of the core should be burned, and the patient should be standing straight on their feet.
and if he cannot, let him lie down, and extend his legs, and raise his arms.
And if you wish, cauterize these cauteries with a scalpel, if you are skillful and wise in the art, and beware that you do not burn the entire core, for you would dry the whole body. and that it does not reach boiling, for the core is very delicate there, and you know it to be true.
When there is an abscess in the liver, and you wish to know if it is in the flesh of the liver or in the membrane: if it is in the flesh, the patient feels pain not too strongly;
and if it is in the membrane, he feels fierce pain.
And when this treatment should be applied to the eyes, the patient must be held sitting upright with his head supported.
then moisten the area where the abscess is, and then heat the cautery iron, which is like a ray, of which this is the shape: And cauterize with the cautery until the skin is burned and reaches the surface, until the pore is entirely open.
After the treatment, care for the wounds until they are healed.
And it is not fitting for anyone to use this cautery except those who have studied medicine for a long time, and whose hands have treated these illnesses on numerous occasions.
Then he can work boldly, and yet it seems to me that it is better to leave it alone.
From cautery with a pleurocin.
The ancients said that cauteries with pleurocin should be made from aristolochia roots, and in this manner: Take a long aristolochia root, the largest you can find, and let it be dry, and as thick and as long as your fingers. and moisten it in oil, and heat it in the fire, and cauterize one cautery between the clavicle and the neck, and two small cauteries a little lower in the part under the beard;
and two cauteries between the fifth and sixth ribs, sloping backward a little; and one cautery in the middle of the breast, and one other above the stomach, and one between the two shoulders, and two on the two sides of the breast, outside the cautery that is between the two shoulders;
and do not press your hand, but do it openly, as if smelling.
And some ancients said that some men use a cautery of iron resembling a razor, and heat it and place it between the ribs until it reaches the abscess; and the pain will leap out, just as we have said in the abscess of the liver.
But in this work, there is fear, where the patient dies now, or a fistula comes that cannot be healed.
of the mouse
When you treat the disease of the mouse with what we have said about the divisions of cures, and it is of no profit, then there are three kinds of cautery that are all good.
Of which one way is that you make three cauteries, or four, by making incisions along the length of the mouse, according to the shape of the cautery of the liver that we have mentioned before;
and do not press your hand on all the cautery, and let the patient often be on their back;
and another way of cautery is that you heat the cautery which has two nerves, as we have shown in the dislocation of the shoulder;
and raise the heart that is next to the mouse, or the patient's chest comes towards the left, and let the elevation by which you raise the heart follow the heart, according to the length of the body, and the cauteries follow the width of the body.
After that, put the two inflamed nerves until the heart is pierced on the other side, and then pull out the cautery, and thus there will be four.
And if you wish, you cauterize with the entire cautery on three nerves.
After the cure, when it has cast off corruption for a long time, and this is worth more than the other cures previously mentioned.
Cautery is not useful for a person with dropsy, except in the manner called "asclytes".
When you treat it according to the methods we have described in the divisions, and your treatment is of no benefit, then you must make four cauteries around the flank, one on the stomach, one on the liver, one on the spleen, two behind the back on the spine, and one on the breast. And the cauteries should be close to the depth of the heart.
Afterward, leave the cautery open to allow the pus to drain for a long time, and do not discontinue the treatment of the sick person after the cautery. And healing will be hastened, and the two intentions will be together with the help of God.
The shape of the cautery for the belly should be the design that we have previously shown. And that for the back should be olive-shaped, according to what is previously mentioned.
When the feet are swollen in someone who is hydrops, and are full of yellow water, you should cauterize on the back of the foot between the little toe and the ring finger; and lift your hand with the cautery without turning.
And do not enter too deeply, lest the yellow water be expelled forcefully, and let the cautery be according to this form:
After that, make two cauteries on each leg at the tip of the shinbone; and let the cauteries be long, one below the knee in front and the other outside, in the middle of the leg;
and leave the cauteries open for a long time without dressing, so that the water comes out;
after the treatment of the other treatments that we have said.
When stomach problems come from cold and dampness, so that the retentive and digestive powers in the stomach and intestines are weakened and cannot be cured by any means; and you see the sick person suffering greatly and with great strength, then apply a large cautery to the stomach according to what was discussed previously, or a circular cautery to the stomach; and four small cauteries around the belly, one small cautery overall, and two cauteries on the hips.
And if you see abundant moisture and the patient suffering, apply a cautery to the groin, one cautery to each side of it, and two small cauteries next to the large one on the stomach, for the cure is beneficial when there is good assistance.
of the treatment of hemorrhoids
When the hemorrhoids are in the fundament, one or more, and are old and are of thick, cold, moist, corrupted humors, and are treated as we have said in divisions, and it does no good, then apply cauteries: Three on the spine of the back, those that are quite outside beneath the armpit little by little in a triangular shape, and one cautery beneath the belly two fingers.
And if you think his stomach is chilled, and the food does not cook, and the face is seen to swell, then apply one large cautery to the stomach, as stated before, and another to the liver, and another to the spleen, with all the cauteries close together. And leave the cautery open a long time. After the treatment, let the area heal.
When you cut the althelul, heat the cautery, which resembles a razor, and then put it, all ablaze, on the cut althelul. and hold it there with your hand until the cautery reaches the beginning of the vein, from which the blood flows;
do this once or twice, and if there is much althelul, cauterize each one as we have said; after applying healing ointments until they are healed;
and if you cauterize with a large cautery on the alchatim, it will be of greater help.
When the patient cannot tolerate cutting or opening, which we will describe in its place, such an illness comes that cannot be cured except by cautery.
When a fistula appears on someone, and is old and throws out rotting and corrupted moisture, you should probe it with a thin probe, and be certain to know the probe's depth.
After heat the cautery, which resembles a scraper, and put it into the fistula according to the quantity that the probe has entered, and reapply the cautery until that rotten and corrupted flesh is burned, once, or twice, or three times, according to its needs.
And beware of burning the nerves which are present, and the large veins.
If the fistula goes to the body of the bladder and to the intestines, beware of those places, and only make these burns on the fleshy areas, and consider that it is not penetrating.
After treat the area until it is healed, and if the area is sealed, and the matter is removed for a long time, then know that the area is completely healed.
And if the matter is not removed, know that the area is open, and the bone at the bottom is corrupted. And thus, as one of those we will describe in its place.
When pain from cold comes to the kidneys, and from great wind, and it does not take the form of a woman's ailment, then it is necessary for you to apply cautery to the kidneys on both sides using the cautery iron we have previously described.
And if we cauterize it in the middle, then there will be three cauteries in a line, and this will provide greater aid.
Of the bladder When the bladder is weak and frail from cold and moisture, so that the patient retains urine, then apply cautery to the outer part above the bladder, where the pubic hair begins, one on the right and one on the left, and let each cautery be as long as the width of a finger.
And apply one cautery on the back outside, or two if you need them.
And let the cauteries be positioned according to the previously described form.
When the scrofula is cold and moist, and does not allow for conception, and the flowers are corrupted and their ends delay. and when they come, then great pain is felt: Then it is necessary that one make three cauteries around the abscess, as we have said in the cautery of the bladder, and two cauteries outside the back;
and let the cauteries be sharp, as we have said.
When viscous moisture descends to the socket of the hip, and for this reason it moves from its place, and the sign is that the thigh is longer than the other when measured together;
and if the place of the separation is empty, then you must cauterize the patient on the hip socket with one cautery shaped like a circle, and mark in front of the place around the socket as it turns, so that the socket is within the circle;
and let the cautery be like the one used to cauterize the stomach.
And if this cautery is not available, make three large olive-shaped cauteries, and let the cauteries be as deep as all the heart.
and treat it until it is healed.
of the pain of the hip When pain comes in the hip joint, and it is from cold and moisture, and the patient is treated with what we have said in the division, and the treatment is not working, and the illness is old: then you must purge the patient of the thick humours with foul pills, or other good similar pills. After that, apply cautery;
and the manner of the cautery is according to two manners: that is to say, burning medicines together, and fire cautery.
Fire cautery is according to many manners, of which one is such:
that you cauterize on the hip joint three triangular cauteries according to this form, and make them deep and wide, and have between each cautery a space the thickness of a finger, and let the cauteries be olive-shaped;
Sometimes cauterization is done in the middle on the head of the hip, so that there are four according to this form:
And if you wish, you may cauterize it with the circular cautery that we have previously mentioned in the dislocation of the hip;
but make it in such a way that the circle encompasses the entire hip, and all the thick parts of the core are burned.
And this is the method used for sciatica, when the pain is in the hip and does not reach the thigh or leg.
And if it reaches the thigh and leg, then make two cauteries where the patient says the pain is, and one cautery above the ankle, four fingers, a little to the left side;
and let the cauteries be sharp, and let the thick parts of the core be burned;
and if the patient feels the pain extend to the toe or near the heel, cauterize it where they feel the pain with three or four pricks of the cautery called "pricks. And if necessary, then make more.
And if the pain is under the knee towards the thigh, make a cautery with a sharp or circular cautery, and be very careful in all your cauteries that you don't leave the cautery on so long that you burn the nerves and major arteries, and that you do not cause the patient further harm and contraction.
And I myself have seen several who have made cauteries on the ankle of the foot, and they left them on so long that the leg became completely swollen, and the foot as well, and the whole foot was pierced and corrupted. After a solution of the belly, of which he died.
And if the pain is in two parts together, make cauteries on each, according to this method.
And the wise said, concerning the cautery of the hip, that this is the method: make a cautery iron and let it be as thick as a nut, or a little less, and let it have grooves and from one groove to another the space of a finger's width.
and let the grooves be on both sides, and let them be like knots, and let there be a good iron handle.
and this is the form:
And it should be heated until it is all red and throws sparks, and then it is placed on the painful part of the hip, and turned towards the healthy side.
and cauterize once, and leave it for three days. and then make a plaster of butter, and leave the wound open a long time. after the ointment treatment until it is healed.
Albucasim says that we rarely use this cautery because of the fear of its effect, and we see few who use it.
and nevertheless, it is a good cautery for those who can tolerate it, and in the place where it is appropriate.
The cautery of burning medicine is such that you make an instrument with interstices in which the edge of the pot descends, and it should be of bronze or iron with a long side, and it should have two grooves, and there should be between each the thickness of a finger; and they should be open at the front and top, and join together in this shape:
Then place the box of the hip on the patient lying on their healthy side, and press your hand firmly onto the box of the hip; then pour between the two circles of hot water which has been heated in the fire a little, and leave it an hour, and the patient endures the heat and burning.
For it finds there a burning just as from fire;
and when the burning is over, remove your hand with the instrument and lift the hip with soft water, and leave it thus for three days, and put on butter until what is black from the scalding is removed; and leave it three days for the rot to come out;
and that would be the final help after the treatment with ointments until it is healed.
And if the pain has spread to the thigh or to the leg, make one instrument that stains with water according to what you have done to the hip equally;
and that is the manner of hot water, and I have written it in the treatment of the rectification of medicine. Take alkali and quicklime, as much of one as of the other, and grind them together, and put them in a new pot. in which there is a small hole to allow the point of a razor to enter;
in which there is a small hole to allow the point of a razor to enter; and put over that pot another pot well-sealed, and put alkali and lime and soft water on top, so much of it that there is a fingerbreadth above the powders when you have well grasped it in your hand;
and let it be thus until it descends as sharp water and drips into the sealed pot, then take all that water, and pour it over lime and alkali as before.
And then it will be very sharp and is administered in various medical works and in cauteries of other members.
For it accomplishes a work like fire, and there are other medicines with which one cauterizes the hip well, like thistle and honey and mastic and lime with soap, all these things mixed together.
And Galen tells us of a cure with which a man was cured of hip and sciatic pain, and praises it greatly, and says that no other cure was made, and that he was healed in one single time when this cure was done, and he had bathed as he will teach hereafter.
And says in this manner that you take fresh and dry green litharge, and grind it much with a little grease, and place it on the hip, and on the thigh, and on the leg where the pain is, and bind it.
and leave it for three hours, and by the quantity that the patient no longer feels the burning.
And then make him enter the bath until his body is somewhat wet, and make him enter the bed, and the pain will leave entirely and he will be healed.
And know that no one should use cautery of such medicines, if it is not after the evacuation of the body.
And Dioscorides says that when the sciatic vein is cauterized with goat's dung, it helps much.
and the cauteries should be done in such a manner. Take wool and soak it in old oil, and place it on the hollow that is between the big toe and the other that is called the foscile.
Afterwards, take dry goat dung, and heat it in fire until it is embers, and place it on the wool, and leave it until it is extinguished;
and repeat this, and do not cease to do thus until you believe, through feeling, that it reaches the hip, and that the pain has ceased;
and this method of cautery is called "cautery of goat".
of the pain of the back
When pain comes to the back, whether through falling or impact or excessive evacuation, or through the spread of cold matter, no cauteries are good for any of these except for that which comes from the infusion of cold matter.
It is necessary, after the patient has been relieved of foul pills or similar things, that three lines be marked on his back, wherever the pain is, and five cauteries in each line, or more, according to the strength and amount that the patient can bear;
and the cauteries should be performed according to the cautery called "pointed".
and if you wish, make three or four cauteries at the middle clavicle cautery according to this form:
Many times this illness comes to young children, and the signs of the beginning are that they have a tight chest when they rise, and fear; and you find in the back's last spine and on other spines the appearance that comes upon them.
When you see this and wish to treat it, cauterize it with the circle cautery according to this form. So that the cautery encompasses each part of the spine equally.
And if you wish, cauterize around the spine with a cautery that makes two or three lines, and let the points be close together.
After treating the area until it is healed according to what we have said, and be careful not to apply cautery to any swelling that is in a nerve's path.
of the pain of the joints
When joint pain is caused by moisture spread throughout the body's limbs, and when pain comes to the feet, which the doctors call "gout" properly, and when it is from a cold cause and treatments with medicines cannot cure it, then it is cured by cauteries in this way:
Make many cauteries around the joint of the foot, and let the cauteries be olive-shaped according to this form:
And if it needs to be done on the sole of the foot, make the cautery a total cautery that is called "point". And if the pains reach the knees and other joints, and this happens many times, make three or four cauteries on each knee, of each part, with an olive-shaped cautery;
and if you need more, make more, but do not hold your hand there for more than the thickness of the heart be burned.
And if the pains descend to the knee and back, administer the cautery that we have mentioned in its chapter.
And if the pains are in the hands, make points around the wrist two lines;
and if there remains any pain in the fingers, make points on each joint and on the hair of the hand;
and if the pains come down to the elbows or to the shoulders, cauterize each part, and give good care to the patient and let him take medicines.
For if you give him good care and purge the phlegm, he will be healthy with God's help.
When a rupture occurs in the inguinal region, and the swelling descends to the testicles, and it is recent, then when you wish to treat it, he should not eat that day. and that he use things that loosen the belly, so that the stool descends from his belly;
after that, make him sit on his back between your hands, and instruct him to hold his breath until the swelling is repaired, and bring it back with your fingers, and make a mark below the rupture on the bone of the groin, and make a sign like half a circle above the body;
then heat the cautery of which this is the form:
until it is white and gives off sparks. Then bring the bowels back to their place; and the assistant should hold their hand over it so that they do not return;
and support the patient's thighs well, and put a cushion under him and a servant on the thighs, and another on the chest to hold his hands;
then place the cautery on the sign with your whole hand, and hold it straight and hold it until you reach the bone, and if you do not reach it the first time, then start again another time until you come to the bone; and carefully guard that the bowel does not jump when you do the cautery; that you do not burn it; and that by this the patient does not die, or other harm.
And know that when you do not come to the bone with the cautery, your work is worth nothing.
And it is necessary that the cauteries of children be subtle according to their size, and of great people also great according to their size;
after three days treat the place of the cautery with butter until the burn is removed;
after that treat with other ointments until it is healed, and let the patient lie on his back for forty days until the wound is well closed;
and it is necessary that his nourishments be light for a long time, so that the bowels do not swell when he tries to walk in rooms.
And after forty days, when he wants to get up, provide him with a well-made bandage, and keep it on for forty more days;
and let him have good rest, that he work little and guard against excessive drinking and eating, and too much shouting;
and when he follows this instruction, he is completely healed.
And I will now describe the treatment of cutting in this chapter.
When ruptures occur in other bellies and are known, and you wish that they grow no more, you should apply the cautery cauterization according to its quantity, and let a third of the core be burned. after the treatment according to what we have said;
and some of the ancients have said that it should be cauterized with a three-angled cautery according to this form:
but first mark the place of incision and make a line across the width above the rupture, and another outside, and then place your hand in the middle, encompassing the entire cautery with your hand.
But the first cauteries are lighter and milder.
of old pain in any limb When pain arises in any limb, whether from falling or striking, and that pain lasts a long time, and the cures of medicine are of no avail, then it is necessary that it be cauterized with a cautery called "point," and let the cauteries be according to the length of the limb, and its smallness and weakness, its virtue, and its location of twists and pain.
If it is healed from the first cautery, that is good;
if not, then recommence another cautery upon that one, for such is the custom that it should shift to the member that is nearest, wherefore you must apply cauteries until the patient is healed.
The mixture is sometimes aided by cautery with great help, and especially the ailments that arise from the putrefaction of phlegm and melancholy.
When you see it cauterized, take care if the ailment is at the beginning, and if it is cured according to what we have said in the division, and it does not descend nor remain, and you doubt that the corruption will not affect the entire patient, then make five cauteries on the head: one in the middle of the head, and the other towards the forehead at the end of the hair; and two on the two horns, and one behind on the nape of the neck;
and let your hand stay there until the cauteries reach the bone, and until the scabs come out so that the vapors of the thick humors can escape;
and cauterize on the mouse according to what is in front of it.
And if the mixture is scattered everywhere; and if it is manifestly lost, then you should cauterize it with the cauteries we have described, one cautery on the nose, two cauteries on the spine of the neck, six cauteries on the spine of the back, one large one on the rump and another beside it, and two on the two shoulders; and two on the elbows, and two on the tendons of the breast, and one on each joint of the hands and feet, and on the hollows of the hands;
and beware of the nerves that are on the back of the heel, that you do not burn them;
and sometimes one cauterizes on the bone of the fist, and another on the bone of the stomach, and another on the liver.
And know that the more cauteries you make, the more you help him, and the more it benefits him;
and know that the sick person feels no pain from the cautery as healthy people do, because the body is already completely corrupted.
And it is necessary that the cauteries be large and small according to the members and joints, according to what you will find in the various types of irons.
After the treatment, cover the area with flour of violets with honey and other remedies until it is healthy.
When swelling appears in any limb and is treated with medicines, oils, and plasters, and it is not healed, then you apply cauteries to the limb according to its size and smallness.
And let the cauteries be slightly into the depth of the flesh. Then treat it with ointments until it is healed.
And sometimes cauteries are applied to the hand, foot, and back, at the point where the nerve affects the limb, and thus the swelling is removed.
And nevertheless, no one should intervene unless they are knowledgeable about the limbs and the exits of the nerves that move the body.
When the disease called "albaras" has grown old, and the tools of medicine are of no value, then cauterize it with a cautery a little deeply, according to the amount of the thickness of the core, until the whiteness is removed and its color is changed.
Then cure it with flour of vetch and lentils, with rose oil and plantain leaves, and blood of a colon and blood of an almond, each a part. And mix all together, and bind it with a cloth, and apply it to the place until it is healed.
The cure of a sore by cautery
When a sore appears at the beginning, and you wish to stop it, cauterize it with a cautery that resembles a circle, all around the sore.
And nevertheless, the wise say that one should also cauterize in the middle of the sore;
And nevertheless, this does not seem good to me, for I fear that it may become ulcerated and corrupted, and I have already seen it happen on several occasions;
And a more proper thing is that it be cauterized around, with the cautery that is called "circle", as we have said in many other cauteries.
When someone has a sickness called "adubelati", and it is slow to heal, either due to the excess it causes or because of the age of the sick person, when they are decrepit (that is to say, too old), and they have little blood, or due to the time; and you wish to hasten its healing: then cauterize it around with many small cauteries by pricking; after that leave it thus. For it will hasten to heal.
And if you wish to pierce it with the whole cautery, then heat the cautery of which this is the shape:
And place your hand in the middle of the ailment called "adubelati" until the cauteries have pierced the core, and let the cauteries be such that the patient feels it from the outside in such a way that the course of the putrefaction is eased.
After that, treat it until it is completely healed.
There is another type of ailment called "corrodens," which is nothing more than a gnawing of the limbs, for it devours the limbs just as fire devours dry wood.
If you see this ailment in a place that can tolerate cautery with fire, then heat the cauteries, small and large, according to what is appropriate for the location of the ailment.
After cauterizing from all sides until you have eradicated all corruption, and nothing remains of it, so that everything that is corrupted is removed.
And then leave it for three days, and apply soothing poultices with oil to the cauterized areas until the heat from the fire is gone, and all the corruption is removed.
After the treatment with ointments that generate flesh.
And if you see after three days that healthy flesh does not grow, it is good.
And if not, then repeat the cautery on the remaining corrupted areas.
And this affliction has sometimes been cured by sharp medicine instead of fire cautery;
However, fire cautery is of greater help, and I have already described the cure with sharp medicine in the division: Take it when you need it.
of the boils that come to the feet Often happens that on the feet, from the outside, a disease arises that is called "closure" according to our understanding, and it is a large, festering thing that hurts the foot.
And the cauteries for this disease are according to two manners. That is to say, cautery by fire, and cautery by hot water.
Cauterization by fire is that you heat a cautery iron, just like a pointed piece of metal, and it should be made of good iron, sized to be able to grip the wound from all sides, and that it have thin edges;
Afterwards, put it hot onto the wound, and turn your hand all around the wound until it reaches the bottom of the wound; and leave it thus for three days until it begins to discharge pus; Then make a poultice of crushed wild mallows with salt, and leave the poultice on all night, and the wound will fall away and be uprooted from its roots.
Then treat the area with a healing ointment until it is healed.
And if they are inflamed outside the body, and often happen on hands and feet, then you must apply hot water cautery there; and is of this sort: Take a rod of copper or iron, or a piece of pumice stone, and place it on the wound and the nail, that is to say, for warts; and place the rod on it so that it encompasses everything around, then put a little hot water on it, and hold your hand firmly, and press your hand while turning so that the edge of the rod reaches the root of the nail, and the hot water can find its way deep to the root;
and the patient endures a little the burning of the hot water for an hour; then leave it thus, and it will uproot itself from all its roots.
Do this one after another, until you remove all those that are on the body, then treat them with ointments that generate flesh.
When someone trembles from cold nerves, or from quartan fever or other, you must make four cauteries or four on the spine of the back, one cautery between each spine; and one cautery on the feet, and one on the stomach with an olive cautery;
This will stop the trembling, and the health will hasten from the cold illness.
Sometimes foul pustules appear on the body, or foul pustules, that come from large corrupt matter.
So it is necessary at first when they appear that one should do cautery on each head of the pustule: a subtle cautery of myrtle wood, whose point is taken from fire, or of long aristoloche root, or to the lenticular cautery.
And sometimes they are cauterized at the beginning when they appear, according to this manner, and they cannot grow from thence onward, but the superfluities from which they come are broken, and they are healed;
but it is necessary that this be done after the evacuation of blood.
Many times there are great flows of blood from the artery that is cut in the wound that comes from outside, or in the incision of the abscess, or in the cautery of the limb, and in similar things; and it is a very grievous thing to stop.
And however, when this happens to someone, hurry to place your index finger on the wound of the vein, and press it firmly until the blood is calmed beneath your finger, and no more drops come out;
then put the olive-shaped cauteries, several small and large, in the fire until they are all red;
then take one, either large or small, according to the wound and the place where the artery is cut, and place the cautery on that vein where you hold your finger, and hold the cautery there until the blood is stopped.
And if it jumps out when you remove your finger from above the vein, and the cautery goes out, quickly take another of the cauteries that are in the fire.
And do not cease to do this one after the other until the blood is stopped;
and watch that you do not burn the nerve that is nearby, and that no other harm comes to the patient;
and know that when blood flows from the artery, it cannot be well stopped, especially when the artery is large, unless it is by one of the four ways that we have said: either by cautery, or by extraction when it is not treated, or by a strong bandage of thread, or by medicines applied that have the power to stop blood; and be bound and held tightly.
Whoever applies the stopping of tying tightly with cloths or putting burning things on, or other similar things, will not profit much from it.
And if this happens to someone and they have neither a remedy nor medicine present, they should place their index finger on the wound of the vein as we have said, and press firmly until the bleeding above the wound and above the vein is stopped; and do not move the finger, but moisten it with cold water often, so it is very cold, until the blood is congealed and thickened and stopped;
and make inquiries beforehand about the cauteries and medicines needed.
In the first chapter, we have told you all the illnesses in which fire cautery, or burning medicines, are needed, and the origins, causes, instruments, and forms of cauteries;
and I have arranged that chapter from head to foot, and I will proceed through this chapter in the same way so that one can find more easily what one desires.
And before I begin this, dear son, you must understand that in this chapter there is more danger and fear than in the first on cauteries, and therefore more caution is required.
For in the work of this chapter, there is often the evacuation of blood when opening a vein, and incising an abscess, and in the treatment of wounds, and in the extraction of arrows, and in cutting into stones, and similar things; where there is doubt and fear, and death comes to many.
And I warn you not to undertake folly. For many kinds of people come for cures. if such come who become so enraged with their illness that they die easily because of the frenzy they find in their illness, and from the greatness of their malice; and of these one should have fear.
And of these there are some who give you their sense, and say: wait, I am cured"; and the illness is spiteful.
It is not fitting that you consent to those who come to you with this manner, but rather place greater emphasis on your honour than on your greed, and do not act foolishly but wisely with those of whom you are certain, and from whom you can have taken and praise;
and use prognostication and indication in the treatment of your sick, that health may be converted;
and this will help you acquire good renown, and glory, and a memory of praise.
Dear son, Our Lord grant you good understanding and rectitude, and may you wish to inspire yourself from the holy inspiration of His hand, amen.
Now I have ordered this chapter, dividing it into chapters, in accordance with the preceding chapter on cauteries, that I have described from head to foot, so that you find more easily that of which you will have need.
Know that this illness often comes to children during childbirth, and when the mother holds the child's head too tightly;
and sometimes it comes from unknown causes.
And I never saw this illness except in children, and for all those I saw death hastened. And therefore it seems to me that I should leave this kind of treatment.
And I saw a child whose head was full of water, and the head grew larger each day until it could not support it.
and the moisture increased until death, and this moisture is gathered under the bone on the surface, between the heart and the bone;
and the treatment is such that if the moisture is between the heart and the bone, and the abscess is small, that you should split the head open with a wide fissure;
and it should be as long as two fingers, until the moisture drains out;
and here is the form of the spatumile:
If the moisture is more extensive, and the abscess larger, then make two fissures in the form of a cross, according to this form:
And if the moisture is beneath the bone, and the signs show you that the sutures of the head are open on each side, and the pus jumps out forcefully when you press inside with your hand, and this is not relieved: then it is necessary that you cut through the head with three fissures according to this method:
And after the incision, remove all the moisture outwards. After that, bind the fissures with cloths and powders, and put wine and oil on them, and leave it thus until the fifth day;
then unbind it, and treat the wound with bandages and ointments, and let the head heal evenly, and give the patient dry food with little moisture until the limb is strengthened and healed.
And another method of incision is that you examine the size of the abscess and the accumulation of the water;
for sometimes it is in front; sometimes behind; sometimes on the right; and sometimes on the left.
Therefore, cut where the abscess is open and filled with water, and open it as much as you can;
and be careful not to cut the artery; and if blood flows, so that the patient dies from the outflow of blood and the evacuation of moisture.
When someone has a sickness called "catarrh" in their eyes or chest, and the illness is long-standing, and the cure of medicine is of no use, then the final cure is cautery, with which one burns the two arteries.
It is necessary, then, when you are about to cut them, that the patient tilt their head back; afterward, he rubs the area with a rough cloth until the arteries appear, then the patient tightens their neck with all the cloth; then look where the vein swells, and the places of one and the other are near the ears, and the punctures are made;
then mark the spots, then cut one and the other with a sharp spatula from two sides, until the cut reaches the bone, and that should be near the head's wide area.
And if you wish, put the spatula under the artery and cut above it, cutting as you should through it.
And when the vein is cut, the blood will spring out continuously.
And if the artery is not apparent to the touch, you must measure the width of three fingers, then mark the spot and cut down to the bone;
and the amount of blood that needs to be drawn out is six fingers' breadth, and perhaps a little more or less, according to the patient's ability to endure and the artery's fullness;
then examine the wound: if there remains on the bone a small piece of the surface, cut it so that no further abscesses form, then constrict the wound and bandage it, and apply ointment until it is healed.
of migraine When chronic migraine comes, and acute catarrh, due to the moisture of tears and the heat in the temples and old-fashioned madness and similar things, and he has been treated with various medical cures and none of it helps him, we will draw the arteries of the temples and cauterize them, as we have described.
And the method of extracting them is that the patient should pull back the hair on his temples, and feel for the artery that appears in the temple, for it appears well by its beating, and is rarely found outside of those who are too cold.
and if it is found, the patient tightens its neck with some cloth strips, then rubs the area with a rough cloth, and warms the area with hot water until the artery appears clearly. then take the spatula, of which this is the form: then scrape the skin lightly until you reach the artery, then pull it upward with the forceps, and separate it well from the tissues that are underneath it on each side;
and if the artery is thin, then turn it with the point of the hook, then cut it from that part according to the quantity of the two heads. For if it is not cut, the blood will not flow completely.
And draw blood from six ounces down to three;
and if the artery is large, you must tie it in two places with a strong double silk thread, so that pus does not come before the wound is closed, and a flow of blood occurs;
then cut the excess that is between the two ligatures at that same time, and then, if you wish, cauterize it with a scalpel cautery to the bone until the heads are cut;
and this is the best work, if the patient does not have a fever and is of a hot complexion. For cauteries are helpful for ending moistures: Therefore, it is of even greater help against moistures.
Where it is necessary for the extraction of arteries that one fill the place with old cotton and put on well-made bandages;
and when they are untied, they should be treated with dry medicines that cause flesh to grow, and with bandages, until they are healed;
and if blood flows from the artery as you work on it, then hurry to cauterize it, or fill the place with vitriol and hold it with your hand so the blood is stopped; and if you do not have that present, then place your finger over the spot until the blood is congealed, and wash the area with cold water until the blood stops, and hold it as is necessary;
And there should be one finger's breadth of space between the two blades, and then when you have marked the two spots, and you place the burning iron upon it until it reaches the bone, and cut the vein in two places; and they should be separated between the two sides, for it is not entirely soldered together with this cautery.
and this is the form of the cautery:
And that which is gentler and lighter in the extraction of the artery is that you cauterize the vein with this sharp cautery from two sides, but the sharp edges should be thick to preserve their heat longer. For when the instrument is too thin, it holds less of its heat.
of tears When the tears from the eyes descend into the veins that are above the head of the afflicted person, and no medicine applied will provide a cure, and you see the patient's face reddening, and feel a trembling sensation on the forehead; and if the skin is thin and moist, such that the hair of the eyebrows has fallen out, and the eyebrows are scorched and burnt by the heat of the tears, then this treatment is needed. And the ancients called it "bruised cure," and what you must do to the afflicted person who has this ailment is to shave the hair from their forehead, then make three equal incisions on the forehead along the length of the forehead;
And the ancients called it "bruised cure," and what you must do to the afflicted person who has this ailment is to shave the hair from their forehead, then make three equal incisions on the forehead along the length of the forehead; and one of the incisions should be as long as two fingers, positioned directly in the middle of the forehead, going downwards toward the nose, and the other two, on either side above the eyebrows, and be careful to avoid cutting the arteries located on either side above the eyebrows;
and keep your hand away from the continuation of the two jawbones, and each wound should be the width of three fingers across.
and prepare a piece of sponge and a lot of cloths to wipe the blood, then place the pointed spatula from two sides, in this shape:
from the incision next to the temple down to the second incision; and scrape all the flesh that is between the two incisions on the entire surface above the bone, then do the same from the middle incision down to the other second one, and then remove this spatula. then place in the first incision the instrument called "cultellaire," which is very sharp on one side, and on the other side is blunt, not sharp, and this is the shape:
And place the cutting edge of the knife towards the flesh nearest to the heart, and the blunt edge towards the bone, and place it until it reaches the middle incision.
And cut all the vessels that descend from the head to the eyes until the incision is continuous to what appears of the heart, and then do the same in the middle incision until the other part;
and then extract the blood equally, and press the place for the blood taken;
then place in each incision a tent of old cotton, and place over it cloths moistened in wine and oil and vinegar, and guard that hot abscesses do not come there;
and on the third day loosen the bandage, and administer a large quantity of warm water, then treat it with basil ointment with rose oil, and other treatments used to cure wounds, until it is healed.
When a sudden cold comes to some, and you see the eyes swollen and small, and the sight weakened, and the eyelids burned; and the hair falls out, and in the head there is sharp pain, and the patient sneezes; Then know by these symptoms that those matters and that cold come from many veins, and the best cure for it is this.
And you instruct the patient to lie on their back, then make a large cut across the forehead, and another one the width of a finger. And begin from the cut at the left temple to the right temple, and let the incision go down to the bone; and keep your hand away from the nerves of the temples that move when chewing;
and when the bone is exposed, wipe away all the blood with a sponge, then separate the two sides of the cut and place old cotton and linen bandages in between; then bind on top damp cloths soaked in wine and oil, and be careful of a hot abscess;
when it is removed, you must rub the bone until flesh begins to grow there, then treat it with drying things, which cause flesh to grow.
In such a manner: take two parts of wheat flour, and four parts of colophony, and make a plaster; and apply it to these wounds to cause flesh to grow everywhere.
of the stuffing of the ears
Everything that falls into the ears is one of the four things: or grains, or a beast, or a stone from a mine or similar thing like iron; or seeds, such as chickpeas, beans, peas; or a flowing thing such as water and oil and similar things.
When a stone or another kind of thing falls into the ear that does not join with the ear, nor grow in the ear, put the ear in the sun.
If you see the stone, then distill a little violet oil or oil of sesamum, then administer extraction; and make him sneeze with a concoction, and stop his nostrils when the sneezing comes, and put pieces of cloth or wool around the ear; and extend the ear upwards.
Often, it comes out with this treatment;
and if it does not come out, administer extraction with fine forceps, of which this is the form:
If it leaps out with the forceps, it is good;
otherwise, administer extraction with a fine, small double-bladed hook;
and if it does not jump out with that, make a copper wire and put the wire's tip into the ear opening firmly, and stuff what is around the wire with soft wax so that the wind cannot enter with the wire; then pull it out strongly, for very often it comes out as we have said;
and if it does not come out in such a way, take glue with which birds are caught, and put on it some instrument that is suitable for doing this, and put a little cotton around it; then press the glue onto the stone or whatever, and pull it out.
And if it does not jump out by all these things that we have said, hurry to cut the ear before a hot abscess comes there, and spasm;
and the method of the incision is that you first make the patient bleed from the cephalic vein, and draw out blood according to the measure of its virtue, then make the patient sit between your hands and turn his ear upwards, and make a small incision at the root of the ear in the fat or dependent place; and let the incision be like a crescent, until you come to the stone, then remove it according to your power, and suck it quickly into your mouth;
and the cure until he is healed.
And if it is grains that are inside and it swells, administer extraction;
and if it cannot come out, administer a subtle thin spatumile according to this form: and administer incision of that grain.
But do not do this at all when you think the grain is moist due to moisture from the ear, until you have made many pieces;
then extract with subtle tweezers and by suction, as we have said, so that the extraction is easy.
In the water that falls into the ear, the patient should first use a sneeze-inducing treatment, and stuff the ear with old cotton. And let him lie on the same ear where the water is. If it leaps out through that, it's good.
If not, then take many stones according to the length of your finger, small and light, and heat them a little in the fire; and let the patient put one in the opening of their ear, and jump upon it with their feet on the other side, and hit with another stone upon the stone that is in the ear; and do not cease to strike stone on stone until the water comes out completely, and thus it leaps out completely;
And if you wish, take a reed, and put one end in the ear, and the other end hold over fire until the most fragile part of the reed is burned;
then do the same with other reeds until the water comes out completely, as we have said concerning the stone.
In the extraction of the beast, if it is small, like a flea and similar things, treat it as we have said in the division;
but if it is large enough to be felt, administer extraction with tweezers; and it is the easiest thing to remove that is in the ear.
In the extraction of worms lodged in the ears, when you treat it as we have said in the division and in the treatment of distillations, and the treatment does not work, then you must look at the ear in the sun: if any worms appear, remove them with fine tweezers, and if they do not appear, take the instrument of which this is the shape:
And be narrow underneath and wide above. And insert the finest end of the instrument into the ear according to the severity of the patient's suffering, then suck firmly with the entire instrument; do this often until all the worms come out.
And if they do not obey to come out, wrap the instrument with cotton as I have said for the stone;
and if they do not jump out as we have said, administer distillations that the ancients have proven in the killing of worms, and you will find them in the treatise on distillations;
and distill your oils and medicines into the ear using this instrument, of which here is the form as you see: And it is of silver or brass narrow underneath with little holes, and wide above for distilling;
and to press the distillation with a well-made copper instrument for this, and if you wish, take a scraper and wrap cotton around the pointed end; then pour your oil or juice, and whatever medicines you wish into the tube, and the tube should be in the ear;
then put the scraper into the cotton, and press your hand gently until the oil is distilled into the ear's interior; and the patient feels it inside, and let the distillation be a little heated by the fire as it is distilled into the ear; and take care that it is not too cold, for the medicine would not be very good.
of the stopping of the ears
No child is born who does not have a hole in their ears;
and this same thing happens to men through the stopping of a wound, or of flesh growing inside the ear, and these stoppages sometimes go deep into the ear, so that one cannot see them;
and sometimes the opening of the hole occurs, and one sees it clearly.
That which goes deep, so that one cannot see it, is of difficult healing in many conditions, and for that which one can see, you must place the patient's ear in the sun; and look inside: if you see the obstruction appearing, if it is a kind of tumour of which this is the form:
And be sharp and cutting in front and behind, completely smooth, so that it does not injure the ear;
if the obstruction is of flesh born in or on the body of the ear, then hold it with delicate forceps and cut it slightly, until all the flesh is removed.
And if the obstruction is deep within the ear, then take a delicate, light scraper and warm it slightly over the fire, then place it on the body of the ear.
If you feel the obstruction which the patient feels pain when hearing, pierce it lightly, and be careful not to injure the nerves of the ear;
then place a tent in the ear according to the width of the opening, and moisten it in Egyptian ointment. Do this for several days until the wound is closed, or take a tent and moisten it in rose water, and powder it with crushed vitriol;
and if you see the ear swelling, it is necessary that you remove the tent and replace it with another tent moistened in a cerote made from rose oil and wax, until the swelling is gone; then treat it until it is healed.
And if a discharge of blood comes, then dip a sponge and cloths in cold water, and place it on the ear, and use other treatments that stop the discharge of blood, which are found in the treatment of discharges.
This ailment that comes to the papers from the eyes when they are moist and dry, it is necessary that you extend them with pincers and forceps, and cut it with a spatula from its roots; then put powdered vitriol on the place.
And if blood flows, cauterize it with a subtle, lens-shaped cautery iron, and the cauterization after the incision will be beneficial.
and many times they will heal, when nothing remains of their roots. and when they are cauterized by fire, those roots are burned and do not return.
of hail Many times, there come from the eyes stones that seem like hail in their shape and hardness, and for this reason, this illness is called "grandine," and it is a gathering of thick moisture in the membrane above and below. the work is such:
the work is such: beware if the grandine moves from one side to the other, and it is an easy thing to know.
Then, open it widely, then lightly scrape it from each part, then grasp it with tweezers and cut it.
If you cannot cut it without slightly piercing the membrane, do not worry the patient.
And if the fissure is large, join it with a stitch and treat it until it is healed.
And if it is small, do not use force, for the ointments will soon restore it and generate flesh.
And if the granulation is descending into the inside of the ear towards the upper part, turn the membrane inside out, grasp the granulation with tweezers, cut and press it from one side and the other.
And if the membrane is separated by the incision, it does not cause any harm.
And when the granulation is cut, wash the area with salty water and treat the place with what generates flesh until the patient is healed.
Of the fat of the eyes Exinach is a fat that grows on the membranes of the eyelids, and this happens more to children than to adults, and it causes much pain to their eyes, and they get cataracts in the mornings and cannot look at the sun's light because the tears flow to their eyes.
And because of this, they often lie on their faces and sleep, and their eyelids under their eyebrows are moist, so that the swelling and the appearance have covered the exinach that appears in the eye. And when you press the area with your fingers and feel the exinach between them.
And the method of treatment is that the patient puts their head in your lap.
and then take a linen cloth, and prepare a tent in the shape of a circle according to the amount of exinach on each part, and then place it over it. and press with your fingers on either side, so that the exinach is gathered within the circle;
then cut through the moisture in the middle, with a sharp blade, making a slit of a width that is no greater than the incision made when opening a vein.
and cut the skin deeply until you reach the exinach; and in several places exinach comes out of the slit, according to the shape of a piece of white fat.
Then pull it out entirely with a piece of cloth held between your fingers, and turn your hand to the right and to the left until it is separated.
and be careful not to press too hard into the slit, that you do not reach the entire spatumile all the way to the eye, lest you injure it.
And if the exirnach does not appear at the beginning of the slit, then slightly widen the slit a little until it appears.
Then pull it out as we have said, then moisten cloths in oil and water, and place over the area, and bind with bandages.
And if there are such men who grind salt and apply it to corrupt the moisture that remains.
Then treat it until it is healed.
And if a hot abscess comes to the area, treat it with soothing plasters until it is healed.
of the hairs of the papers When hairs grow on the eyelids, in addition to the natural ones, and grow old, they harm the eyes and cause various ailments, such as persistent tears and softening of the eyelids and albuginea, so that it is a cause of destruction of the eyes;
and the cure is according to four ways: or by cautery with fire, or by sharp medicine according to what is before or in the chapter on cautery, and it is done either by incision and stitching or by cauterization, according to what I will say.
You must place the patient's head on your lap, then turn the eyelid to your left hand;
if it is turned, that is good; if not, then insert a needle along the entire thread on top; and it should be next to the edge of the eyelid where the hairs grow next to these hairs, and pull the thread on top of the entire eyelid, and turn it with a razor;
then cut into the part beneath the eyelid, beneath the adjacent hairs, cutting all the way through, from the large tear duct down to the small one;
then remove the thread, and place a small tent of cotton and linen beneath the eyelid, then place a figure of an incision on the eyelid, like a myrtle leaf, and however, the figure must be according to the size you want to raise the eyelid which is divided into all.
And if someone has a task where a large amount of the eyelid needs to be cut, according to the softening of the eyelid;
then cut all the way through above the two lines you have marked, and begin from the large tear duct down to the small one; and one of the incisions should be near the natural hairs, the thickness of a root, then one inserts the hook into one of the two angles of the tear sac, and then scrape the whole thing;
then bring the two edges together with a stitch of a fine wool needle, and wipe the blood away, and make the excess threads dry on the two eyebrows with any adhesive substance, if you want to do so;
and if not, then there is no cure, and leave the stitching and threads for three or four days;
then treat the wound without stitching, using drying and constricting things, for the parchment adheres to the wound and its joining, but the stitching is gentler (as the ancients say), and this is work without fear; and if there is another method:
and if there is another method: and is that you shape the parchment into a figure like a myrtle leaf, as we have described, with three separate incisions according to the shape that is here:
then cut what rises above with small equal forces according to the shape which is here:
And if you lack the strength to hold the tongs, and the thing is not equal, then take a needle with one thread and place it in the middle of the figure; and place another thread next to the large tear, and the second thread next to the small one, and hold the threads together between your fingers evenly;
then lift your hand equally, and lift the entire skin on which you have marked, as we have described, then join the two edges of the wound with stitches, and treat it until it is healed;
and if an abscess comes to your incision, soothe it with cerote and similar soothing ointments;
and sometimes it happens that the hair of the paper is turned:
if so, you must use what we have said about the incision;
but the stitches in one and the other are more artificial.
The treatment of canes is according to this form: and it is that you turn the paper and the slit inside according to what I said, and then make two canes by art, and two subtle liens as long as the paper and the width of the spatula are; and cut as two heads from two sides where you hold the threads;
then assemble one and the other subtly on what rises from the paper of the eye, and tighten the two canes of the two parts together; and leave it thus for some days, and the skin that is tightened will die and become black and rot, until it falls off by itself.
If it lingers, then cut it with force, then treat it until it is healed;
and when the wound is closed, and the paper will be lifted, and the hair will no longer prick;
and this is the shape of the two canes that you will make according to this figure, and according to this amount of length and width:
The work is such that you take a fine needle, and thread it with a soft and fine silk thread; then assemble the ends and tie them together subtly, and let the length of the threads be one palm long;
then arrange in the chase another fine silk thread briefly, and tie the ends of the thread;
then place the patient's head on your chest;
and let it be next to the sun so that the work is clear, for it is a subtle and delicate work, then insert the needle with the entire chase into the root of the hair close to it, and make it pierce the paper quickly so that you pull it above the natural hair;
then pull the hair up to the chase, and put that hair in the chase, if there is one or two or three or more;
then withdraw your hand so that the hairs come out of the entire chase into the paper with the natural hair.
And if the chase is drawn and the hairs do not come out with it, you will draw the chase downwards along all the thread you have ordained, until the chase comes out of the hole above and you see it through the vision of your eye;
Then you will withdraw the chase and the thread, and close the eye and leave it closed for two or three days, until the hair adheres to its place and the flesh grows;
and if the hair is small, you should attach one long hair from the natural hairs, and it should be raised with that one or you leave it, until it is elongated and then raise it.
Of the corruption of the eye When this illness, which is called "aleacrati" or corruption, comes to the eye, there are two kinds of it:
one natural, and the other unnatural.
And it happens through the wounding of a cut or a cautery, and through similar things.
And the method of treatment is to split that wound, and separate the edges, and put linen strips inside, and bind it until it is healed;
and you should not use things that dry and constrict in its treatment. For if you do this, the illness will return worse than before;
but use softening things, such as fenugreek; and irrigate with water, or cooked linseed and diaquinon ointment melted into any oil, and wrap a bandage around it, and treat it with this.
And the success of your treatment lies in you guarding against its reuniting according to the form it had before;
and these treatments we have mentioned are no more than ways to address this illness, so that it does not return in the form it was before.
This illness, which is truly called "axacrati," is both natural and accidental.
The accident comes from wounds and cuts and cauteries and similar things;
and the method of treatment in this case is that you take a needle, on which there is a double thread, and insert it into the flesh, and pierce it from the left tear duct to the right, so that the thread comes out in two places in the flesh;
Then stretch the flesh above the entire needle, and cut it with a spatula wide. And if the shape of the paper returns as it should, that is good;
If not, take a scraper and place it in the slit, and turn the paper, and make two slits on the inside of the paper;
and let the ends of the two slits be at the two corners of the incision that you have cut, and form angles so that when they are assembled, the shape is like the shape of a letter called "I Greek";
then remove that flesh, according to the amount its sides are sharp beneath, of what is on the other side of the paper, then join the two separated parts and sew them with a woolen thread;
then treat it with what we have said about softening medicines and poultices, until it is healed.
And if the illness comes from a slit or stitch or cautery, you must make a smooth slit beneath the hair of the paper, and according to what is before; then separate between the two edges of a poultice, as I have said;
then separate between the two edges of a poultice, as I have said; and one must perform the work according to the form of the illness, for it is very diverse in form, and the wise masters prepare remedies with all their power, on how to return the figure to its natural form;
and the patient himself, according to what work and instruments are required in various dispositions.
When this adhesion happens to a person in such a way that the paper above is stuck to the white of the eye, and cannot move or perform its natural functions, then you must put the tip of a razor under the paper, and lift it upwards;
and extend it with forceps, until you cut what is adhering to the fine membrane, which should not be too sharp nor too cutting, so that the patient cannot endure the sharp membrane injuring the eye;
and be your incision, with which you burn that adhesion, lightly, so that the paper returns to its natural shape;
and the entire adhesion is healed, and sometimes they apply salty water to the eye, and remove it with fresh water, and with a poultice;
then place a linen tent between the paper and the eye, and place wet wool on the eye, soaked in abundance of egg white; and after the third day use poultices and soothing things until it is healed.
Know that the nail is according to two types: It is nervous and resembles hard skin, and another which is not nervous, but resembles frozen white moisture, that when one touches it with iron and tries to tear it with pincers, one cannot.
And both types begin near the large tear duct, and grow little by little until they cover the entire vision, and all the light and movement of the eye.
And the manner of the incision is that the patient should place their head in your safe keeping, then you open their eyes; and lift the paper to your hand, then grasp the nail with small double-edged pincers, and stretch it upwards; Then take a needle, and put a horse's hair, or cow's, or ox's, and a strong thread; and double the point of the needle a little and insert it into the nail, and pierce it all the way with the needle, and tie the nail with thread and stretch it upwards, and scrape with the hair the side of the nail that touches the pupil and the silk at the hair to the head, then cut the remainder at the root of the tear duct with a sharp, thin tool and with small forces, and leave the natural tissue of the tear duct, so that the flow of tears does not come from the incision as usual;
and sometimes the nail is stretched with the hook alone, and with the thread, as we have said; then scrape it with a soft, fine tool, the shape of which is this:
And be careful that the tool does not touch the fleshy tissue and break it, and that the pupil is not pierced;
and after the incision, put a little bit of boiled salt and litharge into the eye, and leave it until the next day; then treat it with what is needed until it is healed.
And if the nail is not nerve-ridden, and you cannot push the needle in, and the lancet cannot enter, this type of nail is often treated with medicine;
and grow as I have described in the division, and if you wish to cut it, open the patient's eye and take a sharp, small, pointed tool according to this shape: And carefully slice the nail, and if you see it diminishing and the flesh is close, then instill into the eye, from your mouth, litharge-based liquid, red liquid, and boiled salt, and plug the eye until the next day;
If there is nothing else contrary in the eye, such as a boil, then leave it, and first treat the boil until it is healed, then resume the procedure as before, until it is healed.
then begin the other work again according to this same procedure, until it is all removed.
And if the appearance of the tear duct's flesh harms the eye greatly, then suspend it with a hook, and cut off a part, not all of it, so that the tear duct does not leak;
then instill into the eye red liquid made from litharge.
Sometimes red flesh grows in the eyes of some men, and covers the pupil, and grows over the eyelids and becomes deformed, and resembles a rose of baluster;
and the treatment is that the patient put their head in your grasp, then open their eyes, and pull all that flesh with suitable hooks, and hold it with force;
then cut the first flesh, and continue cutting with a razor until the end, and be careful not to injure the eye in the process;
and let the incision be like the one we described in the incision of the nail, and with small forces, whereby one removes the scab, as the form after this chapter demonstrates;
and when the incision is complete and all the flesh is removed, then fill the eye with boiled oil or you may distill red liquor and similar corrosive medicines, and put over the eye a bandage of cloth with a layer of egg, so that it is protected from a hot abscess;
and if anything remains, and hot blood overwhelms you, and you suspect a hot abscess, then leave the eye and treat the abscess with things that soothe a hot abscess;
then return to your work until it is healed, and thus do with all the flesh that has joined the eye in this manner.
However, it is necessary that you mitigate the treatment of each eye weak in its natural way; and from the accidental way, in the work of iron;
and do not put your hand in any of these works until you see that these members are suffering from that work.
These are red veins that are covered over the eye, and they hinder the eye's work and weaken the eye every day.
Therefore, it is necessary first to see if the eye, in which the redness is, is strong, and there is no other illness except the redness; then treat it in this way:
tell the patient to place his head on your chest, then squeeze those veins with the whole hand according to your skill, and let the hand be subtle and double according to this shape:
And let there be two hands in a row in one body according to this shape:
then with force squeeze those veins subtly, and dry the blood hour after hour, until you see those veins move out of the eye;
and be careful not to injure the eye with the points of the spatulas, and do this work at noon in front of the sun, and be very fervent in your work so that you only cut the veins;
and when you have done this, then distill green and red bile into the eye to corrupt what remains of the blood.
And if you cannot collect it all at that time, then apply a plaster to the eye of things that soothe eye pain, and leave it for a few days until the pain is calmed and you are sure it is a hot abscess, then recommence according to the method shown above until it is healed;
and this is the form of the forces:
The mirrors are called "arissati" fistulas:
When you treat it with cautery and with burning sharp medicine according to what I have said before, and it is not healed, if there is a device within it that you should cut open the abscess, wherever it should remain, and drain all the moisture that is there, until the bone is exposed.
And when the bone is exposed, and you see the corruption and blackness, then clean it with all the instruments whose form is shown here;
and it is called "sharp head," and should be made of iron, pointed at one end, and pointed like a file, as shown in the present form:
And place it on the place of the corrupted bone, then turn it between your fingers, and press your hand a little until you know that the corruption is removed;
and do this several times, then restore the place with drying medicines.
if the place is healed, and flesh grows, and the body of the boil is healed, and it remains like this for 40 days, and it does not renew and is not infected, and no bad accidents come, know that it is healed;
if not, there is no other remedy than to bring the fistula back to the opening of the nose according to this form: and it is that you uncover the bone a second time with iron, and with sharp medicines, and when it is uncovered, then take a drill according to this form, and let the iron head be three-angled, and the shaft be thinned to the tip as you see here:
then place it on the bone next to the tear duct, and move your hand away from the eye a little, then turn the entire drill until it pierces the bone, and the patient feels it because wind comes out if he holds his hand over his nose;
and then restore the place with dry medicines, as I have taught you, and when the flesh grows and the place hardens, the matter goes to the nose; thus it is a lighter thing for the patient.
When the eyes are fully open, and there is no disturbance to the nose, nor any lessening, then you must bind the patient;
then you cure him, then place leeches or cupping glasses without hurting him to draw out fluid, then apply to the eye a poultice made of acacia, aloe, frankincense, and sarcocoll; and then press the eye, and apply a plaster over it with bandages and strips of cloth;
and the way of the strips is that you take soft enough strips, and double each in four, and then place one over the other according to the amount the eye needs;
then press it firmly over a hard bandage, and renew the cupping glasses to draw out fluid without hurting;
then remove the cupping glasses and leave the eye pressed for day and night, and if the poultice softens, then you must press it much more;
then remove the poultice after day and night, and if you see the eye recovering, it is good;
if not; then renew the plaster, the bandages, the poultice, and the cupping glasses until it is healthy.
from the tearing of cloth or wood When disruptions occur in the woven cloth, then it bursts open, and fluid comes out from the fibers like grains of resin, and it is frightening to see;
Then, if you see it split, the work is such that you put a needle into the root of the damaged part down to the top, then put another needle where there is a double thread from the tear; and pierce it, and leave the first needle in its position;
then cut the double thread and tie a part of the cloth around, and tighten it well, then pull out the needle and put on soaked wool mixed with egg white;
and leave it until the threads break with the cloth, then treat the wound with comforting things until the injury is healed;
and sometimes the wound is held together by cloth on each side in a circle, until it is healed.
And if the eye shows great appearance, pierce it with a thin needle that goes deep into the eye, and drain the white moisture and lower the eye, and insert it immediately;
then pull it out until it is healed.
This illness, called "alcunnati," is nothing but a bump assembled in the eye, resembling a descending tear, and it is not a tear;
and the method of the work is that you make the patient sit on a prepared and straight seat, then take the head between your hands on both sides, and move it so that you see the bump come to above your eyes; then it should be fixed, and not descend and the light should be cleared, and the patient should see things as he used to;
and if it does not descend below, know that it is a tear, and if the descent of the bump is not prepared as we have said.
then make the patient sit between your hands, then take the subtle spatula and cut on the cornea a little bit along the continuation of the conjunctiva with the cornea and the crown, until the bump comes out;
and when it has come out, then instill into the eye hot water mixed with honey, or water or fenugreek boiled and honey, then be treated with another treatment until it is healed.
Of the waters of the eye We have already described the types of waters in the division, and what is necessary to pierce them; then work according to the health.
You should make the patient sit between your crossed hands, away from the light of the sun, and bind the healthy eye tightly.
Then place the paper from the eye in your left hand if the eye is left, or in your right hand if the eye is right;
Then take, in your right hand, if the eye is left, the instrument called "almagda," or in your left hand, if the eye is right;
Then place the point of the instrument next to the crown, by the thickness of a finger, in that white part of the eye near the lower eyelid, then firmly apply the instrument called "almagda," and turn your hand so it pierces the white part of the eye, and feel that the almagda reaches the hollow.
And the measurement of the almagda's path should be to the depth of the space between the pupil and the end of the dark part; And that is the crown of the eye;
You will see the bone in that membrane due to the clarity of the cornea, and then place the instrument to where the point is, then press it along one path after another.
If the point descends now, the patient will see in front of him and the instrument in his eye.
After a short rest, if the point rises the second path, apply force with the instrument, and when it is firmly fixed and it does not rise, gently extract the almagda by rotating your hand little by little;
and then put a little bit of gemstone into the point, and lift from the eye inside. Then place over the eye bandages or wool soaked in rose oil and a mixture of egg, and bind with the healthy eye.
We, and those of our time, place a bandage with a mixture of egg upon it.
And if the almagda cannot enter the eye due to its hardness, because there are some people with overly hard eyes, then you must take the instrument called "alberit", of which this is the shape:
And then pierce only the conjunctiva, and do not go too deep, but make a small opening, then put the almagda in, as we have said;
and upon completion of the work, prepare for the patient a comfortable bed, in which he sleeps on his back in a dark place;
and be prevented from any movement, and let him eat light foods, and do not move his head either to the right or to the left, and let him be bound according to his condition until the third day;
then release him in the same dark room, and test his vision, and make him see some things, and then put the bandage back on him until the seventh day;
and you must not do this during the hour of treatment or immediately after the incision, but you must delay this, because the inflammation rises quickly.
if a hot abscess comes, that you should remove the bandage before the seventh day, and apply that which relieves the abscess;
and when it has calmed down, then remove the bandage from the eye and place a compress over his face for a few days, and let him remain in that dark room.
And then gradually leave the room, and return to his normal activities;
and know that no student should interfere in this case. And a man from the Yrach came to us, who told us that in his country people made an almagda, which one sucks the water from, but nevertheless I have never seen one in our land, nor have I ever read about it in the books of the ancients; and perhaps it is a new thing.
And these are the appearances of the shapes of the almagda, so that those who do not know them may see them;
and are properly of bronze: And their heads are of this same fineness, and the rear ends in three sharp angles.
Sometimes various additional fleshy growths appear on the nose, some of which resemble scorpions with many legs;
and some have flesh embedded of a dark color, and some soft flesh of a good color. In that one of these fleshy growths which is soft, and not embedded, you must make the patient sit between your hands facing the sun;
In that one of these fleshy growths which is soft, and not embedded, you must make the patient sit between your hands facing the sun; and open his nostrils, and apply the lancet to those growths, and draw them out; then cut what you can hold onto with a fine, sharp spatula on one side, until you know that all the flesh is removed.
And if any part remains that cannot be cut, you must scrape it with all of the fine instruments lightly, so that nothing remains; and if it resists you, or the abscess is hardened, then treat it as appropriate;
and if it's a malignant abscess, hurry and cauterize it until the blood is stopped and all the flesh is removed, then apply vinegar and water to it. If the vinegar works, and moisture comes out to the palate, know that it is healed;
and if the moisture does not come out as it should, know that there is new flesh growing on the bone above, which the instruments cannot cut away:
Then you must put in a fairly thick linen thread, and tie it tightly, with a space of one or less between each knot; and have the patient hold the end of the thread in his/her nose as powerfully as possible, and pull it, while sniffing, until it comes out through the nose into the mouth;
and many times children do this at school, and it is an easy thing for whoever wants to do it;
then hold the end that comes out of the nose in one hand, and the other end that comes out of the mouth in the other hand, and pull one after the other, while holding the knots of the thread.
Do this until you know that the knots have damaged that flesh, then pull out the thread, wipe away the blood, and soak the thread in Egyptian ointment, and put it back in the nose as before;
Do this for three days or more, until the ointment corrodes all that remains of the flesh;
and then place a lead chain in the nose for several days until it is healed, and if it needs drying medicines, use them;
and this is the form of the instrument for purging the head, with which oils and medicines are distilled into the nose:
And it should be of silver or brass, resembling an open lamp, like a small pipe, and the conduit also;
and if you wish, make a closed pipe, and let the instrument be full to purge the head;
and let it have a handle on the head to hold it when heating the oil or any liquid.
from the skin on the nose
Many times a disease called "telul" arises at the head of the nose, and grows and becomes large often, so much so that it is a visible thing to look at;
and therefore, you must cut it at the beginning, and remove all of it forcefully, then put the cautery or burning medicine on the spot.
and if one delays cutting it until it is large, be wary if it is hard, of a dark color, and of poor sense.
If it is not touched with iron, for it is an entrenched abscess, for when it is cut sometimes, great harm comes to the sick person.
And if the abscess is soft to the touch, not dark in color, and you see that it can be completely cut out, empty the patient and cut it out without fear, and treat the area with dry and astringent things.
Know that when solutions of continuity occur in one of these cartilage works, it profits little, except in some men.
It is necessary, then, when this happens to someone, to see if the wound is fresh and fully of blood; and then join the two lips with a stitch, then treat it until it is healed;
and if the lips are already separated on one side and the other, you must cauterize all the parts of their edges until they bleed, then join the two lips with a stitch, and hold it together, and sprinkle on powder of dragon's blood and powdered incense; and place a piece of strong plaster or another binding plaster over the powders, and leave it until it falls off by itself, then treat it with ointment until it is healed.
The method of the stitching is that you assemble the solution: or with needles, as we have said in the stitching of the belly; or with thread, as I have shown you.
of abscesses of the lips
Hard abscesses occur in the lips of men, resembling grains of millet, and smaller and larger;
Then you should turn the lips, and cut on each side, and take them with tweezers and cut them in each part;
then fill the place after the incision with powdered vitriol, until the blood is stopped;
and then cover it with a bandage, and treat the place with dry things until it is healed.
Many times extra flesh grows on the gums, which the ancients call "albulus";
If so, you must grasp it with tongs, cut it at its root, and let the pus or blood run;
then put powdered vitriol, or other astringent and drying powders, on the place;
and if that flesh returns after the incision, and this happens many times, cut it a second time, and cauterize it: if it does not return after the cautery;
Sometimes there are sores gathered at the head of the teeth, inside the mouth between the gums, which are ugly and rough; and sometimes the teeth are black and yellow and worm-eaten, so that the corruption reaches the gums, and the teeth are foul-smelling;
So you must make the patient sit between your hands, and their head is in your grasp, and remove the teeth or sores that appear, until nothing remains. and thus do for the blackness and the greenness, and the yellowness and the other spots, until they are cleansed;
and if you remove what is there on the first attempt, it is good; if not, then repeat on the second and third day until you have removed everything.
and know that teeth require various tools for removal, according to what the craftsman demonstrates, because the scrapers used to scrape off teeth have different shapes from those used to scrape between teeth. and these shapes and others be prepared with you.
When treating a toothache, you should delay pulling it out as much as possible, for one should never do that. For it is a very high matter until one has no excuse for scraping.
Then, when the patient is compelled to remove it, you must be certain of the aching tooth. Many times the pain deceives the patient, and they think it's in the healthy tooth, and have the good tooth pulled out. And nevertheless, the pain does not depart because of that, until the bad tooth is extracted, for we have already wanted to do this to those nobles.
And when you are quite certain of the aching tooth, you must scorch around the tooth completely.  Apply strong cauterization to protect the gum from all sides.
Then move it with your fingers or with delicate pliers in small, measured movements, until it is well loosened, then firmly hold the pliers. And let the patient's head be between your knees, and hold it firmly so that it does not move.
Afterwards, extract the tooth straight without breaking it, and if it does not come out easily, take one of these instruments and gently insert it on each side, and move it as you did before.
And if the tooth is pierced and decayed, you must fill it with lint where the holes are. And if you hold it gently with pliers, so that it does not break when you hold it.
And one must work very skillfully around the gum to loosen the tooth.
And be very careful not to break it, and leave a part of it, and return to the patient greater pain from the root than the initial pain.
And be careful not to do as ignorant masters do, who through their haste and rashness sometimes break the jaw, and do not accomplish what we have described.
But sometimes cause great illness by the remaining roots, or by the broken jaw, as we have often seen.
And when the tooth is extracted, wash the area with wine, or vinegar and salt.
And if bleeding occurs, which often happens, fill the area with powdered vitriol.
And if this doesn't work, cauterize it.
The shapes of the instruments, with which one pulls the teeth first, should have long points and thick handles, so that they do not bend when you pull the tooth.
And these are the shapes: And let them have large members so that they do not bend when pulling, and let them be of well-made, strong iron, and be toothed to hold the tooth.
of the root of the teeth When the root remains when pulling, you should place moistened cotton in butter for one or two days, until the place is softened, then put the pliers called "algefri", whose head resembles the beak of a bird, there.
And let them be shaped like a file, and this is the form:
And if the roots do not come out with these pliers, you must expose the flesh all around the root, and place the instrument called "althali", that is to say, a pick, whose form is this:
And let it be strong and thick so it does not break, and if the root comes out with it, it is good.
If not, use all the instruments, whose forms will come after:
And one uses this instrument with two prongs, whose form is this: and other iron tools that are shown in the arrangement of the teeth, and this instrument that resembles large pliers, whose form is this:
And let these instruments be strong so they cannot break, and know that many instruments of teeth are. and also other instruments, which are not counted.
and the skillful master himself finds his instrument, according to what his works and the illness show him, for there are such illnesses where the ancients did not teach any instrument because of the diversity of others; and if one breaks the cart or other bones, or in which it might be, then search for the necessary instruments, as I have said, and help with the gestures, whose form is this:
And they should be thick and well-fitting to hold the bone so it does not slip away, but that it can be held and removed.
and then restore the place with appropriate medicines, and if there is rot in the bone, and it is small, then remove it with this whole instrument.
When the teeth appear not in accordance with natural body form, and the shape is ugly, and especially in young women, then you must know whether the tooth is born after the other tooth and is not in the right place, and it cannot be smoothed or filed.
Then remove it. And if it is air-filled with the tooth, then take this instrument, whose shape is like a small beak, and is made of sharp, tempered iron at the tip.
And cut it little by little over several days because of the tooth's hardness and so that you do not move the other teeth, and if it appears that it can be filed, then file it with a file of this shape.
And it is like the file with which needles are made.
And file the tooth little by little over several days gently, so that it does not move too much until it breaks.
Then smooth it with a rasp at the end, and if the tooth is too sharp and it hurts the tongue, it is necessary to file away the sharpness until it is smooth, so that it does not hurt the tongue or impair speech.
When the front teeth are loose, either from a blow or falling, and the patient cannot bite on food without them falling out, and you have treated them with binding medicines, and that is of no use;
then they must be bound with a gold thread, for silver thread turns green and rots, but gold never changes.
and let the thread be neither too thick nor too thin, according to the amount of space between the teeth;
and if you wish to straighten the teeth, take the thread and put it double between the two healthy teeth, then place the ends between the loose teeth, if there are one or more, until you have carefully reached the healthy tooth on the other side; then repeat the covering until the point where you began, and hold your hand gently and carefully, until it does not move at all;
and let your binding be at the root of the tooth so that it cannot escape.
Then cut the ends of the thread with pliers, and bring them together, and tie them between the healthy tooth, and place them so that they do not injure the tongue;
and then leave it so tight as it can remain, and if it loosens, or the thread breaks, bind it with another thread;
if it remains, and will serve thus for all its time, and this is the form of the teeth, and the figure of the alignment of the two healthy teeth, and of the two gums, as you see:
And when the tooth falls out, one resets it in its place, fresh by fresh, as we have said;
and do not meddle with it who is not wise and skillful, and sometimes one makes the shape of a tooth from cow bone, and places it in the place where the missing one is, and binds it as we have said, and it remains and serves thus for a long time.
Sometimes this ligament that comes under the tongue is natural, that one is born with it; or by accident of a healed wound;
and the work is such that you open the patient's mouth, and hold his head steady, and lift his tongue;
then cut the large nerve ligament, so that the tongue is freed from its attachment, and if there is hardness or knots, and it's from the healing of a wound, then use the hook and cut that ligament broadly;
and be careful that the incision is not too deep, due to the artery underneath;
and when you have done this, then lift the place with rose water and oil, or cold water, then put a linen tent under the tongue;
and the patient should bathe it every night, so that the place cannot heal.
And if bleeding occurs, then put powdered vitriol on the place; and if the blood resists, then cauterize it with a lentiginout cautery, which is good for this; then treat it with other remedies until it is healed,
and if you see it as a different color, or black, or hard, so that the patient does not feel it, then do not touch it, for it is a sore;
and if it is tending to ulceration, and there is moisture, then one should place a lancet, and cut it with a sharp lancet, and remove it from one side and the other; and if the blood resists your work, then apply powdered vitriol until it is stopped, then return to your work until you remove all the blood;
then lift the area with a cloth and a bandage, and treat it with other remedies until it is healed.
of abscesses of the throat Sometimes there are boils in the throat, which are called "godath", and they are properly called the two almonds.  And when you treat them, as we said in the division, if they are not healed, be careful:
if they are hard abscesses of small size and dusky color, do not touch them with iron.
And if it is red and the root is large, do not touch it with iron, also because of the discharge of blood; but leave it until it is ripe, and then you will lance it, or it will burst on its own;
and if it is white and pale in color, and the root is subtle, prepare the instrument to cut, but first observe if the abscess is warm and calmed.
Then make the sick person sit in front of the sun, and their head is in your care, and let them open their mouth, and let the surgeon take the tongue between his hands, and press the tongue under the entire instrument, of which this is the form;
and be of silver or thin bronze, just like a knife:
When you press the tongue with this instrument, and you see the abscess, then take the lancet and insert it into the opening, and pull it firmly upwards as much as you can;
and draw out whatever threads are present, then cut it with the instrument, of which this is the form, which resembles a knife; and nevertheless the heads are curved, and one end is sharper than the other, and are very pointed, and are made from hardened iron or steel:
And if you do not have this instrument available, then cut it with pliers, of which this is the form: And be sharp on one side and blunt on the other;
and when you have cut one of the almonds, then cut the other in the same manner, and after the incision, let the patient gargle with hot, sharp, and easy water, and if a discharge of blood occurs, let the patient gargle with water, or with cooked pomegranate rinds, or myrtle leaves, and similar things, until the blood is stopped; then treat it until it is healed;
and sometimes other abscesses form in the throat besides the two almonds, then cut them in the same way as the two almonds equally.
And I treated a woman for an abscess that had formed within her throat, namely a small abscess;
and it had almost completely closed off her throat, so that the woman could not breathe because the passage was blocked, and could neither eat nor drink, and would have died if she had remained like that for a day or two.
And the abscess had grown so large that it had pushed two ribs through the two nostrils.
I then quickly inserted a knife into one, then pulled it out, and extracted a large portion of pus;
then I did the same in the other nostril, and opened her mouth and pressed on her tongue;
after inserting the knife into the abscess, and cut off a portion, and only a little blood came out; and thus the passage to the woman's throat was cleared, and she began to drink water and then wine, and I did not cease to cut away from that abscess for a long time;
and the abscess would grow again, and fill the space I had emptied, until it became very large;
then I incised it and cauterized it within the throat: thus it remained without growing;
and I departed from those parts, and know not what God did to her after me.
of the eye
When phlegm descends to the eye, and it is swollen and long, it is called "perpendicular";
and if it is under large and round, it is called "eye".
When it is treated as we have said in the division, and the treatment is of no use, and you see that the hot abscess has calmed, and it is subtle, then you should cut it.
and the one that is round assembled and is not long; and it is sanguine or of dusky colour or black, then you should avoid cutting it. For there is great danger upon the sick person.
Therefore, when you see it, according to the manner I have said, of its whiteness and its length, you should make the sick person sit facing the sun, and press the tongue with the instrument of which we have made mention before; then insert the hook into the eye, and pull it out, and cut it with one of the two instruments that I have mentioned in the incision of the two almonds.
And you should only cut away the excess that is beyond the natural limit;
for if you cut more, you injure the voice and speech;
and after the incision, use what we have said in the incision of the two almonds, and treat it until it is healed.
And if the patient is afraid of cutting, you should use a device for cauterization of the sense of fear.
And the manner of the cautery is sharp, sharp. And the patient should place their head in your safety, then press the tongue with the instrument we have mentioned in the chapter on cautery, and cauterize with sharp, hot cautery, such that it is neither too thick nor too clear; and fill the end of this instrument, of which this is the form:
And have at the head a hollow or place where medicine is put, like the bowl of a spoon, and put the instrument with all the medicine on the sore;
and let the patient lie on their side, so that the saliva and phlegm run from their mouth into the medicine inside, so that it does not go down into the throat, and touch the sore;
then hold your hand to all the medicine and press it on the sore, for the amount of half an hour, until you see it healed and the burning of the medicine is calmed;
and if you wish, take cotton and wrap it around any instrument, and wet the cotton in the medicine, and place the instrument with all the cotton on the wound, until the cotton dries on the sore;
and do this often, until the cauterization is perfect, then leave it to dry, and it falls off after four or five days.
And if you need to reapply the cauterization of the medicine, reapply it, and after the cauterization, wipe around the sore with cotton dipped in butter, and cleanse what is around the medicine;
and it should be rinsed with cold water, and be treated with gargles until it is healed.
This treatment is safer than incision, not the cauterization;
if it is treated with fumigation in this manner, take calamint and ysop and origanum and rue and chamomile and avronne and similar herbs, and mix them all or some of them in a pot, and add water, and boil;
and the pot should be well sealed with strong earth, and inside the pot there should be an instrument shaped in this manner: And it should be of silver or bronze, and one of its ends should be placed in the patient's mouth so that the vapor rises to the eye through the channel, until the eye is deadened;
after which, repeat often, until the eye dries, and take care not to do this at the beginning of a hot abscess, for many things may happen; and do not do this heating except at the decline of a hot abscess.
And if this instrument is not present, take a channel and put inside the tip a piece of egg white, so that the mouth of the patient is not too hot; For egg white does not allow the vapor to burn the mouth, and it is a good and safe cure overall.
Many times a bone or fish spine, or some other object, lodges in the throat;
Therefore, you should pull out what you can see, and press the tongue to the sun with the entire instrument, so that you can see the object move;
And what you cannot see and is lodged in the throat, you must make the patient vomit before the food is cooked in the stomach; Perhaps the lodged object will come out through vomiting;
or if the patient swallows a piece of sponge, or a piece of navel, or a lettuce root, or a piece of dry bread; and ties a thread to the sponge, and then swallows it; and when it reaches the place, it will adhere, and then you will pull it out;
and if it does not come out with what we have said, then take an instrument of lead according to this form:
And let the instrument be curved at the head so that it can enter the throat more easily, and have the head raised high; and be careful not to touch the epiglottis, lest the whole thing come off, nor to push the bone inside;
and it is better that the patient pushes the instrument, so that it may be known where the thing is stuck; if it pushes down, or if he pulls it out with the whole instrument equally, until it is out.
of the leech of the throat
Sometimes the leech is treated, as I have said in the division, by the cure of medicines; and when this does not work at all, then look into the throat of the sick person in the sun, then that you press his tongue with the instrument that I told you.
And if you see the leech, then pull it out with a very small hook, or with subtle pliers that are suitable for this.
And if this is not enough, take a thin, fine chain, and put it into the sick person's throat, then put a hot iron at the end of the chain, and do this repeatedly. And if the sick person is feverish every day.
then take a full glass of cold water, and open the mouth, and pour it in without swallowing, and move it with his hand often; and as soon as the leech feels the water, it falls off.
And if it does not fall off as we have said, then fumigate the sick person with asafoetida, with the instrument that I have described in the fumigation of the eye;
Do this many times, for it will fall off without delay.
And the method of fumigation is that you take a pot in which there are glowing embers, and the bottom is covered with a perforated cover, and the tip of the instrument is in that hole;
Then pour your fumigation in, and the sick person puts the head of the tube in his mouth, and closes the mouth, so that the smoke does not escape, but goes down to the leech;
And the leech will now fall off, and if it does not fall off, then restart the fumigation many times;
and let the sick person suffer thirst, and eat salty and dry things, and drink no water;
and then it will be necessary for it to depart by this method.
And the shape of the instrument with which one pulls the leech, is, when one can see it, like bent pliers to get into the throat; and it resembles the beak of a bird of prey, and has a rough surface like a file, so that what it takes, it cannot let go;
Many kinds of abscesses are there, according to what the memory brings here after from one and another in this book, and they vary in perforation and incision;
and it is in two ways, one of which is in its own appearance, and of what it holds moist.
And the second manner is for the places where they are in the body.
For the abscesses of the head are different from those of the foundation, and the abscesses of the fleshy places are different from those that come in joints, and each has its own judgment in the work.
And there are abscesses that one should not pierce until the swelling is ripe according to its completion;
and there are some that must be pierced when they are grown, and do not ripen according to their completion, like abscesses that are next to joints.
For when an abscess comes next to a joint, and one leaves it until it is rotten around, perhaps the ligaments and nerves of the joint are corrupted, which is the cause of contraction in that limb.
Where the abscess is next to the principal limb, and if you delay the perforation until it is ripe, it will harm the principal limb;
or if it is next to the foundation, one pierces it sooner than it is ripe;
and you should not pierce a ripe abscess without complete digestion, except for one next to the foundation, lest it rot deeply, become elongated within, and become a fistula; and be unable to heal in a long time.
And you must know the time for puncturing a ripe abscess according to completion, and that is when the pain is relieved, and the fever subsides, and the lessening of pain and redness, and the decrease of the abscess's swelling and sharpness, and the other signs;
and you must make the puncture where the abscess is most dependent and where it appears to move;
and let the puncture be along the body, and if the abscess is on the hands or feet, or in joints and nerves and arteries, and in all places equally where there is no membrane. In those that fold, according to that limb.
And when the abscess is in a fleshy place, it is better that you leave the puncture until it is confirmed in complete digestion, as we have said.
For if you pierce it before that, the body of the venom will be spread, and it is full of much filth. and perhaps it hardens the lips and the depth of it.
And if any abscess is pierced according to the breadth of the body, according to what the limb needs.
And it is necessary that you apply small abscesses, small punctures; and in large abscesses, large punctures, and many slits according to the appearance of the size of the abscess;
and if there are such abscesses where it is necessary to pierce the core and to cut; when it has become as though a banner, and is dormant, then it is necessary to do as is done to boils:
and if there are some that are split into three angles, and if there are some that are cut like the myrtle leaf, like abscesses of the groin;
and if there are some where a round incision is made, and other incisions and similar cuts.
Those that have no head, like a superficial soft abscess, it is necessary for you to pierce them fully;
and it is necessary when the abscess is large, and it has collected a large amount of pus, and you pierce it, you should not remove all the pus at that time, but remove a portion; then seal the abscess until the next day, then remove some more pus again; do this many times, gradually, until all the pus comes out;
especially if the patient is of weak constitution, or a pregnant woman, or young children, or old decrepit men. For the spirit sometimes trembles with the discharge of pus, so that the patient might perhaps die, and you don't realize it.
Therefore, approach this chapter with great caution, and when you have pierced your abscess, then dry the wound, and examine if the wound from the abscess is small; and if it is a wide opening, then apply linen or old cotton; and if it is a large abscess, and there are many openings, then you must place a tent in each one so that they meet each other;
and if you have cut a part of the skin in the abscess, and you have sewn it around, then you must fill it with old cotton or flax rags without moisture, and bind it until the third day;
then remove it, and treat it with ointment until it is healed.
And if blood flows during your work, then apply cold water and ease, and moisten a cloth, and apply it repeatedly to the flowing area.
And if the blood flow persists, then apply treatment and remedies, and the powders that I have mentioned in the appropriate places in this book, and if it is during winter, and the area where the abscess is is very sensitive, then you must apply tents and cloths moistened in wine and hot oil;
and if it is in summer, and the area is fleshy, then you must apply cloths moistened in water and oil, or in wine and cold oil, until the third day, as we have said;
and then drain the abscess, dry it, and treat it as necessary until it is healed.
And this is necessary to know universally in treating abscesses:
I have told you how one should proceed with the treatment of abscesses, and see here the chapter.
Where the head's veins form small abscesses, and there are various types that are like webs, as the lining of a hen's egg, and many similar ones.
Some are fatty and some have moisture like pus;
and some are hard and stony when cut, and there is no doubt that the vein does not oppose.
And the work of cutting is that you try all the instrument called "entromissoire", from which the shape comes next, what it contains.
For if it contains moisture, cut it through the length.
And when the moisture is emptied, scrape it without leaving the skin containing that moisture, for it returns often when you leave anything.
Then dip cotton in Egyptian ointment, if it is present; if not, in water and salt, and fill the wound, and leave it until the next day; and that which remained from the night will run away.
And then repeat the cotton, as before, on the second day, and the third, until you know well that it does not remain overnight;
then treat the wound with ointment suitable for it, until it is healed.
And if the abscess contains thick fat, then cut it along this shape, lengthwise; and apply your lancets, and scrape it from all sides, and put all your treatment into drawing out the matter where it lies;
and if the artery opposes you, then do what I have told you after.
And likewise do with the abscess if it is stony, and in cutting and curing it as I have told you.
And the cutting on a stony and moist abscess is easier, because they are of little blood. And if any of these abscesses are in the head where there is no moisture, and these were the abscesses that I cut in the head of an old woman;
and I found the abscess like a hard, rough, white stone, and could not break it; and if one had struck any of them, one would have made a wound just as with a stone.
In other abscesses coming to the head, except for those that come to the heads of children and the roots of the ears, the opening should always be in the most dependent place, to cause the pus to come out;
and treat them as is appropriate.
Many times these abscesses appear on the neck, and under the armpits, and in the groin, and sometimes come to other parts of the body, and are numerous, and are intertwined with one another.
And each scrofulous boil is properly within its own cavity, just like the boil and abscess of the head, as we have said; And the appearances of these scrofulas are many.
And the appearances of these scrofulas are many. There are some that contain moisture, and there are malignant ones that do not wish to obey health.
In those, then, that you see to be of good disposition upon touch, and are similar in color to the body, and are soft on all sides, and are not adhered to the neck's nerves, or to the artery or duct, and are not deep;
If so, you must cut it from above, and scrape it from every part, and extend the two lips of the sore to the prongs, if you need to, as we have said regarding abscesses of the head;
and drain it little by little, and be sure you do not cut the nerve or vein, and let the instrument not be sharp or cutting, so that the hand does not slip, and do not go too far, so that you do not cut what you should not.
And if you cut the vein or artery, and this prevents you from working, then put vitriol powder or other powders that stop blood, and compress the wound; and leave it until the abscess is calmed, and the wound is softened, and starts to fester.
And when the blood is stopped, then return to your work, until you complete it;
Then look with your index finger if any small sores remain, and cut and clean them.
And if there is a large vein at the root of the sore, you should not cut the sore at its root, but tie it with a strong doubled thread, and let it fall off, without harm;
Then fill the wound with old cotton dipped in Egyptian ointment, then treat it.
And if you cut the entire sore, you must bring together the two edges of the wound, and stitch them now, since there is no excess remaining due to the size of the sore. You must then attend to cutting the root of it, and pulling it out, and stitch it as we have said.
You must then attend to cutting the root of it, and pulling it out, and stitch it as we have said. Those sores that have excess, pierce there where it appears ripe;
and pierce it thus as the one previously mentioned, hanging it, then apply bandages with ointment and similar things, so that it corrupts what remains of the corruption; and when the wound is well cleansed, treat it with ointment causing flesh to grow, until it is healed.
The ancients said and spoke of the sore throat; but I never saw anyone in our land who performed it, and that is the record of their words.
For those with quinsy, it is necessary that the slit in the throat, called "epiglottis," be relieved; and one should not provide assistance for this, because all the veins and the inner organs of the ill person are affected by those who have a hot abscess in the mouth, or in the throat, or in the tonsils.
When the disease is in the channel of the lung, it is necessary to cut the epiglottis to avoid the death that comes from strangulation.
Therefore, when we want to cut the epiglottis, we should cut it below three or four circles, a small slit across, between the two circles or by the quantity of the slit on the surface, not in the cartilage;
and that place is suitable for the cutting of the epiglottis because there is no flesh there, and the vessels are far apart.
And if the master is afraid, he must stretch the skin of the throat along the entire inside, then cut through it until he reaches the channel; and drain the blood vessels, if you see anything, and then cut the surface, as we have said;
and it is demonstrated by the cutting of the phlegm from the channel that leaps out through the broken place, and by the loss of voice;
and leave the wound open for a while.
And when the time has passed during which strangulation is feared, bring together the two edges of the wound in the heart, and sew it together completely without the cartilage;
then administer medicines that cause flesh to grow until it is healed.
Albucasim says that one should not do this until the throat is completely obstructed, and the patient is judged to be dying, and breathing is failing. Then, the epiglottis is cut so that the patient cannot breathe, and he breathes through the wound, and thus is saved from death;
and for this reason, the ancients advised leaving the wound open until the malice of the illness is passed, and it passes in three or four days. And then they ordered the wound to be sewn up and healed, until it was healed;
and I will tell you what I saw. I saw a damsel take a knife and plunge it into her throat, and cut part of the channels of the windpipe;
and I was called to treat her, and I found her as if dead.
I uncovered the wound, and found the blood that had issued from it, and perceived clearly that she had not cut a vein or artery except the throat, and the wind was issuing forth through the wound.
I hastened and sewed up the wound, and treated it until it was healed;
and the damsel suffered no more than a sore throat, and later returned to her condition;
Therefore, I say that in the incision of the epiglottis there should be no fear.
This abscess is called "throat hernia," and is a large abscess the color of a jaundice, and is common in women;
and it is in two ways: natural, and accidental;
where the natural has no artifice.
And the accidental is in two ways, of which one is similar to fat in us, and the other kind is similar to an abscess that comes from us from an artery; and if there is fear, and it is not fitting to work forcefully except in the one that is small, and test and search through all the intermediary: If you find it like a piece of fat, and it is not attached to any vein, cut it, as one cuts off a piece of fat, and pull it out with all its covering, if there is any. and thoroughly investigate everything, and treat it as necessary, until it is completely healed.
Many types of fat there are, of which I will describe all the kinds;
and it is necessary that I describe all the difference between fat and issue.
I say that issue is heat and fever-inducing, as long as the boiling has passed and the putrefaction is complete; Then the fever and heat subside.
With fat, there is neither heat nor fever nor pain, and it contains its own sac, and is according to the colour of the body, and begins like a blister, and grows large;
and they are according to two appearances, either fat or moist, and many colours are as I have said in the division.
It is necessary, when you come to the treatment of fat, that you first examine and inquire into it using all the instruments called "entromissoire", according to what their forms will be in the following chapter.
And the manner of inquiring into abscesses of fat is that you take the moistest place you find in the abscess, and turn your fingers little by little, until you know that the instrument has pierced the core, then according to the size of the abscess;
Then remove the instrument, and be careful of what jumps out.
If moisture runs quickly, of whatever color it may be, you pierce it as I have said of other abscesses;
And if, after the instrument, no moisture comes, know that it is fatty, so pierce it then in a cross, and take it with forceps, and lightly scrape it from each side, and guard the skin where it lies so that you draw it out healthy with the fat;
And if you cannot pull it out healthy, pull it out in pieces so that nothing remains.
For if anything remains, the pus will return many times.
And if a little remains, and the blood bothers you, fill the wound with some sharp corrosive powders, and restrain the wound, and put upon it soothing things for a hot abscess, and cure it with other cures until it is healed;
And if the pus is large, cut the two edges of the wound, and cure it with those that generate flesh.
And if the throbbing vein is contrary or otherwise, hurry and fill the place with crushed vitriol, and leave it for two or three days, so that the wound rots, and the blood's boiling subsides. Then return to the cautery what has remained of the night.
See here the forms of the intrumental instruments, and they are of three types: large and medium and small;
and there are three squares called "albaret", and one called "breb", and there are three types of them: large, medium, and small, for searching out the abscesses of fistulas;
and are also like the needles with which one sews bandages, and are of yellow bronze, or of iron, or of silver, and those that are yellow are more valuable, and are more tested with black lead for searching out the cavities of fistulas;
and are of three types: large, medium, and small, according to the quantity of the width of the openings.
The shapes of the probes are of many appearances, as you see here:
and there are probes that have two curves of three types as well;
and there are probes that have three curves, and are also of three types;
and there are probes that have two curves, and probes of one curve only, and are of three types;
and all of these are necessary in their place.
The head of these, which one cuts, is sharp, and some of them only cut from one side, so as not to cut the vein or the nerve;
and of these instruments are the lancets fitted into handles, so that the patient does not feel it when opening abscesses;
and are of three types: large, small, and medium, as you see;
and one only uses them in fleshy areas, such as legs, arms, breasts, and armpits, and similar places;
and sometimes one makes another small instrument, resembling a piece of pumice, according to this shape, with which one stops blood: and one places it sometimes at the place where a vein or artery has been cut, and sometimes according to this large shape:
Sometimes the breasts of some men swell when they begin to deteriorate, so that they appear like women's breasts;
and they remain ugly and swollen, and whoever wishes to cure them, must proceed according to this shape from this line .b. to .g.: then scrape off the fat, and fill the wound with a healing, flesh-forming medicine, then bring together the two edges of the wound with stitches, and treat it until it is healed;
and if the breast hangs down, and is softened because of its size, as happens with women, then slice it into two parts on either side, with two similar incisions; so that one remains attached to the other at the end of both, such that the larger line contains the smaller one according to this shape, from this line .b. up to line .g.; then scrape off the skin between the two edges, and remove the fat, and apply what we have said about stitches and powders, and whatever is necessary in the treatment, until they are healed;
and if it is not healed, or the incision is not completely made, because the patient does not want to rest, or due to the flow of blood, then you must fill the wound with cotton soaked in a corrosive ointment; and leave it until it consumes the remaining flesh and fat, then treat it until it is healed.
These abscesses that arise under the armpits are a kind of hard scrofulous swelling, or some contain moisture.
Those that contain moisture must be cut according to this shape, from line .b. to line .g.: And when all the pus in the abscess is drained, fill the wound with old cotton, and leave it until the next day, then remove all the cotton, and treat with an appropriate ointment until it is healed.
And if the abscess is of the nature of scrofulous swellings, cut it as we have said in the case of scrofulous swellings, and if the wound re-forms pus, administer cautery as we have said before.
When the artery is ruptured, and the skin above is stitched, abscesses often result, and the same happens to a swollen vein and abscess.
and if one recognizes it as being due to the artery, the abscess is long and deep. and when you feel it with your fingers, you feel a tightening.
and when it is due to the vein, red spots are apparent.
and it is foolish to cut this abscess, especially when it is under the armpits and in the groin and neck and in many other places, and is very large. Therefore, it is necessary to avoid iron treatment, and also the one that is at the top, and in that which is an arterial swelling, one should cut through the skin along it.
then make the incision with the lancets, and carefully separate the artery from the tissues, until it is exposed.
then place a needle underneath it, and pierce it to the other side, and tighten the artery with a double thread in two places, according to what I taught you in the extraction of the two arteries which are in the temples.
then puncture the area between the two ligatures with a probe until the blood within it flows out, and the abscess is relieved.
then apply the treatment that engenders a swelling, until the ligature falls off. then treat it with the appropriate ointment, until it is healed.
and if the abscess is due to the incision of a vein, you must grasp the portion of the abscess on the entire skin, then insert the needle below the area you are holding, pierce it, and use a double thread to pull it out from the other side. then tie the abscess, as I have told you, or tie the thread on one of the two sides of the two ends of the thread.
and if you doubt that the thread will not come out, then reinsert another needle all the way through the thread, beneath the entire abscess, at the incision of the first needle, and tie the threads in four places.
then cut the abscess until the excess comes out, then cut the excess from the core and leave what is bound.
then place a damp cloth in wine and oil, then administer treatments of poultices and ointments until it is healed.
Just as abscesses occur in the arteries and veins, abscesses occur in the nerves when they are injured, or through excessive labor, and similar things.
And this happens more often in the shoulders and arms and in all places where there are joints, and it is a grievous abscess, and its color resembles the color of the body, and is in various conditions without pain;
and when it is squeezed tightly, the patient feels pain, and it is not deep within the body, but beneath the skin;
and moves well in all directions, and does not go forward or backward, or under or over, and the one that is in the joints should not be cut with an iron. perhaps contraction would ensue; and the one that is on the head or forehead, cuts the skin with a spatula.
and the one that is on the head or forehead, cuts the skin with a spatula. If the abscess is small, hold it with pliers and cut it at its root;
and if it is large, suspend it with a hook, and scrape it, then remove it and stitch the wound together, and treat it until it is healed.
Sometimes it happens in the belly and nowhere else, a disease called "fungus" due to its resemblance to mushrooms, and its root is subtle, and its head large;
and there are small and very large ones;
and I saw a man who had two in his belly that were more like mushrooms than anything else, and there was no difference, and they were white, and had fine roots, and were often split open, and moisture often flowed from them.
I cut them open and found eighteen ounces in one, and six in the other, and the work in the incision is such that you look to see if the patient is moist, and the color of the thing is white and moist and with subtle roots; if it is cut with a wide spatula, and the cautery iron is in your presence.
if it is cut with a wide spatula, and the cautery iron is in your presence. For in the process of cutting, there often comes too much blood flow, and if the blood overwhelms you, then quickly cauterize;
and if you see the patient frightened and afraid of the incision of the iron, then take a well-made lead thread and tie the thing to it as we have said, and leave it for two days;
and then restrain it, and do not cease to tighten the lead thread until it cuts the thing and it breaks away without effort;
and if the roots are thick, there is fear in cutting, even for the belly, but you may well cut the half of it, then cauterize it so that it doesn't return;
then treat the wound, and be careful not to cut the membrane which is of a foul color and of poor sense and milky appearance.
For it is a festering abscess, and I will come to the treatment of chancres afterward.
when the boil is fully If the boil appears from a wound or a cut, and is on the belly and some boils come out, as happens in other ruptures, or from blood flowing from veins or arteries as previously described, or from wind;
and if it is from the rupture of the skin and the emergence of the boil, then the color of the abscess resembles the color of the body, and it is a light thing without pain, and has a variety of exits. And if it is because of the intestines, then it is more diverse, and when one presses it with their fingers it swells, and then returns, and perhaps it is sealed, and grows greatly at the entrance of the bath and from hard labor.
And if it is due to moisture, it is a light thing, and appears clearly when you press it with your hand, and does not constrain at all;
and if it is due to blood, then the abscess appears large and hard, and is fixed according to a quantity; and if it is due to wind, it is soft to the touch, and the work is that you observe if the appearance is due to the blood of the artery, or the vein, or wind.
and if it is due to wind, it is soft to the touch, and the work is that you observe if the appearance is due to the blood of the artery, or the vein, or wind. Then you must leave the treatment. For there is doubt and fear, as I told you in the chapter on abscesses, due to the artery and the vein.
And if the appearance is due to the intestine or the bowels, you must instruct the patient to hold their breath, and lie flat, then make incisions around the wound; then instruct him to lie often between your hands, then go around the area you have incised with a spatula, then extend half the abscess above the entire large incision; then tie it around with a strong thread, or a strong silk cord firmly, and let the wound be bound;
then open the half of the abscess extended above the bandage, and put your index finger in it, and search for the intestine; if you find it caught by the bandage, then untie it, and put the intestine outside the belly;
and if you find the bowel, then take it with the incision, and cut off the excess;
and if the artery or vein resists you, then go around carefully, then return to your work and take two needles, and put two strong threads in them, and put the two needles around what you have done in a cross shape so that you pierce it;
then tighten the abscess in four places over the needles, and if you wish, remove the needles, and leave the area until it rots, and the dead flesh will fall away by itself; or you cut it when it is softened and rotten, then treat it as necessary, and close the abscess as we have said;
or you cut it when it is softened and rotten, then treat it as necessary, and close the abscess as we have said; and remove the blood or moisture that you find, then treat the area as necessary, and suture the area.
about/concerning a sore/ulcer We have discussed the varieties of sores, and how one should treat them with medicine, and how one should avoid the use of iron in treatment;
and we say that a sore grows in the flesh, and there is great caution in its treatment, and the ancients said that when a sore is in a place where it can be scraped off, like a sore on the nipples and in the thigh and similar places, one should remove it entirely when it is in its early stages;
No one has ever healed one before me.
And the treatment, when it is in a place where it can be removed, as we have said, is that you purge the patient of black bile sometimes;
then you make him bleed if he has a noticeable fullness, then prepare the patient a good place to perform the treatment;
then throw your ointments or chancre, and the hair from all sides, and remove it from all sides, leaving nothing behind;
and let the blood flow freely, and press the area well with your hand or something else, and if the bleeding makes it difficult to stop the incision of the artery or vein, cauterize it until the blood is stopped; then treat it with another cure until it is healed.
of dropsy We have already discussed the various forms of dropsy, how the accumulation of water occurs, the symptoms of each form, and the treatment using both medicines and iron:
and one should not use iron in these two forms: that is to say, tympanites and hypostatic dropsy, for they are fatal things;
Therefore, when you treat this form of dropsy called "sunstroke" with medicine, and the treatment is not effective, observe if the patient is weak, or if they have another illness besides dropsy, such as diarrhea or similar conditions; if you do not use iron, for there is doubt;
and if you see a patient of strong constitution, and they have no other illness than dropsy alone, and they are neither too young nor too old, you should then operate as follows: lift the patient straight onto your hands, and apply pressure to their belly by pushing the water to the lowest part of the chest, then take the pointed spatula according to this shape: And it should be sharp on two sides. pointed, and yet not so sharp that it can reach the intestine when inserted and injure it;
then see if the dropsy is concentrated towards the intestines: if so, you must cut above the hump three inches straight below the handle; and if the dropsy is due to liver disease, your cut should be to the left of the hump three inches;
and if it is due to the spleen, it should be to the right, and the patient should not lie on the incision so that the superfluities do not flow to that weak spot;
then pierce all the skin with the instrument, and thrust it in, and lift your hand across the whole space between the skin and the surface, just like in skinning to the extent of a fingernail or a bit more;
then pierce the surface until the space comes to the empty place, and that is the place of the water, then draw it out, and put this instrument into it, whose shape is this: And it resembles a thin silver chain, and is of bronze or light iron, and has a small hole at the bottom part; and on the side of one part, three holes; and two on the other side, and one on the other;
and the tip is cut like a feather, and this is the shape of the incision with which the scribe cuts the feather:
at the top is the blade, so that when the instrument comes to the water, it descends immediately onto the instrument;
empty then half or a third of it, for if you empty more than is necessary at that time, perhaps the patient will die from the resolution of his spirit from the wound, or he will fall unconscious, or he approaches death;
but empty according to the quantity of its virtue, and according to what the dispositions of the patient's virtue signify, and his pulse;
then pull the instrument and retain the water, and it is now retained by the heart which stops the opening on the surface, of which I have spoken, that you pierce in this manner;
then recommence the instrument the next day, if you see the patient suffering this, and draw a small quantity of water;
do this for some days, and be careful not to overdo it so that only a little water remains.
And if you doubt about the patient, and you leave a lot of water, treat them in a grave or hot sand, and by sweating or a bath and the sun, and let them drink; and treat with drying medicines until they are healed, and cauterize on the stomach and on the liver and on the spleen after the water has been drawn out, as I have said before.
Sometimes children are born who have no opening in the penis, or the opening is small, or it is not in its proper place.
If it is necessary, immediately pierce it with a very fine needle according to this form:
then place a small lead plug in the opening, tie it, and keep it thus for three or four days. When he wants to urinate, remove the plug, let him urinate, and then replace it;
and perhaps it is not necessary, for the urine that comes to flow will not leave it closed.
Those whose opening is small should be treated with the lead plug, as we have said, and it will enlarge.
Those whose opening is not in its place are injured, for some are born with the opening at the head of the penis, so that they cannot urinate until they raise their penis. and cannot impregnate because the matter cannot reach the womb, and this is a bad illness.
And the method of treatment is that the patient lies often on their back, then extends the head of the penis and cuts it as if the size of a feather, so that the opening falls in the middle, as is appropriate;
and be careful of the bleeding that often occurs, and if it does, stop it with that which stops blood, and treat the wound until it is healed.
of the pustules of the penis Many times these sores appear on the penis, and there is an ugly appearance of flesh;
and some are malignant and some are not;
so you should take them with a fine forceps, and cut and clean them all, then put moistened cotton on an Egyptian ointment; then treat with diafinicon ointment until they are healed.
And if the sore is malignant, of foul color and smelling, you should apply cautery.
When you have cut it, and if the sore is under the skin, and a part of it is inside the skin and a part outside, you should remove the part of the sore that is inside first; and when it is closed, treat the part outside.
For when you treat it all together, the head of the penis is not secure from being pierced, and blackness and corruption come to the penis and the scrotum;
you must remove all that is black and corrupt, then apply a plaster of honey and flour made from pomegranate bark and chickpeas, and then treat it with other remedies until it is healed.
And if a discharge of blood comes, administer the lunar cautery according to this form:
The cautery aids two dispositions together: that is to say, to the discharge of blood, and to the corruption;
And if the head of the penis is corrupt and retracted, you must place a lead pipe into the penis, and the patient urinates through it;
And when the skin is burned on the head of the penis, which happens to those who have not been circumcised, or it happens due to a wound or abscess, then you must cauterize it with a sharp instrument, until the connection is severed, and the head of the penis is freed on all sides;
And if it is a severe thing to dissect this, you must cauterize a small area around the head of the penis and the skin;
Then carefully separate them, and place a thin moistened linen strip in cold water, so that it does not burn again.
Circumcision is not the severing of continuity like other wounds; However, when we perform this work of our own volition, and properly on children, it is necessary that we perform the best and most painless work.
I say that the ancients did not practice circumcision on their children, for they did not use it in their law, and we only have what we have acquired through experience.
For I have seen the greatest part of the masters and surgeons who performed circumcision using a knife, and force, and a whole new tool;
Thus the heart would flee, for there are two layers, and perhaps one above is cut while the other below remains. Or it must be cut again, and the pain is doubled, and the healing of the wound is not assured in the member's tip.
And in the healing of the nail, perhaps the iron slips, and the work is ruined, and many times they heal without further need of healing, as I have seen.
Of the healing done with force, through all the threads of the work, I have found the goodness of the experiment, for force cuts precisely both above and below.
For when you press your hand, it cuts evenly throughout the whole time. But the thread should be very tight around the skin;
And the manner of the first work is such that you make the child think, if he understands, that you are only tying the thread around the rod, and you can make him happy in all the ways you can.
Then hold him between your hands upright, and place the forces between your hands or under your feet so the child does not see them, nor any of the instruments;
Then put your hand on the rod and blow or push, and pull it up until the head of the rod is inside. Then clean it well of the dirt that has gathered, then tie the marked place with a double thread, then tie it under one knot to another tie.
Then clean it well of the dirt that has gathered, then tie the marked place with a double thread, then tie it under one knot to another tie. And hold it with your two fingers by the second tie, at the thumb and index finger, and cut between the two ties, then lift the heart quickly and pull the head of the rod. Then let the blood run drop by drop, for it is the medicine. And put powder on and on top of the powder, a thin layer of glue made from a boiled egg, diluted with rose water, mixed with good fresh rose oil, and leave it there until the next day, and treat it with other remedies until it is healed.
The form of the forces for cleansing is this:
The two blades should be sharp and the blade should also be as wide as the handle.
The error in cleansing occurs when the heart within is exposed by the incision.
Therefore, you must stretch it to your nail, lest the place become an abscess.
And cut it evenly, and if you cannot hold it to your nail, hold it with pliers, and then cut it.
And if three days pass, and that which is beneath the rod is swollen, leave it until the hot abscess is appeased, and lightly scrape it.
Cut it as you are able, and beware of the part of the rod; it will not harm it at all.
Then treat the area with powders suitable for wounds, as we have said in the treatise on powders.  And if one cuts too deeply into the heart, and it goes upward, it will not harm it.
Then cure it, as we have said, until it is healed.
Concerning the retention of urine
Urine retention is caused by obstructions of stones, or congealed blood, or pus, or dead flesh, or similar things, as we have said in the division.
And if the urine is not released, and you see that the retention is due to a stone lodged in the neck or the bladder, then the patient should be bent over their knees. And their feet should be placed on their back, and the patient should extend their abdomen away from their back, and the patient should constrict their abdomen as much as possible. And then the neck of the bladder is forced to express the stone above, so that the urine is released.
And if it does not come out, as we have said, and the patient experiences great pain, then you should administer extraction with the instrument called a "syringe," of which this is the form:
And it should be of fine, light silver, like the feather of a bird. And it should be a palm and a half long, and slender at the head.
And the method of releasing the urine is that you take a double thread, and tie a small piece of wool or cotton to the head, and put the head of the thread inside the syringe;
and cut off the excess wool and put it up to the head of the syringe, then grease the syringe with oil or butter and egg white, and make the patient sit on a seat, and lubricate the bladder and penis with moist oil and olive oil and warm water;
then gently insert the syringe into the penis, until it reaches the root of the penis, then double the penis over towards the groin;
then move the syringe forward to the bladder, and the patient feels it go down to the empty space, and this is not done according to this order only because the passage it goes through is crooked;
then pull the thread with all the little pieces of wool, and the urine follows the wool, then pull it out, and make the urine flow;
and repeat the process of the syringe until the bladder is emptied, and the patient is relieved.
When blisters or blood come into the bladder, or corruption gathers there, and you want to apply drops and medicines, do so using the entire instrument called a "clepsydra," and its form is:
It is closed, and has three holes: Two on one side, and one on the other, as you see;
and the holes through which the medicine flows should be such that they seal the shaft well without adding anything, so that one can draw out the moisture, and push in when necessary;
and when you want to pour your medicines into the bladder, place the tip of the syringe into the moisture, and draw out what is inside;
you will draw out the moisture with the syringe, and then push the rod back in forcefully; the moisture will enter, and will go to the bladder immediately, so that the patient will feel it;
and that is the form of the subtle clyster with which one clysters the bladder:
and it is of silver or of brass, and the tip is higher;
and underneath to the side where the ligament falls;
then take a sheep's bladder and put the moisture with which you wish to clyster the bladder into it, then tie it between the two breasts using a strong double thread, and warm the moisture a little over the fire;
then put the tip of the clyster into the penis, then press your hand on the bladder, letting all the moisture flow in, until the patient feels that the moisture has fully entered the bladder;
and if you do not have a bladder, then take a piece of parchment, and make a circle out of it, and pierce it round about; then put a strong thread through these holes, then assemble the circle as one assembles a disc, and put inside what you wish of oil and moisture and water, and tie it to the instrument;
and do as you did with the bladder, pressing with your hand until the moisture reaches the bladder.
of the stone
We have already discussed in the division the types of stones, and their extraction along with the medicines;
and have described the difference between stones formed in the kidneys, and all the signs, and which stones one should operate on by cutting; and in the bladder, and in the penis;
and I will tell you frankly and briefly.
I say that stones formed in the bladder happen more often to children, and this is a sign that water leaks from the bladder resembling water in its subtlety;
and it shows sand, and the patient rubs his penis, and it often hangs down, and then stiffens; and from much of this leakage the foundations weaken;
and the cure is easy in children until they are four years old, and it is very difficult in old men, and is moderate in young people, in those who are between youth and old age;
and the cure is easier for those who have large stones than for those who have small ones.
And when we come to the cure, it is necessary first to cleanse the patient with an enema, to remove all the waste that is in the intestines. For it sometimes hinders the search for the stone.
Then take the patient by the feet, and raise and move them downwards, so that the stone descends to the bottom of the bladder, and sometimes rises from its high position;
then make him sit between your hands, prepared, and his hands should be under his thighs, so that the bladder is completely inclined downwards;
then seek and touch it inside;
if you feel the stone in the space, then hurry now to cut upon the stone.
And if it does not fall out entirely when touched, then moisten your index finger with oil from your left hand, if the patient is a child, or your middle finger, if the patient is a fully grown young man; and put it in its fundament, and seek the stone, and when you feel it on your finger, then bring it to the neck of the bladder;
then press upon your finger, and put it out where you wish to cut.
And instruct the assistant to press the bladder with his hand, and instruct him to extend his right hand upwards over the nipples, and with his left hand to remove the skin beneath the nipples in the area where the cut is to be made;
then put the scalpel there, of which this is the shape: And make a cut between the nipples and the fundament, not in the middle but on the side of the left groin;
and it should be straight over the stone, and your fingers should be on the fundament, and the cut should be wider out toward the surface, and narrower inwards, according to the size of the stone, not too large;
perhaps the pressure of your finger on the fundament will cause it to jump out without difficulty;
and know that there are stones that have angles and edges: so it is difficult to remove;
and there are some that are smooth, like a ball, and round, from which removal is easy.
For those with angles and edges, make the incision larger;
and if it doesn't yield, you must use pliers which are like a file at the tip, to press and remove the stone so that it doesn't slip away; or you place under it a subtle, curved instrument at the tip;
and if you cannot extract it thus, widen the hole slightly, and if the blood flows, constrict it with vitriol;
and if there is more than one stone, first place the largest one in the bladder's neck, then cut above it, then pull it out forcefully, and the smaller ones afterwards if there are more.
And if it is very large, it must be softened, and a larger incision made. Because two things happen to the patient: either he dies, or his urine constantly comes out through the opening because the wound cannot close;
but nevertheless, try to pull it out, or to break it with pliers, until you pull it out in pieces;
and when you have completed your work, fill the wound with incense and aloe and dragon's blood, and bind it, and put over it a cloth soaked in oil and wine, or in oil and rose water and cold water, to appease the hot abscess; then bind the patient's neck, and do not loosen the bandage until the third day.
And when you loosen it, wash the area thoroughly with oil and water, then treat it with diafinicon ointment and basilicon ointment until it is healed.
And if hot abscesses come to the wound and corrosions, and congealing of blood in the bladder, and the urine is retained by this, which is recognized in such a way as without discharge with the urine: Then put your finger into the wound, and extract that blood, for if it remains, it will corrode the bladder and rot it;
Then wash the wound with water, and soap, and vinegar, and assist him in every way you can, until he is healed;
And it is necessary that every time you treat him, you bind his two thighs together, and gather the medicines over the area.
And if the stone is small, and it is in the conduit of the penis, and is stuck in, and the urine cannot come out; If you treat it as I have said before, that you cut it many times, you are excused from the cut by this treatment. I have already proved it thus.
Take an iron rod according to this shape and let it have three angled prongs in a forked shape.
Then take a thread and tie it around the penis below the stone, so that it cannot go back into the bladder;
Then gently insert the rod into the penis, until it reaches the stone; and turn the rod in your hand against the stone slowly, until you can pierce the stone from the other side;
Then the urine will come quickly, then press your hand against what remains of the stone inside the penis. If it is quickly broken, and it jumps out with the urine, and the patient is cured;
And if you cannot do this for any reason that prevents it, then tie a thread under the stone and another above it, then cut the penis at the stone between the two threads, then pull it out, and untie the thread, and clean the congealed blood that is in the wound; and treat it until it is healed.
of the stone of women
Sometimes a stone is lodged in women, and if it happens, the cure is difficult, and is forbidden for three reasons:
One is that perhaps the woman is a virgin;
and the second is that one cannot find a woman knowledgeable enough to uncover the secrets, especially when she is chaste.
And the third way is that perhaps one cannot find a knowledgeable woman in this art of hands;
And the fourth way is that the woman's stone is deeper than the man's stone, so a deeper incision is needed, and there is great fear. And if necessity compels you to do this, you must take a skilled midwife, and one is hardly found, and if you do not find one, seek a subtle, skilled woman.
and present a wise woman experienced in the lives of women, or a woman who knows part of the art, and instruct her to do what you command regarding the examination of the stone. and carefully consider whether the woman is a virgin:
and carefully consider whether the woman is a virgin: then she should insert her finger into the foundation and seek the stone;
and if she finds it, she should hold it under her finger, and instruct her to insert her finger where the ailment is, and seek and press her left hand firmly on the bladder.
If she finds it, she must move it gradually from the entrance of the bladder downwards, until it reaches the root of the thigh;
then cut over the stone at the root of the thigh, opposite the middle of the vagina, where it is seemingly positioned, and feel the stone in that part; and do not move her finger over or under the stone, and let the incision be small at first;
and do not move her finger over or under the stone, and let the incision be small at first; then place the instrument in the incision, if you feel the stone, enlarge the wound until the stone can be forced out, and know that there are many kinds of stones:
that is to say, small and large, rough and smooth, long and round, and those that have ridges.
so know the appearances in order to know the outcome.
And if the blood is excessive, then place powdered vitriol in the wound, and keep it there for an hour until the blood is stopped;
then return to your work, until the stone is forced out, and have the instruments that I told you about in the extraction of stones from people to help you in your work;
and if the blood is excessive, and it is from the artery that is cut, then put the powder on the place and bind it with bandages and don't start again on this, and leave the stone and do not remove it, lest the patient should die; then treat the wound.
And when the heat of the blood has subsided, and the place is healed, then return to your work, until the stone is forced out.
Watery hernia is nothing other than a collection of moisture or white pus, situated beneath the skin of the testicles, which contain the eggs;
and is called "pus," and sometimes is properly in the sac of the egg, so that one might think it another egg; and it is the skin of the testicle between the white pus we have mentioned;
and this happens rarely. And the generation of this hernia is from weakness that comes to the testicles, and that material is spread out.
And sometimes it comes from a blow to the testicles, and this moisture has many colors: where it is a color declining to jaundice, or it is without redness, or black, or watery white, and this happens more;
and these are the signs to recognize this collection, for if it is as white as we have said, the abscess is round, a little long like the shape of an egg, and the testicle does not appear, because it has moisture all around it.
And if it has moisture in its own tissue, the abscess is round with part of the egg, and therefore it is thought to be another egg.
And if the moisture is between the skin of the testicles and the white surface, one senses it well.
Therefore, when you wish to know the color of the moisture, you try all the intervening spaces, of which the form is shown above. According to that which comes after the intervening space, judge of that which is inside.
And when we treat it with iron, the patient should be bled as much as possible and according to the fullness of his body.
Then lay him on his back, on something slightly elevated, and put many cloths under him;
Then, sit on his left side, and command the minister to sit on the right, and extend the rod to one of the two ribs of the heart, of the testicles;
Then take the scalpel, and cut the skin of the testicles through their length right next to the incision, and make your cut completely straight, separating the skin of the testicles down to the white surface, and peel it delicately as best you can;
Then pierce the white surface with one large hole, and drain all the water, and then put your forceps, and pull the surface upward;
and do not touch the heart of the testicles, but only the surface; Cut either completely or in pieces, even the side of it delicately, for if you do not cut it wisely, the water will return;
and if the egg bursts during your work, put it back in place when you have finished working on the surface;
Then join the two halves of the heart of the testicles with a suture, then treat it like other wounds until it is healed.
And if you find the egg corrupted by another illness, you must tie the vessels that are suspensory, fearing the flow of blood;
Then cut the testicle to the entire suspensory, remove the egg, and treat it as we have said.
And if the appendix is joined into two parts together, know that they are two branches; Cut the other part as you did the first one equally, then wipe the blood away, and put moistened wool in rose oil on the wound;
Cut the other part as you did the first one equally, then wipe the blood away, and put moistened wool in rose oil on the wound; and place another wool moistened in wine and oil over the two testicles, and put doubled cloths over them, and tie it on over the entire bandage according to this shape:
Then take two cloths, and fill them with wool-chintz according to this likeness, and have them joined by stitching at the crotch of the breeches, and one of them should be placed from the hips up to the back, and the other to the side of the dagger;
and the other two ends over the two hips, and let the whole bandage be tied in the buckle of the breeches;
and sometimes this wound is treated with cautery instead of a cut with iron, and you should take a thin, scalpel-like cautery iron, and cut the skin of the testicles, and it should be heated as we have said, so that the white surface that contains the water is exposed;
then take the cautery according to this form, and pierce that surface with the prongs, and scorch it with this hot, thin cautery:
And cut it in all the ways you can, until you have removed everything;
and be careful that the fire does not touch the testicle;
and know that this work is safer; and observe carefully the flow of blood, and the measures of the cutting work;
and if anything opposes you, whether it is an abscess, a discharge of blood, or anything else, then treat whatever opposes you, according to what has been said before.
And if the patient is afraid and does not want to undergo this procedure because of its horror, then administer a perforation, as I tell you, and when you are quite certain, by the signs we have discussed, that the watery humor is present, then make the patient sit on a raised seat; then pierce the abscess in the lower part to the full breadth, and place the perforation along the length of the body;
and let the opening be wide, so that all the water may flow out;
then place cotton on the area and bind it, and let the remaining water run out, then treat it until the wound is healed;
and if the white cloth does not allow the water to leave the wound, then you must put a reed or the instrument with which one draws water from the dropsy sufferers, of which the form is shown previously;
and enlarge the opening of the wound, and know that the water returns, and is collected after six months or a year, and when it is collected as before, and thus the patient will pass his days.
Know that in the section of this part there is fear in many conditions, for which it seems to me that it is better to leave it alone;
and I will tell you the work and the appearances of the abscess.
I say then that many abscesses come to the body, and especially to the testicles; and it is by many means.
That is to say by a superfluity of acrid and sharp humor spread to the testicles, or by percussion;
and the color of the abscess is according to the color of the body; and there is no pain found, and it is a serious abscess;
and perhaps it is a serious, fearful, and painful abscess, and of a dark color, and sometimes it comes from a burst artery, or from a vein swelling.
When it is by bursting of an artery, it is recognized by the disposition of a hot abscess, when you press it with your fingers; and you should not touch it at all.
That which is made from a swollen vein is recognized by its disposition to the pressing of the fingers' touch, and one can well make an incision on this likeness, and on other flesh; and that you cut the cord of the testicles, then raise the testicle upwards, and pull the white part of the skin forward, and release the suspensory ligament from all sides of the testicle.
If the testicle is already swollen with those surrounding tissues, then you must pull the testicle and cut it;
And if there is air on the surface, or within the vessels, you must release all that tautness and cut it roundly.
And if the origin of the tissue is in the back, you must cut it all away, and remove the testicle, as we have said.
And when your work is complete, fill the wound with wool soaked in rose oil and wine, then treat it with further remedies until it is healed.
This is an abscess, enveloped by a wrapping similar to a boil, with softening of the testicles, and the patient suffers greatly when he walks.
And the treatment for this illness is as dangerous as the previous one, and nonetheless, we will tell you its method, according to what the ancients did.
You should have the patient sit on a raised seat, then place the suspensory for the testicles over his fingers, covering all the vessels near the penis, and the masters will hold them, and spread them firmly;
then, with a sharp, wide scalpel, cut across the vessels, until they are exposed, and then scrape from each side, as we have said in the extraction of arteries in the temples;
then insert a needle with a double thread, and tie it to the first place where the wound was, and tie it again to the other end; then cut them in the middle directly, according to the length of the body, and draw out the corrupted moisture;
then treat the wound as the others where pus is generated, so that no vessel bleeds that nourishes one of the testicles;
for by this, no harm comes, and if blood flows to all the vessels, then it is necessary to remove the testicles from all the vessels; so that the testicle does not lose its nourishment due to the incision of the vessels, and dries and cannot be helped.
The occurrence of this ailment is due to a cut that occurs on the surface, or the stretching on the belly in the area of the groins, so that the intestines descend from that rupture to one of the testicles;
and this rupture is of the surface, or of its stretching, and these two types arise from many causes:
or from a blow, or a jump, or a fall, or the lifting of a heavy load, and by similar things;
and the signs when it is from the stretching of the surface, are that it happens little by little, over a long time, and does not come suddenly; and the abscesses are equal all the way down, because the surface presses against the intestines.
And the signs when it is from the section of the surface are that it causes sudden pain at the beginning, and the abscesses appear different, under the skin, and this is because of the discharge of the intestine and the body escaping from the surface.
And sometimes the intestines descend with the curbs, and are caught there, causing the patient great pain, especially when they are pressed.
And in these iron treatments, there is fear, for which it is necessary to avoid them.
And the method of the work is that you instruct the patient to push the intestine back into the wound with their hand, if it can be returned. then it should be held on its neck, between your hands, and raise the thighs.
then stretch the heart upward, and cut all the skin of the testicles along the length; then place within the sides of the wound, incisions as you need to open the wound, and be such that the pus can exit;
then scrape the surface that is beneath the skin of the testicles, until the hard white surface is uncovered on all sides;
then place your index finger into what is around the testicle, in what is between the white surface that is under the skin of the egg, and between the second surface, and separate that which is behind the egg, and between the second surface;
and then move the right hand inside the heart of the testicles, and stretch the white surface upward with your left hand, and lift the egg with all its surface towards the waist; and order the minister to extend the egg upward, and loosen that which is behind the ligament;
and examine with your fingers if there is any of the intestine wrapped around the hard white surface, and if you find anything, place it into the belly underneath;
then take a needle with a thick thread made of X threads, and place it in the rear part of the surface, which is after the skin of the testicles; after the waist, then cut the threads that appear, until there are four threads; then assemble them one over the other in the manner of a cross, and tie the surface, of which we have said is under the skin of the testicles, with a strong bandage of two parts; then wrap the threads around the threads, and tie them firmly in two parts, so that none of the vessels that nourish them can enter into them, so that a painful abscess does not arise; and put back the bandage according to the first bandage, long two inches from it, and after these two bandages, leave a space of one inch from the surface, which is under the skin of the testicles; and after all the rest according to the roundness that the testicle bears;
then cut in the part that is under the skin of the testicles, as much as the blood flows, and the swelling, as we have said before;
then apply wool soaked in oil, and put it on the wounds, and apply the bandage that we have mentioned. And sometimes the white surface that we have mentioned is cauterized after the incision, for fear of the blood's running. For this happens many times, and leave the bandage until it falls off by itself;
and if it is slow to fall off, it should be soaked with hot water, and apply what we have said, until it falls off;
then treat the wound with another treatment, until it is completely healed.
of fleshy hernia
In this section, I have never seen anyone who dared to perform the treatment with iron.
And the ancients said that it is done just as the section that joins the viscera, in such a way that you tie the vessels, after the incision above or slightly below;
then cut it in half, and treat the abscess of what opens, until the vessel drains;
and treat it as we have said, until it is healed.
Sometimes a rupture occurs in the veins, as we have said, and the place opens;
and none of the intestines descend to the testicles, and if any do descend, it is little, and repairs itself all the time;
and nevertheless, if it stays too long in this state, the wound or ulcer grows, until the intestine descends;
and this happens through the stretching of the ulcer which is on the veins, as we have said, for it is stretched, then the place softens and swells and opens;
and the cure is through cautery, as we have previously said;
and sometimes it is cured by iron in this manner: and it is that the patient lies often on their back between your hands, then cut the place of the ruptured swelling with a width of three fingers;
and then remove the ulcer that is under the skin that surrounds it, then take the rod and place it over the visible area of the ulcer;
and press it deeply into the belly, then cut the two visible areas of the ulcer above the head of the rod, and cut both;
then remove the head of the rod, and do not cut into the ulcer nor spread the egg nor anything else, as I have shown you in the treatment of the rupture of the intestines; then treat it with the treatment for wounds.
then treat it with the treatment for wounds. And when you cut the threads, cleanse and treat the wound until it is healed.
The ulcer is constricted and shows no sign of rupture, and cauterization is more appropriate in this location, and closer to a cure.
of the softening of the skin of the nipples
Many times the skin of the nipples is softened in some men, because the tissues within are softened, and it is easy to see;
and it is necessary, when one wishes to cure it, that the sick person lie on their back, and one cut the softened skin over the natural skin;
then bring the two edges together with a stitch, and if you wish, first stitch the excess softened skin with three or four firm stitches;
then cut between the stitches, and cure it like other wounds, until it is healed, and the threads fall out.
of the chastening
Know that chastening is forbidden in our law, and therefore I would prefer not to speak of it in this book;
and is only necessary for two reasons:
one is that the child should be able to answer when asked, and know the cure;
and the other, because we often need to chastise certain animals to help us, such as goats and sheep and cats and other animals.
I say therefore that chastisements are done in two ways: either by traction, or by incision.
In that which we do by traction, we make the animal sit in hot water, until the penis is softened and hanging; then grasp it in your hand, until it is set back in place and you no longer feel it.
Of the castration of the tail: You must restrain the animal, and press the skin of the testicles with your left hand, then tie the suspender, and cut on each testicle in one blow, once you have properly scorched them;
and leave no bit of the surface and the subtle surface which is over the vessels;
and this manner of castration is gentler than that done by pulling, because with pulling, perhaps some part of the testicles remains, causing the animal to desire lust;
then treat the wound until it is healed.
of hermaphrodites
Hermaphroditism is according to two manners in men: one is such that between the two testicles there appears also like the form of a woman's nature, or there is hair, and sometimes urine flows there.
And the other manner is in women, and has on the vulva also like a penis and two testicles.
And the cure of the man and the woman is that you cut away all the attached flesh, and treat them like other wounds;
in the second manner, of men whose urine leaps through the skin of the testicles, there is no cure.
Tenaculum is an attached flesh on the natural part, so long as it is too unsightly to see; and some women have it as large as a hand, and that is the cure.
You must scrape the excess of the tenaculum with your hand or with tongs, and cut it lightly;
and do not go too deep, lest there be a flow of blood, then cure it with another cure until it is healed;
and to another flesh that grows at the mouth of the wound, and fills it, and perhaps bursts, and resembles a boil, and for this the ancients called it "boil disease". If it is necessary, you should cut it, as we have said of the tenaculum, and cure it until it is healed.
Erratic it is when the nature of the woman is not perceived, or the passage is small; and is natural by birth, or accidental by disease that has come to it;
and is natural by birth, or accidental by disease that has come to it; or it is by added flesh, or by a subtle or thick surface, and is done deep in the marrow, or in the ribs, or underneath, or wherever;
and it hinders conception, and childbirth, and perhaps the flowers to have;
and the knowledge of these is by the look of the belly.
If the numbness is close and apparent, then look at your fingers or the hand.
If it is from a subtle surface, and it is close to the two lips, then hurry, and do it thus:
place your two index fingers together, and let the woman be on her back, her legs spread apart;
then stretch the two lips widely, until the subtle surface is round and the numbness is gone;
then take wool, and soak it in oil, and place it on the area, and let the woman lie on her side each day so that it cannot heal.
And if the surface is hard and thick, then you must cut it with a spatula, similar to a myrtle leaf.
If the numbness is of newly formed flesh, then hang it from a hook and cut it.
and have medicines that stop bleeding, such as dragon's blood, frankincense, and a quantity of egg white;
then apply a wide lead bandage, so that the wound cannot heal;
and let it be for a long time, and apply a tent of dry linen;
then be treated with other remedies until it is healed.
And when flesh grows in the wound, it must be cut according to this manner, unless it is a hardened abscess. For a hardened abscess in the wound, one should not touch with iron.
of hemorrhoids Hemorrhoids are openings of veins from which blood flows habitually, and when hemorrhoids are old, they become painful.
And we have already said in the division the likenesses of them, and the signs, and I will now say those which receive a cure.
I say that hemorrhoids and pain, when they are deep within the wound, and are not apparent to the touch, then the cure is not by iron.
Those that are at the opening of the wound, which can be felt, are those that can be cured.
Therefore, you should put the woman in a cold house, then grasp the pain with tongs, and cut it at its roots, then powder on medicines that constrict blood, such as oak gall and dragon's blood and frankincense, and similar things;
then place her feet against the wall for an hour, then put her in cold water;
and if a discharge of blood comes, then make her sit in a decoction of sumac and pomegranate bark and gall and similar things, and then take barley flour, and mix it with honey and vinegar, and make a poultice for her back.
And if it stops, that is good. If not, apply leeches to her back and breasts, without hurting them;
Then take wool, and soak it in plantain juice or elderberry juice with old wine, and apply it to the area.
And when the abscess is healed, treat the area with ointment until it is healthy;
And the one called "albathir" is red, and is like a rough head; if it needs to be cut, cut it as I said the boil; And then treat it until it is healthy.
Many types of abscesses occur in the marrow, such as ulcers, stony abscesses, herpes, carbuncles, fistulas, hemorrhoids, hot abscesses, and many other diseases that I have mentioned in the division.
Therefore, it is necessary for me to discuss in this treatise the hot abscess that occurs in the marrow, which is not among the abscesses that collect pus;
And if you wish to know the treatment for it, observe if the abscess is sharp at the beginning of its appearance, and full of heat and fever, and if it becomes red, if you can see it. Then do not hurry to pierce it, but let it mature until the pain is relieved;
And then have the patient sit on a seat, and have two small stools where he leans, and support his back and bring his feet to the parts behind the leg;
and let his thighs be spread out, and let him put his arms under his knees, and tie them well with a good bandage;
then suck the wound towards the right side, and administer the instrument with which one opens the mouth of the sore, of which the shape will come after;
and it is necessary that when you wish to administer this instrument, that you first insert the rod to know the depth of the sore, so that that which enters the instrument does not go deeper than it should, and that it does not harm the patient; and if the instrument is larger, then it is necessary to cover the depth of the sore with cloths, so that the instrument does not hurt it;
and it is necessary that he place the horn of the instrument above, and that he hold the instrument.
And when the abscess is open, and one cuts it with a soft hand, then it should be cut at the head, at the smooth edge.
And when the boil is emptied, then it is necessary that you put in the wound soaked tents in rose oil, or in dry green oil;
and place the tent deep within the wound, and place over the sore and over the knife clean wool soaked in water or boiled mallows;
then treat it after two days of suitable ointment, until it is healed;
and sometimes one removes the sore and the wound with a clyster of water and honey, and then with water or roots of lilies and aristoloche long, that have been cooked; then return to the ointment.
And if the wound has pus in the sore, then you must avoid iron cautery, but treat it as we have said in the division.
of childbirth It is essential for the midwife to know the appearance of natural childbirth, and the signs are when you see the woman pressing downwards, and desiring to smell the air:
then the child hastens to come out. Then know that this childbirth is according to nature, and the issue is beneath its head, and the afterbirth with it.
And when you see these signs, it is necessary to gently press her stomach, so that the child comes out quickly.
For when it descends upon its head, the afterbirth comes out with it, and the mother's body is cleansed of its superfluities by good purification.
And that which comes out otherwise does not come naturally.
For it sometimes comes upon its feet, and the body or the head, or the hands, come out, or it comes upon its stomach, or often, and is perchance turned onto its neck, and by other bad figures.
Therefore, it is necessary for the midwife to be wise and subtle in these matters, and to guard against errors and deception, and I will show you all the figures how one should aid her.
If the child comes out on its head through a natural birth, and the woman is laboring hard, and her strength is weak, then have her sit on a stool, or let the women hold her up.
And apply her nature of oil or fennel seed which has been cooked, and then let the midwife place the small spatula, whose shape is like this, between her fingers: and divide the afterbirth, and cut with her fingernail until the moisture that is within runs out;
and grasp the woman's abdomen until the child descends, and if it does not descend, the woman must be given a clyster of fenugreek decoction with sesame oil;
then have her drink and sneeze from a concoction, and hold her mouth and nose for an hour: then the child will emerge now.
And if the two hands come out forcefully, you must gently relocate them bit by bit; and if they cannot be put back in, place the woman on a seat, and raise her feet high; then raise the seat on the ground, and hold the woman so that she does not fall when it is raised;
and if the hands cannot be inserted, and the child dies, then cut the hands with the knife that has been placed before, and extract the child, and reposition it equally.
of the child's exit from its feet When the child comes out from its feet, it must be pushed upwards; and then turn it gently, bit by bit, until it is aligned;
then take it by the feet and stretch it gently, bit by bit.
If it jumps as far as the thighs, instruct it to grab, and make it sneeze with the condition; if it jumps away, if God wills it.
And if it does not jump away as we have said, then turn it gently, bit by bit, until it is according to its natural form. For then it is slightly [cured/fixed].
And if it does not jump away as we have said, then take a bit of gum, and oil of sesame, and melted gum, and grind everything together in a mortar; and put on the woman's nature within and around this ointment, then make her sit in warm water up to her ribs;
and when she is softened from beneath, make her a collar of myrrh, and place it beneath, and leave it for an hour; then make her sit on a seat, then make her sneeze and restrain her mouth and nose, and gently press her stomach, for the child will now jump out.
from the delivery of the child on her knees When the child comes into this form, the midwife will place her hands gently and gradually; then let her be supported on her back, and let her feet hang down, and let her lie on the bed; and gently fold her hands, and then take her hands on her stomach, and remove the cushions underneath, until she is positioned downwards; and if the child does not jump out, take her feet and move them forcefully, then move her stomach upwards, then place your hands there; and gently draw out the child; and instruct the woman to hold on tight until the child is out.
of the child's birth coming from the large opening with one hand hanging down. it is necessary to devise a way to bring back the hand: if one cannot bring it back, then make the woman get up and walk;
if she cannot walk, then make her lie down on the bed and straighten her legs firmly;
then administer the mucus that I have described;
and if she does not give birth, then make her sit on the seat, then study how to bring back the hand; and watch the child according to its natural form, and make her sneeze, and instruct her to strain until the child emerges forth.
of the child's exit from its position on her neck, and have her hands spread out, and her face turned toward her mother's back It is necessary that the attendant hold her hand, then turn it slowly, and watch it gently;
and when it is aligned, place on the natural mucous membrane of the alley and oil, as we have said, then instruct her to move slowly;
and when you have done this, have her sit on the seat, and instruct her to strain; and have her sneeze. in this same manner for all the secondine
in this same manner for all the secondine When it comes forth in this manner for the whole secondine, then cut the secondine with your fingernail until the moisture is emptied;
and if the infant hangs upon its face and on its neck, then cut it from the chest, so it is not retained, and the infant dies;
then place the child inside, until you have positioned it as it should be, and tell the woman to take some rest:
of the birth of twins Know that twins are born many times, and sometimes three or four are born; and that is not a strange thing, and it happens little. Two are a strange thing, and do not live, if little is named;
Two are a strange thing, and do not live, if little is named; I know that they are multiplied, and are separated by the surface that divides them, which is attached to the uterus;
and sometimes they emerge as naturally as single embryos, as we have said.
And if they emerge harshly, then the treatment as we have said, and let the hand be delicate, and quickly and lightly do what it does; and do it in such a way that it brings them to health. of several children
Sometimes they are formed in the manner of one or two or three or four or five or six or seven, or several up to fifteen, and are fully formed in the shape of a child according to the measure of the wise and glorious, and the hand must know all of this, because by chance such things happen; so do as is necessary.
of the dead child
When you treat a woman of a dead child in the belly, as I have said in the division, and it does not come out, and you are constrained to the work of your hands; if it is necessary for you to know if the woman is of sound constitution, and has no accident or fear of death;
if it is necessary that the woman be placed on her back, and her head inclined downwards, and her legs raised;
and the minister should hold her in two places, or she should be tied to the bed so that she is not moved in the descent of the child;
then rub the mouth of the woman with moist oils with the mucilage of althea and fenugreek and flaxseed, then anoint the woman's hands with these oils and these mucilages;
then gently put them in the woman's mouth, then look for the place where she will put the forceps that are suitable for it, and be careful if the child is ready to descend onto its head;
if you insert the forceps into its eyes or neck or mouth or palate or under the chin or in the throat or near the sides, and if the descent is on the feet, then insert the forceps into or pierce the ankles or mid-sides;
and it is necessary that he hold the forceps in his right hand, and put the curve between the fingers of his left hand, and gently hold it with all his hand, and insert the forceps into any of these places that we have mentioned, until it reaches the empty space;
then insert the other forceps, or the third if you need it, so that the extraction is equal;
and then extend them equally by moving them from one side to the other, in order to make it come out, and let the forceps be toothed in order to hold it, as is the shape here:
And if a part remains, then grease the finger of one of his fingers with oil, and insert it into that part, and pull the other part;
and if any remains, then put this forceps in a higher place, and do this until it is completely extracted.
And if one hand comes before the other, and it cannot be brought back due to constriction, then you must wrap it in a cloth, until it comes entirely out; then cut at the joint of the sole or with a knife, and thus must you do in the other hand, and at the two feet.
And if the child's head is large and the passage is narrow, or if it has a sharp point assembled, you must place the pointed spatula between your fingers, and split the head and extract the point; or you round it with the instrument called "almidach", from which the form comes with the instruments or chapter that follows this one;
and likewise do the same if the child has a large head naturally;
and then pull the bones with pliers, and if the head jumps out and is held by force, let it be split, so that the moisture that is in the wound comes out;
and if it cannot come out, cut it into pieces as much as you can;
and if it is swollen in the belly or under the ribs, you must pierce it until the moisture flows.
And if the child is on its feet, the pulling is gentle, and the straightening to the mouth of the wound is gentle.
And if it is tight in the belly or in the breast, you must pull it out with a cloth wrapped around the hand; and cut the belly or breast, until the moisture that is in it flows out;
and if the other limbs are removed, and the head remains, the surgeon puts their hand deep into the wound, and pulls it until the mouth of the wound; then put one or two hooks in it, and pull it forcefully;
and if the wound opening is narrowed due to a hot abscess that has developed, one should not work on it, but apply moist and oily substances; and apply poultices, and use water that softens and moistens.
And if the child is on its side, and you can put it straight, apply what we have said about a living child;
and if one does not have the strength, pull it out forcefully in pieces, and leave nothing of the afterbirth.
And when you have done this, apply what we have said about hot abscesses that arise in the wound;
and if blood flows, it should be placed in constricting water, and apply other treatments.
And I saw a woman in whose womb a child had died, then another one was sewn on top of that, and the other one died as well. After a long time, an abscess developed in the groin, and it swelled until it burst, and began to discharge profusely.
I was called to treat it, and I pondered it for a long time, and could not close the wound.
I applied a strong-drawing plaster, and a bone came out, and after a few days another one. I was greatly amazed, because the belly has no bones.
I thought it was the bones of a dead child.
I probed the wound, and pulled out many bones, until the woman was in a better condition; and the woman lived a long time like that, and a little bit of pus would come out from the place;
and I have recorded this chapter only because, when the master finds a strange thing, he should know how to apply help.
Here after comes the form of the press, with which one presses the books;
and two turns at the two ends of the two cords. However, the horns should be finer than the restrictor, and be made of ebony or boxwood;
and let the mouth of the tube be one finger wide, and the margin of the wood one finger, and in length one palm and a half; and in the middle of the two cords there should be two joints of this same tube, which should be fastened to one and the other, half a palm long or a little more;
and these two joints are placed in the mouth of the mortise to open when one turns the two horns.
Another form, similar to it but finer and lighter, should be made of ebony or boxwood, in the shape of pliers; and have two joints at the two ends, as you see, one palm long, and two fingers wide;
and when you wish to open the mortise with the whole instrument, then make the woman sit on a bed, feet dangling and legs open, then place the two joined joints together in the mortise, and hold the head of the instrument between her thighs; then operate your hand on the whole instrument, as you did with the pliers similarly, according to the amount you wish to open the mouth of the mortise, until the woman does as she wants.
These instruments are all surmounted, and their forms are multiplied; and when the smith has prepared them, the work is all the faster and more highly regarded by the men for their quantity.
Do not neglect the instrument until you have prepared it, for their needs cannot be excused.
When the secondine is retained during childbirth, you must instruct the woman to hold her breath, then make her sneeze with a stimulus, and hold your hands over her mouth and nose; and if she sneezes because of this, well and good.
If not, she takes a pot, and makes a hole in the lid, and puts herbs that can open the passage of the womb, like calamint, rue, anise, chamomile, cassia, and centaury; all these herbs, or some of them, are boiled in water over the fire;
then place one end of the pipe in the hole of the pot, and the other end in the mouth of the womb, and heat it until the vapors enter the womb;
then make her sneeze, as we have said. Then the afterbirth will come out quickly.
And if it remains after this treatment, and does not come out easily, instruct the woman to moisten her left hand in oil of sesamum or in a poultice of elecampane, and then apply it to the area and search for the afterbirth; and when she has found it, then gently and steadily pull it out, so that the womb does not rupture during the extraction;
but it must be moved gently to the right and left, and then pulled; and it will come out and be released.
And if the opening of the womb is tightly constricted, we have mentioned the treatment of sneezing and fumigation of herbs;
and if it is not from any of these things we have mentioned, be careful that you do not damage it when pulling;
but it is necessary to tie what is at the opening of the womb to the woman's thigh, then administer a clyster of four-herb ointment; if it will rot and will return, and will be healed;
However, when it rots, a foul odor comes to the stomach and head, and harms the patient. Therefore, suitable fumigations are necessary for this:
None of the ancients have tried fumigation with cress and dried figs.
The shape of the instrument with which one fumigates a woman after the birth of the child and the afterbirth is this:
And it is similar in appearance to a chain, and one places the fine end in the natural place, and the wide ends over the fire;
and let the fumigations be over the embers, and the sickness continue until it is gone, and start another.
Many children are born who do not have the foundation pierced, but it has been stopped by some subtle membrane: So it is necessary for the nurse to pierce that membrane with her finger, and not to pierce it with a sharp instrument, and to watch that she does not touch it;
then put wet wool in wine and oil, then apply ointment until it is healed.
And if you doubt that it will not close up again, place a lead chain in the hole, and leave it there for several days, and remove it when the child wants to go to the chambers.
And sometimes these blockages come from the closure of a wound or an abscess; If so, it is necessary to cut through that closure: it will be healed, as we have said concerning the lead chain.
Fistulas that arise beneath the fundament are swellings, and those that come beside the fundament or in the space between the two parts, have one or several fistulas;
and when that swelling is old, it opens, and often releases white or subtle pus, and sometimes these fistulas are piercing;
and they are recognized by the fact that wind or gas escapes when the patient evacuates, and perhaps some pus spurts out.
And there are fistulas that pierce down to the bladder, and down to the middle of the penis; and they reach down to the hip joint, and to the part of the thigh.
And thus one recognizes a fistula that pierces to the fundament, and one that does not pierce: and that you insert your index finger into the fundament, and place a thin needle of bronze or iron into the fistula when there is no winding.
And if there is winding, insert a thin lead tent, or a horse hair, until you feel the tent or hair with your finger;
and if you do not feel it, and there comes forth neither discharge nor wind nor pus, as we have said: know that it does not pierce; so hurry to cure it.
And when the fistula pierces to the bladder or to the passage of urine, urine will leak out and cannot be healed by medicines.
If it pierces to the hip joint, the swelling will reach the area; if there is no twisting and the origin of the pain is around it, it often comes out as a boil, and no medicine or ointment will help it heal;
and in these piercing fistulas there is no cure but labor, and the folly of the meddling charlatans.
In one that is not piercing and is not old, there is hope for health through iron, as I have experienced, and it is that the patient lies on their back in your hands;
and raise their legs up to their thighs, and have their thighs bent towards their stomach; then apply a bronze tent, or lead if there is twisting, until you know where the tent comes to rest.
If the patient feels it around the fundament, then you must place your index finger there, and then feel whether the tent has pierced it;
and if you feel between your finger the surface or the flesh, then know that it is piercing; if not, do not work at it any more for it cannot be healed.
However, it is said that some can be healed, but this rarely happens;
and the help given is to heat the fine cautery according to the width of the fistula, as previously stated; and place it, hot, in the fistula, until it reaches the bottom; and do this two or three times, until you know that the false flesh is burned, which resembles a bird's feather;
and then treat it with damp tents in butter, until the flesh has come away, then treat it with a healing ointment that will create new flesh and close it up.
If it is thus healed, it is good.
If this, otherwise cannot be healed;
and if the tent goes between, and does not pierce the nail that is at the base, and between your finger and the tent is a thick covering of flesh or skin, and you see the fistula at this, which followed the covering of the heart; then cut from the beginning of the fistula, and push the tent forward again, and then cauterize it afterwards, until it comes to the head of the tent; and the tent will be released, and fall;
then clean those crooked flesh that appear like a bird's feather, and let nothing remain.
And if the blood overcomes you, and runs between you and the work, then cauterize it with fire or sharp medicine.
For fire cauteries assemble two good things: that is to say, the burning of these added flesh, and the stopping of blood and drying of the moisture;
then treat with tents soaked in butter or crushed herbs, until the place expels pus, and the burned flesh is cast off in the pus;
then treat the wound with ointments that consolidate the hard flesh, and they are dry medicines.
For when it is restored, it is healed and does not return.
And if a fistula goes down to the very foundation, and is distant from the body, then place your finger on the foundation and explore it.
If you feel the tent, and between it are the cloth or the cyst or the flesh, where it is close to piercing, then there is no recourse but to hope and trust, through the administration of one of these three methods:
or you cauterize it as we have said, or you cut it to the bottom, or if you can, you put in tents and treat it like before;
and do not go too deep, lest you sever the tissue holding the foundation and the discharge come out unwillingly; then treat it as we have said;
then treat it as we have said; perhaps it will be healed, or you remove that covering and clean it, since it is cut from the foundation, either by tent or by another appropriate instrument; then cleanse the damaged flesh that is in the wound, as much as you can; then strive to restore the wound and to keep the fistula on the part outside the foundation:
then strive to restore the wound and to keep the fistula on the part outside the foundation: it will be a less serious thing for the patient.
And sometimes fistulas are according to this manner: and it is when you put the tent in the fistula, and it is on the side of the foundation next to the skin above, then take a tent pierced at the top according to this shape: And he puts one thread in two, and puts the tent with all the thread in the fistula until it is at the top.
If it is piercing in the margin of the foundation inside, then pull the thread from that hole, as if you put your finger in the foundation;
and pull the top of the thread, and assemble the two ends together, and tighten one to the other, and leave it one or two days;
and tighten it sometimes, so that the thread cuts those tissues that are between them, and they fall away;
then treat the wound until it is healed and sound.
If the fistula does not pierce, then make it pierce in all the ways that you can, if it is not too deep inside. For it is not fitting to make it cut so deep by the tying, and then treat it, as we have said, until it is healed.
The shape of the spine's spatula, with which one cuts the fistula, is very sharp on one side and sharp-edged. and on the other side not, for this reason, that one does not cut what one should not cut, as you see here:
Hemorrhoids are according to two types: or they are within the fundament, as a grain of resin, and there are small and large ones, and blood often flows from them, and there is one or more, and they are from the fundament and at the top of the fundament;
but those which are outside have little moisture, and often a little yellow water or a little blood, and they have the color of the body;
and the treatment for those who have them within the fundament, is that you instruct the patient to press himself to go to the chambers, so that the fundament comes out, and the string appears; if you hurry, and you hold it with tongs, or you hold it with your nail, then you cut it at its roots;
and if the tweezers cannot hold them because of their moisture, then you take them with a cloth, or cotton, or a piece of chamelot; and you pull them out with your fingers, then cut them, and sprinkle some hot powders over them that are in place of cautery; or you cauterize them as it is said in the chapter on cautery, then treat them with other cures until they are healed;
and if the fundament cannot come out, then you give the patient a mordant and harsh clyster to wash what is in the fundament, so that it can come out openly; If the patient complains, and if the threads are strong from the fundament, then the cure is easy;
If the patient complains, and if the threads are strong from the fundament, then the cure is easy; and that you take them with your nail or pliers, and cut them, then treat them as we have said, until they are healed, and that they fear incision by iron. So it is necessary that you administer the suture according to this manner:
So it is necessary that you administer the suture according to this manner: Take a twisted thread, and put it in a needle, and then pull the thread over and pierce the needle on the other side, and turn the two ends of the thread under the needle, and make it wide.
and tighten the thread firmly, then tie the thread, and remove the needle, and do likewise with all the others, and leave one for running off the excess blood;
then place a foundation of dampened cloth in rose oil or in cerote, and place it on the foundation, and instruct the patient to rest;
and then leave it until they fall off, and when they are fallen off, treat them with ointment and other remedies until they are healed.
of the drying of the substance or foundation Many times there is drying up of the substance in the intestines, and by constriction of nature, and when the disease is old and medicine is of no use. If it is necessary to scrape at the point with a spatula or your fingernail the scab above, which does not allow it to moisten; then treat it until it is healed as is fitting;
and if it cannot heal, then resume the scraping more forcefully than before, until it bleeds a lot and is scabbed over; then treat it until it is healed.
(there is) a tremor. A small, false appearance is formed around the body, and goes very deep.
And sometimes, the cold is found, and it is sensed also like a tremor of death, and it spreads throughout the body, and more to the hands than elsewhere.
And the cure is that you take a stick of a goose feather, or a strong vulture feather, and place that stick over the tremor, so that the circle surrounds the tremor entirely. Then turn your hand around the stick so that you cut entirely around the tremor, and drive it deep, and eradicate the tremor from its roots.
And if you wish, do this with a stick of bronze or iron in this form, and it should be thin underneath and tapering above. Not too sharp, so as to hold in the finger, and press gently.
And if you wish, cauterize the tremor, as is described earlier in the chapter on cautery.
Sometimes a clyster is made of silver or bronze, or of molten or hammered bronze;
and sometimes these instruments are made small or large, according to those for whom they are administered. Those then that are administered in the treatment of children and those who are weak and sorrowful are small.
Those then that are administered in the treatment of children and those who are weak and sorrowful are small. The form of the small and large clyster is thus wide at the top, where the belly is bound in this manner:
and there is a separation where the belly is bound, as you see, and the bottom is pierced;
and have two holes on one side, and one on the other;
and the belly, where one puts the medicines, be of an animal's bladder or parchment, and be pierced all around with small holes, and have between each hole a space of one inch, then put in these holes a strong thread of thick thread twisted in an X or something around it, and assemble the belly as is a goat's; and when the medicine is inside, then tie it with a strong thread to the instrument in front, and then administer the clyster;
and that is the shape of the circle:
And let the medicine be neither too hot nor too cold, and anoint the head of the clyster with oil or egg yolk, or something similar, then put it in gently; then the minister squeezes it with his two hands together, until it is all empty, then pull out the clyster, and the patient raises his legs to the wall, and if the medicine wants to come out, then hold it as much as he can; and if he sleeps soundly one night, then it is a greater help.
And if you clyster him in a disease of diarrhoea, and the medicine hurries to come out, then repeat it until he is healthy.
And if the hemorrhoids are in the fundament, or an abscess, let the clyster be as subtle as for a child;
and this is the form of the subtle clyster upon which the skin is squeezed:
We have already said in the division on the treatment of wounds;
or we will tell you the treatments of hands and medicine, according to their completion.
I say that wounds are diverse according to how they are made, and according to the places where the wounds are made, and from what they are made.
The things by which wounds are made are by the throwing of stones, and the cuts of swords and knives, or of spears or staffs or arrows, or similar things;
or that are made according to the places on the body, such as a wound that falls on the neck, or on the head, or the chest, or the belly, or the liver, and similar members;
and I will tell you the cure for each wound, and will begin with simple wounds of the head, for the remembrance will come in its chapter.
I say that when a simple wound comes to the head, and the bone is not broken, if it is from the throwing of stones or similar things, and the skin is nonetheless broken and the wound is large, and you fear a rise of a hot abscess: then immediately make it bleed from the cephalic, especially if little blood comes from the wound, and let the bleeding be opposite the injured part;
and avoid the patient's repletion of wine and heavy foods.
And if he does not want to bleed, then let his food be reduced, and let him drink no wine, nor eat any meat;
and put on the wound, if a hot abscess comes there, cotton soaked in rose oil alone, or in astringent wine;
and if there is no hot abscess, then put on the wound, if it is fresh with all its blood, and it has not been altered by the air, powder, which I will tell a little later;
and if the burn has altered it, then put on some ointments, until it is healed.
And if the wound is large, like a cut from a sword or similar, and the edges cannot be brought together with stitches, then bring them together by stitching, as I will say for wounds of the belly, of the chest.
If the wound is exposed bone, and hangs, and is only held by a little, then cut it. then treat the wound with medicine, and restore hard flesh in place of skin, and instruct the patient to eat hearty foods, such as roasted meats and cooked wheat, as well as poultry, and similar things.
And if you find rot in the skin, and it does not reach the bone, cut out all the rot and burn it, then treat it.
and if there is an artery or vein in the wound, from which blood flows, and you cannot stop it with medicines, then seek the artery, and if you find it severed, tie it with a thread; and if this does not work, then cauterize it.
And if these wounds are small and simple, the treatment is light. and you should put this powder on, so that it will close up before the burn has changed.
And the method of the powder is: take incense, one part; dragon's blood, two parts; living charcoal, three parts, and powder it subtly, and fill the wound, and bind it tightly, until it heals well and joins with all its blood;
and then bind it well, and leave it unbound, if it does not swell; for one does not remove the medicine until it is healed.
And sometimes one uses only charcoal, when one does not have incense or dragon's blood, but that the burn has not changed the wound.
And if the burn has changed the wound, especially if it is, one does not put this powder on it.
but puts on some digested ointments, or poultices of barley flour made from water and honey, until it sheds pus; then cures it with other cures until it is healed.
And if a bone fracture comes with the wound, and it is small, then extract it with delicate pincers;
and I will tell you afterwards about the fractures of the head.
of the wound of the neck
If a wound comes to the neck and it is simple, there is no difference between it and one of the head, but if the nerve of the neck or the artery is cut.
If it is the nerve, there is no other remedy than to leave it to heal, and put nothing constricting on it, for it harms the nerve and causes it to retract; and do not put anything cold on the wound, for the substance of the nerves is cold, and their continuation is also with the brain, which is the highest part of the body;
but let the medicine be soft, like warm water mixed with rose oil, and cooled water, and other mineral stones according to this manner, and moist ointments.
And if the wound is large, stitch it and bind it with bandages, then allow it to heal until it is sound.
And if the wounds are deep and it is infected and full of pus, then pierce it in the lowest part;
and if the artery is cut, and bleeding results, then tie it off, and cauterize it if necessary;
and if the spine in the throat is cut, or the heart, and the passage is guarded, through which the food passes, then stitch the heart to the throat's lining, and do not touch the throat but return it to its natural shape; and then apply a tight dressing, and leave it for several days, then treat it with drying ointments until it is healed;
and if the wound has made an impression on the bone, then search for it; and if there are pieces of bone, then remove all that you can, and those that you cannot remove, leave them until the wound suppurates, and the discharge is loosened and eased;
and if the wound is fresh, then powder it with the powder I have mentioned. And if there is bone in the wound and it has a fistula, treat it as I have described in its chapter.
If it is a wound from a lance or a knife, and the wound is deep, then look to see if gas escapes from the wound as the patient breathes: then know that the wound is fatal;
and if it is not deep, and it is fresh with all its blood, then do not put powder on it at the first hour, nor bind it tightly, for the blood to not congeal deep and return to the heart, and kill the patient; but put an attracting ointment on it, and bind it twice a day;
and if you have no ointment, put old cotton in the wound to absorb the moisture, and make the patient sleep over the wound for three days, or four, or more; then there will be no spasm, nor evil tremor of the heart, nor constriction of the veins; and when you see good conditions, then know that the wound is healed. Then cure it with poultices and other remedies until it is healed;
and if it cannot heal, and it opens again, then know that there is a fistula;
if you cure it as one should. And if the wound is from a sword or knife cut, and it is simple, or on the chest or back, then cure it like the one that is in front; if it is large, with stitches;
and if it is small, with powder, and if it is embedded in the bone, and has broken pieces, then search the wound, and draw out the pieces if they are separated; and if they are not separated, then let the wound fester, so that the extraction will be easier;
and for other wounds on other limbs, the judgment is as we have said.
of the rupture of the belly
The rupture of the belly is great, medium, and small;
From the large wound sometimes the intestines, or the nerves of the intestines, jump out, so that they are thrust out;
and the healing is more difficult, and sometimes a small wound is worse than a large one, because one has more trouble putting the intestines back in, unless one puts them back in quickly;
because the intestines swell as soon as they feel the cold, so they are more difficult to put back, and therefore a medium wound is worse, because it is more difficult to put the intestines back in their place than in other wounds.
And know that the rupture of the belly is according to four types:
the two common types of healing occur in the healing of the belly, and the healing of other wounds of the body, and two other types of healing are common to other wounds;
and yet they are more specific to the healing of the belly, and I will describe each and explain.
I say that when the wound is small, and some part of the intestine protrudes, and it is difficult to put back, this is by one of the two methods: or because of the smallness of the wound, as we have said, or because the intestine is swollen due to the cold.
And when it is cold, warm it in this manner: wet a sponge or linen cloth in lukewarm water, or boil it in water with vinegar and cypress and spikenard, and raise the intestine until the swelling is removed;
and sometimes use astringent wines, and it is better than water alone for reducing swelling.
And when you see the swelling depart, moisten the intestine with water in which dates and mallows have been boiled, for by this the passage is made easier with little effort;
and if it cannot enter, then make a small incision in the wound with the instrument used to cut hemorrhoids;
and the initial treatment is better than cutting, which no one should perform without great necessity.
and this is the instrument for splitting it:
so cut inward along the curve and not outward, and see here the form: And when the wound is enlarged, and the intestine leaps out, then return it according to the natural form to its proper place, if you have the power, for this is worthwhile.
When the wound is large, and it is in the part below the belly, then you must have the patient lie on their back, and raise their legs higher than their head; and if it is in the part below the belly, then raise the head and chest higher than the parts below, and also if the rupture of the belly is in one of the two parts, then focus on making the injured part higher than the other;
And thus it is necessary to administer what I say in large and medium wounds.
For small wounds, apply what is suitable, then have between your hands a pitiful minister who holds the entire rupture in their hand, and bring the lips together;
and this is the common way of stitching, and you should take a needle or several, according to the size of the wound, then leave a space of one inch from the head of the wound, and insert a needle where there is a strong good thread; and pierce the two edges of the skin with the two edges of the subcutaneous tissue, which is beneath the skin, until you pierce it from that side, and bring together the two edges of the subcutaneous tissue all four together;
then pull a double thread around the needle from both sides, then bring together the two edges of the wound, and then leave one inch of space, and insert another needle;
then tie the thread as you did the first needle, and do not stop doing this according to what you need of needles, until the entire wound is stitched;
and the needles should be medium, between fine and thick, because fine needles cut through all the flesh, and too thick ones cannot enter properly: therefore they should be medium;
and you should not push the needles too far into the flesh and skin, lest they cut and open the wound before it is stitched;
and then cut the points of the needles, so that they do not injure the patient while they sleep, and place tents or flaps over the points of the needles to hold them in place, and leave them until the wound is healed;
and this method of stitching with needles is more suitable for small wounds, because one or two needles will suffice.
The second method of stitching is common, and is that you join the two edges of the leather and the two edges of the flesh together with a needle and a strong medium thread.
And when you have pierced all four edges together, then draw the needle back to the starting point, in the manner in which one sews cloth.
and put a space between each stitch the width of a small finger.
This stitching is known to men, and I sewed a wound that a man had on his stomach, which was cut by a knife, and the wound was more than one palm in size, and intestines were protruding about two palms in size, and the wound was in the middle of the stomach.
I pulled back the intestine after 24 hours had passed, and the wound was closed by the 15th day, and I treated it, and it healed.
And the physicians had judged that he would die, and that was a miracle.
and I did not treat it with any ointment, for I was in a place where one could not find any, nor any medicine. and I placed old cotton on the wound twice a day, and washed it with honey water until it healed.
Now I will tell you the two proper ways of stitching:
Take the needle and bring it out from the outer part until it is inside.
When it has pierced the heart of the right to the right, then leave the tip of the thread or stitch where you have put the needle, and make it pierce from the inner part to the outer part.
And the understanding of this stitch is that you sew as the furriers sew furs, and that you leave the thread on one side and take it up again on the other, until the stitching is complete.
The second way of stitching, which Galen properly calls, is like some do, who join the two parts naturally together, and apply one end of the thread to the other end, in this way:
Insert a needle into the tip of the thread nearby, and pierce that spot only, and leave the two ends of the thread. Then turn the needle and pierce from the outer part to the inner part, at the two ends of the thread.
Then pierce each from the outer part to the inner part, at two other thread ends on the other side.
And this is the most subtle and most common way of stitching.
Galen said this, and some attest that one should sew the belly with two needles, each having thread.
And one needle should be pushed in from one side, and the other from the other, in the manner of those who sew leather straps.
And know that when the rupture is in the middle of the belly, the stitching is more difficult than in other parts of the belly.
The judgment of the wound is like the judgment of other wounds:
And it is that when you find the wound fresh, with all its blood, before the wound has changed, you put the intestine back in place and sew it up;
Then put on a healing powder on top, and if the wound has changed, put on any available ointment until the wound heals. And stitch the threads, and let the seams and the bandages be bound tight. Then treat the wound as you would other wounds, until it is healed.
And if you lack medicine, as soon as it begins to heal, put on old cotton, and move it twice a day until it is healed.
For you do not need any other medicine in addition in many cases when the wounds are simple.
And if you doubt that the wound will cause a spreading infection to the principal members, then you should soak light wool in warm oil, or rose oil, and place it around the joints, and under the armpits.
And if it feels pain or corruption in boils, which often happens, then irrigate them with warm black wine, especially if the corruption reaches the intestines.
And pierce it within, and know that when it is the large intestines, it is easier to heal than the small ones.
The intestines called "jejunum" cannot heal when wounded, and this is due to the abundance of veins that are there, and due to the subtlety of the whole body, and the proximity of its nature to the nerves.
And if the sliver jumps out of the wound, then reset it back in, just like the intestines, while it is fresh.
And if it is old and become dark or black, you must tie the dark area to prevent blood from flowing, because there are veins and arteries there.
Then cut what is between the bandage, and place the two ends hanging down from the area beneath the wound, as far as possible, to facilitate the extraction when the sliver comes out and the wound heals.
of the rupture of the bladder
When the intestine is broken and the wound is small, it can be restored in some people, for I saw a man wounded in the belly by a lance;
and the wound was to the right of the stomach, and became festered and turned into a fistula, and there issued excrement and flatulence;
I applied treatment as best I could, and did not cease to refine it until it was healed, and the place was closed.
And when I saw it close, I feared the patient might have pain in his belly; and he had no pain, but remained in better condition, eating and drinking;
and some experimenters said that when there is a small wound in the intestine, it should be bound in this manner: take a piece of linen with large threads, then bring together the edges of the wound, and when the linen has opened its mouth, place it over the two edges so that it binds its mouth around them;
and then cut off the thread, and this holds so that it cannot come undone, then put another piece of linen afterward in the same manner as before, until the wound is entirely covered; and stitch the wound.
This method heals the intestine, and no harm comes to the patient, and the intestine can be bound with a thin thread, which is cut from the intestine of an animal, in this manner:
Take the end of this intestinal thread, which is very slender, and then tie to the end of this thread a fine linen thread twisted, then put the thread in the needle, and stitch the intestine, and bring it together at the rupture;
and this method of stitching with linen threads is only as good as faith and hope;
and if the wound is large and wide, especially if it is in one of the large intestines, there is no remedy or skill, except subtlety.
of a fistula or where it may be Know that any wound or abscess, when it becomes chronic, is universally called a "fistula," especially when it is draining and discharging pus.
And a fistula, in truth, is a hard, white, knotted swelling, where there is no pain, and is as flowing as a bird's feather;
and sometimes clear pus, and other times thick; sometimes little, and other times quite a bit;
and I have already spoken about this in the division of wounds, that any wound that is not healed, and there is no flesh, is no different than one of the eight causes: that is to say, because of the smallness of the blood or body; or because of its malice; or because there is hard flesh inside, and on the edges, that does not allow flesh to grow; or if there is too much pus; or the place is rotten, and the matter is of bad quality; or the medicine is not good in the treatment; or because the corruption is a kind of pestilence; or because the property in the region is slow to digest, and health is delayed, and swells by nature; or there are veins or bones:
and I have already shown all these causes, and the signs, and the cures of medicine in the division.
Or it is necessary that I make you know the cure of the fistula that is done by the work of hands.
Know that fistula occurs in all members of the body; for there are fistulas that come from large veins, and arteries, and nerves, or to the surface, or to the intestine, or to the bladder, or to some of the ribs, or to the spine of the back, or to any joint of the hands or feet; and some come to the property of the principal limb, and to similar places.
And all the fistulas that are of this kind are of grievous healing, and there is only labor, and ignorance;
and if there is any fistula that does not come to the place I have mentioned, and you are confident of the cure, and you want to know it, take a tin or iron tent, if the fistula is straight, seek it;
and if the fistula is crooked, seek it with a subtle lead tent, for lead bends itself around the crookedness;
and if the fistula has many holes and you cannot properly search it with tents, then irrigate it through one of the holes, for the moisture will flow from one hole to another, and cleanse it;
then search it wisely to your ability, so that you know if there is bone or nerve, and it is deep-seated, and inquire well from the patient about the pain he feels when pressing your hand, and the place where he feels it;
and when you truly know the place where it is, and if it is far from a joint, or nerve, or artery or vein, or in any of the places I have told you, then cut it according to what I have told you, and remove the pus and the corrupted flesh that are inside;
and then treat it until it is healed, and if the fistula is deep and in the right place, you must cut deeply, as far as you can, then place moistened tents in sharp medicine and put them down to the head of the fistula, so that the medicine corrodes the excess that remains at the bottom;
and then apply ointments that generate healthy flesh, until they are healed;
and if it is not healed by this, cauterize it as we have said, and if the bone is corrupted by the fistula, cut it.
If a vein or nerve does not affect the main limb, as we have said;
and if the bone is exposed, and there is corruption and blackness, remove it until the corruption is entirely removed, then treat it with things that generate flesh until it is healed;
and if it is not healed, and returns to the boil as before, know that you have not reached the source:
if you uncover and search until you are at the bottom, and remove all the corruption, then restore the place;
and if it is thus healed, it is well. If not, know that the corruption is too deep, that you cannot reach it; if there is no other remedy than to leave it to nature;
and if there is a small corrupted bone, and you can remove it with pliers, remove it with a suitable instrument, and if there are many bones, remove them all, and do not leave even one;
and if the moisture resists, and there is no error or fear, cut through the moisture and flesh, and free the bones.
And if you cannot remove them at once, place something that will cause decay on the wound, and leave it until the area around the bones is decayed, and then the bones will come out more easily;
and if it is a large bone, such as of the leg or thigh, only delay the decay until all the blackness is removed, then repair the wound;
and if a large part of it is decayed, and reaches the marrow of the bone; then it must be cleaned and cut all the way down to the decay, and then treat it until it is healed;
and I will tell you about a fistula that happened to a man in his leg, so that you may take an example and help in your work.
He was a young man around 30 years old, who had a pain in his leg from a cause that came within the body, so that the matter came to his leg, and it became swollen with a large abscess, and had no reason to avoid opening it;
but the physicians in their folly worked so much on it that the abscess opened, and much matter flowed out, and it became a fistula, and many openings came that all discharged pus and moisture from the body;
and many physicians applied treatment for about two years, and there was no skilled practitioner in the art of medicine until I was called, and I saw his leg and the medicines with which they treated him, and what flowed out through the openings in great quantity; and the young man's body turned red, and had a yellowish color.
I placed a tent in one of these openings, and then searched all the openings, and found that one came against the other from all parts of the leg.
I hastened then, and cut into one of the openings until I uncovered part of the bone, and found it corrupted and pierced, and the corruption extended to the bone within.
I removed what appeared to me of the corrupted bone, and thought there was no other corruption, except for what I removed.
and began to restore the wound with healing medicines for a long time, and it could not heal.
and then I began again, and uncovered the bone as before, and found the corruption continuing into the bone, and removed it, and then I tried to heal the place. but I could not until I cut around a palm's width of bone, and the marrow was completely gone, then I restored it with medicines. and it was healed and mended quickly, and it was no longer necessary to restart the work except for the patient's weakness, who could not endure, and for the fear of death I had of him. For because of the bloodletting, he often gasped, but he was healed completely, and hard flesh grew in place of the bone, and was of good disposition and had no harm or contrary in any way, neither to his air nor to his coming.
And if the bone is broken in any part of the body, it should be treated in this manner: Take a bandage, and tie it to the head of the exposed bone, and instruct someone to extend it upwards; and put another bandage of wool thicker than the first bandage, and place it over the flesh that is above the bone, and extend the head, so that you draw the corrupted flesh downwards, and uncover the flesh above the place where you want to treat, so that the bandage does not hurt the flesh;
and place a piece of wood or a board under the bone to help cut away the corrupted flesh;
and it should be done as long as one can see and feel the corruption, and should be done again afterwards.
And if the bone is corrupted, and does not show, and the corruption is in the middle or in a part, then uncover all of the flesh;
then place wood underneath, and then bandage from one side of the corruption to the other, and let the bandage be the length of the corruption, a bit, as we have said;
and if the corruption is in the joint, then cut the corrupted joint, and bandage the bone where it is on the other side;
and if the corruption is in the continuation of the two joints, there is no other remedy than to cut it;
and if the corruption is in the nail of the hand, or in the nail of the foot, that is a very serious thing, but nevertheless you must inquire into that corrosion, how it appears to you; and clean it by all means that you can, but let the vein or the nerve not oppose you;
and know that the instruments and blades for cutting these bones are many, according to the arrangement of the bones and their appearance, and their thickness and thinness, and their size and smallness, and their hardness; and therefore, it is necessary to prepare a tool for each type of work;
and know that the task will show you the tool you will need, according to the knowledge of this art, and the testimony of the ways of illnesses; so consider the tool you need according to what is required.
The shoulder might dislocate either due to internal or external causes;
and when you have treated that corrosion with medicinal cures, and they do not help, then you must cut that limb down to the place where the corrosion is, so that the patient escapes death, or the greater harm, which is the loss of the limb;
and the signs are that the limb becomes black, so that it seems to be burned by fire, and after the blackness, then that corrosion spreads from limb to limb, and takes over the whole body;
so hurry to cut it, and if it's from the sting of some venomous creatures, like sea scorpions and vipers and similar ones, if the corrosion is at the tip of the finger, then cut it, and do not give it a chance to reach the hand.
And if it reaches the hand, cut it at the joint, so that the corrosion does not reach the arm;
and if it reaches the arm, cut it at the elbow;
and if it passes the elbow, it is death, and there is no strong treatment that can equal the quantity of its power;
and do thus similarly when the corrosion comes to the foot: if it comes to the first joint, cut it after the other joint;
and if it comes to the foot, cut off the entire foot; and if it ascends to the leg, cut at the knee joint;
and if it rises above the knee, there is no other remedy than to leave the sick person to die;
and the manner of cutting or severing the limb is that you tie it above and below, and have one surgeon pull one of the ties downwards, and another surgeon the other tie upwards, and you separate the flesh between the two ties to a space of one span, until the bone is exposed;
then cut or sever it, and place a linen strip on each side, so that the cut does not touch healthy tissue, and cause the patient further injury and festering sores.
And if bleeding occurs when you work, cauterize the area quickly, or apply some astringent powders;
then return to your treatment until it is completed, then bind the injured limb with a suitable bandage, and treat it until it is healed;
and I will tell you that it happened to a man in his foot:
a blackening occurred, resembling a burn from fire, and this corrosion first appeared on his toe, until it affected his entire foot;
and when the man saw the corrosion, he quickly cut off his foot, and was healed;
and a long time later, the corrosion returned to the toe of his hand, and he came to me, and I applied remedies after cleansing the body, but the corrosion could not cease;
and he wanted me to cut off his hand, and I did not, as I had hope of repelling the matter; and feared also that if I cut off his hand, that he might die, for the man's strength was weak;
and he despaired completely, and returned to his land, and quickly cut off his hand, and was healed;
and I have recorded this case only so that others may do likewise, if there is need.
Sometimes an abscess occurs in a fleshy area, and lingers so long that it collects a large amount of pus; and then it bursts and the pus escapes, and the area remains empty, like a vessel; and the skin above is as thin as delicate cloth, and does not extend to the bone, nor to the nerve, and such an illness is called "sain," and is not called "fistula";
but if it extends so far that it reaches the bone deep down, then it is called "fistula";
and the skin is such that you cut the skin all around, especially when it is thin, like a cloth; and it does not swell because of its corruption.
And if you believe the skin is inflamed and the corruption is not deep, and the skin is thick with flesh, then treat it with an enema like this:
See if the swelling is large, and the pus that comes out has a foul odor, then irrigate it with Egyptian medicine, which is made like this: Take oil, and litharge, likewise, and put them in a vessel over the fire, until the medicine turns red and becomes as thick as honey;
and then take some of this according to your need, and mix it with water and honey, and irrigate the swelling with it, and tighten the opening; and leave the medicine in for two hours, then remove it by pressing;
do this many times, until the swelling is healed, and the odor is removed;
and sometimes, when this medicine isn't available, irrigate with water and ashes.  Take ashes from a vine branch, and pour water over them, then strain the water, and irrigate with it, until you know that the swelling is cleansed;
and if the patient cannot tolerate it, neither the Egyptian medicine nor the water of ashes, irrigate with water and honey, or if he has a little bit of litharge powdered; or irrigate with honey and wine mixed, because honey has the property of cleansing and washing, and the wine makes the swelling firm;
and when you have done this, and are certain that the swelling is well cleansed, irrigate with that which causes flesh to grow there.  Take a diafinit plaster, made with rose oil and wine;
or irrigate with some medicines and ointments, whose properties I have discussed in the treatment of ointments;
and if the opening of the swelling is small, and the tip of the clyster cannot enter, enlarge it a little with an iron, and place a tent of Egyptian ointment or basil ointment in it, until it is enlarged;
and if the wound is too wide, stitch it, leaving only the space where the clyster can enter, and if the opening that discharges pus is on top, cut it at a lower place than where it is.
and if you cannot cut the swelling from below as you wish, prepare it in such a way that the pus flows to the lowest place it is, for when the pus is deep, it does not allow flesh to form there, and if you cannot cut the swelling from below as you wish, prepare it in such a manner: that the pus flows easily downwards, and leave nothing of the pus;
that the pus flows easily downwards, and leave nothing of the pus; and take consolidating medicines to put on the swelling, and spread linen over the entire swelling; then cut as forcefully at the opening of the swelling a little wider than the first, then spread soft ointment over another cloth according to the size of the opening, and put it over the opening of the swelling to ease the pus, and do not remove the large cloth except after many days, once;
and the one that is over the opening of the swelling, remove often to remove the pus, and know what runs from the pus, whether it is venom or little or enough, or digestible, or indigestible;
and watch if the patient feels pain or not, and if there is an abscess or not, and when your medicine has spread in this way and you see the nature leaping over the opening of the swelling, then know that the swelling is already healing, and health is approaching;
and then loosen it in the morning, or on the third day, and when you loosen the wound, change another cloth, and renew the ointment.
And if subtle venom flows after a long time, do not despair of health, for health is approaching.
For there are people whose flesh heals slowly in their wounds, and others who do the opposite.
And if indigested pus bursts from the swelling after many days, know that the swelling will not heal.
And if the swelling is slow to heal and is prolonged, add drying medicines, moist in substance but dry in virtue, such as ointments, for there is a significant amount of vitriol, and that is the final medicine;
Take diafinit ointment, and make it with rose oil, and mix it with equal parts of old wine in substance.
Then it is mixed and used.
And this same preparation works better if the ointment diafinit is unavailable, or you take myrrh, aloes, and frankincense, and grind them, and powder them over honey when it is on the fire;
And then apply it in strips, and spread it over the swelling, and sometimes an experienced herbalist administers long roots of the lily of the valley, which is also like the flour of vetch and centaury; and use it with simple or compound ingredients: Grind them, and make it into powder, and put it over the honey I mentioned, and use it.
And if the treatment is prolonged and is not cured by this treatment, then know that the corruption is deep, and makes an impression on the bone, or on the hard parts, or on the ligaments; if the treatment of the fistula, as we have said before.
A whitlow is an abscess that arises under the nail of the finger of the hand, or of the foot, or perhaps it arises in other toes;
and when it grows old, and one does not take heed, a large abscess arises, and it runs and casts pus until it corrodes the root of the nail, and perhaps it corrodes the entire nail;
and the corrosion reaches down to the bone, so that there arises putrid pain, and the fingertip is swollen, and the color is black/dark.
When you treat it as we have said in the section, and the treatment does not work, you must cut away all the excess remaining of the nail with a hot iron, then cauterize the wound afterwards. Cauterization is very helpful if the bone is healthy and the nail is healthy.
and if the nail presses against the flesh, and begins to prick and wound it, you must place a rod under the nail that pricks the flesh, and push it upward, and carefully and gently cut the flesh, and apply burning and corrosive medicines to the remaining flesh to remove everything. then treat it with ointments until it is healed.
And if the corruption is in the bone, cut it out and remove the diseased tissue, for as long as the corrupt bone is there, it cannot heal.
And if you see the finger being corrupted, cut it in half as previously described, then treat it until it is healed.
And if it is struck and bruised, and feels great pain, you must first clean it.
Then cut the nail with a sharp instrument, cutting across the top, and be careful that the cut does not reach the flesh beneath the nail, for the patient would feel too much pain.
And if it happens, place something on it that soothes.
The swelling that arises in the hands of some people by chance is entirely fleshy, and sometimes it has bones, and sometimes a nail, and some of them grow at the base of the joint, or their growth is in the bones of the fingers.
The one that grows on any fingernail does not move, and the one that grows at the finger joint, perhaps moves.
The size of the fleshy one is light, in this manner: Cut it at its root with a wide spatula.
The one that grows at the base of the joint is difficult to cure: So hold on to the cutting.
In the one that grows at or near the posterior, you should first cut the flesh roundly down to the bone, then cut the bone with a suitable blade, and then treat it until it is healed.
The swelling that comes to the fingers together comes about by birth, or from the joining of a wound, or from burning with fire, or similar things.
You should cut that swelling, so that the fingers return to their natural forms. Then place between them wet cloths or bandages soaked in rose oil, so that they don't stick together; or you place between them thin pieces of lead, until the place is healed, as is appropriate.
If swelling comes to any of those fingers with the palm, cut that swelling as is appropriate.
Large veins are wrapped full of melancholic superfluities, that come to many members of the body;
and more occurs in the legs of those who walk and work and carry, than in others.
It is therefore necessary that you administer him purgation of the gall, and then the healing from the basilica.
The cure of iron is according to two manners: one is that they are cut, and black blood is drawn out; and the other manner is that you bind the vein, and draw it completely out.
The incision is according to this manner: First, apply a very hot water bandage to the leg, until the thick blood is thinned, then restrain the patient's leg from above the thigh down to the area below the knee;
then cut the vein in one place, or in two or three, with a wide incision, then raise and draw the black blood to your hand, from one end to the other, until as much blood flows out as the patient's strength can tolerate;
and then bandage it, and instruct him to eat foods producing black bile;
and repeat the evacuation and bleeding when the veins are full, and harm the patient.
The raising of it is according to this method: raise the patient's leg, if there is much hair, then put it in a bath, and bathe the leg in hot water until it becomes red, and the veins swell;
and if you have no bath, heat it by the fire, and then cut it along the vein from the top of the knee, or in the part below the ankle;
then open the skin with the lancet, and scrape the vein on each side, until it appears when you feel it;
and it appears red and black, and when it enters the skin, it looks like a white cord;
then push it back, so that it is lifted from the skin, and then pull it slightly with the lancet, then cut it in another place above three fingers;
then scrape the skin over the vein until it appears, then lift it with the tool, as you did, and pull it with another lancet, as you did first;
then make another incision, or several if you need them, then lift it, and cut it at the foot of the finger, then pull and lift it down to the second incision;
then pull it from incision to incision, until it is completely free, then cut it;
and if you cannot pull and lift it, then put a needle with a strong double thread, and tie it and pull it, and put a tool underneath, and turn your hand to one side and the other, until it comes out; and be careful that it does not cut, for if it cuts, it cannot be pulled or lifted, and harm comes to the patient;
and when you have pulled it all out, place soaked wool on the wound's location in wine and rose oil; and treat it until it is healed.
And if the vision is constricted, twisted, and wrapped together, and it is not straight, as we have said, then you must split it crookedly, but do not cut it at all; and pull it as we have said before.
The shape of the iron with which one cuts the vision is curved, and does not cut straight, so it does not cut the vein;
and it is of great curvature, for if it were subtle, it would cut the vein, but let it be thick as we have said, and here is the shape:
This vein is interwoven in legs, in warm parts where no herbs or trees grow, and in earth where there is no moisture;
and perhaps arises elsewhere than in the legs, and this happens from the rot that comes under the skin, as it comes within the body of serpents and worms, interwoven between skin and flesh.
And if the signs of the beginning of this vein are that there comes a very great inflammation in the leg, then the place changes, and the vein begins to emerge, like a root of a plant.
When the head appears, you should wrap around it a piece of lead of one and a half to two ounces, and a bandage, and leave the lead hanging on the leg, and every time any liquid issues forth, wrap it around the lead and the bandage;
and if it is too long, cut off a portion, and wrap the remainder, and do not cut it at its root until it has all emerged; for if you cut it, it will return into the flesh and cause abscess and rot in that place, and a bad illness;
because of which thing it is necessary that it be treated little by little until the end, and nothing remains in the body;
and sometimes this vein, when treated, is five palms long, or ten, and a man came to me once, from whom it issued ten palms long, and when you cut it, you make one cut or opening, and pierce it to the bottom, so that all of it issues forth;
and let the matter within be emptied, and apply healing remedies to the place to prevent any rot, then treat it as you would an abscess.
And sometimes this vein has many branches, especially when it opens at the joint of the foot, or in the foot, and there are many openings, and from which many branches spring;
Then cure it as we have said before.
of worms that arise between skin and flesh This illness is called "bull's disease" in our land, because it often happens to oxen, and is a small worm that arises between skin and flesh, and travels throughout the body, ascending and descending, and one feels it well by the movement of limb to limb, as long as it gnaws through the skin where it goes, and causes blisters.
and is engendered from the corruption of certain humors, like worms and serpents and leeches and ascarids in the belly;
and one doubts its malice, because when it travels through the body, and it ascends to the head, and it comes to the eye, by chance it enters and destroys the eye; and this happens many times.
When you wish to cure and remove it, one can only do so when it moves.
so it is necessary that you bind the place above and below with a strong band tightly, then cut above and pull it out forcefully, and if the worm is deep within the flesh, and you do not find it, then cauterize it with fire above, until it dies;
and the greatest harm it causes is that it damages the eye, as we have said;
and if you see it coming to the head near the eye, then firmly hold the eyebrow below it, then cut above, and pull it out forcefully;
and it is necessary to use the patient with cleansing of the body with medicinal solutions for the bad festering humours, and to abstain from foods that induce putrefaction.
of the pain that comes from wind. This illness is called "vakirir" in our land, and is a pain that comes in some limbs, and may move from limb to limb;
and I saw what I tell you. I was called to a sick woman, and she uncovered her arm, and I saw a small swelling in the vein of the arm;
and I saw it rise afterward like a worm on the shoulder, more quickly than anything, like quick silver when it rushes from one place to another;
the pain left that place, and settled on the shoulder, and then a little afterward ran throughout the body, until it came to the other arm;
then she told me that it circled the body repeatedly, just as I saw it.
I was greatly astonished how it moved thus from limb to limb, for I had never seen this illness in this way before. However, I had seen many who had had pain move from one place to another, but I had never seen it like this in the woman;
and I thought it was because the woman had a thin body, and exposed veins, and for this reason the wind seemed constrained;
and it does not appear according to this reasoning in those who are plump, and who have moist bodies and full veins.
And when you wish to treat this illness, and the patient feels this pain, if it appears to you as we have said, then quickly apply something above and below it, and then cut over it so that the constrained wind in the place comes out forcefully; and cauterize the place;
and if you do not see it with your eyes, then treat it with that which expels winds, such as foul-smelling pills, and pills of serpent's root, and similar others.
Arrows are diverse, according to their appearances and according to the places of the body where they strike.
Their diversity is such that there are those with large points, and small, and barbed, and soldered; and those with two angles, and those with tongues, and those with pieces;
And those that strike any limb strike in two ways: or in a principal member, like the brain, heart, liver, lungs, kidneys, intestines, bladder, and similar members. When it falls in any of these members, and the signs of death, which I will tell you afterwards, appear: Then you must avoid extracting this arrow, for death follows in many cases; and when these bad signs do not appear, and the arrow is not deep, then pull it out and treat the wound.
And the signs of the brain, when the arrow strikes and pierces the bone, and the membrane covering the brain bursts, are when there is dizziness and stupor and a turning green or red of the eyes, and inflammation and redness of the tongue, and spasms and confusion of understanding, and vomiting of bile; and perhaps there is a discharge of blood from the nostrils or the ears; and perhaps he loses speech and voice; and from the wound there emerges white moisture resembling pus, and there is also a burning of the flesh;
and if these signs appear, then you must abstain from treatment and remove the arrow if it is not inside.
The sign of an arrow that has struck the heart is that it is near the left breast, and it feels as if it were lodged in something hard, and not empty; and perhaps the arrow moves like the pulse, and black blood flows, and coldness and cold sweat come, and syncope occurs: Then know without a doubt that death will follow.
And the sign of an arrow that has struck the lung is that frothy blood spurts from the wound, and the throat swells, and the patient changes color, and sighs heavily and seeks cold air.
And if the arrow strikes the covering of the breast, it is beside the small ribs; and produces great pain and great sorrow and sighs; and all the members of the shoulders move.
And if the arrow strikes the stomach, perhaps something of indigested food spurts from the wound.
And if the arrow strikes the belly, and a piece of straw spurts out through the intestines, there is no hope for treatment, nor for the removal of the arrow.
And if the arrow strikes the bladder, and urine spurts out and flows, and the patient feels intense pain: know that the wound is mortal.
The other limbs, such as the arms and neck and throat and shoulder and shoulder blade and spine of the back and thighs and legs, and similar limbs, are saved according to various dispositions. When the arrow is in the nerve or artery, and it is not venomous, as I will tell you what happened to me, so that you may do likewise.
It happened to a man that an arrow struck him in the tear duct at the root of his nose: I probed it and extracted it from the other side under the fat of the ear, and he was healed without difficulty.
And I extracted an arrow that struck him in the fat of the eye under the eyelid, and the arrow was lodged, and I could only reach the tip towards the shaft, and the arrow was large, from a Turkish bow, with a light iron head without wings;
The man was healed, and no bad accidents befell him.
And I extracted an arrow from the throat of a Christian, and the arrow was Arab, with wings:
I cleaned the beard, and I worked carefully until I extracted it, and the Christian was healed.
And I extracted an arrow from a man that had lodged in his belly, and I thought he would die;
and after thirty days had passed, he did not change his condition; I cut around the arrow, and grasped it, and extracted it completely, and there was no bad consequence.
And I saw a man whose arrow struck his back, and the wound was closed over;
and the arrow remained inside him, and did not change his natural dispositions, nor did he find any harm in any of his natural functions.
And I saw another man, whom an arrow struck in his face, and the wound was closed over; and remained thus without suffering great pain;
and many other similar cases.
And a prince of the king, a man, had an arrow that had entered him in the middle of his nose, and it was slightly inclined towards the right side; and the arrow was completely lodged.
I was called to treat him after it had been lodged for three days. I found the wound very narrow.
I probed it with a very thin probe, and did not feel it at all; and he felt a prick and pain under his right ear.
I thought it was from the point of the arrow. I placed an attractive and digestive plaster over the area, so that the area would not swell; and the arrow's wound appeared to me.
and the arrow's wound appeared to me. I put the plaster on again, and the wound healed up again, and the patient remained like that for a long time, until he felt the arrowhead inside his nose one day;
and he told me so. I applied a sharp, corrosive medicine to the wound for several days, until it opened up, and I probed it, and felt the head of the arrow beginning to emerge from the area;
then I added more of that sharp medicine to the opening of the wound, until the head of the arrow became clearly visible;
and the wound's edges healed well within two months, and then the wound widened so much that I put in the pincers, and moved it from one side to the other, and it still couldn't come out;
then I did not cease to devise and invent tools, until I took pliers well-made, in accordance with what their form will appear at the end of this chapter, until I extracted it, and healed the wound.
And the doctors judged that the cartilage of the nose cannot be restored: I restored it then, and the wound was healed, and the patient was completely cured.
Now I have told you the quality of extracting certain arrows, so that you apply your treatment to what I haven't said, because the book cannot cover everything;
but a skillful master compares very little, and upon what is present and lacking, finds new work and new instruments, in the descent of strange things that occur in this art.
I say that arrows do not leave the limbs where they are lodged except in two ways: or through the place where they enter, or through another part;
and the one that jumps out through the place where it enters, is an arrow penetrating fleshy places, and sometimes jumps out immediately.
And if it does not jump out immediately, let it remain until the flesh around it is decayed, and the exit is eased;
and also if it is lodged in the bone and cannot come out, let it remain thus for a few days, and move it daily;
and then it will jump out; and if it does not, pierce around it with a very fine implement, until the surrounding area is widened, and then pull it out.
And if the arrow is embedded in the body and cannot be seen, search for it throughout the entire wound. and if you feel it, extract it with a suitable instrument;
and if you cannot because of the tightness of the wound, and the depth of the arrow, and there is no bone, nerve or vein, enlarge the wound until it is large;
and extract the arrow if you can, and if the arrow has barbs with which it is lodged, remove the flesh that is stuck to it from both sides as much as you can, and then break or bend the barbs of the arrow until you can pull it out;
and carefully avoid breaking the arrow, so that you will remove it more easily.
And if you cannot in one go, leave it until the surrounding area is rotten, then pull it out, for the extraction will be easier. And if the flow of blood makes you hesitant, administer what we have said about treatment in that chapter;
and be wary of cutting the nerve and the vein, and devise a method to remove the arrow without risk, quickly or slowly, or firmly or gently;
and position the patient according to the form he was in when the arrow struck him, for this is the greatest help there is, and if you cannot, then position him according to the signs that show you.
The arrow that comes from another part, or where anything shows, or the skin is swollen in a place that can be seen or felt clearly:
then cut there, until the pliers can grasp it, and then remove it: if it jumps out now.
And if it is held in the bone, then turn your hand roundly, until it enters the bone, and widens the bone, then remove it.
And if it cannot come out, then leave it for a while, and then begin the extraction again until it comes out;
and if the shaft of the arrow is in it, then put it through the whole shaft;
and if the shaft is broken, and you want to administer a thrust, then administer a pointed instrument, so that the point of the arrow enters the tip of the instrument;
and then thrust forcefully, and if the arrow is tipped, then put an instrument with a pointed end into it, to make the extraction easier.
And if the arrow is poisoned, then you must cut all the flesh around where the poison is, if you can, then treat the wound as is appropriate.
And if the arrow lodges in the groin, or the belly, or the bladder, or the ribs, and it is close to the surface, and you can cut above it, then cut above it;
and beware of cutting the vein and the nerve, and then extract it, and then stitch the wound, if necessary; and treat it until it is healed.
The shape of the pliers with which arrows are drawn is similar to a bird's beak, and see here the shape:
And there are many kinds of them: large, medium, and small, according to the size of the arrow.
The shape of the arrowhead is also like the feather of a bird, for thrusting at the point of the arrow, as here is the shape:
Of the veins from which one bleeds are thirty-one, of which there are sixteen in the head, that is to say: Two arteries located behind the ears, which are called the two "herbech"; and the two arteries which are in the two visible temples; and two veins that are in the two tear ducts of the two eyes, which are called "aspires"; and the vein that is in the middle of the forehead; and the vein that is at the root of the nose; and the two veins that are in the neck; and the two veins that are on the lips above the mouth, and these are the veins that are called "augeherich"; and two veins that are under the tongue.
The veins that are commonly lanced are five in each arm:
One is the cephalic, and is on the left side, and the common people call it "vein of the head"; and the middle one is called "faste", and is composed of the cephalic and the basilic, and the common people call it "vein of the heart"; and the basilic is on the right side, and the common people call it "vein of the belly", and is above the elbow, and is the one that is lanced, which is clearly visible above the wrist.
And the salvatelle is the vein that is between the ring finger and the little finger, and has two branches;
and in the leg and foot there are three veins: one is beneath the curve of the ankle on the left side, and the second is the saphenous vein, which is at the ankle of the right side; and the vein called "soles", which is at the ankle of the other side;
and in the other leg there are three veins beneath those.
The bleeding of veins behind the ears helps with chronic colds, and headaches;
and the quality of the bleeding, as I tell you, is that you raise the patient's head, and rub the spot where the veins are with a rough cloth; then the patient strains their neck with a vise, until the two veins appear behind the ears in two places dependent from the head: Now grasp them with your finger, and where you feel the pulse under your finger, there make the incision;
Then take the lancet, and insert it under the vein down to the bone, then raise your hand all the way up the vein, and cut through the skin and the vein in two places, and let the blood flow as much as you wish;
then restrain and tie it, until it is healed;
and I have already said about the incision and cautery in the first book.
Bleeding from the two arteries in the two temples is good for chronic migraine, and stubborn, and habitual ophthalmia, and for acute eye-watering.
and the qualities of bleeding are as I have said: and it is that the patient should tighten their neck, until the two veins appear clearly; and feel the pulse under your finger, and then bleed from the inside.
Then raise the heart towards the vein above your index finger, and place the lancet underneath, and raise the vein upwards, and cut it, as you have done to the other two veins, and cause the blood to flow according to your need;
Then release the patient, and place your finger over the vein for an hour, then place some cotton over it; and then bind it firmly, and leave it until it is healed;
and we have already spoken of their cutting and their extraction, at the beginning of the book.
Bleeding from the vein of the forehead is as valuable as bleeding from the cephalic vein for ailments of the face, and for migraine and inflammation.
and the technique is that the patient should tighten their neck by twisting, until the vein appears; then take the instrument called a "digging tool," of which this is the form:
And place the point on the vein, and press down with your hand, or with something else, and allow blood to flow out according to the quantity you desire; then release the patient's neck, and tie the vein until it is healed, and sometimes the work is done with a wide flame.
However, the flame should not be too sharp; and keep it at an angle, for the bone is nearby, and perhaps the flame will break if it is too thin.
The application of the two veins located in the two tear ducts helps the eyes, and the eyelids, and redness, and the inflammation in the eye, and the ailments of the face;
and the quality of their application is that the patient constricts their neck by twisting with a bandage, as before;
then apply it, and let the application be across, a little length of the flame a little wide, for there is no flesh there. And if the flame is thin, perhaps it will break;
then let the blood flow, as long as you need it, and then bind over with cotton, and bind it well.
The application of the vein from the nose is good for headaches, and for madness, and for facial ailments, such as migraines and redness that comes to the face, especially when it is long-standing;
and the method of the application is that the patient tightens their neck, then pinches their nose with your left hand, and take a thin long flame, and place it in the space between the two nostrils, because the vein does not appear well there, and the blood will now begin to flow;
and do not go too deep, and let the blood flow according to your need, then bind it for a night, because it is very quickly restored;
The application of the two unguents helps with the constriction of the urethra, and the beginning of inflammations, and many illnesses, and to ringworm, and to scabs, and to herpes, and to boils;
The method of the application is that the patient tightens their neck from both sides, as we have said;
And let the master be standing over the head of the patient, and the patient sit on a chair, then lance the vein along a little width, then draw blood moderately, or as much as needed;
Then do the same in the other vein, then loosen the ligature, and gently constrict both veins, so the patient does not suffocate; and leave it until morning, so the wound is healed.
Of the bloodletting of the lips Bloodletting from the veins of the lips above helps with phlegm in the mouth, and with the corruption of the gums, and cracks in the lips, and the nose and throat.
And the qualities of the bloodletting are to make the patient sit before you, and to tighten his neck as I have said; then turn the lip, and look for two veins, one on the right lip and the other on the left, which are recognized by their being dark, and because around them are smaller dark veins:
Then cut one and the other, and if you do not recognize them, and you are in doubt, then cut the largest on each side, and likewise do with the two veins that are above and below, for it is the same method.
Of bloodletting under the tongue Bloodletting from the veins under the tongue helps after bloodletting from the cephalic vein, and it is for tightening of the throat, and for diseases of the eye, and for diseases of the mouth;
and the quality of the bloodletting is that the patient sit still between your hands in front of the sun, and lift the tongue, and look underneath on each side for a dark vein:
Then bleed one and the other, and do not go too deep, for the arteries are below.
The veins of the arm which are commonly bled are bled in two ways:
or by pricking with a wide, thin, pointed lancet, or a subtle lancet like cutting knives, and is called "anesil"; and are wide and subtle according to the width and narrowness of the veins. The shape of the lancet is very renowned, and is wide as you see:
And it is needed for opening veins full of thick, visible blood, and which contain thick and troubled blood; and that is the shape of the lancet of olive:
and is more pointed and subtle, and is for lancing subtle veins, where there is subtle yellowish blood.
The lancing of the basilary vein, which is one of these veins, helps illnesses that are beneath the throat, and in the neck, and the chest, and the belly;
and it is necessary for the lancet operator that he lance wisely, and that he avoids the artery below. And if he cuts the artery, and a flow of blood comes, then it must be stanched, as I have said; And the lancet should not be pricking, but cutting like a knife.
And if the basilary vein is not clearly visible, then you must press on it and change to another vein. or you want some opening in it, or you lance a vein in the middle of the arm instead: it appears clearly; and the incision with the knife, as we have said.
And if you wish to know the site for the incision, then first you should squeeze the arm, and touch the site until you feel the pulse; then mark the site clearly, and then tie the arm, and cut the vein with the knife; and watch that you do not strike the artery when you see the site inflamed, for it is of the artery: Wipe it then.
And if you see it ooze upward, like a child's urine, and the blood is red and thin, know that it is blood from the artery: Hasten then, and place your finger upon it for a while, then remove your finger if the blood stops, as often happens; Tie the arm, and leave it thus, and let the patient not move it;
and be cautious, and let him not move it until he is healed.
And if the blood does not stop, and it overwhelms you, and the medicine is not present, then cut the artery if it is exposed, for the head is threatened; and stop the blood.
And take a fig bark, and split it, and take one half and bind firmly over it until the next day;
if the blood stops, that is good; if not, treat it, as we have said, with powders that stop blood;
and the stopping of it is not difficult in many cases because of the small size of the wound and the strength of the arm's bandage.
The vein's bleeding helps in this way: it draws blood from the head above and from the body below, because it is composed of the basilica and cephalic, as we have said;
and it is necessary for the healer to beware of the nerve underneath, and if it pierces too deeply and finds the nerve, it swells and the patient's condition becomes severe, and perhaps it cannot heal;
and this nerve often appears, and if it does not appear in some men because of its subtlety, you should cut it with a lancet. and cauterize the nerve to the best of your ability.
And if there is a vein between the two nerves, cut it lengthwise.
The bloodletting from the cephalic vein helps, as it draws blood from the head and helps the eyes;
and it is necessary to bleed by pricking the olive vein or the myrtle vein, for it is the safest of all the veins, because it has neither nerve nor artery beneath it. However, it is necessary to seek the easiest place, and do no harm if one fails the first time, and one tries again; and perhaps the place swells in some men when one fails the first time, but it does no harm.
The quality of the bleeding is according to your thought.
The first thing you must know about bleeding is that it is administered only to preserve health, and to avoid future illnesses;
and let the bleeding be done in one of the three veins which are in the elbow: that is to say, cephalic, basilic, and median. and one should bleed at the beginning of spring on an empty stomach, and in autumn and winter after eating, when the signs of fullness appear;
and one should bleed on the first or third day, after two or three hours of the day.
The bleeding administered to illnesses has no determined hour, but only when necessary, by day or by night, at all hours and times;
and it is not fitting to bleed children until fourteen years of age, nor pregnant women except from the fourth to seventh month. And elderly people who have passed sixty years should not be bled.
And when someone wishes to be bled, in whatever manner, it is necessary that they cleanse their intestines with a gentle clyster, if they have retained much waste, so that the veins do not draw impurities from the intestines, harmful to the principal limbs;
Nor should those who are overly full of food, nor those who are drunk, as long as they are still intoxicated, nor those suffering from dropsy, be bled.
And one should refrain from bleeding after a colic attack, and vomiting, and bowel movements, and an abundance of menstruation in women, and childbirth, and fatigue, and fasting, and whatever has reduced the entire strength, either through exertion or illness of the body.
Then, if the blood is thick,  thin it out with food and drinks and medicines, if you have the power to do so.
Then, if nothing prevents it, enter a bath to thin the blood, and bleed from the vein near the breast, in the middle part, as we have said.
And keep yourself free from work, exertion, lust, and similar things that day.
And be relaxed and joyful, and let the leeches be higher than the person being bled, and rub the arm twice or three times, then tighten the bandage moderately, for if it is too tight or loose, the blood will not flow.
And then rub the area with your hands until the veins swell and are felt.
Then the leeches soak the flame with a little bit of old oil, then place their left hand finger on the vein under the area where they want to bleed, so the vein does not break when the instrument strikes.
For there are veins that flee like strings when bled, and some that are full of wind, so that when the flame is applied, it recoils from the flame, and the vein cannot be opened, and it is like that. And if he opens the vein, the wound is too narrow, therefore the leeches must be careful in these things.
And if the vein opens the first time, that's good. If not, he starts again a little below that place, or above it quickly, if the area isn't swollen.
And if the area is swollen, and the patient is frightened, he leaves it for one or two days, and does not tie the arm. Perhaps a hot abscess will come.
Do not enter a bath, then restart the bleeding if it pleases him.
And if the opening is small, or the blood flows subtly, and you doubt that it will not bleed as much as you want, then apply the flame directly to that opening.
And work a little quickly, before the area becomes swollen. For this happens many times when the wound is small.
If you see the area swollen, do not restart the bleeding, and put a little oil clay on it, for it lessens the body of blood, and the clay is milder in this place than oil.
And so apply oil clay to each bleeding that you bleed the veins, to stop the flow of blood;
And this same thing does heal and soothe them when put on the area. So subtle is the blood and it parts when it is too thick.
And if there comes a large abscess, which happens often, especially when it has not been bled sufficiently only at that time when the opening of the vein is small, then hurry, and place a sponge moistened in hot water and salt on the area and press it for an hour.
And it is necessary that you do this after the blood issues from the vein, and if any blackness or greenness remains in the area after a few days, it does not harm at all. And if you wish, put some aloes or myrrh mixed with juice of calamint, or similar, on it.
And many times, abscesses and appearances occur with the bleeding of the basilica.
Then place your hand over it, and if you find the area soft when pressing with your hand, that appearance is bad. Therefore, you should not put anything of what we have mentioned on it, for perhaps it is a cut from an artery.
But make a dry poultice to harden the area, then treat it with other remedies until it is healed.
And draw out each drop of blood according to the quantity of its virtue and the color of the blood.
For if the blood is black, let it flow out until it is red. And if you see it thick, let it flow until it becomes thin. And if it is too hot, let it cool down.
And it is necessary for the one who is strong and full, and needs bloodletting, that a larger wound be made, and the incisions be wide.
And for the one who is weak, do the opposite, and it must be bled little and often, and it should be bled by slicing across, not by pricking.
And this manner of bleeding is safe from the flow of blood and the cutting of nerves, and is better than bleeding from the long or the wide.
And to the one whose body weakens from bleeding, it is necessary to give bread soaked in pomegranate juice; If he is heated, draw three or four times from his blood. And if he is of a cold temperament, give him bread soaked in syrup of mulled wine, or in aromatic honey syrup with spices like pepper, cinnamon, ginger, and chickpeas, and a well-scented syrup before the bleeding.
And if he faints during the bleeding, after the outflow of much blood, he should sip broth of meat and a subtle fragrant syrup, and use the other things we have mentioned in the division or chapter on syncope, for the evacuation of veins.
And if he wants to release his arm, and bleed again, it is necessary, when he is weakened by much bleeding, that he bleed little by little, according to the quantity of his continued strength.
And whoever wants to release his arm after the first bleeding, and he has a strong body, he should bleed seven hours after the first bleeding, or after the ninth hour.
And whoever wants to bleed from another part, should bleed on the second or third day.
For there is much blood within the body that is already heated, and causes fever; so it is necessary to draw a large quantity, and to enlarge the opening so that it drips in a pan; Then, once you have observed all the conditions of bleeding, and place your hand on his pulse while he bleeds, lest death come in place of the pan, and this happens many times, when the bleeder is negligent;
and it is not necessary, when you wish to release the arm, and make blood come out a second time, and the opening is closed, that you press strongly on it; nor if it is bent, that he extends the arm hastily, for that would be bad;
but leave it until he bleeds a second time; or you prick it with the tip of the flame, until the blood that is congealed at the opening of the vein flows freely, and place a little of the oil diluted in water on it, and press lightly.
And if the vein is swollen, leave it and do not bind it, until the abscess is calmed.
And if it is necessary to draw blood a second time, let it bleed in that same place, or in another vein, or in the other arm.
The vein in the middle of the arm is lanced instead of the vein of the head because it is composed.
And the manner of bleeding is that the patient puts his hand in warm water, until the vessels are red;
then it is tied moderately, so that the vein appears well, then bleed through the middle, not from the side nor from the length;
and let the opening be wide, and let it bleed close to the joint of the hand, and if blood cannot come out, then put the hand back in warm water, and let the blood flow into the water, until you have enough;
and if it is in summer, do not put the hand back in warm water, for it is put more in winter than in summer;
and the bleeding from this vein is safer than any other vein, for there is neither artery nor nerve in it.
Bleeding from the vein on the right hand's palm is good for all diseases of the liver, and this is the method:
Hold the hand, and put it in warm water, until the vein is swollen, so that it can be seen; and if the blood flows across, and if you cut it completely through, nothing will harm;
and do not go too deep, because the nerves are beneath, completely bare of flesh, and then return the hand to warm water, if the blood is frozen in the wound, and cannot come out.
And when you have drawn as much blood as you need, put oil and wax over the vein to quickly close it, and do the same for each vein.
The bleeding in the left hand is as effective for the illness of the mouse, and do everything in the same way as I told you for the right one.
Bleeding from the temple is effective for all illnesses below the body, such as those of the marrow, and retention of flowers, and ailments of the kidneys, thighs, and old legs, and similar ailments.
And the quality of this bleeding is that the patient puts their foot in hot water, and rubs the vein until it breaks, and ties above the joint of the foot; and the vein is at the ankle, and many veins go above the foot;
Bleed then in the larger vein, or at the ankle, whichever is better.
And if you bleed above the foot, beware of the nerves below, and bleed across as if cutting;
And let the flame be gentle.
And if the blood cannot come out, then immerse the foot in water and let the vein empty well.
And if the bleeding fails the first time, recommence above a little bit the second time, for the place is salty;
and do not fear the nerve, as we have said, and thus do the same with the vein of the other foot likewise.
The place of the sciatic vein is at the heel of the foot, and its bleeding is worth the pain of the hip, when it is for hot blood.
And the quality of its bleeding is that the patient enters a bath, and squeezes above the ankle with four fingers by twisting, for otherwise the vein does not appear;
and if it appears, then bleed it in all the ways that you can, and by crossing [the vein]; and it is better that you cut it, for the place is safe, and it is very responsive to the hands.
and it is better that you cut it, for the place is safe, and it is very responsive to the hands. And if you do not find it, bleed any vein that appears on the back of the foot, and towards the little toe, and beware of the nerves;
and make as much blood run as you want, and then loosen the ligature, and put on cotton and bind it; It is now bled.
Cupping is done with horns, or with bronze, or with glass;
and cupping is done in two ways: either by striking and drawing blood, or without striking.
And this cupping without striking is in two ways: either by complete fire, or without fire;
And cupping which is done by striking and drawing blood is done in fourteen places of the body, of which one is right on the top of the head; and another is in the middle of the neck; and two others on the two sides of the neck; and the cupping under the chin; and the cupping on the two shoulders; and cupping on the hips; and cupping between the two arms; and cupping on the two legs; and cupping on the two ankles;
and cupping does not draw much blood, except from small veins scattered in the flesh, and therefore does not weaken one, like bloodletting from a vein; and it should not be administered, neither with nor without fire, in any disease resulting from fullness, until the whole body is emptied.
And if cupping is necessary for illness or custom, we administer it each hour at the beginning of the month, or at the end, and in between, and at all times;
for there are some who, when they need to be cupped, have a heavy head;
and there are some who find fullness and redness in their face, and in their head, and neck, and darkness in their eyes;
and some who find a drop of blood in their mouth, and have a swollen tongue, and bleed; and there are some who dream, and see at night blood and wounds and death and similar things.
And when we see these signs, and especially when it is in the middle of the month, we command them to be cupped after three hours of the day.
The leech from the temple helps the headache... that comes to the eyes, and it is not necessary for this to be after the evacuation of the whole body;
and this cupping is in the place of the leeching of the cephalic vein, and it is not necessary for those who are of cold complexion to use it, or who have a cold, for this does them much harm;
and for this reason, it is not necessary for the elderly to use it, nor those who have cold illnesses in their head.
And those who often bleed themselves become forgetful, and for this reason, the cupping must be placed a little lower, due to the fear of forgetfulness.
Cupping in the neck is in place of bleeding from the head and the basilic vein, and for this reason it is good for chest tightness, and for splitting of the windpipe, and for coughs, and for congestion.
And it must be applied gently, for if it holds too firmly, it causes forgetfulness in the stomach and heart.
Cupping on the second ribs of the neck is good for headaches, and eye pain and migraines, and for strangulation, and pain in the roots of the teeth, and is in place of bleeding from the basilic vein.
And you must instruct the patient to press his hand when applying it, so that he does not cut the artery, and no bleeding occurs.
Cupping under the chin is good for mouth ailments, and for gum problems, and similar maladies in the mouth. And it is in place of bleedings from the two lips.
Cupping on the shoulders is good for ailments caused by heat and fullness.
Cupping on the elbows is as effective as cupping the three veins of the arm, for it draws blood from these large veins.
And instruct the master not to pierce too deeply, for the spot is bare of flesh, and lies beneath nerves and arteries.
A cupping on the rump is effective for hemorrhoids of the fundament, and for ailments underneath, and the cupping must be large, and of brass, so that it is capable of drawing well. And perhaps, if it were thin, it would break. and it makes great wounds.
Cupping on the legs bleeds openly, for they draw blood from the whole body, and are effective for old pains of the kidneys, and of the bladder, and of the groin, and resolve the inflammation.
And they are in place of the two hips, and the two ankles, and nevertheless they weaken the body after long use, and cause weakness in various conditions.
The manner of applying the cupping is that you first place it empty, and gently suck, and quickly apply it, and move it equally, and do not cease from this doing until you see the place reddened and swollen, and the redness of the blood appears.
Then cease, and replace the cupping glasses, and be wary of the condition of the bodies, for there are some who have tender flesh, and clear pores. If so, only one strike is needed, and it is necessary to make wide wounds, and slightly deep. And suck gently.
And if the blood is thick, it is necessary to strike twice. The first time to make the path of the thick blood thinner.
And if the blood is very thick, it is necessary to strike a third time.
And when we want to draw little blood bit by bit, we need only one strike. And if we want a lot of blood, we must begin again often.
And if the blood is thick, strike deep, and the end result may be that the heart is pierced suddenly, and it is necessary for those with thick, hard skin and narrow pores to anoint the places of the leeches with an appetizing and dissolving oil. if it is in this condition, with violet oil, or sweet almond oil, or oil of gourd seed;
and if it is in winter, with oil of cress, or lilies, or chamomile, or something similar.
And if the superfluity is thick and cold, take bitter oil, or balsam oil, or anise oil, and the like.
And if the one who is being treated has tender skin and wide pores, one should not put any oil on it, but should wash it after the leeching with rose water, or cold water, or morelle water, or gourd water, or porcelain water, or something similar.
And he who has much moisture, let him rise with rue, or myrtle water, and sumac, and similar things.
And those who have large superfluities rise with old wine, or water of seuc, or decoction of anise or chamomile, or other similar things;
and one should not bleed with a cupping glass before or during a bath, but after the bath an hour or two;
and do not sleep after the leeching, and he must wash himself when he is to be leeched and when he is leeched.
And beware if the one who is bled is choleric, and if the blood is too sharp and inflamed; if it is necessary that he take cold things, such as pomegranates and endives and lettuces in season, and similar things; and eat purslane, and hare meat, and moist foods.
and eat purslane, and hare meat, and moist foods. And he who has a cold complexion, let him take syrup of honey, and medium-aged, fragrant wine, which is between old and new, and eat little, and eat purslane and small birds and pigeons;
and the day that he will have a bowel movement, let him drink more than eat;
and it is necessary to give some men sometimes triacle or nutmeg before the bowel movement, or afterwards, to strengthen the main limbs; and let the blood be thinned, but it is not fitting for those who are hot to drink it.
The cupping that is placed without striking is that which is placed on the liver, and on the gout, and on the belly and the bottom and the kidneys and the hip, because those members do not bear to be struck on them, and one does it only to draw blood from member to member, as we place them on the breasts when the nipple bleeds;
to remove the viscosity that is in the member, as we place cupping on the belly and on the bottom to lessen the member;
and it removes the pain, when there is obstruction or stone, so it removes by its attractive virtue perhaps the obstruction, or loosens the stone from its place;
and thus it does when it is placed on the liver and on the gout when there is retained wind, and these cupping are administered empty just to suck; and sometimes they are administered with fire, and sometimes filled with warm water, as in illnesses of the pleurisy, and in such a way that one fills the cupping with warm water alone, or with water in which suitable herbs have been boiled.
The form of the cupping administered with fire is thus:
And have two inches wide and a half palm deep, and have on the side near the middle one small hole, just enough to push a needle through, and be of bronze, smooth on the front so that it does not injure the patient when placed on the limb;
and have in the middle a cross-shaped rod of bronze or iron, to place a lit candle on it, and be both large and small according to the illnesses and the age of those who use them;
for the cuppings of children are different from those of the old, and of the thin from the fat.
And one should thus place this cupping on the limb:
light the candle of wax or linen, and put it in the middle of the cupping, through the rod that is in the middle of the cupping, so that the light is at the bottom of the cupping so that it does not burn the patient;
and then put it on the limb, and your fingers be on the opening that we have mentioned, so that when one wants, the vapor goes out, and one removes the cupping;
and one lights the linen as before, and repeats it often, if you need to.
In the cupping, therefore, which is administered in a pleurisy, acute, there is no rod nor opening, and it is not administered otherwise than when it is full of water, and is placed only on the limb;
and this is the form:
Leeches are only administered in limbs where one cannot place cupping due to their smallness, such as lips and gums, and similar places; and in places bare of flesh, such as the toe or the nose, and other similar ones;
and the quality of using them is that when you find leeches that are in clear, fresh water without any puncture, take them;
and place them in fresh water for a while, until they are hungry, and have nothing in their bellies; and then be bled from a vein and cupped, then rub the limb until it is red, and put the leeches on;
and when they are full and fall off, if it is a place where one can put a cupping glass, put one there, for this is very helpful.
If not, then cleanse the area, and then with water, very well, and then wring it out;
and if the area heals too quickly after the leeches, then soak a linen cloth in cool water, and put it on, until the swelling has gone down;
and if the swelling is increased, then put powdered vitriol, or galena, and similar things, until it has gone down;
or you put half of peeled beans on the area, and leave them until they become hot on the spot, then it will stop the swelling;
and if you need more, then take more leeches.
And if the leeches do not want to attach, then rub the area with fresh blood, or you insert a needle until blood comes out, and then put them on, and as soon as they sense the blood, they will attach;
and when you want them to detach, then sprinkle a little powdered aloes and salt, or ash, on them, and they will fall off now.
Here begins the book of fractures. This chapter is many times necessary in the art of medicine, and is about the restoration of fractures and dislocations.
Know, dear son, that the fools mock this chapter, that they have never seen any of the ancient books, nor have they read a letter from them;
and for this reason, the science is estranged in our land, for I have never found any good one;
and I know nothing, except through the knowledge of ancient books, where I have studied so much that I have treated the science, and through experiment, and through the custom of my life;
and I have just described in this chapter what is contained, and have summarized it at the end, and have clearly shown the forms of the instruments that are used, as I have done in these two chapters before.
It is necessary, then, that we say in the prologue of this book the sums of the discourse and the chapters where the wise man sets his understanding, and dwells upon the truth, so that those who are proven may know and learn this noble art, and teach it to others.
I say that when a fracture or dislocation or twisting or crushing occurs to anyone, you must quickly bleed the patient on either side, if nothing prevents you from doing so, such as weakness of the body, or if a child or an elder. or if the time is not too hot, or too cold;
and eat cold foods, that is to say cold meats, and the flesh of birds and roe deer, and drink no wine, nor eat any fatty meats, and do not fill himself too much with foods that fill the veins with blood, so that you do not fear a hot abscess or the spreading of matter to the limb;
so that the patient returns to his former state of health.
And when the broken bone begins to heal, the patient should be nourished with foods that provide substantial nourishment, or that have viscosity, such as cooked wheat in water, and rice, and turnips, and veal feet, and eggs, and fresh fish, and strong wine, and similar things. For with such nourishment the fracture heals more quickly.
And know that broken bones of the elderly and decrepit cannot heal or knit together properly due to the dryness of their limbs, nor those that are too tender, such as the bones of young children;
but there is a cure, by placing strong splints which hold and join the limb together, until it is as strong as it was before; and it is not completely finished with that, and therefore, it is necessary to nourish him with substantial foods, as we have said.
And know that fractures are diverse in many ways.
For a fracture of the head is different from a fracture of the chest or leg, and I will tell you in this chapter all types of fractures. For there are fractures that go inward, and others outward, like the edge of a feather for writing.
For there are fractures that go inward, and others outward, like the edge of a feather for writing. And there are fractures with a wound, and fractures with just a small crack.
And each type has its own device and its own proper instrument for restoration, according to what the memory brings back into place;
And a fracture of the bone is known by the fact that the place is twisted, and is clearly evident by the absence of proper alignment, and sounds when pressed with the hand;
and when there is no twisting or sound on touching, and the patient does not feel much pain, then there is no fracture;
but there can still be twisting, or a crack, or a small fracture. So you should not move it with your hand, but apply the medicines that come next, and then gently hold it still.
And know that a fracture that goes outward, and the two parts are separated, you must now put them in equal alignment, lest a hot abscess result;
and if a hot abscess develops, leave it for a day or so until the abscess subsides;
then put it in alignment as easily and wisely as you can, and know that the mending is easier than when there are pieces;
then hold it still, as is appropriate next.
And if in the bone there are broken pieces, if it is a hand or foot, or with your hand if it is a small limb, or with two cords, or with one cord and your hand;
and put the limb in its natural shape, so that when the broken parts of the limb are separated, you bring together all the additions to their places as best you can, and be careful that your work does not cause the patient injury or pain;
and carefully join the two ends of the bones according to the best forms.
And feel it well with your hand if it seems to you that it is not quite right:
if you straighten it beautifully, and do not constrict it too much, nor press as those do whose work causes a hot abscess and contraction in the limb, as we have often seen.
And when the limb is in place, you must properly restrain the patient so that he does not move it, neither while awake nor while sleeping, nor turning, nor in any other way; and carefully watch that the limb is so secure that it feels no pain. For when it feels no pain, it is not quite right, and it must be placed in such a position that it feels no pain;
and carefully watch that the limb is so secure that it feels no pain. For when it feels no pain, it is not quite right, and it must be placed in such a position that it feels no pain; and be careful that it is placed straight, so that no twisting occurs when it is restored;
and the quality of the broken limb is according to what I have told you.
Know that broken limbs are diverse in size and in shape.
For there are small limbs, such as arms and toes and similar ones: so it is necessary to wrap it with soft and thin linen cloths; and those that are large, such as thighs and legs:
so it is necessary to wrap with a wide and strong bandage, for the wide bandages encompass the entire large limb and constrict it evenly on all sides, so that there is no blemish;
then bind around lightweight bandages, three or four turns according to the limb, and gently tighten the entire bandage, then go above the break and tighten it less, so that the break then moves the break slightly away;
and soften the bandage little by little, until you take a large portion of the healthy area, then take another bandage, and turn it around again over the broken area;
then return to the part below the break, and tighten it moderately, neither too tight nor too loose, as we have said in the first chapter above;
then place linen or cloth strips between the bandages until it is all even, then bind everything over the bandage, and then place your well-made dressings over it, if there is no abscess or swelling.
And if there is swelling or an abscess, then put on a thing that calms the abscess, hot, and that removes the swelling, and leave it thus for a few days;
then tighten over your dressings, and let them be of half a wide cane skilfully cut, or of wood from which the planks are made, or of palm fronds, and let them be according to this figure:
but it is necessary that the dressing placed over the break be a little thicker and wider than the others;
and be also as long as necessary for the limb, whether small or large; then tighten over the dressings as you did at the first dressing, then tie over it a thread evenly, just as in the first dressing over the break; tighter on top, gradually less;
and the thread should be medium, neither too thick nor too thin, and made of soft linen;
for if the threads are thick, like the works of fools who make their dressings of twisted linen cords, and that is a great error, for the dressing cannot be even if it is too fine, and it is not right that there should be less than the breadth of a finger between each dressing.
And if the patient is wounded by the edges of the dressings after tightening them in healthy places, then put under them linen or woolen lint, so that he is not wounded.
When the wound is with a fracture, and the bone is broken, I will tell of the cure afterward.
And know that it is not necessary to tighten dressings on all broken limbs on the first day. For when the limb is large, it is not necessary to put tight dressings on it except after 5 or 7 days, or more, according to your certainty of a hot abscess occurring.
and see here the method of the ancient plasters for restoring fracture, dislocation, and twisting:
and it is that you take flour that stays on the mill walls, and mix it with abundance of eggs, and put this mixture, neither too thin nor too thick, and apply it, and this is the common way of the plaster restoring the fracture in many cases, especially for women and young children, for it is neither too hot nor too cold.
Another method of plaster restoring the fracture and dislocation and twisting: take 3 abareis and ladani and enule and asefetide and gum arabic and mugat, each 10 ounces; myrrh and aloes, each 5 ounces; alechil 8 ounces; and make it into powder, and mix it with the white of an egg; if the man's complexion is hot, then use this plaster, for it is of good composition, and quickly restores broken bones, and is of benefit to many men.
Another type of plaster that is good for a sprain: take mugwort and marshmallow, each 10 ounces; myrrh and aloes, each 9 ounces; frankincense 6 ounces; Armenian bole 10 ounces, and grind well, and mix with wine or abundant egg white, and administer.
Another way of plaster for joints and bones separated from their places, and alleviates the pain that occurs, and the wear and tear of the bone, and the fracture: Take new wool, and soak it in warm oil and cooked oil, and put it on the affected area.
These plasters do not restore, but they are good for calming a hot abscess, and properly relieving the pain.
Another way of plaster which restores broken bones: Take dried fig leaves and leaves of the earth-pepper, and grind them together, and make a plaster.
Another type of plaster for the restoration of broken bone and for lessening the remaining abscess. Take root of mallow, chamomile, violet flowers, and vetch flour, of each one part;
and grind them, and mix with wine, and if the limb is inflamed, then mix it with moist coriander water or water, and use it.
Another stronger plaster than the first, when a hard abscess comes to the restoration of the limb. Take roots of mallow, and flaxseed, balaustine, melilot, and sanicle, and violet flowers and chamomile, of each one part; and grind them, and mix with salt water, or fresh water, or wine, according to the heat of the limb and its rest.
Hippocrates says in his book that one should not put on a broken limb to restore strength anything other than a cerote made of wax and oil, and nothing else, and says it should be neither too soft nor too hard.
And Galen seems to say that one should put on a broken limb, for restoration, slightly warm dry things, such as myrrh and aloes and frankincense and similar things, as we have said.
Another kind of poultice that is good for injury and pain: Take mugwort and chopped human hair, or bird feathers, and mallow, and equal amounts of flax, and grind them, and make a poultice and apply it.
And then remove it a little later, and watch if the patient feels no pain, nor has the bone shifted from its place; if not, do not remove it for several days. And if pain comes to the place, or itching, lack of rest or swelling, then hurry, and remove it, and take off the poultice immediately;
and take a light cloth, and a wet sea sponge, and dip it in water, and bathe the area, until the itching stops, and the pain is calmed; then let the limb rest for an hour, then place dry wool, soaked in water or rose oil, and bind it for a night, until you are sure of a hot abscess;
and the inflammation of the limb subsides, and the pain is gone, then recommence the subtle binding, and a little of the poultice, and do not bind it as tightly as before; and continue subtly until it is healed.
And if you see that the hot abscess, redness, pain, and swelling are completely gone, and you need a poultice and bandage, then recommence it just as you did before.
And if nothing from what we have said happens to the limb, do not unbind it until after three or four or five or seven days. and sometimes leave it twenty days, according to what is seen, until the fracture heals, and the joining of the flesh approaches;
then restrain it more than before, and let its flesh grow, as I said before;
and if you see the place drying more than necessary, know that nourishment cannot come; apply then warm water, every time you unbind it, and do so every third day, and loosen a little the bandage;
by this work then nourishment flows to the limb, and quickly corrects what the foolish physicians do, who restore the limb wrongly:
This is bad, and such work is frightening, and I see nothing else but to leave it alone and work rightly.
Many ways of fractures exist, and diverse shapes, and the causes are distinct.
For there are fractures caused by a sword blow, and the collarbone breaks all the bone down to the surface beneath the bone, as a log or shaft does. And therefore this type of fracture is called a "haichure".
Where the sword cuts the bone from above, piercing through, and this type of fracture is called "absolute".
And the wound from these two fractures is great or small.
And if there is a penetrating blow, or a fissure, or from the impact of a stone, or from falling on a stone, or other similar things.
And if there is a penetrating fracture, which approaches the membrane beneath the bone, or it is on the bone, and this wound is either large or small.
And if there is a wound that is notched in the bone as thin as a hair, and the fissure is small, and for this reason this fracture is called "capillary";
and if the wound is made either by hitting with a stone, or by falling, or by a similar thing, and forces a piece of bone inward, and the place is splintered as when a blacksmith hits pots; if between the stones inside.
And this happens more to those who have moist bones, such as a child's head;
and happens in all these types of fractures that small pieces are separated like splinters; and I will speak in its place.
And we know all types of fractures by the pulling on them, and the investigation of their coverings, and by the corrupted flesh that is on them.
The similar fracture is known by this, that when one has uncovered the bone, and rubs the surface, the fracture shows black.
In the treatment of the fracture, pay attention to the patient's symptoms, and if you see any bad symptoms, such as vomiting of phlegm, loss of awareness, stretching, sweating, acute fever, the eyes turning white and red, and other similar conditions in various dispositions, then healing is doubtful.
And if you do not see a dreadful symptom, and hope for healing, then begin the treatment.
And when the injured person comes to you first, and it is in winter, you must remove the bone before the fourteenth day if you can.
And if it is in summer, hurry to remove the bone before the seventh day, lest the tissue beneath the bone become corrupted, and the symptoms we have mentioned appear.
And if the fracture of the bone reaches the tissue covering the brain, then you must split the fractured part thus:
and that you take the head of the wounded patient, and uncover the bone in every way you can, and with the greatest gentleness over the shape of the wound, and if a discharge of blood comes when uncovering the bone, or a hot abscess, assist with what is necessary, and that you fill the place with cloths soaked in rose oil; and allow the wound to rest until the hot abscess is calmed, and be sure of any discharge of blood; then begin around the bone to remove it, and this is done according to two types of work:
One method is that you cut with a narrow incision in front, and this is the form:
And then you make a second incision larger than the first.
And the second method is that you have several different incisions, some narrow and others wide, and they should be pointed, and made with a sharp iron;
and work gently, so that you do not injure the head.
And if the bone is hard and tough, you must pierce around it, before you apply incisions with drills, not so deep that they pierce through the bone of the head, and there should be a margin or a circle above the point, which does not let the point pass through the bone;
and you must have several, so that each one goes in its place in the thickness of the bone, so that you have drills for all heads;
and this is the shape of the three types of drills:
The quality for piercing around the fractured bone is that you place a drill on the bone, and turn with your fingers until you know that the bone is pierced;
then reposition the drill slightly afterwards, and do this all around, then cut with the chisels the space of the bone which is between the holes, and do this more subtly than you can, and lightly, as we have said, until you pull the bone with your hand, or with any of the instruments that you have, such as pliers, pincers;
and be careful that you do not touch the brain or the marrow.
And when you have pierced and pulled the bone, it is necessary to remove the remaining sharpness of the bone with any other instrument similar to a chisel, but it must be thinner and finer than the other chisel;
and if any small bones or scales remain, remove them gently with one of the instruments; then treat the wound with ointments and dressings that we have mentioned.
And the other method of work is that which Galen describes, which is safer; and hold it very tightly, and that is his word. First, you must uncover a part of the bone, where the fracture is clearly visible, so that when you have uncovered that part, you shall place under the head of this lancet a lens-shaped implement, of which this is the form:
And do not cut from one side only, but let the edge be sharp on two sides, so that the cutting edge faces the bone;
then strike gently with a small mallet from above, so that you cut the bone slightly all around, and take good care of the cloth that is underneath;
if it adheres to the bone, then remove it gently, because it is removed well without injury and without fear.
And if the fracture of the bone does not pierce through the cloth, and the bone is only cut on the surface, and there are small pieces, then you must smooth over that roughness and remove the flakes with a fine rasp, of which you should have various sizes, to administer the most suitable one in each place, according to the work and the shape of the fracture.
So use larger rasps first, and then finer ones afterwards, and do not cease doing this until it is well done.
In each of the other cuts and subtle fractures, you must apply the remedy according to its alignment;
and this is something not easily understood by those who have devoted themselves to this art.
And if the surface is exposed, then you should take a linen cloth, according to the size of the wound, and soak it in rose oil, and place it over the wound; then take another cloth doubled in two or three, and soak it in wine and rose oil, and place it over the first cloth; and do this as gently as possible, so you do not burden the surface, then apply another bandage over it, and do not bind it too tightly, only so that it holds the wound;
and leave it like this for one or two days, until the inflamed abscess is calmed, then remove it, and apply medicines such as lily roots, and vetch flour, and incense powder, and aristolochia, and similar things;
and from these things make a powder, and place it over the wound, and apply more medicines without causing irritation;
and watch that the wound is kept clean, that you do not leave any ointment there, nor allow any pus to collect, for when pus collects on the brain's membrane, it will rot and fester, and cause the patient great harm;
for when one places a biting thing on the surface, it will burn through it. Beware then, if any bad accident comes to the patient, as we have said, it is doubtful without a doubt.
And if blackening does not occur except because of the medicine that was placed on it, that such virtue has it, then you must take one part of honey, and three parts of rose oil and mix it with one bandage, and put it on the surface; then treat it with the kinds of remedies that are necessary, until it is healed.
Know that sometimes both parts of the nose are broken, or just one, because there are two bones.
and the one underneath is cartilaginous, and does not break, it only bends or twists, and then heals.
And if one of the two parts is broken, then you must put your little finger into the nostril, and place the broken part inside your index finger, and pull gently outwards, until the nose returns to its natural shape; and do this gently, and be careful that the patient does not feel pain from your work.
And if the break is in the upper part of the nose, and your finger cannot reach the place, then you must place it even with the head of a small, somewhat thick stick.
And if the break is in two parts, then do the same again, and hurry to restore it on the first day, if you can.
if not, after the seventh or tenth day, when the inflamed abscess is calmed, then tie strips of linen to the head of the nose, if the break is in one part.
Or you put one on the other side, if the break is there. and let the strips be so large that they fill the openings of the nose.
And some healers say that the strips should be soaked in butter, and changed each day. It does not seem to me that this is good, but they should be soaked in a mixture of egg white and mill powder. Then leave the strip until the bone is firm, and the cartilage hardened.
And sometimes goose feathers are placed in the nose instead of strips, and a soft cloth is wrapped around it, and the fracture is held, and the patient blows through it. Or do what you want.
And if a hot abscess comes to the nose while you work on it, put a plaster or moistened cotton in rose oil, or a little diachylon.
And if a hot abscess does not come, put a plaster on the outside, made of chickpea flour and incense powder, mixed with a little egg white. Then place light wool over it, and do not bandage the nose.
And if the fracture of the nose is small, and it is broken into small pieces, remove it with appropriate instruments, then stitch the fracture, and treat the wound with healing substances, such as appropriate plasters and ointments.
And if there is no wound inside the nose, treat it with tents, and insert lead strips until it is healed.
When the jaw is broken from below, and there is no external wound, and the fracture is only superficial, and not broken into two, except for small fragments inside, it can be easily identified.
It is necessary, if the fracture is on the right side, that you put your index finger into the patient's mouth; and if the fracture is on the left jaw, then put your right index finger in, and gently push the fracture inward, and smooth it out with the other hand from the outside, and make it level.
And if the jaw fracture is separated into two, then it is necessary that you apply extension to both sides, until they are equal.
And if movement of the teeth occurs, or breakage, bind them with a gold, silver, or silk thread, then place a plaster over the broken jaw, and place a double bandage on top; and place a large, well-made splint, or a piece of equal leather, long and wide according to the jaw, and bind it on as tightly as you can, and tell the patient to rest, and eat light foods.
And if you see that the shape changes, then unbind it on the third day, and then reset what has been changed. and place a plaster on top, of the mill's powder with plenty of egg or chickpea flour, after you have removed the plaster.
and place light wool over the plaster, and if the plaster heals, and the patient's condition does not change, leave it until they are healed. Many times they are healed in three weeks.
And if a hot abscess comes, administer what we have said many times.
And if there is a fracture and wound together, examine if any piece of the bone has been removed; so subtle is the removing with appropriate instruments for this.
And if the wound is narrow, widen it with fire according to your need.
And when you have removed all these pieces, and none remain, close the wound, if it is large, and apply suitable dressings to it, to encourage healing, until it is healthy.
The forceps break many times before, towards the shoulder, and the breakage is in three ways:
where it is broken and separated into two, and there are pieces, and it is the easiest to restore;
or there is a break with a wound.
And the work is when the break is without a wound, that you have two assistants, so that one holds the shoulder that feels the broken forceps; and the other extends the neck towards the part;
then place the break even with your fingers, so that the shape is as it should be, and there is neither appearance nor completion.
And if you need to extend it further, place a round sphere of cloth, or wool, under the patient's shoulder, and it should be thick according to your need; and extend and lift the forceps, and grasp the sphere in your hand, so that you place the break even, as it should be.
And if you cannot pull the head of the forceps out, because it has gone deep, then the patient must lie often on their back, and place a moderate pillow under the shoulder, and the assistants push the shoulder down, until the bone of the forceps is lifted.
And then straighten the break with your fingers, and if you find it broken, you must split it open.
and draw the pieces gently, and if the bones cannot join despite any effort, split them with one of the scalpels you have. but place this instrument under the forceps, to protect its surface.
and it resembles a spoon, and is not sharp, and be as wide as necessary, according to the size of the bone and the strength of the work;
and have two ends, as you see, and one is wide, and the other narrow, as is the break in the wound you made when you pulled the bones;
and when you are sure of a hot abscess, cauterize the wound, and if the break is small, or you doubt a hot abscess, fill the wound with bandages and tents, according to its quantity.
And if a hot abscess comes, soak the bandages in rose oil and vinegar and wine, and put them on.
The tightening of the bone, when it is without wounds and cuts, is that you put on the bone a plaster of mill powder and egg white, and put light swabs on top, and put a splint under the joint if you need it; then take a very wide bandage, one palm wide, then put a double bandage over the swabs, and the plaster; then take a thin stick three fingers wide and long, and wrap it around that bandage, so that the end of the bandage hangs down; and place the stick on the fracture, and turn the bandage over the shoulder, and under the healthy armpit, and under the injured armpit; and tie it firmly from each part, and when you see that the bandage holds the fracture properly, and you clearly see that the stick does not move over the broken bone, then check it every day, and when the swelling subsides, then tighten it;
and have the patient lie on his back, and put a small pillow under his armpit when he sleeps, to raise the shoulder upwards; this will ease the fracture from the force by lifting the shoulder, or you bind the arm to the neck, and do not untie it until twenty days have passed unless a bad accident happens;
then reapply the plaster if you see that it needs it, and tighten and leave it like that until it is restored;
and it is restored in at most twenty-eight days, and in less time in some men.
of the fracture of the shoulder
Sometimes the shoulder breaks in a wide area or in the middle, and it is not known to be broken except by touch;
if you align it according to the shape of the fracture, and reposition it according to its natural form, in all the ways you can;
then put on the area flour from the mill with plenty of egg, and light bandages, and put over it a double cloth; then put over it a broad, thin board, a little wider than the shoulder, and if under the board there is any protrusion on the shoulder, fill that protrusion with linen bandages, so that the board lies flat;
and then bind it tightly with a large bandage, so that the board does not move from its place, and check the binding every day;
and every time it softens, bind it, and make the board even if it is out of place, and let the patient lie on their side;
and the shoulder is restored in 20 or 25 days.
And when this number is complete, unbind it, and be sure, for it is not bone that easily displaces itself.
And if a piece of the bone protrudes forward, and is just below the skin, it is opened, and the bone is removed, and do what we have said in the breaking of the forcelet, to soothe a hot abscess.
of the breaking of the breast.
The breast is sometimes broken in the middle, but this happens rarely; but it often breaks on the outside.
And when it is broken in the middle, it descends downwards, and the patient feels great pain, and lack of breath, and nausea, and perhaps vomits blood, and the breakage in the broken bone is apparent, and one can feel it well.
And the restoration is that the patient often lies on their back, and one places a cushion between the shoulders, then presses the shoulders, and brings the ribs of the two ribs together with your hands, and skillfully ensures it is aligned in every way that you can, until the shape of the bone is as it should be;
then place dressings and bandages over the fine layer of salt, or another light material, and wrap it in a cloth, and bind it over the broken bone so that it does not move; and turn the bandage around the back, and tighten it appropriately, and check the bandage every hour, and if it loosens, tighten it;
and if it needs loosening, due to a corrosion or an itching that comes to the area, or pain or an abscess, then hurry and loosen it, and remove the dressing, and correct whatever has come in the way of cures;
then reapply the dressing, and tighten it until it is healed.
of the fracture of the ribs
Know that the fracture of the ribs usually occurs only in the thick areas next to the spine, and towards the inside, and only bends because they are brittle; and one feels it well by examining the sides.
And the restoration is that you put the fracture in alignment, as is appropriate. And then apply the plaster, and bind it tightly with a bandage, if you need one.
And if the fracture of the ribs is tilting inward, the patient feels intense pain and stabbing, as if from a wound, because the bone pierces the tissue; and breathes with difficulty, and coughs and vomits large amounts of blood, and it is a serious illness, and the ancients have applied great effort to it.
And some say that you should administer foods that inflate the stomach, to push the fracture outward.
We do not do this, lest a hot abscess occur, if one has not already. And if one has occurred, then treat it.
And some among you say that cupping should be applied to the area, to draw out strongly, and this seems reasonable. However, there is doubt that the cupping will draw out the superfluities to the area because of the weakness of the disposition.
And some among you say that the area should be covered with wool soaked in warm oil, and tents are placed between the ribs to evenly wrap the bandage, then be treated with the treatment for pleurisy, with diet and medicine.
And if the patient feels intense pain that he cannot endure because the bone pierces the flesh, and there is doubt in the patient, then it is necessary to cut open the area of the broken rib, and it is necessary to place an instrument underneath to protect the surface.
And then one should saw the bone, and pull gently, and then sew the two edges of the wound, if it is large, and treat it with plasters until it is healed.
And if a hot abscess comes, then place damp cloths in rose oil, and put on the area.
and treat the area as is appropriate for an abscess, and let him lie often on the side where it is, until he is healed.
and also in the spine of the back.
And when this happens to someone, and you wish to know if they will be healed or not, watch carefully if you see their hands softened and swollen and lifeless, and they cannot move or extend them, and when you prick them with a needle, they don't feel it.
Know that it is fatal in several ways, and if they move and feel well when they are squeezed and pricked, know that the joint of the bone is sound, and that the patient will be cured if treatment is applied.
And if a similar thing happens to the spine of the back, and you wish to know if they will be healed or not, watch carefully if the feet are softened, and if the accidents are there as in the hands, and on the back there is an eruption of wind and expulsion without will;
and when it is pressed on their belly, there will be expulsion without will. And when it is pressed on their back and they want to sit up, they cannot. Know that it is fatal: so do not labour in their cure.
And if these accidents do not befall them, the matter is less serious.
And the treatment is that, if there is a hot abscess, you apply rose oil or egg oil to it until it is calmed;
then apply one of the comforting and drying plasters, and bind it with a bandage, and instruct the patient to rest; and do not sleep on that part where he feels the pain, until he is healed.
And if any bone is separated, it is necessary to cut around the affected area; and remove the bone, then bring the two edges of the wound together, if it is large, with stitches, and then treat it with an ointment that draws out flesh until it is healed;
and if the head of the bone is broken, which is called the "head of the knee," put the thumb of your left hand in it, and place it as equal as possible to the other hand, then place the plaster and bandage on it, if you need them;
then restrain it, and if there is a separated bone, cut it open, and remove it, and treat the wound until it is healed.
of the fracture of the hip bone
Sometimes the hip bone is fractured, and if it happens, there is not much damage to the head; and it breaks lengthwise, and shifts inwards, and causes the patient pain at the site, and throbbing, and swells that which is broken.
And the restoration is that you extend your hand above, so that you are above the fracture; and know what the fracture is and its shape;
and if the fracture is only at the head, then place that fracture evenly, so that it is in its natural shape.
And if the fracture is lengthwise, or if it shifts inward, then lay the patient on their stomach, until the restoration of that fracture is prepared for you. And when you have placed it evenly, then apply a plaster, then place a splint of wood or leather, and bind the fracture, so that it does not move;
and fill the space under the ribs, so that the limb is even. And instruct the patient to sleep on their healthy side, or on their back.
And if a hot abscess comes there, do not touch it, until the hot abscess is calmed, and put on what we have said before; and then return to the restoration, and bind it as is necessary, if there is no bad accident;
of the fracture of the shoulder
The shoulder is that which is between the ribs and the head of the shoulder, and if it is fractured, it must be restored according to one of the two manners:
one of which is that you take a piece of wood of medium thickness, according to this form:
And tie two ends to two points, and hang them upwards, and let the patient sit on a seat;
then lay the broken arm on the wood, until it comes to the armpit, and have a curve of wood in the middle, then hang it on something heavy, or the assistant should extend it downward;
then let the assistant put the fracture equal to his hands together, so that the fracture returns as it should.
And another method is that the patient is supported on a support, and the hand is tied to the neck, then order two assistants, one to hold what is above the fracture in their hands, and the other to hold below at one end, and extend each in their own direction.
And if you wish the extraction to be more forceful, then tighten one end below the fracture, and one above the fracture, and each of the assistants extends in their direction.
And if the fracture is near the head of the shoulder, you must place one bandage under the armpit, and another towards the side, below the fracture;
and also if the fracture is towards the side, you must lightly apply a bandage, without effort, until the fracture is even in its place, and towards the side;
then place the fracture evenly, as it should be, and tighten it, if no abscesses develop.
And if a festering abscess arises, do not tighten it for seven days, and apply wool soaked in oil and rose oil, until the festering abscess is soothed;
then tighten it, and the manner of tightening it is that you place a plaster over the fracture, then bring the arm up towards the shoulder, and place your hand on the shoulder or on the chest;
and apply the bandage, and tighten it on the shoulder, and on the arm, so that the arm is in its proper position, if nothing prevents it, or if the bone is not displaced.
And if you doubt that the bone will move, use splints, and place over the fracture a splint wider and stronger than the others, and have one finger's breadth between each splint, and let each splint be so large that it extends three fingers' breadth beyond the fracture on each side;
then tighten over the splints, as I said at the beginning of the chapter concerning the fracture, more strongly and less as you move away.
And if you see the placement of the splints and the tightening, as we have said, at the time that you restore the fractured limb, and you fear a hot abscess, leave it to be bound until the seventh day, as we have said;
then check the bandage every three days, that no itching or swelling comes to the place, or that the nourishment cannot come to the limb because it is too tight. If it straightens, as we have said.
And if no such accidents come, do not loosen it until after three days or more, and let the patient sleep on their back, and have their hands on their stomach;
and put under the shoulder one cushion full of wool equally, and watch every hour of the day or night that the shape of the broken limb does not move, or that the bandages are not softened;
if it straightens by the virtue of medicine, and give it the food that we have put before, in such a way that the food is subtle at first; and when it begins to recover, let it be thick.
And it is customary that the shoulder and the leg should be recovered in forty days altogether; and then one should unbind it and administer baths and ointments to position the place correctly.
And if the constriction is severe and swollen, it remains unbound for 10 days or 2 months.
of the fracture of the arm
The arm is composed of two bones, which are called the two "forearm bones", one is small, and is the one that supports the wrist;
and the other is large, and is the one that is underneath, towards the small finger;
Perhaps only the large forearm bone is broken, or the small one, and perhaps both together.
When the small forearm bone is broken, the restoration is slight, and the healing;
and when the large one is broken, the healing is bad, and more serious than when they are both broken together.
If it is the small forearm bone that is broken alone, it should be slightly extended, and put straight.
And if it is the large forearm bone, it should be held tighter;
and extend it on a cushion, and keep the thumb higher than the other fingers, and the little finger lower than the other fingers, and let the patient lie across himself, and the cushion in front of him higher, so that the patient does not suffer any labor;
then let the minister extend his arm to the lower part of his hand, or to the middle, and another minister to the other higher.
And then the attendant should put it straight, according to its best form.
And if it is broken into pieces, put each one in its place, and if any are separated that prick the heart, and you cannot restore them to their place, then cut around it and remove it, as we have said before.
And if with the breakage there is a wound, I have spoken of it in the singular chapter; so take the cure.
And if in the beginning of the restoration, hot abscesses arise, apply a bandage of cerote made of rose oil and white wax, neither too hard nor too soft; and bind the bandage gently until the hot abscess is calmed.
And then remove the cerote, and put the plaster of mill powder with plenty of egg, then place the splints, and the splint for the breakage should be stronger and a little wider than the others;
and know that there should be six splints on the arm in several positions: whether the fracture be in one of the bones, or in two;
and hold it more tightly over the fracture than elsewhere, and progressively less as it heals, as I said at the beginning of the chapter; and the bandages over the fracture should be soft and moist, and not hard or rough;
and the bandages over the fracture should be soft and moist, and not hard or rough; and the thread with which it is bound should be linen, neither too thick nor too thin, as we have said.
And watch the limb and the bandage after several days. And if any bad accident comes to the limb, such as itching that comes to the limb, then you must wash the limb with hot water, until the itching is calmed;
and let the limb rest, not too tightly bound.
And then recommence the binding, and if the bandage is softened and the bones separated, or similar things, then adjust it.
And if you observe that nourishment cannot reach the limb because it is too tight, then you must loosen it a little, and leave it like that for a few days, until nourishment flows there, and then tighten it.
And if none of these things that we have said happens to the patient, then do not loosen it until 20 days.
or, otherwise, then he should hold his hands to his neck, and let his arms be equal, and beware of movement and touching, and sleep on his back;
and know that this fracture is restored in 30 days or 35, and perhaps in 20 days, according to the compositions and complexions of the virtues.
of the fracture of the hand
Know that on the back of the hand and at the bases of the fingers, few fractures occur, and only bending happens many times.
And when the palm of the hand is fractured or bent, it is necessary for the patient to sit cross-legged, and sit upright in front of him equally;
then place his hand on the extended surface, and let the attendant extend the broken bones, and align them, the attendant, until they are properly joined;
and apply the plaster and bandages, if no abscess occurs, then place a splint according to the size of the area; and wrap it in a linen bandage.
And if the fracture is within the area around the sole of the foot, make a sphere of bandages, and instruct the patient to hold it against their fractured foot; and then bind it with a long bandage, and let the splint be soft leather as large as the palm of the hand, and bind it, as it should be.
And if the fracture is on the outside, you should place a splint on top and another underneath on the sole of the foot, so that the hand is open and straight, then bandage the whole hand, and tie the bandage between the fingers.
And if the fracture is in any of the bones of the fingers, if it is the thumb, place it straight as is fitting; and bind it with the palm, and if you want, place a small straight splint to lift the fracture, and do not move it;
and if the fracture is in the other fingers, like the index or one of the others, place it straight and bind it with the healthy finger next to it; or bind them all together in a way that works, or place a splint on it, as with the thumb;
and be careful in the restoration and in the handling of hot abscesses, and treat what comes of it, as I said.
The bone of the thigh is often broken, and this is clearly seen when it twists forward and backward;
and the restoration is done by binding one bandage above the fracture, and another below. And the patient lies on their face, then each attendant extends their bandage equally to their side;
and this is when the fracture is in the middle of the bone.
And if the fracture is close to the root of the thigh, one bandage should be towards the groin, and the other below the fracture.
And also if it is close to the knee, then the bandage should be next to the knee, and the extension should be downward;
then the surgeon should place the bone equal with their two hands, so that it is according to its natural shape, and then apply the plaster, and bandage it, if no abscesses arise there.
And if there is a hot abscess, let it calm down, then return to your work and your treatment; The healing is done in such a manner.
You must wrap around the fracture one hard bandage doubled in two or three, and the excess remains, then turn the leg so that the heel comes to the root of the thigh, and insert one long thread between the thigh and the leg, below the knee, and have the thread's ends on top;
then turn the bandage around the leg and the thigh, then place splints over the fracture, and place a splint over the leg bone;
then fill the empty space between the leg and the thigh with soft cloths to make the constriction equal, then begin to bind tightly three or four turns over the fracture; and the higher you go over the fracture, the less you constrict it;
then tie the two ends of the thread you put between the leg and the thigh, and bind three splints that are above, then go back below to the thread's end, until you get next to the foot;
and constrict it, so that it does not move from its place, then leave it like this, so that neither abscess nor swelling nor any other such thing comes to it. And if any such thing happens, then untie it, and address what comes to it, as we have said many times;
and if there are pieces of bone that prick, it must be removed, if possible; and if one cannot, then it is necessary to cut the place open and draw out the foreign object; and treat it as we have said, until it is healed.
And sometimes the thigh is broken in this way, so that splints are put on it, as in the shoulder and in the arm;
However, in this way of restoration, the patient does not limp.
And know that the thigh is restored in ten days, or a little less or a little more, according to the diversities of the complexions.
Know that in the knee joint there is little breaking, but it bends many times.
And if it breaks, it is not a fissure, nor a hole, and it happens to all wounds, and without wounds, and this one feels well.
And the restoration is that one puts equal those that are broken to their place, as much as it is possible to assemble them.
Then put the plaster, and put a round splint, if you need it, and bind it as necessary, then observe all the treatments we have described in other fractures, such as hot abscesses and similar things. So apply to each accident what is appropriate, until it is healed.
Of the fracture of the leg.
Know that in the leg there are two bones, of which one is called the "shinbone", and the other is called the "fibula".
And there is every kind of fracture as there is in the arm, and for that reason the restoration is like that of the arm equally, and the treatment is all the same. And if the two bones are broken together, the leg twists in all directions.
And if the thin bone is broken, it twists forward.
And if the thick bone is broken, one feels great pain, and one sees it clearly. and it twists downwards.
Then administer extension, and put it straight, and tie the splints equally;
However, if the fracture is severe, and there are several pieces, the extension should be gentler and lighter; and adjust according to your skill.
And when you have completed your work, take two sheaves of wood that encompass the leg on either side, and are the length of the leg from the knee downwards;
then wrap the two sheaves in one bandage above and below, and tie it in the middle also, and with this binding the leg will not deviate to the right or left, and thus it is well;
and some apply a splint the length of the leg, made of wood, and place the leg on it to prevent movement, and this is properly done in fractures where there is a wound;
and move the leg each day to see if there is a hot abscess or other accident; if treat it until it is healed.
of the fracture of the bones of the foot
At the ankle there is no fracture, but to the bones of the foot sometimes comes fracture and to the toes too, and there is only cracking in various positions.
And if a fracture occurs to the bones of the foot, and you see these bones overriding one another, then put the patient's foot on the ground, as if he were going to walk, and then put your foot on his, where the bones are raised, then press it until they return to their places;
then place the plaster and bandages on top, and put a small board under the sole of the foot, two spans wide, then bind it to the foot snugly, after wrapping cloths around, and other things you need.
And when three or four days have passed, untie the bandage, for you will find the bones aligned, whether fractured or dislocated.
And if any of the toes are fractured, restore them, as we have said for the toes of the hand; then place a splint along the length of the fractured toe, and slightly wider, then place the board under the foot, as I said, and bind it snugly;
and if there are two or three, or more, fractured, place a splint on each toe according to its size, wrapped in one linen cloth, and bind the board under the foot; and let it extend above the top of the board, to protect the sole of the foot well.
And you must not forget the other things I have said about other fractures, which we have already discussed; and treat each injury accordingly.
of the fracture of the bone of the finger.
When the bone of a woman's nature is broken, have her sit with her legs spread, then lean her back, and hold her from behind;
then fill the woman's body with cotton, and put as much in as it can hold;
then raise the woman up, and lift her back gently, and then the cotton will come out, until it reaches the entrance to the body, and the bone will return with the cotton;
and when she wants to urinate, remove the cotton, and when she has urinated, put it back in, and do this for seven days or so: and the fracture will be restored, and if you wish, take a sheep's bladder and tie a string to the opening, and put the entire bladder into her body; then blow into the string forcefully, until the bladder is inflated inside: the body will return the fracture;
then fill it with cotton, and leave it thus for a few days, until it is healed.
And when the bone of the man's finger, or woman's, is broken, restore it thus as we have said for the hip bone;
and these fractures are not hidden to him who applies study and practice to it and attends to my book.
For the fracture signifies in many ways the right path to restoration: Understand it then.
In the finger, when it is broken, take a goose's throat and put the finger in it; then wrap cloths around it, and leave it three days or more around it, and it will quickly be healed.
of fracture with wound
It is necessary for one who has a fracture with a wound, especially if it is large, such as the bone of the thigh or shoulder or similar, that it be healed quickly, so that the bleedings that we have mentioned testify to this.
And if the wound heals, staunch it with vitriol, if you have nothing else, then resume restoring the fracture at that same hour, or that day, if no festering comes.
And if a festering comes, leave the restoration until the ninth day, so that the festering subsides, and do not touch it on the third or fourth day, for you would cause a bad accident.
And if the broken bone is apparent on the exposed flesh, then you should gently place it back into position with small extensions of your hands.
And if the extensions are not suitable for putting it back in place with your hands, then use this instrument made of iron, which is seven or eight inches long, and the width is according to the size of the wound; and for this, the surgeon needs three or four, according to what he needs in each fracture treatment;
and it should be round and slightly thick, so that it does not bend when pressing on the limb during your work, and be pointed in front, and thick from the middle forward, like this:
And it is called a "palancha", so that the curved end must be placed over the head of the exposed bone; and push it in one go, until it returns to its place, and the ends are equal. And if the fracture is subtle, and the instrument cannot properly grip the bone, you must cut the head of the bone until the instrument has purchase.
And if you cannot return the bone, as we have said, then cut it with a suitable instrument, either a chisel or saw, to your ability;
then remove what remains in the bone of hardness and small fragments.
And when the bone is repositioned, and the patient feels great pain afterward, know that it is not yet in its natural place.
Do so until it is in its place, then soak a cloth in black astringent wine, and properly if it is in the state; and do not put any plaster or other oily substance on the wound, lest it cause rot and corruption;
Then, after restoring the bone, administer bandages, leave the wound uncovered, and cut the covering all around, according to the wound's extent, and take good care that the wound is not constricted by the fracture;
and many times have foolish surgeons done this, and have caused death or ulcers in the patient; and let the constriction be softer and gentler than other fractures.
And if the wound is severe or large, and you fear that bad consequences will arise, as we have stated, and you find pain at the site, you should not put bandages on it; but wrap around, instead of bandages, hard cloths, and tie them.
And when you see pus or swelling forming on the wound after one or two days, remove what you have put on it completely, and apply a healing ointment for wounds, such as a four-herb ointment and similar ones.
And you must loosen the limb twice a day, morning and evening, until it is healed and sound.
And the limb must be positioned so that the pus runs down easily.
And if many days pass, and it cannot heal but returns with pus repeatedly, know that there are small pieces of bone, so you must probe the wound with a tent, and remove all these separated pieces that cause the pain.
And if a fistula appears in the area, or another form of corruption, you must treat it according to what he says in his chapter before.
And when the bone is broken and exposed on the limb, such as the bone of the thigh or the shoulder, and others like the large limbs, do not pull it out, for many times death comes from it, but leave it until it rots.
Perhaps it will fall out by itself after twenty or thirty days, then treat the wound if you can.
And if you cannot, then leave it.
We often see them (bruises) after the healing of a fracture, especially when it is near a joint, and it is a nasty sight, the appearance of the limb. And perhaps the limb cannot perform its natural functions.
Therefore, be wary if it is fresh. If the physician administers astringent medicines, such as aloes, frankincense, and myrrh, and gum tragacanth, acacia, and similar others, then you should take any of these things, or all together, and mix them with astringent wine or with the white of an egg or with vinegar. And place them on the wound in bandages, and bind it tightly, and do not loosen it for days.
And place them on the wound in bandages, and bind it tightly, and do not loosen it for days. and then loosen it, and begin another one, until the swelling is removed;
or you bind over a piece of lead well made; for the property of lead is such that it removes all swellings on the limbs;
and if the swelling has already turned hard like stone, and it needs to be removed, then cut over it and remove the excess visible matter; or you scrape it with a scraper until it is removed, and treat it until it is healed.
of the limb that is weak after the healing
When the fracture of the bone is restored, and afterward the limb remains weak and fragile, this happens for many reasons: one of which is that it was bound too tightly, and was not bound as it should have been; or because there were too many bandages, and nourishment could not reach the limb; or due to excessive watering; or due to too much movement, and not at the right time; or because it has little blood in its body, and is weak.
And the cure is that you should feed the patient, and make the body tender, until the blood is multiplied within him; and administer baths, and give him joy and ease;
then put poultices on the limb, so that the poultice draws the great nourishment, and often water it with warm water, until the nourishment flows to the limb; and returns to its natural form.
a limb twisted after the sickness When the limb is twisted after the restoration, and the broken bone is apparent, and the shape of the limb is ugly, nevertheless, it does not lose its natural function:
So do not believe the foolish who say that one should break the limb anew, and many fools have done this in our land;
and this practice is blamed, and great harm comes of it, and perhaps death;
However, if the knots and the twisting are fresh, then they should be bathed with hot water, or softening herbs should be boiled, such as mallow leaves, roots, and melilot, and similar things;
and make a softening poultice, such as a well-made diachylon, and take the mucilage of mallow, and mix it with goose fat or sesame oil, and make a poultice on top;
or take ripe figs, and grind them with fine flax, and similar medicines that soften the adhesion.
And sometimes the knot is removed by rubbing continuously and for a long time with wet hands. And let movement be given to the limb every hour.
And if the distortion is old and hardened, like stone, and it needs to be removed with iron, then it must be cut right to the bone, with a sharp, light incision. and apply dressings and care in the treatment.
Dislocation occurs when a joint moves out of its place, preventing it from moving, and the limb is misaligned, causing the patient great pain and injury.
When dislocation occurs to someone, it must be immediately returned to its place without delay.
For if one delays, the area swells, and perhaps it is difficult to return it to its place.
Therefore, it is not appropriate to move it when it is swollen. Many times this causes swelling and other pains.
However, when this happens, have the patient bled, then leave it alone until the abscess subsides.
Then bathe the limb in hot water and oil, then gently reposition it, and treat each limb as the cure dictates to return it to its place.
And I have arranged the chapters on dislocations from the head to the feet.
Sometimes the jaws are dislocated on both sides, and the dislocation of both is according to two types. where they are slightly removed from their place, and slightly loosened; or they are completely dislocated, and hang down towards the chest, and saliva flows from the mouth so that he cannot hold it, nor can he close his mouth, and he wraps his tongue with speech.
When the dislocation is slight, it returns through several methods.
And if it is complete and accomplished, you must reset it quickly, and not delay.
and in such a way that the attendant holds the patient's head, and places the minister's small bag of one of his hands in the root of the dislocation of the jawbone within the mouth, if the dislocation is of two parts; and the other fingers of the hands should be used, to put it in alignment;
and tell the patient to relax their jaw and move it in all directions. And the minister aligns it, until it returns to its place.
And if the resetting is difficult, especially if it is the two jawbones together, then soften them with hot water and oil, until they are easily reset;
and do not delay in the resetting, as we have said.
And when they are aligned, and the patient's mouth closes well without pain, then place moistened cloths in a bandage made of rose oil and wax, then tie it gently with soft bandages;
and the patient sleeps on their back, and their head is placed between two cushions, so that they do not move it to the right or left, nor do they try to force it, but should take light food, until the pain is gone, and the jawbones are healed;
and then let them eat whatever they want lightly, and do not strain to open their mouth to eat and drink, until the jawbone is well healed and sound.
And if the two jawbones cannot be put back in place at once, and are not returned to their position, fever and habitual swooning will result, and perhaps loosening of the bowels, and perhaps vomiting of pure phlegm.
And when you see this, then know that it is fatal. and many times those who experience this die within nine days.
The fork cannot dislocate from the inside of the ribcage and from the breast, and is dislocated sometimes from behind, and one certainly feels it.
And the restoration is that the patient often lies on their back and extends their arms. and then press the area firmly with your palm, and it will return;
then apply a plaster and bandage, and bind it tightly;
and the shoulder that is toward the ribs cannot dislocate; if not, and if it dislocates any time, then reset it to its place, as we have said;
then apply a plaster and bandage, and bind it tightly, and instruct the patient to rest until he is healed;
and likewise, the shoulder is reset when it is pulled out of place.
of the dislocation of the shoulder
Know that the shoulder is dislocated in only three ways:
one of which is that it dislocates towards the armpit below; and the second is towards the breast; and perhaps dislocates towards the top, and this happens rarely;
and it does not dislocate behind due to the shoulder, and does not dislocate inside due to the nerves;
and many times it dislocates below towards the armpit, especially in those who have little flesh, because in them it jumps out quickly;
in those who have enough flesh, it jumps out with difficulty, and it returns with difficulty.
And perhaps in some men, there occurs a blow or a break, and the shoulder swells with a hot abscess, and they think that it is dislocated because of that.
Therefore, it is necessary that you test it, until you are certain; and then begin the treatment.
And dislocation is known when it is down towards the armpit, and you find a difference between the sick shoulder and the healthy one, and you will find a clear difference between them; and you will find a hollow at the head of the shoulder, and under the armpit when touching the head of the shoulder, as if it were a bone; and the patient cannot bring their hand to their neck, nor move in any way;
and also, if it is dislocated upward, it is not hidden, for you find it clearly when touching;
and this type of dislocation is only to be reset, when it is recent, or if the child is ill.
And the method is that the attendant lifts the patient's hand upward, then places their fingers under the armpit, and lifts the joint upward to its place by force; And the attendant lifts the hand, and extends it upward, then places it under; Then it will come quickly.
And if it does not come as we have said within a few days, then the patient must be bathed in hot water; and the attendant should administer a softening and soothing treatment, such as a decoction of marsh-mallow, fenugreek, and melilot in water, and it should be administered;
then the patient should be laid on their back, and a layer of equal thickness of wool, neither too soft nor too hard, should be placed under the armpit; then the patient's heel should be placed on the wool, and the shoulder should be lifted vigorously, and the patient's arm should be pulled;
and another attendant should hold the patient's head so that it does not move down; that shoulder will return immediately, and if you wish to see it reset in this manner:
and it is that you have a man present who is larger than the patient; and stand straight toward the side, and place his shoulder under the patient's armpit, and lift the armpit upwards, so that the patient hangs in the air; and another attendant pulls the patient's arm downwards towards the stomach. And if the patient is too light, then hang something heavy with him, and the dislocation returns immediately.
And it is reset also in another way:
and one places a long burning stick in the ground, of which the head is as wide as a pestle, and is neither too thick nor too thin; then it is placed under the patient, but let there be soft cloths above, and the patient is lying along the length of the pole;
then his hand should be stretched out in the opposite direction forcefully, and the joint will return to its place quickly;
and if it does not want to return despite all these things we have said, then do this treatment: take a stick of two arms of great and four fingers wide, that has a rounded head to be able to enter deeply under the armpit, according to this shape:
then tie soft cloths over the top of the pole, so that the pole does not harm the patient, then place it under the patient's armpit;
and extend the arm over the long pole, and tie the shoulder over the pole, and the arm at the top of the hand, then place the arm over a rung of a wide ladder, and let the hands be extended downward, and let the body hang on the other side: The joint will return now.
And when it is back in place, no matter how, you should place an even layer of wool under the armpit, then apply the prepared plaster of mill powder, with incense and egg white, over the entire shoulder and around it, then tie it under the armpit securely, and turn the bandage over the plaster, and support the hand at its neck, and let the hands remain thus.
And it is necessary that he eat little, so that the limb is strengthened, for it will heal sooner;
and then eat more after five or seven days, and move it; and if it is firm and not softened, it is healed.
And if the joint is displaced from its place due to moisture that has come there, or for another reason, you must apply cauteries to three openings, as it is described in the chapter on cauteries.
And if you do all this, and it loosens after seven days, and the joint does not hold, and cannot raise its arm upwards, then know that the nerve at the head of the shoulder is cut or stretched or softened; and know that the joint will never be fixed in its place.
Dislocations near the breast, or behind, are caused by a blow and the extension of the arms, and another treatment is administered;
and treat until it is healed.
And if, after healing, there is stiffness in the limb and delay in movement, the patient should use baths many times until the stiffness is relieved and returns to its original nature.
of the dislocation of the ribs
Know that the joint of the ribs is dislocated, and then returns to its place.
and if it is dislocated on all sides, and especially in front and behind, and the dislocation is not corrected, because it is clearly seen and felt; and dislocated according to each shape. And when you join the diseased rib with the healthy one, you can clearly see it. For the joint is twisted, and cannot bend the arm, nor touch the shoulder at all.
And you must reset it before abscesses appear, for if abscesses form, it would be difficult to reset it.
and perhaps it cannot be fully reset at all, especially when it is at the back; so it is worse than other dislocations, and is of greater pain, and perhaps death comes from it.
And the restoration, when it is such that it can be reset, is that you extend its hand with your two hands; and its arms be spread, and the hands of the mirror according to the cut around, above and below, and put the joint to its shoulders together, or at the root of its palm, until it returns to its place.
And if the dislocation is in front, it returns when he doubles his hand to his hand, and grasping the root of the palm with the cut that is dislocated.
And if it does not want to return to its place, then administer strong extension;
and it is that two ministers extend the arm, and hold it, two ministers, so that it does not move with the extension;
then turn the arm in each direction, after you have wrapped a double cloth long and wide;
and when the minister touches the joint to his hand, then anoint it with some oil to soften the joint, then push the joint firmly until it returns;
and when it is in place, put on a dry plaster with a touch of egg, and bind it firmly, and hang the arm to the patient's neck, and leave it for several days, then untie it.
And if the joint is firm in its place, then untie the bandage, and leave it;
and if you see that the joint is not correctly aligned, then reapply the plaster and bandage, and leave it thus for several days, until it is firmly in place; then untie it.
And if, after the joint has been reset, he feels tightness and it moves, bathe and rub it gently, and press until the pain is relieved; or place a layer of greasy sheep's wool on the joint, then leave it for one day and one night, then remove it, and put it into a bath; and when it sweats, rub the joint gently, then replace the wool, and then put it in the bath; and do this two or three times, until it is healed;
and if you wish, place warm, moist cow's hay mixed with butter on it, and bind it on;
it will return to its proper position.
the dislocation of the hand
The joint of the hand dislocates, and its return is easier than the other joints. However, it must be brought back to its place quickly, at the very moment it is dislocated, before the area swells or a hot abscess forms there.
And the repositioning is done by placing the injured hand on a table, and the attending physician stretches out the hand, and aligns it so that the palm is placed over the appearance of the joint, and pushes it until it returns to its place.
However, you must check if it is properly in place; then the patient should place the back of their hand on a table during the stretching and repositioning. And if the dislocation is in the back of the hand, the patient should place the back of their hand on the table, and the physician should place their hand over the appearance of the joint.
If it returns now, it is well. If not, apply soothing poultices to the abscesses, and leave it thus without recommencing.
And if he cannot endure it, and you cannot put it back in place after several days, the joint remains crooked.
and it does no harm to the patient except that the hand is softened and cannot grasp anything at all. Then know that the nerve or the artery is cut.
There is no other remedy but to cauterize near the site, and perhaps nothing else will work.
And when the hand is in place, put on the plaster that we have mentioned, then bandage it and leave it for five days, then unbandage it and leave it thus.
And if he cannot move it well, and there is some stiffness, then soak it in hot water and rub it until it is healthy.
Of the dislocation of the fingers of the hand.
Sometimes the fingers of the hand are dislocated in various directions, sometimes on the back of the palm or the front.
Then extend the finger and push the dislocation with your fingers until it returns, then support the head of the finger and bend it towards the part where it is disjointed;
and leave it two days, and then put it straight that day;
and at night tie it, as we have said, and untie it by day, and make it move, and tie it again at night;
and do this often, until it is straight, and likewise do, if it is dislocated on the front of the hand, and do as you did before, until it is healed;
and likewise do, when it is dislocated on the other side.
where dislocation of the shin of the back
When the shin of the back or of the neck is dislocated, or if there are many dislocated, there is no cure, for death hastens the patient.
And the signs are that the bowels jump without will, and cannot be held, and many times certain limbs are softened, or the two thighs or the two arms or one.
And many times the shin moves to four parts;
the one that moves to the back is called "gilbositez":
The cure is that you observe if the gilbositez has come from childhood: if there is no cure nor healing at all.
And that which comes from falling or from impacts or similar things, the ancient healers spoke of cures in grand words, where there is not always much benefit;
but I have abridged it according to my intention, and have formed instruments in various ways.
I say that in the gilbosite that comes to the front of the chest, there is no remedy or health;
and also that which comes straight to the two sides, and one cannot cure anything except that which comes to the back, as I say;
and that the patient be lying stretched out on a flat surface, and have padding underneath him so that he does not injure himself;
then place one brand in the ground at the head and another at the feet, and tie a bandage under the patient's armpits, another at the hips, and at the knees, and at the ankles;
and two attendants should hold the bandages, one at the head and the other at the feet, between the two brands;
and be firmly fixed, the brands as we have said, and the physician should place his palms firmly on the spine until it returns to its place.
And if it does not return with this treatment, take a board three arms long, and place it under the wall, and let the patient lie on his side, and place the end of the board under the wall, then place the middle of the board on the spine; and let the physician place his feet on the other end of the board, and press firmly, until it returns to its place;
and if you wish, do it with a turning device that turns by hand. And you should place two brands at the patient's head, one arm's length apart, and two others towards the feet, and have a hand's breadth of space between each brand, both above and below.
and have one hole in each brand, through which the turning device runs, and let the brands be firmly in the ground, so that they do not move.
and between each of the two brands, place one turning brand, on which the ropes turn, and have two small brands, one hand's breadth long, on the two turning points, for turning the turning device;
and then tie the rope that is among the rods to the turning device towards the head, and the other rope towards the feet to the other turning device, and each of the ministers turns their turning device along the entire rope, and the master places the spine evenly as we have said.
And when it is even, apply a desiccant plaster with plenty of egg, then the bandages, and then a splint of a tablet three fingers long, that covers the area of the swelling and the healthy part of the spine, then bind it with a bandage, as we have said, and the patient uses a subtle nourishment until he is healed.
And if anything comes up at the end of healing, it is necessary to administer softening and soothing medicines, with the splint that we have mentioned before. And sometimes a piece of lead is administered, and sometimes an appearance arises in the posterior spine of the back, and it is thought to be a dislocation. And it is the bone that appears, for which one should not have any presumption. Perhaps it would bring death.
Know that at the joints of the hip and the joints of the shoulder, only dislocations occur, and not like at other joints.
and the hip joint is dislocated according to four parts: inward and outward, and front and back;
and more inward elsewhere, and slightly dislocated front and back.
And the knowledge of its inward dislocation is that when one joins the diseased leg with the healthy one, it is longer, and the patient's knee is more apparent than the healthy one, and the patient cannot bend their knee at the fire; and the place next to it is swollen with a hot abscess, because the head of the thighbone comes there.
And the sign of him to whom it comes to the outward is that these accidents are contrary to those before.
And the signs of him to whom it happens to the front are that he extends his leg well according to its completion; however, does not bend the knee without pain, and if one wishes to make it go forward, it cannot go forward, and retains its urine, and the groin swells, and when it walks, it passes over the heel.
And the signs of him to whom it happens behind are that he cannot extend or bend his knee, and that leg is more twisted than the other, and the groin is softened, and the head of the thighbone is in the place below the ribs.
The resetting of this type of dislocation is that you observe if the dislocation is old, and it remains according to its position, then there is no cure; and it is not necessary for it to have presumption.
And in that whose dislocation is fresh, and it is one of the four types of dislocation, hurry to turn the joint, and extend it inside and outside, and move it to the right and left; Perhaps it will return, and no other cure is needed.
And if it does not return in this way, you must prepare a strong assistant, and extend the leg firmly with two hands, or with a strap tied above the knee; and another assistant extends his hand above in such a manner that he places his hands under his armpits, then tightens it with a soft strap above the thigh; and another holds the end of the strap;
and they pull upwards and downwards all at once, so that the patient is lifted from the ground at once, and remains hanging.
This method of extension is common to four similar cases, and if the dislocation has returned, as we have said, it is good.
If not, then treatment must be applied to its likeness.
When the dislocation is inward, you must lay the patient on their healthy side, then place the strap on the root of the thigh and the area under the armpit, then extend the strap upwards towards the armpit and towards the shoulder;
then take other attendants by the arms, and embrace the thick part of the affected thigh, and extend it outwards forcefully: it will return to its place now;
and this type of dislocation is milder than the others.
And if you cannot set it in this manner that we have described, you must tie the patient's two feet together with a strong soft strap around the two heels and the two knees, and the affected leg should be extended two inches further than the other;
then be hung over the head of a post, and let it be two arms' length above the ground;
then instruct one minister to grasp the head of the thigh, and let another minister hang with the patient, holding the thigh firmly, for the joint will now return quickly.
And when the dislocation is at the thigh, let the patient lie down, as we said for those with a gibbosity, and tie a bandage around the affected leg properly, and around the foot as well;
then place two embers, one at the head and one at the feet, then place one ember between the patient's thighs in the middle. and have wet cloths spread around so they don't injure the patient, then let each minister pull towards him, and let the one in the middle hold the dislocation level with his hand.
If it returns, that is good.
If not, put it on a table and press it as we said for the gibbosity, and let the patient lie on his healthy side.
And when the dislocation is in front, it is necessary to extend the sick leg quickly, and according to what I have said; and let the healer put their effort on the sick hip, then press with the other hand, and extend it downwards towards the knee.
And if the dislocation is behind, it is not necessary to extend the sick person downwards, nor to lift them up from the ground, but it is necessary that they are as if the hip were dislocated behind, as we said about lying on both hips; and let them lie on their face, and the bandage is extended as we said before, and one should press on the joint to the table; and it will be correct when the patient extends their legs, and they are equal; then join the thighs, and apply the plaster, and bind it with a bandage, so that the hip does not move; and rest for three or four days, then unbind it, and put the plaster on;
and if you see that they are equal, then bind it, as before, and leave it for three days;
then unbind it, and allow it to move gently, until the limb is strengthened.
of the dislocation of the knee
The knee is dislocated in three ways: that is to say, inward and outward, and backward;
and it does not dislocate forward.
And the sign is that you instruct the patient to bend their leg at the hip, and if it does not fit against their hip, know that it is dislocated;
And the restoration of all is that you make the patient sit upright, and extend their leg if they can, and place your back against their thigh, and put their foot on your feet;
then take their knee in your palms, and pull between your fingers, then bend the two sides of the knee tightly; and another assistant extends their foot, so that the knee returns to its place, and the sign is that they fit their leg against their hip lightly;
and place the plaster on it, and make the leg fit against the hip, and bind them together firmly for three or four days, then unbind them;
and the patient does not work walking, until the limb is strengthened.
And if the limb is not quite right, the assistant applies strong stretching, as we have said in the treatment of the hip, until it is healed.
of the dislocation of the heel
The heel is sometimes displaced, and sometimes dislocated completely, both inside and outward.
And the signs are that the ankle is swollen, and it bulges forward to the part where it is dislocated:
The repositioning is gentle, and one should gently stretch it with one's hands when it is merely displaced.
And when it is completely dislocated, you must make the patient sit upright, and have two assistants hold the leg firmly above the ankle;
then pull the foot towards your right hand, and then to the left twice, then stretch it upwards, and place the foot firmly upwards;
and do this twice, as we have said, pushing and pulling the foot;
if it returns, that is good;
if not, then start the work again, for it returns;
and if it cannot return thus, then make the sick person lie on their back on the ground, and firmly place a stick in the ground between their thighs, and tie cloths around it so that it does not injure the sick person;
then let the attendants hold the thigh, and another attendant extend the foot to their hands or to a rope, that they tie around the top of the foot; then let each attendant pull equally, and the stick be always between the sick person's thighs to hold the sick person when they are being stretched;
then let the surgeon place the dislocation in their hands, and another attendant hold the healthy leg underneath, and the dislocation will return quickly.
And when it is in place, then put the plaster and bandages on, and bind it tightly, and tie the foot to the leg, and guard the nerves that are above the ankle behind, lest the bandage be too tight;
then leave it for two or three days, and if the bandage softens, then tighten it;
then untie it on the third or fourth day, and forbid the patient from walking for four days; and if he walks before that time, it is not certain that it will not dislocate again.
And if boils appear there, you must soothe them, as we have said elsewhere, until they are healed.
of the fingers When the fingers are dislocated, they must be gently straightened without effort, and it is an easy matter.
And if the dislocation is in any bone of the back of the foot, you must have the patient sit on a flat surface or a table, completely straight, and place your foot on the exposed part of the joints, then press firmly with your foot until it returns;
and when it is aligned and nothing is apparent, place a table with two supports under the sole of the foot, then hold it firmly, and leave it for three days, then release it; and keep it at rest until it is healed.
of wound and dislocation together
When a wound comes with the dislocation, and one wants to restore it, many times the patient dies:
So do not be presumptuous in the treatment, if you are not wise in the art and have not used it for a long time, and if you are not compassionate and merciful and slow, and not hasty;
and use at the beginning soothing things for hot abscesses, and leave the patient in God's hand if you see no hope of health; And when you see hope, then restore the limb to its place, before the hot abscesses come to it;
And when the limb is in place, administer soothing things for hot abscesses, and treat the wound, as it is fitting, with drying ointments;
And if with the dislocation there is a fracture, and small bones separated, then set them, and do what we have said in simple illnesses;
And guard yourself from entering a path of fear, according to what I have said, for this will earn you praise from your Creator, and for the salvation of your body and soul.
