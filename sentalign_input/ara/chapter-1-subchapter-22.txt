Chapter Twenty-Two.
On Cauterizing Hemorrhoids.
If the hemorrhoids are due to phlegm and cold humors, and they do not respond to ripening with medications, and you want rapid ripening, then heat the hollow cautery iron, which is depicted here, with both ends open.
So that the smoke may come out of the other end during cauterization, place it, heated, upon the swelling itself, once and a second time if needed, until you reach the depth of the swelling.  If the swelling is small, then make the cautery the size of the swelling.
Then leave it for three days and apply to it cotton dipped in fat until what was burned by the fire is gone, then treat it with ointment and bandages until it heals, God willing.
