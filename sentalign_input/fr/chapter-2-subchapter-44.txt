Of the swollen throat
This abscess is called "hernia of the throat," and is a large abscess the color of fat, and is common in women;
and it is of two kinds: natural, and accidental; the natural one has no remedy.
And the accidental kind is of two types, one resembling a fatty knot, and the other resembling an abscess that comes from an artery;
and it is dangerous, and should not be treated with iron except in the small one, and it should be tested and examined with the probe:
if you find it like a fatty knot, and it is not attached to any vein, then cut it as one cuts knots, and pull it out with its membrane, if it has one;
and examine everything well, and treat it properly until it is completely healed.
