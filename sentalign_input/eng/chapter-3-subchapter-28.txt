 CHAPTER TWENTY-EIGHT.
On the treatment of a dislocation of the wrist.
 The carpus of the hand is often dislocated.
Unlike other joints, the reduction is easy, but there should be haste to reduce it as soon as it is dislocated, before the place swells or an abscess occur.
The way of reducing the dislocation is to place the patient's wrist upon a board while an assistant stretches the hand, and the doctor puts the palm of his hand upon the prominence of the joint and applies pressure on it until it goes back.
But he should examine: if it is a displacement toward the ventral aspect of the hand, the patient should place the back of his hand upon the board for extension and reduction; but if it be a luxation toward the dorsum of the hand, then the inner part of the hand should be laid upon the board so that the doctor's hand may come upon the prominence of the joint itself.
If it go back at once, good; but if not, bandage it with a plaster that settles swelling and let it be.
Do not revert to it, for it will not tolerate that, and you will not be able to effect its reduction after some days have passed.
But the joint will retain its deformity; and the patient will in no wise be harmed except if his hand is slackened so that he be unable to grip anything; then you may know that the tendons are either severed or bruised.
In this situation there is no method but to strengthen it by cauterization; this sometimes helps but sometimes is of no use at all.
When the reduction of the joint is complete, apply to it the plaster we have described, then bandage it and leave it for five days; then loosen it and try out the hand.
If movement be hampered and any hardness occur in it, soften it repeatedly with hot water and sweating until it be softened.
