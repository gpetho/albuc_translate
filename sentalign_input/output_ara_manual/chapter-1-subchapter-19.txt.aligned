If a swelling appears at the base of the gums, or in the palate, or at the roots of the molars, then it suppurates and bursts, and the flow of pus becomes a fistula, then you treat it but the treatment does not succeed, then you should heat a cautery iron of a size that fits in the fistula.	When there comes a tumour in the base of the gums or in the palate or in the roots of the molar teeth, and it becomes purulent and breaks out and a fistula comes from the flow of pus, and you have treated this without effect, you should heat a cautery of a size to fit the fistula; then introduce it hot into the fistula opening; and continue the pressure with it hot until the iron, still hot, reaches the hollow and the extremity of it.	0.8384374
Then you insert it hot into the opening of the fistula and hold your hand steady until the heated iron reaches its deepest part and its end. You do this once or twice. Then you treat it after that with what we mentioned of the treatment until it heals, God willing.	Do this once or twice over. Then afterwards treat as we have mentioned until it heals.	0.54605526
If the discharge stops and it heals, then [well and good].  Otherwise, it is necessary to examine the area and remove the diseased bone, according to what will come in its chapter, God willing.	If the matter stops and it heals, well and good; otherwise it is impossible to avoid opening up the place and removing the diseased bone in the manner we shall speak of in its proper chapter.	0.71103764
