If a rupture occurs in the uveal layer, then it swells and protrudes outside the eyelids like a grape, thus disfiguring the person's appearance. And if you want to remove it, the procedure is as I describe.	When a rupture befalls the uveal membrane so that it swells and protrudes outside the eyelids looking like a grape, and on this account the man's features are disfigured; if you intend to cut it away the operation will be as I am about to describe.	0.88586533
It is that you insert a needle into the base of the grape-like swelling from bottom to top. Then you insert another needle, which has a doubled thread, from the side of the corner of the eye and pass it through, leaving the first needle as it is.	You introduce a needle to the root of the uvea from the lower to the upper segment; then you introduce another needle threaded with a double thread, from the region of the canthus major where you will perforate it; and leave the first needle in its place.	0.7686027
Then you cut the place where the doubled thread is folded and tie some of the swelling around the needle and tighten it well.	Then cut the place of doubling of the doubled thread, and with it ligature that part of the excrescence around the needle and tie it well.	0.851668
Then you remove the needle and place wool moistened with egg white on the eye and leave it until the threads fall off with the swelling.	Then remove the needle and apply to the eye wool moistened with egg-white; and leave till the thread falls away with the growth.	0.9157635
Then you treat the eye with what strengthens it until the wound heals.	Then treat the eye with fortifying dressings till the wound be healed.	0.87989455
The swelling may also be tightened from all sides with a circle of cloth so that the swelling increases well.	Sometimes the uvea is tied all round with a circle of material so that the prominence of the eye is greatly increased.	0.4887112
Then it is lanced with a thin scalpel that reaches the depth of the eye, so that the watery fluid flows out and the swelling subsides and withers on the spot.	Then you perforate it with a fine scalpel going to the depth of the eye; and an albuminous humour will flow out and the eye will shrink and return at once.	0.7539673
Then you tighten it until it heals.	Then bandage till healed.	0.84508777
