On Cauterizing Back Pain.	On cauterization for pain in the back.	0.8411797
Pain may occur in the back from many causes, either from a fall, a blow, excessive vomiting, and the like. It results from an outpouring of a cold, moist substance, and cauterization is done only for this type.	Many different causes give pain in the back. Sometimes it happens from a fall or a blow, or from excessive evacuation or the like. It may also be due to an influx of humid matter. Cauterization is only to be employed in this last case, which arises from an influx of cold matter.	0.8480196
That which is from an outpouring of a cold substance, it is necessary, after emptying the patient with حبّ المنتن (habb al-muntin) and the like, to cauterize on their back where the pain is, three rows across the width of the area, after marking the place with ink. In each row, five cauterizations or more, according to what you see of the patient's tolerance and strength.	When the patient has been purged with foetid pills or the like, he should be cauterized in his back where the pain is, over the breadth of the flat of the back, after the place has been marked with ink, with three rows of cauterizations, five in each, or more, in proportion to what you see of the patient's endurance and strength.	0.76660705
And the cauterization should be with a point cautery, and if you wish, cauterize it three or four times with a medium nail-shaped cautery, in this manner.	Use the punctate cautery. If you like, you may give him three or four cauterizations with the middle-sized claviform cautery.	0.69001716
