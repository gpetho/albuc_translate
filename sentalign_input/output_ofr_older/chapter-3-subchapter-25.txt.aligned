The collarbone cannot dislocate from the rib internally where it connects to the chest, but it sometimes dislocates externally, and it is easily felt.	The clavicle is never dislocated inwards because of its continuity with the breast-bone; but sometimes it is dislocated outwards, and then it is detected by palpation.	0.72659004
The treatment is for the patient to lie often on his back and extend his arms; then press the area firmly with your palm, and it will return; then apply a plaster and a bandage, and tighten it.	The replacement is thus: the patient is to lie on his back and stretch out both arms; then with the palm of your hand press heavily upon the place and it will go back. Then apply to it the plaster and pads, and bandage it up.	0.87470865
The end near the shoulder cannot dislocate; if it does sometimes dislocate, then return it to its place, as we have said; then apply the plaster and bandage, and tighten it, and command the patient to rest until it is healed.	As to the extremity of the clavicle, which is close to the shoulder and joined to it, it is only rarely dislocated; but if ever it is dislocated you must reduce it and set it straight as we have mentioned, by any convenient means. Then apply the plaster, pads, and bandages, and bid the patient keep quiet and still until it is healed.	0.8116099
And in the same way, the head of the shoulder is reduced when it is out of place.	By this same treatment you may also reduce the head of the humerus when it is displaced.	0.64334893
