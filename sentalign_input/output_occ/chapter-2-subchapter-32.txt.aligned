On the treatment of teeth that are prominent over the others.	On the sawing-down of teeth growing on top of others.	0.7128544
When teeth are prominent not according to their natural alignment, this affects their appearance, especially when it happens to women, particularly venerable young girls; then you must consider: if a tooth is born next to another tooth and cannot be moved or aligned, then remove that one; but if it is not attached to another tooth, then you incise it with this instrument, the shape of which is this; and it resembles a pigâ€™s snout, and should be made of Indian iron with a very sharp end.	When teeth grow in other than their natural place the appearance is very bad, specially when it occurs in women or slaves. So you should examine; if the tooth has grown out behind another tooth and it is impossible either to saw or file it down, then extract it. But if it be attached to another tooth, cut it down with an instrument of this kind. It resembles a small chisel and should be of Indian steel with a well-sharpened end.	0.86118066
And your incision, with which you cut it, should be over several days due to the hardness of the tooth, and ensure that no other teeth are disturbed.	You should spread your cutting with it over several days on account of the hardness of the tooth and so as to leave the others undisturbed.	0.76256806
And if it is a prominent tooth exposed to filing, then file it with an Indian iron file, the shape of which is this:	If the tooth projects in such a way as to make filing possible, use a file of Indian iron, shaped like this.	0.704898
And it should be entirely of Indian iron and easy to handle; and it should have many small points like a file used to make needles, with which the tooth should be filed little by little over many days with ease, so that no other teeth are disturbed and loosened. And then smooth it at the end and scrape it with some scrapers.	It should be wholly manufactured of Indian iron, its handle too, and covered with very fine points to resemble the file used in making needles. You should file the tooth with it very slowly and gently over a period of many days so as not to shift the tooth and cause it to fall out; then finally smooth it and scrape it with one of the scrapers.	0.86423695
And if it is a tooth, part of which is broken and injures the tongue, then you must file it until the roughness of that fracture is removed and smoothed, and it should be evened out so that it does not injure the tongue or disrupt speech.	If it be a tooth of which part has broken off and it hurts the tongue in speaking, file it down till you have disposed of the roughness of the break and the tooth is smooth and neither injures the tongue nor hinders speech.	0.8777671
