Chapter Ten.
On the reduction of hip fracture.
Hip bones rarely break. If they do break, the break is usually a fragmentation at the ends and a longitudinal split, and it tilts inward. The patient experiences pain in the area, throbbing, and numbness in the leg on the side of the fracture.
Its reduction is by passing your hand over it until you determine the shape of the fracture. If the fracture is only at the ends, then reduce that fracture as best you can until its shape resembles its natural shape.
If the fracture is longitudinal or if it has tilted inward, then lay the patient on his stomach so that you can reduce that fracture. Once you have reduced it, apply the dressing, then place a splint of wood or leather on it and bandage it tightly. 
Do not fear displacement of the fracture or loosening of the splint. Level the hollows at the flanks with whatever fills them so that the bandaging is even. Instruct the patient to lie on his back or on his healthy side. If a hot swelling appears...
stop extending it and reducing it until the hot swelling subsides. Apply what will soothe it as described previously, then return to its reduction and bandage it as appropriate.  If fragments appear in the bone, or something crumbles from its ends, it should not be removed.
It should not be touched, but leveled from the outside, as we have said, and the bandaging should be left until it heals.
