On Cauterizing Leprosy.	On cauterization for elephantiasis.	0.6575366
As for lepers, they may benefit greatly from cauterization, especially the type of leprosy that is caused by the putrefaction of phlegm and black bile.	Those suffering from elephantiasis are sometimes greatly helped by the cautery; especially that kind that arises from corruption of the phlegm and black bile.	0.7366713
If you want to cauterize it, observe. If the leprosy is in its early stages and you have treated it with what we mentioned in the division, and it has not subsided or stopped, and you fear that the corruption will take over the patient's entire temperament, then cauterize him on the head with five cauterizations. One in the customary center of the head, the second below it towards the forehead at the hairline, two on the temples, and one behind on the nape of the neck.  Press your hand firmly with the cautery until it slightly affects the bone.	When you wish to use the cautery, first look, and if the elephantiasis be in the early stage and you treat it with those remedies advised in the section but it does not abate and is not arrested, and you fear lest the corruption spread over the patient's whole constitution, then give him five cauterizations on the head: the well-known one in the middle of the head; the second one lower than that, toward the forehead, about the edge of the hair; and two at the temples; and one behind, on the nape of the neck.	0.8787997
Scales will peel off from it, which will facilitate the exhalation of thick vapors. Cauterize him also over the spleen itself as previously mentioned. However, if the leprosy has persisted in the patient and has manifested clearly, then it is necessary to cauterize these cauterizations that we mentioned on the head.	And maintain the application of the cautery a little while till a slight mark is impressed on the bone and the outer table is removed from it, that there be an easy exit for the thick vapours. Burn him also one cauterization over the spleen itself in the manner described earlier.	0.6556449
And be careful of the nerve that is on the back of the heels, lest you burn them. One may also cauterize the pubic bone, another on the cardia of the stomach, and another on the liver.  Know that the more you cauterize, the more beneficial and effective it is.	Be careful not to burn the posterior tendons of his heels. He may also be cauterized once on the pubic bone; another on the cardia of the stomach; and another on the liver. You should know that the more you cauterize the more beneficial and effective it will be.	0.8845186
And know that the sick person does not feel the pain of cauterization as the healthy person does, because his body is numb.  The cauteries should be large and small according to the limbs and joints, as previously mentioned regarding the characteristics of the irons.	You should know also that the patient will not find the cautery painful as a sound man would, since his body is benumbed. The cauteries should be of the types of instrument mentioned earlier, larger or smaller in proportion to the size of the limb or joint.	0.80559707
Then treat the cauterization with powdered fenugreek with honey and other treatments until he recovers, God willing.	Then treat the cauterization with powder of bitter vetch with honey, together with the other treatments, till healed.	0.8443917
