Chapter Twenty-Five
On Cauterization of the Armpit.
If the head of the humerus is dislocated due to slippery humors, or it does not stabilize when reduced from its dislocation, so that this becomes a habit for it - it is reduced and then dislocated at the slightest movement that occurs, as we have witnessed - then the jaw should first be reduced.
Then the patient lies on his back or on the healthy side, then you lift the skin that is inside the armpit upwards with the fingers of your left hand if the joint is dislocated inwards.
Then you heat the cautery with the two skewers, whose image is this.
Then you cauterize the skin with it until you penetrate it to the other side, and the shape of the cautery mark is four burns, and it may be cauterized with a cautery with three skewers, so the shape of the cautery mark will then be six burns, and the skewers are the thinness of the file.
This is the image of the cautery with the three skewers.
And one may be added to this number, so the burns become eight, then you apply to the burn the crushed cress with salt, then you order the patient to rest and not to move the limb for a while until it strengthens, and if the dislocation is upward, which is rare.
Cauterize it above the shoulder with one good nail-shaped cautery, or many cauterizations by dripping, for the joint will tighten, the moisture will go away, and the patient will recover.
