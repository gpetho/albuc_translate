Chapter fifty-five on cauterizing pustules occurring on the body.
Ugly pustules may erupt on the body, arising from cold, thick, and corrupt humors.
Therefore, upon their first appearance, it is necessary to cauterize the head of each pustule gently with an aloeswood stick, the tip of which has been ignited by fire, or with the root of long birthwort, or with a lentil-shaped cautery iron.
Carbuncles may also be cauterized in the same manner upon their first appearance, so that they do not increase, and the causative excess dissipates, and the patient recovers.
However, it is necessary that this be done after the patient has been evacuated by bloodletting.
