Often, something appears in the eyelids that resembles hail in its intensity and hardness, and therefore it is called hail.	There often occurs in the eyelids a thing resembling a hailstone in its strength and hardness, and therefore called 'hail'.	0.9152684
It is a collection of thick moisture in the upper eyelid and the lower eyelid.	It is actually a collection of thick humours in the upper or lower lid.	0.70195115
The procedure for it is that you look, and if the hailstone is prominent on the outer surface of the eyelid, moving in every direction, then its treatment is easy.	The operative treatment for it is thus: examine; and if the stone is external on the outer aspect of the lid, and mobile in all directions, dealing with it is simple.	0.75754297
Make a horizontal incision on it, then gently peel it from each side until it is freed, then hook it with a fishhook and cut it off.	You make above it a transverse incision; then scrape gently around it till it is free; then catch it up with a hook and cut it away.	0.7875711
And if you are unable to cut it off unless after piercing through the eyelid with the cut, it will not harm the patient at all.	If it is in such a position that you cannot excise it without cutting through the lid, that will not harm the patient at all.	0.7458023
If the incision is large, then close it with stitches and treat it until it heals.	If the incision be big, gather it up with a suture and dress it till it heals.	0.8496387
And if it is small, there is no harm in it for you, because the ointment will strengthen it and heal it.	If it be small, it will be no trouble, for ointment will restore it and heal it.	0.83562565
If the hailstone is tilted towards the inside of the eyelid, towards the inner surface, then turn the eyelid over and hook the hailstone with a fishhook without needing an incision, and cut it off from each side.	If the stone is rather toward the inner aspect of the eyelid, then invert the lid and catch up the stone with a hook—you will not need to incise the lid—and cut it all round.	0.7866181
If it pierces through the eyelid with the cut, it will not harm at all.	If the lid is pierced in the cutting, it will do no harm at all.	0.8260735
Then, after cutting off the hailstone, wash the eye with salt water and treat the area with something that heals until the patient recovers.	Then, after cutting away the stone, wash the eye with salt water; then treat with cicatrizing medicines till healed.	0.8172819
