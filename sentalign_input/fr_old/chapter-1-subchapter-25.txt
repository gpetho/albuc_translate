of the dislocation of the shoulder
When the head of the shoulder is dislocated due to moisture, and it is reset but cannot stay in place, repeatedly dislocating with slight movement as we have experienced, then you must first reset the dislocation.
Afterward, the patient should be laid on his back and side; then lift the core within the titillate with the fingers of your left hand; and if the joint is dislocated inward, heat the cautery with two nerves of which this is the shape:
and cauterize the core until it penetrates to the ribs, and the shape of the cautery will come with four cauteries; and therefore a cautery is made with the cautery that has three nerves, so the shape of the cauterization will be six cauteries; and the nerves are according to the subtlety of a tent, and this is the shape of the cautery with three nerves:
Sometimes an additional nerve is added, making it eight cauteries.
Afterward, apply mashed leeks with salt on the cautery; then let the patient rest, and do not move the limb for a long time until it is well strengthened.
If it is dislocated upward, which rarely happens, then make a cautery on the thickness of the clavicle cautery, or many small cauteries. This will close the joint, remove the moisture, and the patient will be healed.
