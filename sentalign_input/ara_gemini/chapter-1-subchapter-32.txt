Chapter thirty-two on cauterizing the feet and legs.
If they swell in ascites and are filled with yellow water, then it is necessary to cauterize on the back of the foot in the hollow between the little finger and the ring finger.
And keep your hand steady with the cautery iron, and do not twist it.
Then lift your hand and do not return it at all.
For it will drain the yellow water.
And the cautery iron should be of this form:
Then cauterize on the legs, two spots, two spots on each leg.
And the cauterization should be with the knife-like edge of the cautery iron.
And the cauterization should be along the length of the leg, one below the knee and another below it towards the middle of the leg.
And on each thigh, two spots, two spots.
And leave the cauterization open without treatment for a long time so that water seeps from it.
Then treat it with all that we have mentioned.
