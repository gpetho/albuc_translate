of joint pain	On cauterization of gout and pain in the joints.	0.5029675
When joint pain is from moisture that is spread to each part of the body, and when pain comes to the feet, which doctors properly call "podagra", and when it is from a cold cause and medical treatments cannot cure it, it is cured by cautery in this manner: make many cauteries around the joint of the foot, and let the cautery be olive-shaped in this shape:	When there are pains in the joints from cold humidities flowing into whatever part of the body it may be, and specially when there are pains in the feet, doctors are in the habit of calling that 'gout'. When gout due to chill has been treated with the various treatments mentioned in its section, and the pains remain, the cautery will remove them. That is, you cauterize the patient with multiple burns around the joint of the foot, after he has been purged.	0.7534822
And if it is necessary to prick the face of the foot, make a cautery with the cautery called "point". And if the pains come to the knees and other joints, which happens many times, make cautery on each knee with three or four cauteries on each part, with the olive-shaped cautery; and if you need more, make more, but do not leave your hand there longer than necessary to burn the thickness of the core.	If you need to make punctate cauterizations round the front of the foot, use the punctate cautery; and if the pains go up to the knee or other joints, which often happens, burn each knee with three or four cauterizations on every side with the same olivary cautery. And if you require to cauterize him more than this, do it, but do not go deeply but only about the thickness of the skin.	0.8192011
