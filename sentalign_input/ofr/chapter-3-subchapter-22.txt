of the crooked limb after healing
When the limb is crooked after restoration, and the bone is visibly broken, and the shape of the limb is ugly, nevertheless it does not lose its natural function:
so do not believe the fools who say that the limb must be broken all over again, and many foolish physicians have done this in our land;
and this practice is condemned, and great harm comes from it, and possibly death;
however, if the knots and distortions are fresh, they should be bathed with hot water, in which softening herbs have been cooked, such as marshmallow leaves and roots, and melilot, and similar things;
and make a softening plaster, such as a well-made diachylon, and take marshmallow mucilage, and mix it with chicken fat or sesame oil, and make a plaster on top;
or take ripe figs, and crush them with dove droppings, and similar medicines that reduce swelling.
And sometimes the knot is removed by rubbing continuously and for a long time with wet hands.
And movement should be applied to the limb every hour.
And if the crookedness is old and hardened, like stone, and it is necessary to remove it with an instrument, then it must be cut down to the bone, with a thin scalpel, gently; 
and put care and study into the treatment.
