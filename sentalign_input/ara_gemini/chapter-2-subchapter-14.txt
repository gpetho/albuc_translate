Chapter fourteen on the treatment of the fissure that occurs in the lower eyelid.
This fissure that occurs in the lower eyelid is what is truly called a fissure.
It can be natural, and it can be accidental.
The accidental one results from a wound, a cut, cauterization, and the like.
The way to operate on it is to take a needle with doubled thread and insert it into the flesh, passing it from the left corner to the right corner until the thread is at both edges of the flesh.
Then you stretch the flesh upwards with the needle and cut it with a wide scalpel.
If the shape of the eyelid returns to how it should be, then fine; otherwise, you take a small probe and place it on the location of the fissure and turn the eyelid with it, and you make two incisions on the inner side of the eyelid, with the ends of the two incisions starting from the corners of the cut you made until they meet, forming an angle so that when they join, its shape becomes similar to this shape:
And it is the letter lam in Greek.
Then you remove that flesh as much as the sharp side of it is below what follows the eyelid.
Then you gather the scattered parts with two stitches, sewing it with woolen thread.
Then you treat it with what we mentioned of relaxing medicines and twisting until it heals.
And if the eyelid split occurred from an incision or stitching or cauterization, then it is necessary to make a simple incision below the hair of the eyelashes also as mentioned before.
Then separate between the two lips by twisting as we mentioned.
The summary of the treatment of the eyelid split, if it is from above or from below, is that you perform the work according to what is available to you from the form of the eyelid split.
Because it may have many differences in form.
And the experienced craftsman manages the trick in any way possible until he restores the form to its natural state or close to it.
The disease itself will guide you to what is suitable for it in terms of work and instruments in most cases.
