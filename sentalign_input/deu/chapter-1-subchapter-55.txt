Chapter Fifty-Five:
On the cauterization of white pustules affecting the body.
When the body is afflicted with white pustules, which are caused by thick, corrupt materials; at the onset, cauterize each pustule with a thin cautery stick made from myrtle wood, its tip burned; or with long erestology roots; or with a lenticular cautery.
Sometimes, this cautery is used at the beginning of their expulsion in this manner; they are not burned through, and the excess causing them is disrupted, thus they heal.
However, this should be done after bloodletting.
