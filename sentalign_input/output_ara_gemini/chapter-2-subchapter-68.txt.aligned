Chapter sixty-eight on the relaxation of the scrotum's skin.	CHAPTER SIXTY-EIGHT. On the loosening of the skin of the scrotum.	0.8614896
Often the skin of the testicles relaxes in some people without the flesh inside them relaxing, and their appearance becomes ugly.	In some men there often occurs a loosening of the skin of the scrotum without any loosening of the organs within. This has a horrible appearance.	0.75063753
So it is appropriate for whoever wishes to treat it to put the patient on his back and cut all the skin that has relaxed on the thick skin, then bring the two edges together.	He who desires to treat this condition should make the patient lie on his back; and he should cut away all the loose skin that is over and above the normal. Then he should bring together the two edges of the incision with a suture.	0.74339104
And if you wish, first sew the excess relaxed skin with three or four stitches, and make sure of the stitching, then cut between the stitches, then treat it with the treatment of other wounds until it heals and the threads fall out.	Or, if you prefer, first suture the excess of loose skin together, with three or four stitches, and make the suture firm. Then cut away what is taken up between the stitches. Then dress the wound with the usual dressings till it heals and the stitches come away.	0.87378395
