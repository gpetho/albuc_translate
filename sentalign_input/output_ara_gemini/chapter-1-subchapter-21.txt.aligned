Chapter twenty-one on cauterizing toothache.	CHAPTER TWENTY-ONE. On cauterization for toothache.	0.8396301
If the toothache is caused by cold or there are worms in it, and treatment with medicines is not effective, then cauterization is done in two ways: either cauterization with ghee or cauterization with fire.	When the toothache arises on account of cold, or if there be a worm in the tooth, and medical treatment does not avail, then cauterization should be undertaken. There are two ways of doing this, one with butter, the other with the cautery.	0.82029366
Cauterization with ghee is done by taking cow ghee and boiling it in an iron spoon or in a shell, then taking cotton and wrapping it around the tip of a probe, then dipping it in the boiling ghee and placing it quickly on the aching tooth, holding it until it cools, and repeating this several times until the heat reaches the root of the tooth.	Cauterization with butter is done thus: take cows' butter and let it boil in an iron ladle or pan; then take cotton wool, wind it round the top of a probe, and dip it in the boiling butter and quickly apply it to the aching tooth and hold it there till cold. Repeat this a number of times till the power of the fire reaches the root of the tooth.	0.89420545
If you wish, you can dip wool or cotton in cold ghee and place it on the aching tooth and place the heated iron on top of it until the heat reaches the bottom of the tooth.	If you prefer, dip wool or cotton in cold butter and put it on the aching tooth, then on top of that apply the hot iron until the heat of the fire reaches the root of the tooth.	0.90994364
Cauterization with fire is done by using a copper or iron tube that is somewhat thick so that the heat of the fire does not reach the patient's mouth.	The actual cautery is administered thus: take a tube of bronze or iron with some thickness in the body of it so that the intensity of the fire does not reach the patient's mouth.	0.70455813
Then, heat the cauterizing iron, the image of which is shown, and place it on the tooth itself, holding your hand steady until the iron cools. Repeat this several times and the pain will go away, either that same day or the next.	Then heat a cautery whose figure will be given shortly, and apply it to the tooth itself and hold your hand until the cautery gets cold. Do this several times over; the pain will certainly depart the same day or the next.	0.87346935
After the cauterization, the patient should fill his mouth with good ghee, hold it for an hour, and then spit it out.	After this cauterization the patient is to fill his mouth with good butter and keep it in for a while, then spit it out.	0.85940456
