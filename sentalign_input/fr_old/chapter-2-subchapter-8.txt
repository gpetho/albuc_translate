About the flesh of the eyelids
These swellings that come on the eyelids of the eyes when they are moist and then dry, you must stretch them with tongs and pincers, and cut them with a spatula at their roots; then place powdered vitriol on the area.
And if blood flows from them, cauterize with a delicate lenticular cautery, and cauterizing after the incision is very effective; and many times they recur if any part of their roots remains; and when they are cauterized by fire, those roots are burnt and do not return.
