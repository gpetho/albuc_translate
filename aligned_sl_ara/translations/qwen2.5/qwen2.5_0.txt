said the author of this book, when I have completed for you, my sons, this book which is a part of science in medicine with its completion and attainment of its goal through its clarity and explanation, I saw fit to complete it for you with this treatise which is a part of manual work.
because manual work is improved in our land, and in our time it is entirely absent, to the point that its science has almost been studied and its trace has nearly disappeared. and only a few sketches remained in the works of the early ones, which have been corrupted by the hands, and its reality is full of errors and confusion to the extent that its meanings have become obscure and its benefits distant.
and I saw fit to revive it and compose this treatise on the path of explanation and clarification and condensation, and to bring forth images of the iron bell and other tools of manual work, for it is an addition to clarification and a necessity that he needs.
and the reason why there is no skilled craftsman in our time, because the craft of medicine is long and it behooves its master to become proficient in the science of anatomy, which Galen described. until he stands firm on the benefits of the organs, their appearances, compositions, and their connections and separations, and the knowledge of bones, nerves, muscles, their numbers, outlets, veins and arteries, and the positions of their outlets.
and for this reason, Albucasis said that doctors by name are many, but in reality few, especially in the craft of manual work. We have mentioned a part of that in the introduction to this book.
because one who is not knowledgeable about what we have mentioned from anatomy may still commit errors that can kill people, as I have seen many who imagined in this science and claimed it without knowledge or understanding.
And I saw an ignorant physician who incised a swine tumor in the neck of a woman, cauterizing some of the neck veins causing her to bleed to death before him.
And I saw another physician who advanced in removing a stone from a man who had been stabbed in the kidney, and the stone was large; he acted rashly and removed it with a piece of the bladder. And the man died within about three days, and I had been called to remove it; I saw from the size of the stone and the condition of the patient what I had expected.
And I saw another physician who earned his living as a quack among some of the governors of our city.
And a black boy fell ill with a fracture near his ankle along with a wound. The ignorant physician hastened to treat the fracture, tying the wound tightly with bandages and splints, leaving no room for the wound to breathe.
Then he released him to his desires, and left him for days, ordering him not to bind it until his leg and foot swelled, and he was at risk of dying.
And I was called to him, and hastened to loosen the binding. He found relief and was able to move from his pain, though the corruption had become severe in the limb, and I could not remedy it.
And the corruption continued to spread in the limb until the patient died.
And I saw another physician delay treating a cancerous tumor; it ulcerated after days, worsening the condition of his patient. For, if the cancer is pure and unmixed with black bile, it should not be treated with iron at all.
Except that it should be in an organ that can be completely excised.
And for this, O my son, you should know that work by hand is divided into two parts: work that is accompanied by safety, and work that is accompanied by harm in most cases.
And I have warned of every place in this book where there is work involving risk and fear; you should beware of it and refuse to perform it.
Lest the ignorant find a way to criticize and undermine, take for yourselves firmness and caution in your actions, and for your patients, kindness and careful consideration.
Use the best path leading to safety and the blessed outcome, and avoid dangerous diseases that are difficult to diagnose.
Purify yourselves from what you fear may cast doubt upon your religion and worldly affairs. It is more lasting for your honor and higher in this world and the hereafter by your stations.
For Galen has said in some of his instructions: "Do not treat a bad disease and become known as a bad physician.
And this article has been divided into three sections.
The first section.
On branding with fire and branding with sharp medicine, arranged from the head to the foot. The machines for branding, the tools used for branding, and all that is needed for work by hand are depicted here.
The second section.
In incision and evacuation and extraction and cupping and surgery and removal of arrows and the like, all of it is categorized and arranged and the images of the instruments are shown.
The third chapter.
In algebra and divorce and the treatment of abscesses and the like, all of it is categorized and arranged from head to foot, and the images of the instruments are shown.
The first chapter.
In cauterization.
And before we describe its use, it is necessary to mention the ways in which it benefits and harms, and in what humors it is used.
I say that the discussion of the ways in which cauterization benefits and harms is a long and precise science, a secret that has been kept hidden. Many wise men have spoken about it.
And they differed in their opinions on it. I have abbreviated their words slightly to avoid unnecessary length.
I say that cauterization benefits in general for all bad humors, whether present with a substance or without a substance, except for two humors: the hot humor without a substance and the dry humor without a substance.
As for the dry humor with a substance, they differed on it. Some said that cauterization is beneficial in this case, while others argued against it, saying that cauterization is not suitable for a condition arising from heat and dryness, as the nature of fire is heat and dryness.
And it is impossible to cure a hot and dry disease with a hot and dry remedy. Those who argued against this said that cauterization with fire can be beneficial for a hot and dry disease that occurs in human bodies. Because when you add the moisture of the human body to the nature of fire, you temper the human body with cold.
And I say as he says, because experience has shown me this many times, but it should not be imagined in that manner except by one who is well-versed and trained in the art of heating to an extreme degree. And he stood firm on the differences in the temperaments of people and the conditions of diseases within themselves and their causes and symptoms and duration of time.
As for the other temperaments, you have nothing to fear from them, and particularly from cold moisture diseases, as all physicians agree on the benefit of heating in treating them.
And know, my sons, that the true cure is heating with fire and its superiority over heating with burning medicines, for fire is a single element whose effect does not extend to another organ connected to it except with minimal harm.
And heating with burning medicines may extend its effect to organs beyond the affected area, and it might cause a disease in another organ that is difficult to cure. It might even kill. But fire, for its nobility and excellence of its nature, does not do this except if it is过度加热。
And we have come to know this through experience, due to the length of our service and attention to the craft, and standing firm on the realities of the matter.
And for this reason, I have refrained from lengthy speech. However, if it were fitting for this book, I would have presented to you the secrets of fire, its mysterious workings and how it affects bodies, and its cure for diseases using philosophical and demonstrative language that would penetrate your understanding.
Know, O sons, that they have differed on the time in which clyasting is suitable and they made the spring time the best time.
And I say that clyasting is suitable in every time, for the harm caused by the time is absorbed in the benefit brought about by clyasting. And especially if the clyasting is for a strong necessary pain constrained not to be delayed, lest that which fears it may follow with an evil greater than the usual harm from the time.
And let it not occur to your mind, O sons, what the common people and ignorant physicians may imagine that clyasting which cures a disease never to return should be considered blameworthy.
And neither of these is thought to be merely in the sense that clyasting is like a medicine that alters the temperament and dries up the humors which are the cause of pain.
Except that clyasting is preferred to medicine in the speed of its success, the strength of its effect, and the intensity of its power.
And the disease may return at some time of the year, according to the temperament of the patient and the strength and nature of his illness, and what happens in his body due to the aggregation of superfluous humors and his neglect in acquiring them from food and the like.
Except that the disease for which clyasting is used may be a gentle disease in a part with little excess and humors. Like a tooth in pain and similar conditions, it may not return to that pain, and this is at the least.
And as for the common saying that the cautery is the end of medicine, this is a correct saying not because they believe there is no treatment beneficial either by medicine or otherwise after the cautery, but the matter is to the contrary.
And the meaning of "the cautery is the end of medicine" is that if we have used various treatments for a disease and they do not work, then when we use the cautery as the last resort and it proves effective, it is from here that we conclude that the cautery is the end of medicine. Not according to the meaning that the general public and many ignorant physicians adhere to.
And I have mentioned earlier that cautery with gold is better than cautery with iron, and they said this because of the moderation of gold and its noble nature. They also said that it does not blister at the site of the cautery, although this is not absolute.
Because I have tried this and found that it does so in some parts of the body but not in others. Cautery with gold is better and preferable to iron, as they said. However, if you heat the iron cautery on the fire until it reaches the desired temperature for the gold, you may not be able to tell when it has reached that temperature.
And because it cools more quickly, and if you increase its heat in a fever it melts in the fire and becomes malleable, causing the craftsman to be occupied with it. Therefore, cautery with iron has become faster and closer to being correct for practical use, God willing.
And I have arranged this chapter in surgery into sections organized from the head to the foot so that it may be easier for the student what he desires, if Allah wills.
The First Chapter.
Surgery of the Head, One Operation.
This operation is beneficial for the predominance of dampness and cold over the brain, which are the causes of headache, frequent nasal discharges from the head to the sides of the eyes and ears, excessive sleepiness, toothache, and throat pain. And in brief, for every disease caused by cold such as paralysis, epilepsy, and fainting, and similar diseases.
The procedure for this operation is to order the patient first to induce vomiting with a mild, head-focused laxative for three or four days, depending on the strength of the patient and their age and usual condition.
Then order him to shave his head with the mōsī (a type of scissors or shears). Place him in front of you on a throne, with his hands resting on his chest.
Then place the base of your palm on the base of his nose between his eyes. Wherever your middle finger ends, mark that spot with a pen.
Then heat the oil lamp烙铁，这是错误的翻译，请使用正确的术语。请加热这个油灯。
Then expose the bone to the size of a saffron head or the size of a caraway seed. If it cools, raise your hand, and if it does, reheat it with the same tongs or with another if it has cooled. Until you see what you have been told about the bone, then take a bit of salt and dissolve it in water and soak a cotton in it and place it on the area and leave it for three days.
Then apply a cotton soaked in oil and leave it until the scorching goes away. Then treat it with the quadruple ointment until he is cured, God willing.
And they have said that the wound is better and more beneficial when it remains open to produce pus.
And some have mentioned that the skin should be seared to the bone and the iron pressed until some thickness of the bone is burned. Then, after that, remove what was burned from the bone and treat it.
And others said that one should sear it severely until it affects the bone strongly, causing it to fall off like a carat or a small seed. They claimed that this releases vapor from that area and leaves the wound open for a long time.
Then treat it until it heals. I do not see these two types of searing at all except in some people and by chance. Leaving it alone with safety is better, for the head strengthens when its natural connection is separated, as we have often seen in other organs.
And especially if the patient's head is naturally weak. The first type of searing I find to be better and more acceptable, so use it. Work with it and God willing you will be safe.
The Second Chapter.
في كيّ الرأس أيضا
If in a sentence of the head there occurs a persistent headache, and this has lasted for the patient, and he has used irradjats and cocoanuts and fumigations and teeth and dressings, and especially if it was treated with the cautery we have described, and nothing of that helped him, then look. If the head of the patient is strong in constitution and not weak, and he finds severe cold, then apply another cautery above that slightly. Then apply the cautery to each temple of his head until the thick skin is gone and the amount of bone described becomes visible. And apply the cautery to the back of his head in the place known as the axe, but be gentle with your hand in this; do not expose the bone, for the patient finds great pain from it unlike the pain from all other cauterizations of the head. I will mention this cautery in its proper place.
And the cautery with which the horns of the head and its back are cauterized should be softer than that used for the middle of the head. This is its shape.
The Third Section.
In the Cauterization of the Non-Persistent Hemicrania.
If in the side of the head there occurs a headache with dizziness and the pain extends to the eye, apply the patient with medicines that cleanse the head and use all the other treatment methods mentioned in the sections on diseases. If none of this is effective, cauterize it in two ways. Either cauterization with sharp burning medicine or with iron.
If cauterization with burning medicine is to be done, you should take one piece of garlic, peel it, and cut its ends from both sides. Then, incise the area of pain in the cheek with a broad forceps until there remains a space under the skin large enough to hold the piece of garlic.
It should be inserted under the skin until it disappears, then tied tightly with ligatures. Leave it for about fifteen hours, then loosen it and remove the garlic, and leave the wound two or three days before proceeding further.
Apply it with a cotton soaked in oil until the area discharges, then treat it with ointment until it heals, if Allah wills. If you prefer, you can do this with some of the burning medicines mentioned in the eighteenth article on burning medicines.
And for cauterization with iron, it should be done as follows: Heat the iron poker, which is depicted in this image.
And it is called the nail poker because its head is shaped like a nail, with some beading, and in its center there is a small notch.
Then place it on the area of pain, hold your hand steady, and turn the iron slightly. The depth you burn should be about half the thickness of the skin. Then lift your hand to prevent burning the vein below, which could cause bleeding. Soak a cotton in salt water and place it on the area, leaving it for three days. Then apply cotton with oil, then treat it with ointment until it heals by the will of God.
And if you wish, cauterize this carbuncle with the tip of the iron from the poker, and take care to avoid cutting the vessel in this non-chronic carbuncle.
Fourth Chapter.
Cauterize the chronic carbuncle.
If you have treated the carbuncle with the advanced therapy we mentioned and with what we mentioned in the sections on diseases, and the treatment does not work, and you see from the condition something that cannot be remedied except by the first cauterization with medicine or by fire cauterization. You must heat the iron until it becomes white, after placing it on the site of the pain in a line length equal to half an inch or so. You then withdraw your hand once and tighten it until you cut the vessel and reach near the bone.
Except that you must beware of the jaw bone that moves during chewing, as burning the muscle or the nerve that controls it will cause tetanus.
And be careful and cautious of the bleeding from the vessel you have cut, for cutting it carries risk. And especially for one who is unaware of what to do and has no experience, it is better to refrain from the work.
And the management of accidental bleeding from the vessel will be described in its proper place in the book, if God wills. If you see something in the condition that cannot be remedied by this cauterization.
I saw the body of the sick capable of it placed carefully in the middle of the head as we described and treated the wound until he may recover by the will of God.
And if you wish, use the cauterization which we mentioned in the chapter on closing the vein with the tongs having two blades; for it is a better and more effective cauterization.
The Fifth Chapter.
On Cauterizing Pains in the Ears.
If there is pain in the ear due to cold and has been treated with mild remedies and other treatment as mentioned in divisional therapy, but the pain persists, heat the tongs called نقطة. Here is its image.
Then apply it around the entire ear after heating it, or around both of them if the pain is in both ears. And apply the cauterization slightly away from the root of the ear after marking the spot with a pen. The cauterization should be the size of about ten points in each ear or close to that. Then treat the areas until he may recover by the will of God.
The Sixth Chapter.
On Cauterizing Lockjaw.
Lockjaw that is treated with cauterization only occurs from phlegm, as mentioned in our division of diseases.
And cauterization should be avoided for the type that occurs from dryness and spasms of the nerve.
When you have treated this kind of abscess with incisions, suction, and counter-suction, and the treatment was not effective, it should be cauterized with three cauteries. One at the opening of the ear and the second slightly below his cheek, and the third at the meeting of the lips.
Make your cautery from the opposite side of the affected area, for relaxation only occurs in the healthy appearing side.
A diagram of the cautery should be made by cauterizing a point above the ear near the top of the ear under the frontal bone, and another on the cheek, with their length being about the length of the upper arm.
Lower your cautery hand until it burns to the depth of half the thickness of the skin. This is the shape of the cautery, which is a type of searing tool, though slightly gentler as you can see. It should have a slight bulge in the blade. Then treat the area as previously mentioned until it heals, by the grace of God.
Seventh Chapter.
On the Cauterization of Chronic Gangrene.
If the gangrene has become chronic and you have treated it with what we have mentioned, but your treatment was not effective and there is no fever in the affected area, cauterize it four times. Cauterize each frontal bone of his head once, and cauterize the middle of the head as we have mentioned, and cauterize the back of the head as previously described.
Recipe for the cauterization as described above, and it can also be seared through the mouth of the stomach, which would be more effective, then treated as previously mentioned.
第八章。
في كي النسيان。
Which is from the phlegm, it should first be treated with the larger astringents and brain-purifying remedies.
Then his head should be shaved completely, and a compress of dill, as written in the article on compresses, should be applied to his nape. It should be changed frequently, for it is a form of cauterization.
And do that in the same sequence as I mentioned there. If he is cured by this, then stop. Otherwise, apply three cauterizations to his nape, arranged from the top of the head to the bottom of the neck.
And make the interval between each cauterization one finger's breadth. Then treat each cauterization as previously mentioned. If you wish to increase the treatment and the patient can tolerate it, then apply the middle cauterization.
If you wish to increase the treatment, apply it to the horns as well. Then treat him until he is cured. The cauterization should be oily, as previously described.
第九章。
In cauterization for relaxation and the松弛 all bodily muscles.
It should first be treated by using astringents and the remedies we have mentioned. Then shave the patient's head. Next, cauterize the center of the head with one cauterization, apply one cauterization to each corner of the head, and one to the nape.
And in three vertebrae of the neck, if you need more than that for a cause of relaxation of the body and the patient is capable of it and the disease is strong and established, then give him four cauterizations on his spinal vertebrae. And apply the cauterization thoroughly until you burn more of the skin and then raise your hand. Then treat it as mentioned before until it heals, if God wills. And let the烙铁为油脂制的。
The Tenth Chapter.
On the Cautionary Treatment of Epilepsy.
Only those afflicted with epilepsy due to phlegm should be cauterized. It is advisable to cleanse their brain first with major purgatives and all other treatment as mentioned in the classification if the patient is large and capable of taking medications.
If, however, he is a child who cannot take medications, then use the enemas and the well-chewed substances to cleanse his brain several days before, along with improving his diet.
Then shave his head, and apply the cauterization once in the middle of his head as described in the procedure, and another once at the back. And apply a cauterization to each horn of his head. If the patient is strong and capable, then apply the cauterizations mentioned for the area below the diaphragm and relaxation of the body on the cervical and spinal vertebrae. Let the烙铁为油脂制的。
If the patient is a child, make the烙铁温和一些。
The Twelfth Chapter.
In the Correction of Malnkhulia.
If the cause of malnkhulia is corrupt humors and thick phlegm, apply the cauteries we mentioned in the case of falj.
If the cause of malnkhulia is an excess倾向 towards black bile, and the patient's body is wet and corrupt, use what has been mentioned before in the classification for cleansing his brain.
Then shave the patient's head. Then make a tight cake of linen like a circle. Place it in the center of his head while the patient is sitting and reclining, holding it from all sides. Then take one pound of old sheep tallow.
Then heat it on the fire with a moderate heat such that the finger can tolerate it if inserted in it. Then pour it into the center of his head in the circle and leave it until it cools. Do this to the patient once a week along with all his other good treatments until he recovers, if God wills it.
And if you wish, cauterize him with many small punctures without holding the iron. Instead, let it be a superficial application. For this type of cautery softens the brain moderately.
Then place on it a cotton cloth soaked in tallow or chicken fat.
The Twelfth Chapter.
In the Correction of Water Dropping into the Eye by Cautery.
If it is evident to you at the beginning of the water flowing into the eye by the signs mentioned in the division, then hasten to treat the swelling with what cleanses its head and protects it from all moisture and bathe him in the bath before breakfast for several days.
Then shave his head and cauterize two points in the middle of the head. If the water began to flow in both eyes or from one side, cauterize two points on the cheeks.
Then cauterize all the veins and arteries under the skin, and let the cauterizations be long in width across the cheeks, and take care to prevent bleeding.
If you see anything of it, cauterize it on the spot with any treatment available to you. We will address the method of ligating and cutting the arteries and preventing bleeding later.
And it may be cauterized in the cheek under the bones with two strong cauterizations.
The Thirteenth Chapter.
On Cauterizing Chronic Tears.
If the tears from the eye are chronic and constant, and they come from the veins and arteries on the forehead outside the head, and you are certain that this is due to cold phlegm, then cauterize the cauterization described for the beginning of water flowing into the eye. Cauterize in the middle of the head, two points on the cheeks, and two points in the cheek under the bones. If you need to increase it, cauterize one point on each side at the corner of the eye near the eyebrow with a small iron.
The Fourteenth Chapter.
To Set the Nose.
If the treatment as described in the division did not见效, proceed at once with the Qocawaya cautery for three days, then shave his head and apply the middle cautery with the oily iron. Then apply the wooden cautery for two cauteries above the eyebrows slightly below the hair, being careful to protect the artery and not cut it. This is the image of the wooden cautery.
The Fifteenth Chapter.
To Set the Cautery for Relaxing the Eyelid.
If the eyelid relaxes due to a disease or moisture, apply one cautery to the eyelid with this crescent-shaped iron.
And if you wish, apply two cauteries above the eyebrows on each side, spacing them from the cheeks. The length of each cautery should be equal to the length of the eyebrow.
And do not overdo with the cautery; it should only burn one-third of the skin. The shape of the iron should be as described.
The Sixteenth Chapter.
To Set the Cautery for the Eyelid.
If the eyelid turns inward, first evert the eye. Then apply the cautery to it in two types. Either by cauterization with fire or by cauterization with a burning medicament. If you are to cauterize it with fire, order the patient to leave his eyelids alone if he is of those who pluck them, until they grow long and even.
If the tear duct is near the plant, tighten his eyes with a bandage so that they do not move until it grows. If it grows and becomes stable, place the patient's head on your lap then mark on the eyelid with ink a sign of the shape of a leaf Aas.
The mark should begin near the eyelid margin. Then place a cotton swab soaked in egg white or lizard saliva under the lid, and protect the image of this with an iron.
Then iron it on the shape you marked slightly and repeatedly many times until the skin surface burns, which is in the shape of a leaf of Aas, all of its appearance is clear. A sign of the success of your work is that you see the eyelid raising and the hair lifting away from the eye肉膜。
Then raise your hand and leave it for three days, then apply a cotton swab soaked in oil until the scab falls off. Then treat it with ointment until it heals, if God wills. If any hair returns after some time and the eyelid relaxes, treat it accordingly.
Redo the cauterization at that place as you did first. If the hair is in the lower eyelid, shave it until it returns to its natural position without causing the tear duct to narrow. As for cauterizing with a burning medicine, you should order the patient to avoid the eyelids until they grow long and become level.
Then make a shape of a leaf of Aas from paper. Take from the usual soap and the unextinguished lime, from each one, a weight of a dirham or about that. Crush them all thoroughly and do this quickly so that they do not dry out. Then spread it on the paper made like an ass leaf and place it over one or both eyelids. Put a cotton soaked in egg white under the eye, and hold the radish head in your hand.
Then place your middle finger over the remedy and press it slightly, moving it whenever the radish feels the taste of the medicine because it finds a relish like fire. As long as it finds the relish, leave the remedy and move it with your finger. When the relish subsides, remove the remedy and wash the eye with water.
And look, if you see the eyelid has lifted up as it does when tightened by heat or cutting, then redo it with the remedy in the place where the medicine did not take effect until you complete your work and tighten the eye. Then put on it the cotton soaked in oil until the burning sensation subsides.
Then treat it with the palm-oil ointment or another, until it heals. When working, you must be as careful as possible to ensure nothing of the remedy falls into the eye, for if the eyelid relaxes after days and we fear hair might have entered the eye.
Redo the remedy in that area where the eyelid relaxed, as you did initially. Then treat it until it heals. This is a picture of an ass leaf.
Know that people's eyes may differ in size and age. Adjust your method of tightening according to this difference. The correct way is not hidden from those skilled in this craft.
Seventeenth Chapter.
In the correction of the eyebrow that is found in the corner of the eye.
If you have treated the eyebrow as described in the divisions of diseases and the treatment is ineffective, it should be cauterized in this manner.
You should direct the patient to place his head on your lap and hold his head with a servant between your hands so that it does not move or strike with his head.
Then you should place a wet cloth in the white of an egg or in the saliva of a lizard on his eyes. Then heat the iron implement, which is shown in this image.
It should be hollow, resembling a falcon's quill from one end, which is the side for cauterization. If you prefer, you can make it tapered at the other end. Otherwise, it can be flat like a wick; however, this hollow one is better for your purpose, God willing.
Then you should squeeze the abscess if it is open and extract the pus. Dry it, or if it is not open, you should make an incision and extract its purulent matter. Then place the heated iron implement on it, and hold it with your hand until it reaches the bone.
Withdraw your hand slightly during the cauterization from the eye towards the nostril to avoid误触发了备注，请忽略此部分，以下为翻译结果：
Leave it for three days then apply a cotton pad with oil and treat with the dried ointment until it heals. If it does not heal after forty days, apply the strong purgative medicine until the bone becomes apparent and then strip it as will be described in its own chapter, God willing.
Another method for correcting the nasoor, mentioned by some early practitioners, is to aim at the location of the nasoor, cut it open, and place a thin pad inside the same incision. This is its image.
Pour in enough molten lead to weigh a dirham and grasp the pad tightly with your hand so that the diseased part does not move at all, lest the melted lead flow into his eye. It is necessary to place a cotton pad soaked in egg white or water over the affected eye.
If the lead burns the nasoor area, it will heal with an amazing healing. If the nasoor is healed as mentioned by cauterization and treatment, there is no need for nasal puncture and restoring the nasoor to its nasal passage as will be described in its specific place.
Eighteenth Chapter.
On Cautioning the Splitting of the Lip.
Often, a splitting occurs in the lip and is called a "hair" cleft, especially in boys' lips. If this cleft does not heal with the treatment mentioned for division, heat a small iron shoe on the following basis.
Make its cavity soft like the edge of a razor. Then apply it hot from the blowpipe to the same cleft until the cauterization reaches the depth of the cleft. Then treat it with quicksilver until it heals, God willing.
The Nineteenth Chapter.
In the Correction of the Sharp Tooth in the Mouth.
If a swelling appears in the root of the gum, or in the cheek, or in the roots of the teeth, and then turns black and bursts, becoming a sharp tooth, and the treatment does not work, it should be covered with a mouthpiece as fits the size of the tooth.
Then insert a hot instrument into the hole of the tooth and hold your hand until the hot instrument reaches the depth and bottom of the hole. Do this one or two times, then treat it thereafter as we have mentioned in the treatment until it heals, if God wills.
If the material is discharged and it heals, and otherwise, it is necessary to expose the place and remove the decayed bone as described in its chapter, if God wills.
The Twentieth Chapter.
In the Correction of the Teeth and Relaxed Gums.
If the gums become relaxed due to moisture and the teeth move, and if treatment with medicines is ineffective, place the root of the tooth in your hand, then heat the mouthpiece that will be described after this, after you have placed the tube on the tooth.
And insert the heated mouthpiece into it, and hold your hand for a moment until the tooth feels the heat of the fire has reached the root of the tooth. Then lift your hand, and then reinsert the mouthpiece several times as desired. Finally, fill the tooth's mouth with salt water.
He holds it for a while and then injects it; the movable tooth remains in place, and the relaxed gum becomes tense and dries up the foul moisture.
The Twenty-First Chapter.
On Treating Pain in the Tooth.
If the tooth pain is due to cold or there is worm infestation and medical treatment has been ineffective, then the tooth should be treated by two methods: either by cauterizing with oil, or by cauterizing with fire.
As for cauterizing with oil, it is as follows: Take cow oil and boil it in an iron pan or a spoon. Then take a cotton cloth, wrap it at the end of the stick, dip it in the boiled oil, and apply it to the affected tooth using a wheel. Hold it until it cools down.
Then repeat it several times until the heat reaches the root of the tooth. If you prefer, you can dip a cotton cloth or thread in cold oil and apply it to the affected tooth, placing a heated spoon above it until the heat reaches the bottom of the tooth.
As for cauterizing with fire, it is as follows: Use a copper or iron tube with some thickness in its wall to prevent the heat of the fire from reaching the patient's mouth. Heat an iron press, which will be its image, and place it on the same tooth. Hold your hand until the press cools down. Repeat this several times.
If the pain goes away either on that same day or another day, it is advisable to follow up after the cauterization by having the patient fill his mouth with good oil and hold it for a while, then inject it. This is the image of the iron press.
It may be applied with any part you choose and according to the extent that is possible, and this is the picture of the vase.
The Twenty-Second Chapter.
On Curing Pigs.
If the pigs are due to phlegm and cold moisture and will not ripen with medicines, and you want a quick ripening, heat the hollowed-out iron tongs, which is its image with both ends treated.
Let the smoke arise from the other end during cauterization. Place it protected over the same boil again and again if needed, until you reach the depth of the boil. If the boil is small, place the iron tongs on the size of the boil.
Then leave it for three days and apply a cotton pad soaked in oil to it until what was burned by the fire disappears. Then treat it with ointments and fomentations until it heals, if God wills.
The Twenty-Third Chapter.
On Cauterization for Hoarseness and Narrowing of the Windpipe.
If the moist conditions overpower the windpipe, especially if this is accompanied by a cold temperament, it should first be induced to purge with laxative medicines. Then cauterize it in the notch of the neck at the base of the throat in the lower location.
Be careful not to reach the throat with the cauterization, and do not burn any more than a half of the skin. Then cauterize another time at the joint of the neck at the end of one of its large veins. The iron tongs should be in the shape described previously.
Then treat it with what has been mentioned above until it heals by the will of God.
The Fourth and Twenty-Fourth Chapter.
On the Affection of the Lung and Cough.
If the cough and lung disease are due to cold dampness with no fever or chills and the illness is chronic, apply two packs above the lumbar region in the low, soft, empty places and another pack in the middle of the chest between the breasts.
And the ironing should be with a nail-pressed shape as described before. If you prefer, use puncturing with the nail-shaped iron, and its shape has been shown in the illustration for puncturing pain in the ears; the puncturing should consist of about thirty points or so.
Then treat it with what has been mentioned above until it heals. You can make an ironing tool with three branches in this shape, and you should hurry with the ironing because you can apply three treatments with one application of the iron. This is the illustration of the ironing tool.
The Fifth and Twenty-Fifth Chapter.
On the Ironing of the Elbow.
If the head of the elbow dislocates due to sliding dampness or does not stay in place after reducing it until it becomes habitual, then it dislocates again with the slightest movement as we have witnessed. It should first be reduced. Then the patient should lie on his back or on the correct side. Then lift the skin inside the elbow with your left hand fingers if the joint dislocated inward.
Then protect the two-pronged iron press whose image is shown here.
Then it is pressed with it until it penetrates to the other side, and the shape of the pressing will be four pressings. It may be pressed with a three-pronged iron press, in which case the shape of the pressing will be six pressings, and the prongs will be on the thickness of the wound.
This is the image of the three-pronged iron press.
And one may add one more to this number, making the pressings eight. Then it is held with the iron press the rounded balls tempered with salt, and the wound is bandaged tightly so that the limb is not moved until it heals. If the dislocation is severe, this rarely happens.
Place one good pressing or many pressings lightly over the hip joint; for the joint will become tight and the moisture will be removed, and the wound will heal.
The Sixth and Twenty-sixth.
On pressing the stomach.
If in the stomach there is cold and much moisture that has gone against its temperament, and frequent discharges occur, and it has been treated with various remedies without success, it should be laid on its back with its legs and arms extended, and then pressed three times. Press with a three-pronged iron press: one pressing below the sternum, as wide as one finger's breadth. Then press two more below each side of the single pressing, so that the shape of the pressings forms a triangle, and keep them apart to prevent them from meeting if they become ulcerated. The depth of the pressing should be two-thirds the thickness of the skin.
On this image and to this extent only.
And if you choose, make it with one large cut in the middle of the stomach as shown in this image.
And the烙铁用于这种一次性的切割应为圆形，如图所示。
And the stomach may be branded with punctures for those who are afraid of this cut. It is done by marking points on the area you want with a pen or pencil, then branding it with a pointed烙铁, and then treating it with the remedies mentioned until it heals.
The Seventh and Twenty-Seventh Chapter.
On the Treatment of the Cold Liver.
If one is affected by liver pain due to cold and dampness, or due to a fermentation gas, to such an extent that it has disturbed its natural balance significantly, and the treatment as mentioned for differentiation has proven ineffective. It is necessary that the patient lie on his back and mark with a pen three cuts in this shape and to this extent on the liver below the ribs, where the human arm ends.
And after each cut, make another cut on the base of the thumb. The cuts should be straight along the length of the body. Do not curve your hand with the iron, yes.
Let the depth of the burn be half the thickness of the skin, no more. The patient should stand on his feet; if he cannot stand, let him lie down with his legs stretched out and his arms raised. This is the image of the烙铁.
And you may cauterize these vessels with the scalpel iron if you have a companion and craftsmanship skill, and take care lest you dwell too long in the cauterizing so as to burn all the skin, burning the belly and reaching the intestines; for the skin there is thin, know it.
The Twenty-Eighth Chapter.
On the Swelling of the Liver by Cauterization.
If a swelling appears in the liver and you want to know whether this tumor is in the liver flesh or in the gallbladder, then if it is in the liver flesh, he will find the diseased area heavy and painful but not acute.
And if it is in the gallbladder, then along with the pain there will be a severe sharpness. I have found that this disease has baffled the physicians in its treatment; therefore, the diseased person should lie on his back, and the spot should be marked with ink where it is warm.
Then heat the iron in the fire; this is the scalpel iron, and this is its shape. And cauterize it with one pass of the iron until you burn all the skin and end the cauterization at the gallbladder until you remove the lesion completely, then treat it with the remedies for swellings until it heals.
And this type of cauterization should be used only by one who has a long apprenticeship in the craft of medicine and has frequently handled such cases through experience; then he may undertake such work, but leaving it to me would be better.
The Twenty-Ninth Chapter.
In Setting the Wound.
The first ones described the setting of the wound with the roots of the zrawnd plant for cold wounds in this manner: one should take from the dry, long roots a single root longer than the others, and make it resemble the thickness of a finger. Then dip it in oil and heat it over fire. Then, apply one cautery between the connection of the vertebral column with the neck. Apply two small cauteries slightly below the chin on the side beneath the jaw. Apply two large cauteries above the chest between the third and fourth ribs.
And apply two more cauteries between the fifth and sixth ribs, slightly towards the back. Apply another one in the middle of the chest, and another above the stomach. Place three cauteries from behind, one between the shoulders, and two on the sides of the spine below the cautery between the hands.
And it should not be necessary to delve deeply with the cautery; it should only cause inflammation on the surface of the skin. Some early ones have mentioned that some people used an iron shoe-like clamp, which they would protect and insert between the ribs until it reaches the core of the swelling.
And the extraction of the mass should be as we mentioned in the case of a liver swelling. In this, using the cautery for treatment can either result in the patient's death immediately, or leave a keloid scar with no possibility of healing.
The Thirty-Third Chapter.
In regard to the condition of the liver.
If the treatment of the liver as described in the division of treatments does not improve the condition, sear it three times or four sears arranged along the length of the liver.
It should be seared in the shape of liver sears, with each scar spaced about the width of a finger or slightly more. The iron used for searing should be the same as described for searing the liver. Do not delve your hand deeply into the sear. The patient should be lying on their back.
The other approach is for the arm. Raise the skin near the liver where the arm ends. Raise the skin near the liver where the left arm ends. Your lifting of the skin should be about the width of the body, so that the sears fall along the length of the body.
Then insert the tongs carefully protected so that they penetrate the skin from the other side. Then remove the iron, leaving four sears. If you wish, you can sear with the three-pronged iron instead.
Then treat the site of the sear after you leave it to drain pus for many days. This is more effective than all other treatments mentioned above.
The Thirty-First Chapter.
On Searing for Aspiration.
Searing is only effective for cystic aspiration. If the patient has not responded to the various treatments described in the division of therapies, it should be seared with four sears around the sac and one on the stomach.
Kiyah on the liver and kiyah on the spleen, two kiyahs behind his back between the vertebrae one beside his chest and another beside his stomach, and the depth of the kiyah should be close to the thickness of the skin, then leave the kiyah open so that pus persists for a long time.
And do not omit the application after the kiyah for what is appropriate to bring together those skilled in the matter so that recovery comes quickly. The shape of the tongs used to kiyah the back should be clamp-like as described earlier, and those used for the back should be oil-like.
The Thirty-second Chapter.
On kiyah of the feet and legs.
If they swell in the ankle and are filled with yellow water, it should be kiyahed on the back of the foot at the spot between the thumb and forefinger.
And hold your hand with the tongs without bending it. Then lift your hand and do not return it at all, for this will cause the yellow water to drain, and the tongs should be held in this manner.
Then kiyah the legs with two kiyahs on each leg. The kiyah should be made with the sharp end of the tongs and should be along the length of the leg, one below the knee and another below it near the middle of the leg. On each thigh, there should be two kiyahs.
And leave the kiyah open without treatment for a long time, allowing the yellow water to drain, then treat it with all that we have mentioned.
The Thirty-Third Chapter.
In the Correction of Diarrhea.
If the diarrhea is due to cold and dampness, weakening the grasping and digestive powers in the stomach and intestines, and this has been treated with various therapies without success, and you find the patient strong enough for cauterization, then perform a large cauterization on his stomach. As described previously, perform a cauterization on the stomach with the circular iron, and four cauterizations around the navel using the gentle clay iron. Apply a large cauterization on cotton above the urethra, or two cauterizations.
If you find the dampness abundant and the patient strong enough for it, perform a cauterization on the pubic area and one on each buttock. Sometimes, you may add two small cauterizations to the stomach near the large one. This is an effective treatment whose benefit will not fail, if Allah wills it.
The Forty-Third Chapter.
In the Cautionary Use of Cauterization for Piles.
If there are chronic piles in the anus, many or one, and they are hard, thick, cold mixtures or bad dampness, and have been treated as described in the division without success, then cauterize the patient three times below the base of the spine, just below the waist, triangularly.
And cauterize below the navel with the size of two fingers. If you estimate that his stomach has weakened and his food does not digest, and you see his face swollen, then perform a large cauterization on the stomach as described before, and one on his liver. And some [cases] on the liver with a wooden tongs and leave the ironing open for a while then treat it until it heals, God willing.
The Thirty-fifth Chapter.
In ironing the warts.
After cutting them, if the warts have been cut, heat the tongs that resemble forceps. Then insert the heated ones into the same warts that have been cut and keep your hand there until the heated tongs reach the opening from which the blood flows. Do this one or two times.
If the warts are many, then boil each one separately as described, and treat it with a salve that suits it until it heals. If his boiling is a large ironing on cotton, it is more effective in benefiting.
The Thirty-sixth Chapter.
On ironing the nacora that may be in the bladder and its surroundings.
If the inflammation does not respond to the incision and the treatment we described in its place, and if it fails, it may heal with ironing. If any nacora occurs and pus and bad humors flow from it, the first thing you should do is measure it with a thin probe.
Then, measure the depth of the nacora with a thin probe. Heat the tongs that resemble forceps. Insert them heated into the same nacora at the depth indicated by the probe and in the quantity entered by the probe. Repeat the ironing one or two or three times as needed.
And take care to avoid burning the nerve if present or a great vein, and if the naseer opens into the bladder cavity or the intestine cavity.
And take care with all these places, and you do this only if the naseer is in a place of cooked flesh and you estimate that it is not penetrating. Then treat the place until it heals. If I incise the place and the materials cease from it and it remains thus for a time, know that it has healed completely.
And if the materials do not cease from it, know that it is penetrating or there is a decayed bone deep within or something like that which will be mentioned in its place.
The Seventh and Thirty-Third Chapter.
On the Treatment of the Kidney.
If pain occurs in the kidney due to cold or thick wind, and there is a deficiency of the essential fluid, it should be cauterized on the flanks on the same side as the kidney, cauterizing each kidney with the clamp mentioned earlier. Sometimes we might cauterize it a third time on the same tray, resulting in three cauterizations aligned, which proves more effective in benefit.
The Eighth and Thirty-Third Chapter.
On the Cautionary Treatment of the Bladder.
If there is weakness and relaxation of the bladder due to cold and dampness, such that it fails to retain the essential fluid (urine), cauterize it on the bladder below the pubic bone where the hair begins, one cauterization on the right side of the pubic bone and another on the left side.

Make the cauterization deeper to match the thickness of the entire skin, then treat it until it heals by the grace of God.
The Forty-first Chapter.
In Cauterizing the Sweat Gland.
If pain occurs in the region of the hip and this is due to凝聚的汗水，应当被轻柔地擦去，并让皮肤自然干燥。如果疼痛持续不减，应使用苦参或刺蒺藜等药物轻轻涂抹于患处。
Then apply the cauterization, performing it in two stages. Either use burning medicines or use fire cauterization. Fire cauterization can be done in various ways. One method is to cauterize three triangular areas directly on the hip itself.
And make the cauterization deep enough. The distance between each cauterization should be about the width of a finger. Use a metalawl for the cauterization. Alternatively, you can cauterize once in the middle of the hip itself, making four cauterizations in total. If desired, you can use the circle method mentioned earlier for cauterizing to remove the hip joint, using just one cauterization.
Let the circle encompass all of the hip and burn the entire thickness of the skin. This is the method for cauterizing the sweat gland if the pain is localized to the hip itself and does not extend to the thigh or leg.
If the pain extends to the thigh or leg, cauterize twice on the thigh at the position indicated by the disease as causing pain. Cauterize once above the greater trochanter about four fingers' width towards the outer side. Use a sharpawl for the cauterization, and make the depth of each cauterization match the thickness of the skin only.
And if the pain extends to about the fingers, treat it where he pointed with a cauterization of three or four points or more if needed. And if the pain is below the knee towards the leg, treat it with one surgical cautery.
And be careful in all cauterizations to ensure that you do not burn a major nerve or artery, as this will cause the patient great harm or lasting damage.
And I have seen cases of those who cauterized above the knee and were burned by the cautery, resulting in gangrene of the leg that reached the foot, causing all of it to ulcerate and rendering the entire foot useless. Then diarrhea and death ensued. If the pain was in both sides equally, they should be cauterized in this manner on both sides.
And some of the wise scientists described the cautery for the hip as follows: A tube is made of iron with a diameter of half a span. It is placed near its mouth on the core of a date palm pit or slightly smaller. Inside this tube, there are two other tubes.
And there is a distance of the span of an index finger between each tube. The tubes are open on both sides, and their height is about one or two spans. A holder is made of iron to hold the tubes securely. This is its shape.
Then it is heated over fire until it turns red and throws off sparks. It is then placed at the proper spot on the hip, and the patient leans on the correct side. He is cauterized three circular cauteries in one go. Then he is left for three days, and is dressed with oil. The wound is kept open for several days.
Often, treat it with the ointment until it heals. Said the author of this book: This type of cauterization is rarely used due to its severity and frightening appearance, and few find it bearable. However, it is a good cautery for those who can endure it and are affected by it in the right place.
As for cauterization with burning medicines, it is that you prepare two troughs similar to those used for placing calamine or iron.
It should be in their sides an elevation of about two spans or similar. It should be the distance between them as wide as the thickness of a finger. They should be open at the bottom and open at the top, and should be held together in this manner.
Then place it over the right hip and apply it to the affected side while lying on his healthy side. Hold your hand well, then pour boiling water between the two troughs, which has been heated slightly by fire. The affected person should endure its sharpness and burning sensation for about an hour. He will find the burning similar to fire.
Until the burning sensation subsides, then remove your hand using the tool and wipe all over the hip with fresh water. Leave him for three days and apply oil on him until the burn discoloration fades. Leave him for days as pus exudes from him, for this is more beneficial.
Then treat it with ointments until it heals. If the pain extends to the thigh or leg, make a mold for him as you would for the hip, according to its size. This is the description of the boiling water, and I have confirmed it in an article on the修复药物。
Take one part of salt of the sea and one part of unextinguished alkali from each, grind them together, put them in a new pot with a small hole at the bottom, and place another pot underneath to catch what drips through.
Pour enough fresh water over the salt and alkali to cover them by about an inch after mixing them well with your hand. Let the pot stand until the sharp water collects at the bottom of the lined pot. Gather all that sharp water, then pour it over another piece of alkali and another piece of salt, repeating the process again.
For it becomes then extremely sharp in its acidity, effective for many medical procedures and for the cauterization of all organs, as it does the work of fire itself. Some medicines used for cauterizing the hip also include thafsiya, honey from bladdernets, and alkali mixed with soap and ground up.
Galenus related a remedy for hip pain and women's ailments, praising it greatly and claiming that no other treatment is needed, asserting that it cures in one application.
It is even said that someone might have been carried to the bathhouse sick and emerged cured after using this remedy. One should take green vitriol; if green vitriol is not available, use new white vitriol, grind it with some fat, and apply it to the affected area of the hip, leg, or thigh where the pain is located.
Wear it and leave it on for three hours or until the patient feels the burning sensation has subsided. Then, bathe him and if his body becomes wet, immerse him in a bath tub. The pain will go away and he will be cured by the grace of God. If he is not cured, renew the compress after ten days.
Fain he shall be cured if Allah wills, and know that it is not advisable to use cauterization with these medicines except after the body has expelled its contents. And Dioscorides mentioned that the dung of the goat, when cauterized on the menstrual blood, is beneficial from it.
Cauterization shall be done as follows: Take wool and soak it in old oil and place it on the deep spot between the thumb and the wrist, which is closer to the wrist. Then take a dry goat's dung.
Ignite it with fire until it becomes a live coal, then place it on the wool and leave it until it extinguishes. Then take another piece and do the same until sensation returns to the middle of the arm reaching the hip, and the pain subsides by Allah's will. This type of cauterization is called the cauterization of dung.
The Fourth and Forty-Second Chapter.
On Cauterization for Back Pain.
Back pain may arise from many causes, such as a fall or a blow or excessive expulsion and the like. It is due to the accumulation of cold and moist matter, and cauterization is applied only in this type.
Which is due to the accumulation of cold matter. It should be cauterized on his back where the pain is, three rows, each as wide as a table. Mark the position with ink in each row and apply five or more cauterizations in each row, according to what you judge regarding the strength and condition of the patient.
And the branding shall be done with a point iron, or if you wish, brand it three or four times with a medium clamp iron on this pattern.
The thirty-fourth chapter.
On branding the beginning of the凸起。
This condition often affects young children. Its initial sign in a child is difficulty in breathing during sitting and movement. You will find at the end of his spinal vertebrae a swelling that protrudes above the other swellings.
If you see this and wish to stop it, brand it with an iron that is circular in this pattern. Let the branding take place evenly on every side of the vertebra. If you wish, brand it around the vertebra with a point iron in two or three rows, and let the points be close to one another. Then treat the area until it heals as we have mentioned.
And take care not to use branding for the凸起 which is caused by nerve spasms.
The forty-fourth chapter.
On branding for gout and joint pain.
If the joint pain is due to cold dampness flooding any part of the body, if the pain occurs in the legs, it is customary for doctors to call this gout specifically.
If the cold dampness gout does not respond to the treatments we mentioned for its cause and the pain persists, branding will alleviate it. This involves branding around the ankles after vomiting, with many brands using a medium oil iron on this pattern.
And if you need to prick the man's face, do it with the point pricking instrument. If the pains ascend to the knees or to other joints, and this often occurs, then apply to each knee three or four cauterizations from each side with that same oil-soaked iron instrument.
And if you need more than this cauterization, do it but do not deepen your cauterization; let it be about the thickness of the skin only. If the pains ascend to the hips or to the back, then use what we have mentioned for cauterization in its section.
And if the pains are only in the hands, prick around the knuckles as you turn two circles. If the pains remain in the fingers, prick each joint with a point and the hand comb. If the pains ascend after days to the elbows or to the armpits.
And apply it from each side. No case should be without good consideration and taking of medicines; for if the food is well digested and the phlegm is expelled, then he will recover with this cauterization, God willing.
The Fifth and Forty-Third Chapter.
On the Cautionary Cauterization.
If a fistula occurs in the abdomen and some of the intestines prolapse to the groin, and this is a recent onset, it should be advised that the patient abstain from food for a day and use mild laxatives to help expel the feces from his abdomen.
Then he should lie down before you on his back and you should advise him to hold himself until the prolapsed part (intestine or fluid) protrudes. Then push it back with your finger, and mark under the fistula, below the ilium bone, a mark resembling half a circle, its ends going towards the upper part of the body.
Then protect the appearance of this iron tongs.
Until it comes white throwing sparks then return the肠中或液体到其体内，然后放置仆人的手在该处以防肠中物突出。我已经在患者两腿之间分开，并在他的下方放了一个垫子，另一个仆人支撑他的双腿。
And another holds his hands. Then the iron tongs are placed on the same mark. You hold the tongs with your hand, standing straight and erect, and apply it until you reach the bone or repeat if it did not reach the bone initially.
And you must preserve your effort to prevent the protrusion of the intestines while cauterizing to avoid burning it, which would result in either death or severe illness for the patient. Know that if you do not reach the bone with the cauterization, your work has failed. It is advisable to use tongs appropriate for children on their size and for adults on their size.
Then treat the place of cauterization with oil after three days until the blackness of the burn disappears. Then treat it with other ointments until he is cured. Let the patient lie on his back for forty days until the wound is healed.
And you should make his food during his treatment what softens his belly, to prevent the protrusion of the intestines upon straining and defecation. Then, if he wishes to rise after forty days, use a tight bandage for another forty days. Reduce his exertion, overfilling with food and drink, and intense crying.
If this remedy is applied in this manner, it will be completely cured by God willing. I will mention the treatment of hernia by incision in its own chapter if God wills. As for the hernia that occurs in other parts of the abdomen and is newly begun, if you desire that it not increase, apply a circular tying at its size. Let what is burned on the skin be about two-thirds, then treat it as we have mentioned; for it will not increase God willing. Some early authorities have also recommended searing the hernia with a triangular iron as shown.
After learning to mark the hernia with a pencil, draw one line across at the upper side of the hernia and another down. Place your hand in the middle with a single circular branding iron. The first brand is easier and better God willing.
The Sixth and Forty-First Chapter.
On Branding the Wedge.
If pain occurs in some organs due to a fall or blow and this pain persists for a long time, and medical treatment proves ineffective, it should be branded with a branding iron. The size of the brand should be adjusted according to the organ's size and its strength or weakness.
And if the pain and the swelling are removed by the first branding, it will be cured. Otherwise, reapply the branding, for it is customary for such pains to spread to adjacent organs. It should therefore be followed by branding until the disease is cured.
The Seventh and Forty-First Chapter.
فى كىّ الجذام.
Amma al-majdzumun qayy yanfaعون بالكى نفعا عظيما وليسعما صنف الجذام الذى يكون من قبل تعفن البلغم والسوداء.
If you desire to cauterize him, look and see if the jiddam is newly begun and treat it as we mentioned in the division. If it does not subside and does not stop and thou fearest that the illness will seize upon all his humours, cause it five cauteries on the head. The first in the middle of the forehead as is usual, and the second below it toward the brow near the end of the hair. Two on the temples, and one behind at the spot of the mastoid process. Apply the cautery with some force, but not too much, so that it affects the bone slightly.
And the crusts fall from it, making it easier for the thick vapors to pass through. Cauterize him also on the liver in the same manner as we have previously mentioned, but if the jiddam has continued in the patient and its appearance is clear and obvious, then you should apply these cauteries on the head that we have mentioned. Cauterize on the tip of the nose, two on the cheeks, two on the cervical vertebrae, six on the lumbar vertebrae, one large one on the sacrum when the tail is unable to reach, and another above it on the same level. Two on the hips, one on each hip. Two on the knees, one on each knee, two on the armpits, two on the elbows, two on the wrists, and cauterize on each joint of the fingers and toes. Cauterize on each heel of his feet and brand his hands.
And take care of the nerve at the back of the heels so as not to burn them, and some may be seared on the bone of the thigh, another on the mouth of the stomach, and another on the liver. Know that the more you sear, the better and more effective it is.
And know that the sick do not feel pain from searing as much as the healthy do, because their bodies are numb. The size of the irons for searing should be according to the organs and joints as mentioned before in the qualities of the metals.
Then treat the searing with fine safflower powder and honey, and other treatments as well, until it heals if Allah wills.
The Eighth and Forty-Third Chapter.
In searing for numbness, when a part of the body is numbed and treated with medicines, ointments, and dressings but does not heal, then the same part should be seared according to what the bone or its size deserves. Let your searing be deeper in thick skin somewhat.
Then treat it with ointment until it heals. Searing may also be applied to some numbness that affects the hand and foot at the vertebrae of the spine where the nerve that moves that part is located, and this will remove the numbness.
And none should do this except one who is well-versed in the anatomy of the organs and the exits of the nerves that move the body.
The Ninth and Forty-Third Chapter.
On searing for blindness.
If the scab has become old and no medical remedy is effective for it, perform a cautery on it to a shallow depth according to the thickness of the skin until the whiteness disappears and its color changes.
Then treat it with lentil powder mixed with saffron, duck's blood or falcon's blood, one part of each, mixing all together, applying it on a cloth and covering the area until it heals.
The Fifty-First Chapter.
For the cautery of cancer.
If the cancer is new and you wish to stop its progression, cauterize around it in a circular manner as if you were tracing a circle. Some wise men have recommended performing a severe cautery in its center. I do not see this as necessary because I expect it to ulcerate, and I have seen this happen several times.
The correct procedure is to cauterize around it in a circular manner as we said, or with many small cauteries.
The Fifty-First Chapter.
For the cautery of diphtheria.
If diphtheria occurs in one of the tonsils and its development is delayed either due to the powerful influence it has received or because the patient is an old man with little blood, or due to time itself, and you wish to hasten its development, cauterize around it with many small cauteries in a puncturing manner.
Then leave it, as this will hasten its development. If you wish to delay it by cauterization, heat the cautery, which is shown in this image.
And place it in the center of the blister until the skin permeates and let the cauterization be from below so that the pus flows easily, then treat it as appropriate until it heals.
The Fifty-Second Chapter.
For cauterizing the eaten lesion.
The eaten lesion is a corruption that spreads in the tissue and eats it as fire consumes dry wood. If you see the eaten lesion in a place where cauterization with fire is possible, heat many small and large wooden pliers according to what suits the location where the eaten lesion is located.
Then cauterize it from every direction until all the corruption is completely removed and nothing remains, then leave it for three days and apply the powdered sulfur with oil to the cauterized areas until all the pus and corruption is expelled.
Then treat it with ointments that promote healing of the flesh. If after three days you see that the flesh is growing healthily without any corruption, then do not re-cauterize. However, if there is still corruption in some areas, re-cauterize those areas. The eaten lesion can be treated with a sharp remedy.
For it serves as a substitute for fire, more effective in its benefit. I have mentioned its treatment with a sharp remedy in the classification; take it from there when you need it.
The Fifty-Third Chapter.
For cauterizing the bent and unbent pliers.
Often this illness occurs in the soles of the feet and it is a rough thing that blisters the man. The branding of it can be done in two ways: either by branding with fire or by branding with sharp water.
As for branding with fire, you should heat a hollow tongs resembling the quill of an eagle, made of iron to fit around the nail from all sides and be thin at the edges. Then you should place it hot on the nail and move your hand around the nail with the tongs until the heat reaches the depth of the nail.
And you should leave it for three days until it suppurates. Then, apply a compress of wild bakebread made soft with salt and leave the compress on it overnight; it will fall off from its roots. Then treat the wound site with a salve that dissolves flesh until it heals. If the nails are not reversed.
And often this occurs on the surface of the body, especially in the hands and feet. It should be treated by taking a tube made of brass or iron or resembling the quill of an eagle and placing it over the nail or thorn. Then, pour a small amount of sharp water into the tube.
And hold your hand while you rotate it slightly with a quick movement of your fingers to allow the edge of the tube to affect the root of the nail. The sharp water will find its way deep into the root of the nail, and the patient should endure the sting of the sharp water for a moment.
Then you should leave it, for the nail will fall off along with its roots. Do this to each one until all that is left of it in the body is removed. Then treat the sites where they fell out with salves that promote flesh growth.
The Fifty-fourth Chapter.
In the Correction of the Sprain.
If a sprain occurs in any nafp from cold or from quartan fever or the like, it should be cauterized four or five times with pins on the back, and one cauterization between each pin. In his chest, one cauterization. And on his stomach, one cauterization with the oil-soaked iron press; for the sprain subsides and the cold disease is hastened by ripening.
The Fifty-fifth Chapter.
In the Cautioning of Boils Occurring in the Body.
Boils may appear in the body as ugly swellings resulting from cold, thick, corrupt materials. As soon as they appear, it should be cauterized with a light cauterization at the top of each boil using a rush stick that has been ignited at its end, or with the stem of a long zarund plant, or with an oiled iron press.
And the dimples should be cauterized at their first appearance in this manner; it should not be increased, and the effective remedy will dissipate, and the patient will recover. However, it should be done after the patient has vomited by purging.
The Fifty-sixth Chapter.
In the Cautioning of Bleeding Occurring Upon Cutting the Vein.
Bleeding often occurs from a vein that has been severed by a wound inflicted from the outside, or when cutting a tumor, or cauterizing an organ, and it may be difficult to stop.
If this happens to one of those, hasten with your hand to the mouth of the artery and place your third finger upon it, and press it so that the blood is contained under your finger and nothing escapes from it. Then put in the fire a variety of small and large cotton swabs and blow upon them until they become very hot.
Then take one, either small or large, according to the wound and the place where the artery has ruptured. Place the swab on the same artery after you remove your finger with the wheel and hold the swab until the bleeding stops.
If the bleeding persists when you remove your finger from the mouth of the artery and the swab is cooled, take another swab with the wheel from those in the prepared fire, and continue doing this with one after another until the bleeding stops.
And take care not to burn any vein, for if you do, you will harm the patient with another ligature. Know that an artery, once it has bled, cannot be tied off entirely, especially if it is a large artery, except in four ways: either by cauterizing as we said, or by amputating if it has not already been amputated. If it is amputated, its ends will contract and the bleeding will cease. Either it can be tied with threads tightly, or medicines that are capable of stopping the bleeding should be applied to it, along with firm compression by ligatures.
As for those who attempt to tie it off with a ligature or by pulling on the vein or placing burning substances and similar items, it will not cease entirely except in rare cases. If such a situation arises and there is no physician or medicine at hand, one should hasten to place the third finger on the mouth of the wound itself, as we have described.
It is tightened strongly until the blood congeals and stops flowing from above the wound and onto the vessel; the finger does not come off when dipped in extremely cold water constantly until the blood freezes, thickens, and ceases. During this time, you should examine what it requires of cauterization or medicine.
The Second Chapter.
In the Incision and Extraction and Fissure and Wounds and Similar Conditions.
Al-Bucasis said: We have already mentioned in the First Chapter all diseases that are suitable for cauterization with fire and burning medicines, and their causes, instruments, and types of cauterization devices. We have presented this as chapters from the thigh to the foot.
And I shall follow this path in this chapter as well, so that the student may easily obtain what is needed.
Before I begin with this, you should know, my sons, that this chapter contains even more risk than the first chapter on cauterization.
And for that reason, the warning in this should be stronger, as the work in this chapter is great, and much vomiting of blood occurs, which is necessary for life when a vein is opened or a wound is made on a tumor, extraction from an abscess, incision for drainage, removal of an arrow, or incision for a stone, and similar conditions that accompany all of them with risk and fear, and death occurs in most of them.
And I advise you to avoid what involves doubt for you. For in this craft, various kinds of people with different afflictions may come to you; some may be weary of their illness and find death easy.
Severely affected by his wound and the length of his illness, to the extent that it indicates death, and some of them spend their wealth on you to relieve you in hope of recovery while illness persists, it is not fitting for you to rely on anyone among them having this characteristic at all.
Let your caution be stronger than your desire and eagerness, and do not proceed with anything of that without certain knowledge by which the blessed outcome is established. Use in all your treatments a contribution from knowledge and a warning of what safety may lead to.
For in that you will find aid in acquiring praise and glory, and being remembered with honor and gratitude. May Allah guide you, O sons of righteousness, and grant you the right path and success. Verily, it is in His hand; there is no deity but He.
And I have arranged this chapter into sections as was done in the chapter on cauterization from the hand to the foot, so that it may be easier for you to obtain what you desire, by Allah's will.
The First Section.
On the Treatment of Water That Accumulates in the Heads of Boys.
This illness often affects boys at birth if the midwife presses their heads without gentleness. It may also occur due to a hidden cause that is unknown.
I have not seen this cause in anyone other than boys. All those I saw among them died sooner due to it, so I decided not to use this method. I have also seen a boy whose head was filled with water, and the head grew larger every day. Until the boy could not bear to sit on himself because of the great size of his head and the moisture increasing until he perished.
This moisture may gather between the skin and bone, or under the bone on the diploe. The work in this regard: if the moisture is between the skin and bone and the swelling is small, it should be incised in the middle of the head with one incision across, and the length of the incision should be about two palms until the moisture flows out. This is a picture of the forceps.
If the moisture is greater and the swelling larger, make it two intersecting incisions as shown in this figure.
If the moisture is under the bone, and its sign is that you see the scalp incisions open from all sides, and the water drains when you squeeze it with your hand towards the inside, and this is not hidden from you, it should be incised in the middle of the head in three incisions as shown in this figure.
After the incision, all the moisture should be removed. Then, tie the incisions with sutures and dressings. Next, apply a drink and oil over it daily for five days. Then remove the bandage and treat the wound with thread and ointments. Do not neglect to properly tie the head, and nourish the patient with dry and slightly moist food.
Until the organ strengthens and heals. Another method for the incision is to look where the bone of the swelling and the accumulation of water are evident, as it may be more at the back of the head or in front of it or on the right side or on the left.
You should incise the swelling where the water accumulation is evident, and make the incision as large as you can while ensuring that you do not cut a vein to cause bleeding. This will lead to the patient's death from the bleeding along with the expulsion of moisture.
The Second Chapter.
Cutting the veins which are behind the ears and known as Hassas.
When a severe illness affects the eyes or the chest and lasts, and medical treatment proves ineffective, then cutting these veins is the appropriate remedy.
If you desire to cut them, you should shave the patient's head with a razor. Then, rub the area with a rough cloth so that the veins become visible. Next, pull the neck of the patient with his garment. Then, look where the pulse beats and note the two depressed positions which are behind the ears; but what is hidden may be found in some people only.
Then, mark these two positions with a pen. Next, cut them using the clamping forceps by cutting up to the bone. This can be done by exposing the head. If you prefer, you can insert the forceps from under the vein and cut it from above. The length of the cut should be about two compressed fingers.
If the vein is cut, the blood will flow in a pulsatile manner, rushing forward and backward in a continuous stream. If the vein does not become visible by touch, you should estimate its position about three fingers' breadth behind the ear. Then, mark it with a pen and cut up to the bone.
Send six draughts of blood in the middle, or perhaps more or less. All this should be done according to what you judge appropriate for the patient's strength and the fullness of his veins. Then, look at the wound; if there is anything remaining on the bone from the dura mater, cut it off.
Lest a hot tumor arise, then the wound be tightened with a wick of torn cloth, then treated with ointments until it heals.
The Third Chapter.
Separate the vessels in the eyebrows.
If a person has a chronic sinusitis or acute attacks due to hot humidity and heat in the muscles of the eyebrows, or severe and persistent headaches, and medical treatments have not been effective, we have found that trying to separate the vessels in the eyebrows or cauterizing them, as described, can be effective in these diseases.
The procedure for separating the vessels involves shaving the hair in the eyebrows. You should aim to identify the visible vessel in the brow; you will recognize it by its pulse, and very little of it goes unnoticed except perhaps in individuals with sparse hair.
Or when there is severe cold, if the vessel is hidden from you, make the patient tilt his neck with the help of a cloth covering. Then, press the area with a cloth or apply heat with hot water until the vessel becomes clearly visible. Then take the forceps, which is depicted in this image. Then, gently strip the skin with it until you reach the vessel. Insert a forceps and pull it upwards to remove it from the skin. Detach it from the fascia on all sides. If the vessel is thin, twist it with the tip of the forceps. Then, cut a portion of it according to the distance between its ends, making sure not to cause bleeding. If it is not amputated and does not rupture, the blood will not clot at all. Afterwards, extract six ounces to three ounces of blood.
If the vein is large, it should be tied at two places with a strong doubled thread. The thread should either be from the intestine or from the tendons of the forearm to prevent decay from reaching it before the wound heals and cause bleeding.
Then cut the remaining part between the ties. You can do this at that time or after some other time. If you wish, sear its ends with a surgical iron until they char off. This can be done by itself or better as we said.
Except if it is affected by fever or has a rectified temperament, for searing helps in eliminating moisture and is more beneficial. After clamping the veins, the area should be stuffed with old wool and tightly covered with bandages. After removal of the bandages, treat with drying medicines that promote flesh growth and continue with fomentations until God wills his recovery.
If bleeding occurs from the vein during your work, act quickly to tie it off either by searing or by stuffing the area with wool and tightening your grip until the blood stops. If you have neither of these, place your finger there to cause the blood to clot.
And cool the area with very cold water until the pain subsides and tighten it as needed. To make this easier than clamping the vein, after marking the positions with ink, sear the arteries with this two-edged iron.
And apply it with very hot water until it reaches the bone, searing the arteries at two places to separate what lies between its ends. For it will not stick together with this searing at all. This is the image of the iron.
The blades of the scissors should resemble the two small curved parts, except that they should be much less sharp than the blade. For if they were as sharp as the blade, cold would reach them quickly and the flesh would not remain intact. If there is some thickness in them, heat will adhere to them.
Cut the flesh quickly, and this work is better than all others, lighter and easier. Let the distance between the blades be about the thickness of a finger.
The Fourth Chapter.
In the Treatment of Continuous Flow of Hot Tears into the Eyes.
If the tears flow continuously from the vessels on the forehead from outside, and no treatment with medicines has benefited, and I have seen the patient's face turn red. And he feels a throbbing on his forehead like the biting of ants, and his eyes are weak and wet, with the eyelids peeling due to the sharpness of the tears. The first to treat this condition were compelled to perform this work, which they call treatment by the sword. It involves ordering the patient to shave the hair from his forehead.
Then, make three parallel incisions along the forehead. The length of each incision should be about two fingers. Each incision should be parallel to the length of the nose in the middle of the forehead, the second slightly offset from the movement of the muscle in the cheek, and the third on the other side.
And take care not to cut the two arteries on the sides. Keep your hand away from connecting the two jaws. The distance between each incision should be about three fingers when closed. Have with you sponges ready or many dry, porous pieces that can absorb the blood.
Then enter the sharp forceps whose shape is shown here. From the incision following the cheek to the middle incision, remove all the skin between these incisions along with the subcutaneous tissue. Then do the same from the middle incision to the third incision. Afterwards, extract this forceps. And enter the first incision also with another instrument called a single-sharp-bladed scalpel and smooth but non-sharp on the other side. This is its shape:.
And its sharp side should face towards the flesh adhering to the skin, and its smooth side towards the bone. Push it until it reaches the middle incision, and cut with it all the vessels descending from the head to the eyes without the cut reaching the surface of the skin.
Then do this in the middle incision to the other, and after a moderate amount of blood has flowed, compress the areas from where the clotted blood was cut. Then in each incision, place a wick of cotton and put a wet pad of纱布、浸透了药水或醋和油的。
To prevent a hot swelling, on the third day remove the bandage and use much cold water for irrigation. Then treat it with the ointment of baslicum with rose oil and whatever is used to heal wounds until it heals, God willing.
The Fifth Chapter.
On the Treatment of Tears and Catarrhs Afflicting the Eyes from the Back of the Head.
When someone experiences frequent sharp and persistent catarrh, and you see the eyes as small and shriveled with weakened vision, and the eyelids are injured with the eyebrows falling out. There is a sharp, painful headache deep in the head and continuous sneezing. From these symptoms, know that these materials and discharges come from many deep veins. The best treatment for this is this treatment: Order the patient to shave his forehead, then make one incision in the middle of the forehead.
There is a sharp, painful headache deep in the head and continuous sneezing. From these symptoms, know that these materials and discharges come from many deep veins. The best treatment for this is this treatment: Order the patient to shave his forehead, then make one incision in the middle of the forehead. Or raise it slightly in width and start the incision from the left zygomatic bone to the right zygomatic bone. The incision should reach the bone, and keep your hand away from the movable muscles of the zygomatic region involved in chewing. Once the bone is exposed and all the blood is dried with a sponge, proceed.
Separate the lips of the incision with dry cotton or a flax thread. Then, pull from above with sutures and dip the sutures in the drink and oil to prevent the formation of a hot swelling. When it has healed and you see that the hot swelling has subsided, you should massage the bone until flesh begins to grow on it.
Then, treat it with the dried preparation that promotes flesh growth. For example, take two parts of wheat flour and four parts of aloes. Prepare a paste from them and use it to promote flesh growth in such injuries.
Chapter Six.
In the treatment of what falls into the ear.
All that falls into the ear is of four kinds: either a metallic stone, or something similar to stone like iron and glass; or a plant seed such as chickpeas and nuts; or a liquid substance such as water and vinegar.
And if it is an animal, whenever a stone or a substance similar to a stone falls into the ear, expose the ear to the sun. If you see the stone has absorbed some saffron or safran oil or frankincense in it, then try to remove it by moving the head or pressing with a cloth. 塞住鼻孔，当打喷嚏时，在耳周围上一条细绳或羊毛圈，然后将耳朵向上提。经常使用此疗法可使石块排出。如果未排出，可用轻轻的夹子尝试取出，这就是它的形状。
If it comes out with the gentle curved forceps, otherwise try to remove it with a mild and slightly bent blind probe. If it does not come out with that, make a copper tube and insert the end of the tube into the ear hole.
塞住铜管周围的空隙，用浸有油的棉球封闭，以防空气从其他途径进入。然后用力抽吸，经常这样可以将其吸出。如果未按上述方法吸出，可用一点鼻药或鸽子药轻轻放入导管的末端。
After wrapping it tightly with a cotton cloth, gently insert it into the ear hole after drying the ear from moisture. If it does not come out with all that we have described, act quickly to incise before a hot swelling or spasm occurs.
The incision recipe is to cut the vein at the cheek first and let it bleed according to its strength. Then sit the patient in front of you and turn his ear upwards. Make a small incision at the base of the ear where the fat is located in the lower part.
The incision should be semilunar in shape until you reach the stone, then remove it with whatever instrument is possible, then suture the incision as soon as convenient and treat it until it heals.
And if the fallen thing in the ear is one of the seeds that swell and grow, try to remove it with what we have mentioned. If it does not yield to removal, take a fine sharp scissors like this.
And try to cut that type of fallen seed in the ear with it. You do this only if you are certain that that seed has adhered to the ear's moisture until it becomes many small pieces, then remove it with the blind forceps or a gentle wick or by sucking.
As we have mentioned, it is easy to remove. As for water that has entered the ear, it should first be treated with a gentle sneeze using a condy. The ear should be filled with some old cotton, and he should lie on the side of the ear that contains the water; if this removes it, that is good.
And if not, take small pieces of stone along the length of your fingers, smooth and thin. Warm them slightly by fire and insert one of them into the hole in his ear. Strike with another stone on the stone in the ear.
And he should continue doing this with one stone after another until all the water is removed. The water may also be removed by taking a piece of reed or bird feather, inserting its end into the ear, and heating the other end over fire until most of it burns, then replacing it with another feather.
Do that several times until all the water comes out or draw it with the tube as mentioned earlier for the stone. As for expelling the animal within, see if it is small like a louse and the like; then treat it as mentioned in the division.
If its body is large and can be felt, try to extract it with forceps and suction tubes. Its removal is easier than all that which occurs in the ear. As for extracting worms generated in the ear, if treating it as mentioned in the division in our article on caustics does not alleviate the condition.
You should look into the ear in the sunlight. If you see anything resembling a worm, extract it with forceps or gentle suction tubes. If you do not see anything, take this as its image.
Narrow at the bottom and wide at the top, insert the fine end into the ear to the extent that the patient can tolerate it. Then suck on it strongly. Do this several times until all the worms come out. If they do not come out, plug around the tube with wax as mentioned for the stone.
If they do not come out as described, use the caustics that were mentioned and which the early practitioners have tested for killing worms. You can find this in the article on caustics. You should pour oils and medicines into the ear with this instrument; here is its image:
As you can see, it is made from silver or copper. It is narrow at the bottom with a small hole, and wide at the top. If you wish, the tube within the cylinder can be made of tight-fitting copper. Alternatively, you could use reed and wrap cloth tightly around its end.
Then pour the oil or the juice or what you want from these medicines into the tube and put it in the ear. Then insert the wick with cotton from above and squeeze it with a moderate pressure until the oil goes into the cavity of the ear and he feels it.
Let the medicine enter by it, and let what you pour in the ear be slightly warmed in the fire. Beware that the thing which you drip in it be not too cold or too hot, for the ear cannot bear that.
Seventh Chapter.
In the Treatment of Temporary Occlusion of the Ear.
Some infants may be born with their ear canals intact and uncannulated.
And it may also occur in some people that there is a blockage in the ear canal due to a wound or flesh growing in it. This blockage may be deep within the ear canal and not visible.
And it may appear slightly outside the canal and be visible. That which appears deep in the ear and is not visible is usually difficult to remove, and that which is visible should have the ear filled with the medicine and placed in the sun. Examine it. If you see the blockage visibly, open it with a gentle forceps. This is its appearance:
Its end has a slight and limited prominence, while the rest of the forceps is smooth on both sides to avoid injuring the ear. If the blockage is due to flesh that has grown in the ear canal, grasp it with a gentle tweezers and cut it with great care until all the flesh is removed.
If the obstruction is deep in the ear, take a soft, smooth probe and warm it slightly in fire, then insert it into the ear canal. If you sense the obstruction and the patient experiences a decrease in hearing, gently withdraw it.
Be careful not to injure the ear nerve. Then insert a wick into the ear canal to the extent of the hole, having moistened it with Egyptian ointment. Do this for several days until you are safe from the wound joining or take a wick, moisten it in water, and sprinkle it with powdered zاجا.
Use it, for if you see that the ear has become swollen with a hot inflammation, you should remove the wick and replace it with another one that has been moistened in cyrtite prepared with rose oil until the hot inflammation subsides. Then treat it until it heals.
If there is bleeding, dampen a sponge or cloth in cold water and place it on the ear. Use all other treatments that stop the mentioned bleeding as described in the section on styptics.
Chapter Eight.
In the Treatment of Thrombi That Affect the Eyelids.
These thrombi that affect the eyelids may be wet or dry. In either case, you should grasp them with forceps or a claw and cut them out from their roots using fine scissors. Then apply powdered zاجا to the affected area.
If there is bleeding from it, cauterize it with a gentle iridectomy needle. Better to cauterize it after cutting it out. Often it returns if any part of its root remains. If you cauterize it with fire, however, it burns the root and does not return.
The Ninth Chapter.
In the Treatment of Cold Affection in the Eyelids.
Often in the eyelids there appears something resembling cold in its intensity and hardness.
And therefore it is called cold, which is a combination of thick moisture in the upper and lower eyelid. The treatment involves looking at it; if the cold is prominent on the surface of the eyelid and moves to every direction, then its condition is simple, so make a slit in it lengthwise.
Then strip it off from every side gently until it is completely removed, then stitch it with forceps and cut it. If you are unable to cut it, do not cut the eyelid until it is thoroughly severed by cutting; this will not harm the patient in any way. If the slit is large, suture it up and treat it until it heals.
And if it is small, there is no harm in it; the ointment will heal and tighten it. If the cold is inclined towards the inner surface of the eyelid, turn the eyelid and stitch the cold with forceps without needing to make a cut, and cut it off from every side.
And if the eyelid is thoroughly severed by cutting, this will not harm anything. Then wash the eye after cutting the cold with saline water and treat the area with something that tightens it until the patient recovers.
The Tenth Chapter.
In the Treatment of Ptosis Which Appears in the Eyelid.
Ptosis is a fleshy growth in the layers of the upper eyelid. This condition most often affects boys, making their eyes appear heavy and causing them to be susceptible to colds at night. They are unable to look at sunlight. In order that the tears may reach them quickly.
And therefore you see them lying on their faces always and sleeping on them, with their eyelids wet beneath the eyebrows and the swelling of the eyes apparent. And when you press the place with your fingers, you feel the swelling between them. The work to be done is that the patient places his head in your lap.
Then take a cloth of cotton, prepare from it a compress, and make from that compress a circle as large as the swelling on all sides. Then place it over the swelling and press it with your fingers from all sides to gather the swelling in the center of the circle.
Then make a incision in the center of that wetness with the bistoury horizontally, and let the width of the incision not be wider than the incision made in the flesh. As for the depth, it should be deep enough to reach the swelling.
In most cases, the swelling protrudes from the incision in the form of a piece of white fat. Draw it out with a cloth that you have wrapped around your fingers and move your hand to the right and left until it is completely drained. Be careful not to widen the incision too much, lest the bistoury enter the eye and injure it.
If the swelling does not appear in the first incision, it should be widened very slightly with care until the swelling protrudes. Then draw it out as we said. Next, dip a cloth in vinegar and water, place it on the area, and secure it with a bandage. Some people crush salt for this purpose.
He places it in the cavity of the incision to dissolve what remains of that moisture, then treats it until it heals. If something happens in the place and a hot tumor appears, he treats it with soothing dressings until it heals.
The Eleventh Chapter.
On Kinds of Tightening the Eye.
If a fold of excess eyelid tissue grows above the natural course under the natural eyelids and becomes established, it will harm the eye and cause various diseases such as constant tearing, laxity of the eyelids, whitening, and hardness until this becomes a cause for the loss of vision.
Tightening the eye can be done in four ways: either by cauterization with fire, or by a sharp medication as mentioned earlier in the section on cauterization, or by tightening through cutting and缝合，或如我所提及的，通过使用竹签。
You should place the patient's head on your lap, then use your left hand to turn the eyelid. If it turns, do nothing else. Otherwise, insert a needle with a thread from beneath the eyelid and let the needle pass with the thread above, making sure it is near the hair line. Then pull the thread upwards using the eyelid.
Then turn it with the forceps. Next, incise the inner side of the eyelid without cutting the excess hair using the separating forceps from above downward. Then pass the thread and place a small pad of cotton or cloth under the eyelid. Finally, suture the eyelid with needle and thread.
Like the shape of an aspen leaf, but it should be shaped to the extent you want to lift the eyelid, as this can vary among people. Some may need to cut a suitable amount from the eyelid according to how lax the eyelid has become.
And some require cutting less than all of that, according to the degree of relaxation of the eyelid, then incise with the forceps along the lines which you have been taught, and begin from the outer corner to the inner corner, and let each incision be near the natural hair by the thickness of a strand of flax.
Then introduce the scalpel into one of the corners of the skin, then strip it entirely. Gather the two lips with a needle and细针和细线缝合，擦拭血液，将剩余的线粘在眉毛上用一些碎屑。
Then leave the sutures and threads for about three or four days, then treat it. If you prefer, you can leave the wound untreated and treat it with something that dries and constricts, for the eyelid will rise when the wound is sealed and healed, and suturing is better.
This method of toning the eyelid, as mentioned by the ancients, has a burden for the patient, yet it is of good workmanship and poses no danger. Another method in toning the eyelid is to teach the eyelid a shape like that of an aswad leaf, as we have described. Then raise the eyelid with three forceps, either spread apart or grouped in this manner:.
Then cut the remaining eyelid with small scissors in this manner, cutting with moderation:.
If you are unable to hold the forceps or they do not suit you, take a needle with a thread and insert it in the middle of the shape. Insert another thread near the outer corner and a third near the inner corner. Gather the threads with your fingers moderately, then raise your hand moderately.
Raise the taught skin completely as we described then gather the wound's lips by suturing and treat it until it heals, if a hot swelling appears upon cutting or incising calm that swelling with calamine or similar anesthetizing ointments.
And the lower eyelid may also present with its lashes turning inward. It should be treated with what we have mentioned for cutting, suturing, and cauterization or with a sharp medication. The cauterization or the sharp medication is more effective and gentler on the patient than cutting and suturing. In both cases, cutting and suturing are preferable.
Cauterization with cauteries is done as follows: The eyelid should be turned, and a incision is made from the inside as described. Then, two thin rods or sticks are made, their length equal to the length of the eyelid and their width less than that of forceps.
And I have applied cautery to their ends on both sides where the threads adhere. Then, they are gathered gently as is preferable for the eyelid, and the rods are pulled taut from both sides tightly. It is left for days; the tightened skin dies, blackens, and rots.
Until it falls off by itself. If it heals slowly, apply cauterization with the cautery, then treat it until it heals. When it adheres, the eyelid will rise, and the eyelashes will not fall out. This is the image of the rods, which you should make in this shape and size, both in length and width.
The Twelfth Chapter.
On Raising the Grey Hair from the Eye with Needles.
If a hair or two hairs are to be handled, it should be done by taking a fine needle and inserting therein a thin smooth silk thread. Then gather its ends and tie them very gently. The length of the thread should be about a span.
Then, insert another thin thread into the ligature and tie its ends if you wish. Then place the patient's head on your lap and let it be near the sun to see the work clearly, as it is a delicate operation. Then insert the needle through the ligature into the base of the extra hair.
And pass it through the eyelid with the forceps until it comes out above the natural hair. Then pull the thread upwards towards the ligature and insert that hair into the ligature if it is one or two or three, no more.
Then pull it with your hand until the hair comes out along with the ligature in the eyelid with the natural hair. If you pulled the ligature but the hair did not come out with it, pull the ligature downwards with the thread that you had inserted in it until the ligature comes out of the upper hole.
Then insert the hair again and pull both of them. You do this until it rises through the upper hole and you see it with your eye. Then release the ligature and the thread, and take them out. Tighten the eyelid and keep it tightened for two or three days until the hair takes its place and flesh grows on it.
If the hair is short, either add to it a long hair from the natural hair, which will rise with it, or leave it until it grows longer, then raise it.
The Thirteenth Chapter.
In the Treatment of the Cutaneous Wound That Occurs in the Upper Eyelid.
That wound is called arnbeh. This wound can be either natural or accidental; the accidental one occurs from the cutting or burning or something similar.
The procedure is to cut the wound and separate its edges, making a wick of cotton between them. Bind it until it heals, and do not use things that dry and constrict in its treatment.
If you do that, the wound will return worse than before. Instead, use relaxing substances such as cumin seeds, fomentation with water in which Iridomyrmex leaves and cotton seeds have been boiled, and ointments of diakhilon mixed with some fat, applying them to the wick.
The principle of its treatment is to strive with every means to prevent it from sticking in the manner it was originally. This procedure we mentioned is part of correcting the wound; it is not about restoring the area's original appearance exactly as it was.
The Fourteenth Chapter.
In the Treatment of the Cutaneous Wound That Occurs in the Lower Eyelid.
This wound that occurs in the lower eyelid is called a shtra. It can be either natural or accidental; the accidental one occurs from a cut, or a tear, or burning, and so on.
The procedure is to take a needle with a doubled thread and insert it into the flesh, passing it from the left margin to the right margin so that the thread ends up at the edges of the flesh. Then, pull the flesh upward with the needle and cut it with a broad forceps.
If the shape of the eyelid returns as it should, otherwise take Meruda and place it on the place of the cut and turn it with the eyelid and make two cuts on the inner side of the eyelid and let the ends of the cuts be from the corners of the cut until they meet, making thus a corner. Until it meets, it becomes shaped like this:
And it is the Greek letter lambda. Then that flesh is removed to the extent that the acute side of it is lower than the eyelid, then the separated parts are gathered with two sutures and sewn with a silk thread. Then it is treated with the medicines and catgut as mentioned until it heals.
And if the cut is across a fold or suture, it should be made with a simple cut without involving the eyelashes, as previously mentioned. Then, the two lips should be separated with catgut as we have mentioned.
And in saying this about the treatment of cuts whether from above or below, one should carry out the work according to what appears suitable from the condition of the cut. For it may differ greatly in appearance, and the skilled craftsman will devise a solution in any way that is possible for him.
Until it returns to its natural shape or approaches it. The same disease will guide you as to what is suitable for it in most cases regarding the work and tool.
Fifteenth Chapter.
On the Adhesion of the Eyelid to the Mucous Membrane or Cornea.
This adhesion may cause many people to believe that the upper eyelid fuses with the white of the eye, thereby preventing it from moving easily and hindering its natural actions. It should be entered under the lid with a wettened point.
It should be raised above or stretched with forceps, then the adhesion is cut with a delicate clamp that is not as sharp as other clamps but is slightly blunt to avoid troubling the patient. When you cut, it should be like peeling off that adhesion.
Wait until the eyelid returns to its natural position and all the adhesion has healed, then apply saline water to the eye with it or instill from the zingerine syringe a solution diluted in water. Then separate the eyelid from the eye with a cotton wick.
Place a dampened cloth soaked in egg white above the eye, and after the third day use the swabs until healed.
Sixteenth Chapter.
On Cutting the Cornea and Periosteum.
The cornea is of two kinds: either it is nervous, resembling a thin and delicate membrane, or it is non-nervous, resembling a white, dry substance that becomes brittle when touched by iron or cut with forceps.
And forceps are not used in it. Both kinds begin from the superior meatus and proceed gradually until they cover the naris, preventing light and eye movement. The procedure for cutting them is that the patient places their head on your stone.
Then he opens his eyes and raises the eyelid with your hand. Then you pick up the splinter with a small curved forceps and extend it upwards. Then you take a needle and insert a hair from a horse's or cow's mane or a strong thread into it, bend the end of the needle slightly, and prick it in the middle of the splinter.
And you pass it with the needle, tying the splinter to a thread. You extend it upwards and strip the side of the splinter next to the orbit as if you were spreading it with the hair until it reaches its end. Then you cut the remaining part at the base of the wound with a delicate forceps or a small scissors, leaving the natural flesh of the wound intact.
To avoid the discharge of continuous tears, you extend the splinter with the forceps alone or with the thread as mentioned. Then you strip the smooth forceps over the tip, which is shown in this image.
And you take care to ensure that the forceps do not touch the corneal conjunctiva, as this might cause a tear and lead to an injury of the orbit. After the cutting, you place something from powdered salt or from zingerbark in the eye, and leave it until the next day. Then you treat it as necessary until it heals.
If the splinter is not nerve-bearing and you cannot insert a needle into it or secure it with forceps, this type of splinter is often treated with medicines, which will heal as I described in the classification. If you wish to cut it out, open the eye of the patient.
And take a delicate smooth forceps with a weak edge as shown in this image. Jerk the thumbnail from above gently, if you see that it is loose and crumbling, apply pressure from the side of your hand in the eye with a guava leaf or a red leaf or salt powder, and tighten the eye for another day.
Then, resume the work on it until they all go away, unless a hot swelling appears in the eye. In that case, leave it and treat the hot swelling until it heals, then resume the work on it with the jerk until it heals. As for the raw flesh of the excision, let it heal on its own.
If the raw flesh pains the eye severely, remove some of it with forceps and do not cut too much to avoid causing a discharge of tears. Then instill into the eyes a red leaf or guava leaf infusion until it heals.
Seventeenth Section.
On Cutting the Vascular Tissue and What Grows Excessively in the Eye.
In some people's eyes, raw red flesh may grow excessively, covering or nearly covering the eyelid, or even flowing onto the cheeks. It may cause the eyelids to turn outward and resemble the vascular tissue of the palm.
The procedure for this is to place the patient's head on your lap, then open their eyes and use appropriate forceps to remove all of that red raw flesh.
Or hold the patient's eye with forceps or a probe, then cut the red flesh piece by piece until it is all removed and ensure that you do not injure the eye during the procedure. Your cuts should either be made with the scissors we described for cutting thumbnails or with a small pair of scissors. As it is taken to capture the methods by which their appearance comes in the chapter following this chapter.
If the cutting is complete and all the vizard has gone, fill the eye with fine salt or drop in some red hellebore and the like of eating medicines and place a cloth soaked in egg white outside the eye to ensure the hot swelling.
If there remains some vizard and the blood overcomes you, and you fear the hot swelling, leave the eye alone and treat it with what calms the swelling. Then return to its treatment until it heals. Thus, do likewise with the excess flesh that appears in the eye of this kind.
Except that you should avoid treating every weak eye by nature or by condition with the use of iron. Do not enter your hand in any of these works until you see that that organ is capable of that work.
The Eighteenth Chapter.
On Capturing the Methods from the Eye.
The methods are red veins that weave over the eye, obstructing vision with their presence and weakening the eye with the passage of time. You should first look and see if the eye in which the methods are present is strong and free from any other illness besides the methods.
Then the capturing is that you order the patient to place his head on your lap. Then hang those veins with one clamp or two clamps according to your skill, and the clamps should be gently bent in this manner:.
Or two joined forceps in one body as shown.
Then take those veins gently with a fine scissors and wipe the blood now and then until you see the eye; for then those veins have dissolved and the blood has coagulated, and protect the eye so that you do not injure it with the tips of the scissors and let your work be half the day facing the sun.
And be diligent in your work lest you cut anything other than those veins. When you are finished, prick the green or red vein in the eye with sharpness so that it consumes whatever remains of the blood vessels. If you cannot gather all of it in that hour, apply a poultice to the eye to soothe the pain.
And leave it for days until the pain subsides, and ensure that the hot swelling has gone down. Then resume the work on this eye in the same manner until the pain is completely alleviated. This is the method of the scissors to relieve the pain.
And leave it [and let the head of the scissors remain in the pupil of the eye, and let the other end drain the tears while ensuring a clear view of the front and back of the eye]. The main principle in the work is to open the eye with fixed forceps or a triangular instrument that holds it by a student.
Stare at it, and let the head of the scissors remain in the pupil of the eye, and let the other end drain the tears while ensuring a clear view of the front and back of the eye. If you start, you may begin by picking from the upper part of the eye or the lower part; however, it is better to drain two forceps on the upper side, with one at the back of the orbit and the other at the front.
Hold it between the middle finger and the thumb, then suspend cannulas from opposite sides. Next, hold it between the index finger and the ring finger and gently lift your hand until you see all the passages have risen. Cut from the smaller western side if you wish with scissors, or use a delicate forceps if preferred.
And irrigate the passages with a needle and thoroughly cleanse all the passages until they rise to the knuckle. Do not cut the suction, for the tears and blood will impede you.
Then cut with the scissors what exceeds the crown from above and below until nothing remains nascent except in the cornu. If possible, raise it from the cornu and excise it with the needle; this is better. It may occur in some people.
And when you have cut it, it will burn its pharynx for several days, ease its pain, and reduce the hot swelling. Then proceed to work on it again.
Nineteenth Chapter.
On Reverting the Flap to the Nose.
The doctors call the flap Nasur. If it is treated by cauterization or with a sharp, burning medicine as described previously and does not heal, the only remedy is to incise the swelling when it is ripe and extract all the moisture or pus that is within it.
Until the bone is revealed. If the bone is revealed and you see corruption or blackness in it, strip it with an instrument of this kind:
And it is called the rough head, made from Indian iron. Its head is round like a zir and engraved with a delicate pattern like that of a pincers or a lancet. Place it on the place of corruption in the bone, then turn it between your fingers while slightly tightening your hand until you know that that corruption has been removed.
And do that several times, then apply the dried contracting medicines to the area. If the site contracts and flesh grows therein, and the period ends without recurrence for forty days with no complications occurring.
Know that he has recovered, unless there is no remedy but to return the nasal forceps to the nostril as follows: you must uncover the bone again with iron or with sharp medicine. When the bone is exposed, take a spreader in this manner:
Let the tip of the probe be triangular, and its sides conical, curved towards the tip as you see. Then place it on the bone itself. Do this near the nasal septum, keeping your hand a little away from the eye. Then turn the bone with the spreader until it passes and the patient feels it.
Let him find the air escaping from it if he places his hand on his nose. Then, apply the dried contracting medicines to the area as I have taught you. If flesh grows and the place stiffens, the material that used to flow out will return to the nose, making this easier for the patient, God willing.
Chapter Twenty.
In Returning the Nasal Septum.
If the nose is perforated completely and no harm or deficiency occurs in vision, it should be made easy for the patient. Then divide it in the qiyyafah, and place a hemostat in the qiyyafah without any force. Suction gently.
Then place on the eye a splint made from acacia, cotton, and silk. Then pull the eye from above onto the bandage with many ligatures. The method of the ligatures is to take soft strips in great quantity and fold each strip into four folds, making many of them.
Then place one over the other according to what the eye requires. Then tie them tightly with a strong bandage and re-aspirate without necessity. Then remove the suction device and leave the eye tied for a day and a night.
If the bandage relaxes during that time, it should be tightened properly. Then remove the bandage after a day and a night as we said. If you see that the eye has returned, otherwise, reapply the dressing, supports, tightening, and suction device until it returns.
The Twenty-First Chapter.
On Cutting the Umbilical Cord.
If a fistula appears in the umbilical tissue, then it ulcerates and protrudes outside the eyelid, taking on the appearance of a grape, disfiguring the person's appearance. If you intend to cut it, the procedure should be as described.
It is to insert a needle from the bottom into the base of the fistula towards the top, then insert another needle with a double thread on one side and pass it through. Leave the first needle in place as it is.
Then cut at the bend where the double thread is located, tie a part of the fistula around the needle with the thread, and tighten it properly. Remove the needle and place moistened cotton wool soaked in egg white over the eye. Leave it until the threads fall off with the fistula, then treat the eye to strengthen it.
Until the wound heals, the fistula should be tightened from all sides with a circle of a strong bandage until the eye swells properly. Then use a fine forceps that reaches deep into the eye to release the egg white moisture and lower the eye, causing it to shrink in place. Tighten it until it heals.
The Twenty-Second Chapter.
In the Treatment of Constriction.
This disease called kmanah is nothing but a period that gathers in the eye resembling water without it, and the way to deal with it is to place the patient on a chair upright, then take his head by both hands.
And move it until you see the constriction change to be at the bottom with your eye, then fix it and do not let it go until light comes forth, and the patient sees the things as he used to see them. If it does not descend to the bottom, we know that it is water. If it does not come down as described, proceed accordingly.
And if not, place the patient between your legs. Then take a thin tweezers and make a small incision above the corneal conjunctiva where the adherent is in contact with the corneal conjunctiva in the cornea until you remove the substance.
And if it comes out, pour warm water into the eye that has mixed with honey or boiled colocynth and honey. Then treat it with other treatments until it heals.
The Twenty-Third Chapter.
We have mentioned the types of water in the classification and which is suitable for injection as explained and clarified. Take it from there with certainty. Then, you should place the patient between your legs, seated facing the light near the sun.
And join his healthy eye and tighten it well, then raise his eyelid with your left hand if the eye with the water is the left eye or with your right hand if the right eye.
Then place the tip of the probe near the root of the eyelid with a moistened end in the same whitish part of the eye on the side of the lesser wound. Then push the probe forcefully and turn it with your hand until it enters the white part of the eye, and you feel that the probe has reached something empty.
And it should be such that the depth to which the probe goes is equal to the distance from the child to the back of the black, which is the eyelid. If brass is seen in the same field as the observer, it appears like seeing the eye due to the clarity of the corneal membrane, then the probe should go upwards to the place where the water is.
Then press it downwards several times. If the water comes out from its socket, then the patient will see what his sight was opened to in its socket and the probe is still in his eye. Then rest for a while. If the water rises, bring it down again without removing the probe.
Then, if it settles and does not rise, remove the probe gently while flexing your hand slightly. Next, dissolve a little of purified sublimed salt in water and wash the eye from within. Then, place outside the eye either gauze or wet cotton wool.
Anoint it with rose oil and egg white, and join it with his healthy eye. As for us and the people of our time, we place on it the powdered camphor with egg white, for if the probe does not enter the eye due to its hardness, since some people have very hard eyes.

He leaves the house gradually and deals with its causes, and know that the lancet cannot do without the student's observation many times then he advances to practice, and I have heard from some of the Iraqis that he said they make in Iraq a potent lancet that absorbs water.
I have not seen anyone in our country make this, nor have I read about it in the books of the early authors. It may be a recent development, and these are images of different types of lancets to familiarize oneself with them due to their unfamiliarity.
It is made of special brass and its tip is shaped in this manner, triangular and sharp.
Chapter Twenty-Four.
In the Treatment of Putrid Meat in the Nose.
It may grow in the nose different kinds of flesh, some resembling scorpions with many legs, and others being cancerous, hardened like the color of a sore. Some may be soft flesh not like the color of a sore.
For any of this flesh that is soft and not malignant or cancerous, it should be placed facing the sun with a healthy side towards you. Open his nostril and insert the probe into the flesh, then draw it out. Cut what you have reached from it with a fine sharp forceps from one side.
Until you know that all the flesh has gone. If there is something remaining that you cannot cut, strip it off with one of the gentle instruments gently, until nothing remains. If blood prevails or a hot swelling appears.
For it should be treated as it ought to be or if it is from malignant tumors, act quickly and cauterize until the blood ceases and all the flesh disappears. Then place in the nose after cutting, either chalk and water or a drink. If the nose opens and the moisture is expelled to the throat.
Know that it is cured, but if the moisture does not penetrate as it ought, know that there is flesh growing inside at the top of the loose bones where the instrument did not reach with the cut. Then it should be necessary for you to take a thread of flax that has some thickness.
And tie it in many knots, making the space between each knot about an inch or less. The patient should then insert the end of the single thread into his nose with a wisp of cloth or whatever he can manage, after shaping it like a pellet, and draw the smell towards him until it reaches the polyp.
And it comes out at his throat. Often, boys in the scribes' trade do this action, and it is easy for whoever wishes to perform it. Then gather the two ends of the thread, one that came out at the mouth and the other that remained in the nose.
Then use the knots on the thread to cauterize the flesh, doing so until you know that the flesh has been cut by the threads. Then remove the thread and leave a wick in the nose after wiping away the blood. Soak it in the Egyptian ointment for three days or more.
Until the ointment consumes all that remains of the flesh. Then leave a lead pipe in the nose for several days until it heals. If it needs further treatment, use drying methods as required.
This is a picture of the snuffing instrument used for applying powders and medicines in the nose:.
He places a small candelabrum-like object made of silver or copper with an open spout and similarly shaped channel.
And if you prefer, the bottle can be sealed like a reed, and the spout of the snuffing instrument flat.
It has a handle at its end as you can see, which is held when heating the fat or any other liquid substances.
The Fifth and Twenty-Fifth.
On Boils in the Tip of the Nose.
Boils often appear at the tip of the nose and grow larger, increasing in size with time until they disfigure his appearance.
And therefore, it should be cut at the first sign of appearance and all of it thoroughly excised. Then apply either cauterization or a burning medication that serves the purpose of cauterization. If it is missed and grows larger, examine it; if it has become hardened and solid like a bluish color with little sensation,
Do not use iron on it, as it is a malignant tumor. Often, I have seen that cutting this tumor results in a large ulcerous lesion for the patient. If the tumor is soft and fleshy without a bluish color and I have observed that it can be cut entirely. Empty the boil and cut it without hesitation or fear, and treat the area with substances that dry and constrict until it heals.
The Twenty-Sixth Chapter.
In Sewing the Nose and Ear and Lip. If separation of its connection occurs due to a wound or the like, know that whatever treatment is effective for it is rare, except in some people.
When anything of this kind presents itself, see if the wound is fresh with blood. If so,缝合其两端，然后治疗直至痊愈。如果分离已经使得其两端各自独立，每端都已愈合，则应剥离每个端口的表皮一层直到出血。请注意，保持翻译的准确性是关键，避免添加任何额外内容。
Then sew the lips together, tighten them, and sprinkle them with a powder mixture of saffron and frankincense. Place a plaster of olive ointment or some other adhesive ointment over the dressing. Leave it tightened for two or three days, then release it.
And change the medicine, leaving it until the sutures fall off by themselves. Then treat it with ointment until it heals. The method of sewing is to gather the separated parts either with needles as we described in sewing the abdomen, or with thread as you were taught earlier.
The Twenty-Seventh Chapter.
On Removing Beads That Appear in the Lips.
Many people may find small, hard tumors within their lips, some resembling chestnuts and others varying in size. You should turn the lip inside out and incise each tumor, then clamp it with forceps.
It is cut from every side, then after the cut, it is filled with powdered honey until the blood stops. It is gargled with vinegar, salt, and the wounds are treated with what causes contraction until the injuries heal.
The Twenty-Eighth Chapter.
On Cutting the Excess Flesh in the Gum.
Often, excess flesh grows on the gum, which the ancients called abscess. It should be clamped with forceps or grasped with tweezers and cut at its base. Allow the wound to bleed or heal for a while, then apply powdered honey to the area.
Or with one of the contracting desiccants. If that flesh returns after treatment, it often does so again; cut it off a second time and cauterize it, for it will not return after cauterization.
The Twenty-Ninth Chapter.
On Tooth Extraction with Iron.
Sometimes, on the surfaces of the teeth from inside and outside, between the gums, there may collect rough, ugly scales that darken, turn yellow, or green, to such an extent that this decay affects the gums and disfigures the teeth.
It should be that the patient sits before you with his head on your lap. Extract the tooth and the part of the gum that has the scales and something resembling sand until nothing remains. Do the same for the blackness, greenness, yellowness, and other such things until you cleanse the area.
If what is in the first sifting has gone, otherwise re-sift it another day and the second day and the third day until you reach the goal of what you want, and know that the tooth requires different sieves with various shapes according to what is suitable for your work.
The sieve that sieves the tooth from inside is different from the one that sieves from outside, and the one that sieves between the teeth in another shape. These are several sieve shapes you should have prepared for all cases.
Chapter Thirty.
For extracting the teeth.
You should treat the tooth for its pain with every means and delay extracting it if possible, for there is no replacement for a tooth once extracted, as it is a noble entity. Therefore, extract it only when absolutely necessary.
If the painful tooth is determined to be extracted, you should verify carefully until you confirm the condition of the tooth's pain. For often, the pain deceives and one may think it is in the healthy tooth and extract it, only for the pain not to go away until the diseased tooth is extracted. We have seen this many times with the work of the tooth drawers.
If you confirm that the pain is indeed in the tooth itself, then you should cut around the tooth with a forceps to some degree until the gum is loosened from all sides. Then move it with your fingers or with light clamps gradually, gradually, until it becomes loose.
Then firmly grasp the two large clamps and hold the painful tooth between your knees, securing it so that it cannot move. Next, extract the tooth straight to avoid breaking it. If it does not come out, use one of those instruments and gently insert it from all sides under the tooth with care, and shake it as you did before.
And if the tooth is perforated or loose, it should be filled with a piece of cloth and tightly sealed with a thin, pliable thread so that it does not tear while you are tightening it with the forceps. You should also probe around the gum with a探查器 from all sides.
And spare no effort to prevent it from breaking, for some of it may remain, causing a soreness worse than its original pain. Avoid doing what the unskilled barbers do in their bridges, rushing to extract them without using what we have described.
For often they cause great harm to people, the worst of which is that the tooth may break and some or all of its roots remain. And if it is necessary to extract part of the jawbone as we have often witnessed, then he should gargle after extracting it with a drink or a mixture of herbs and salt. If there is bleeding from the area, it often occurs; in such a case, crush some zağ (a type of medicinal substance) and apply it to the area.
And if the zağ does not help, use a gentle forceps that is long-tipped and short-handed. It should be thick to prevent it from bending when clamped on the tooth. This is the image of the large forceps.
It should be as you see, thick-cuffed so that it does not bend when clamped on the tooth. It should have long-tipped ends. Make it from Indian iron or from well-forged steel with pointed ends that fit into each other tightly and securely.
And the limbs are made like the pitcher, also being strong in control.
Chapter Thirty-First.
On the Extraction of Root Canals and the Removal of Broken Skull Bones.
If the root breaks during tooth extraction, it should be covered with cotton soaked in oil for one or two days until the area relaxes, then the forceps or files can be inserted. That resembles its limbs the beak of the bird called blerage. This is an illustration of the forceps:.
It should be made like a pitcher from the inside or like a scoop. If you are unable to remove it with these forceps, you should dig around the root and uncover all the flesh with dissecting forceps, then insert an instrument resembling a small clamp, as shown in this illustration:.
It should be short at the end and slightly thick to prevent it from breaking. If the root comes out with this, otherwise use these other instruments shown in this illustration; the first one is triangular at the end with some thickness:.
Illustration of another gentle triangular instrument:.
And we may also use this forceps with two branches, as shown in this illustration:.
And we may also use this forceps that resembles the large tongs, as shown in this illustration:.
Triangle-shaped at the end and bent, with some thickness to prevent it from breaking, and not scoop-like. Know that the instruments for teeth are numerous, and so too are other instruments; they are almost countless. The skilled craftsman can invent new instruments based on what his work and diseases themselves suggest.
Because some diseases do not have instruments mentioned by the ancients for their various kinds, if a bone of the jaw or any bone of the mouth is broken or infected, examine it in its place with one of these instruments and clamps mentioned for extracting roots.
And we rely on this illustration:
It should have a small piece of hard material to hold the bone so that it does not slip until the bone is extracted, and we reinforce the area with appropriate medicines. If the bone itself is slightly infected, we should remove its infection and blackness until it is cleansed, then treat it until it heals.
The Thirty-Second Section.
On the Extraction of Teeth Growing Over Another.
If a tooth has grown in an abnormal position, it spoils the appearance. This is especially true for women and slaves. You should examine it; if the tooth has grown behind another tooth, it should be extracted.
And if it cannot be extracted or pushed back, remove it. If it is attached to another tooth, extract it with this instrument as shown in the illustration.
And it resembles a small bird's beak. Let it be made of sharp Indian iron, and cut it out over many days due to the hardness of the tooth, so as not to affect other teeth. If it is firmly grown due to its coldness, cool it with an Indian refrigerant. This is its illustration.
It should be entirely made of Indian metal, with a very thin engraving, similar to the needle used for refrigeration. Cool the tooth gradually over many days gently so as not to loosen the tooth and cause it to fall out. Then polish it later and scrape it with some files.
And if a tooth has broken part of it, and it pains the tongue when speaking, it should also be cooled until the roughness of that break goes away and it becomes smooth, fitting and will not pain the tongue nor impair speech.
The Thirty-Third Chapter.
On Ligating Mobile Teeth with Silver Thread or Gold Thread.
If the ancient teeth wobble or move due to a blow or fall, and the patient is unable to bite on anything to prevent them from falling out, and after treating them with contracting medicines, the treatment was ineffective.
The solution is to tie a thread of gold or silver. Gold is better because silver rusts and spoils after days, while gold remains unchanged forever. The thread should be medium in its softness and hardness, suitable for the space between the teeth.
A diagram of the ligation shows: Take the thread and insert one bend between the correct teeth. Then weave the ends of the thread between the mobile tooth or teeth until the weaving reaches the correct tooth on the other side.
Then weave back to the side where you started. Pull gently and wisely so that the mobile tooth does not move at all. Tighten the thread at the roots of the teeth to prevent it from slipping. Cut the excess ends of the thread with scissors, tie them together, and hide them between the correct tooth and the mobile tooth.
To avoid hurting the tongue, leave it tightened as long as needed. If it loosens or breaks, tighten it with another thread so that it can be used for a lifetime. This is a diagram of the teeth and the method of ligation in two correct teeth and two mobile teeth, as you can see.
One or both teeth may fall out and return to their place, interlock as we described, and remain. This is done by someone who prepares a companion path, and one may hollow out a bone from the cow's bones to shape it like a tooth and place it in the position where the tooth has fallen. It is pulled as we said and remains, and he finds pleasure in it.
The Forty-Third Chapter.
In cutting the ligament that is found beneath the tongue and prevents speech.
This ligament that is found beneath the tongue may either be natural, something one is born with, or may be accidental, resulting from a wound that healed.
The procedure is to open the patient's mouth and tilt his head on your lap. Raise the tongue, then cut that accessory nerve ligament until the tongue is released from its restraint. If there is some stiffness and complexity, and this is due to a healed wound, insert a probe and cut the ligament wide until it is removed and the knot resolves.
Be careful that the cut does not go deep into the flesh, for it may sever a blood vessel there, causing bleeding. Then, rinse the area after the cut with rose water or vinegar and cold water. Place a cotton wick under the tongue, which the patient should hold each night.
Lest it粘连再次，如果发生出血，可在该处敷上一层湿的粉末，若出血过多，则用一副适合此用途的眼镜熨斗固定位置。 Then treat it with all other treatments until it is cured.

A swelling resembling a small frog may occur under the tongue and prevent it from performing its natural functions. It may even become hard and fill the mouth. The treatment is to open the patient's mouth towards the sunlight and examine the swelling.
If you see it appearing blueish or black and hard, with no sensation in the patient, do not touch it, as it is a cancer. If it leans towards being white with moisture, lance it with a sharp probe, cut it open with a fine scissors, and extract it from all sides.
If the bleeding persists while you are working, apply a poultice of powder until the bleeding stops. Then return to your work until you remove it completely, and gargle with vinegar and salt.
Then treat it with all other appropriate treatments until it is cured.
The Thirty-Sixth Chapter.
On the Treatment of Swellings of the Tonsils.
And whatever swells in the throat from other swellings may present glands inside the throat that resemble those that appear outside and are called tonsils. If these are treated as mentioned in the previous section and do not cure, then further treatment is required.
If you see that the swelling is hard, blueish in color, and has little sensation, do not treat it with iron. If it is red in color and its origin is thick, also do not treat it with iron to avoid bleeding. Instead, leave it alone until it matures; either it will atrophy or it will rupture on its own.
And if it is white, round, and of a delicate nature, this is what should be cut. The work therein that you should do is to look before the work if its hot swelling has become completely still or diminished somewhat.
And then seat the patient with his back to the sun and his head on your lap and open his mouth and take a lancet between your hands and press his tongue down with this instrument, its image is as follows:.
You make it from silver or copper, thin like a knife. When you press it on the tongue and see the swelling and your sight falls upon it, take forceps and insert it into the gland and draw it out as much as possible without drawing any of the veins with it.
Then you cut it with an instrument like this, its image resembles scissors but both ends are bent, each one hooked into the other, extremely sharp. You make it from Indian iron or Damascus steel:.
If this instrument is not at hand, then cut it with forceps like this:.
Sharp on one side and not sharp on the other. After cutting one gland, cut the other in the same manner. Then, after cutting, irrigate the patient with cold water or with vinegar and water.
If he experiences bleeding, irrigate with water in which the peel of the carob or the leaves of the acacia or similar astringent substances have been boiled until the bleeding stops. Then treat him until he recovers. And if tumors appear elsewhere in the throat other than the glands, cut them as you have described for cutting the glands.
And I treated a woman with a tumor that had grown inside her throat, striking the larynx slightly in its sensitivity, nearly blocking the throat. The woman was breathing through a narrow passage and it had prevented her from eating and drinking water.
And she would have died if she had survived for one or two days more. The tumor had grown to the extent that two branches emerged through holes in her nostrils. I acted quickly, inserting a needle into one of them, then pulled it out and with it came a suitable piece.
Then I cut it where I encountered it through the nostril hole. I did the same for what emerged from the other nostril hole. Then I opened her mouth, pressed her tongue, and inserted the needle into the tumor itself. I cut a part of it, and all that came out was a little blood.
Then the woman's throat was cleared, and she began to drink water at that time. She also started eating again. We continued cutting from that tumor repeatedly for a long time, and the tumor would leave a new growth in place of what we cut, until this lasted for us both for a long period.
I treated and incised the tumor inside the throat, hoping it would stop growing. Then I left that area without knowing what Allah had done to it after me.
The Seventh and Thirty-Third Chapter.
In Cutting the Oesophageal Tumor.
Which is called Unbah if a flow descends to the oesophagus and swells, becoming white and rectangular; it is then called 'Ammud. If it is thick at the bottom and round, it is called Unbah. If treated with what we have mentioned in the division and the treatment proves ineffective.
I saw the hot tumor had subsided and it was thin, so it should be cut out. It was not joined together in a round manner and did not have length, being either mottled or black or without sensation, so it should be avoided cutting it out.
If there is a danger to the patient, when you see it in the condition described by its whiteness and length, you should place the patient under the solar plexus and press his tongue with the instrument described earlier. Then you should insert the needle into the vein.
Pull it downward and cut it with one of the two instruments I mentioned for cutting the parotid glands. It should be cut only beyond the natural part without any excess, for if you cut more than necessary, you will harm the voice and speech.
After the cutting, use what we described for cutting the parotid glands and treat it until it heals. If the patient is unwilling to be cut, you should apply the trick on his glands without fear or caution. The reason for applying the cautery in this case is with a sharp remedy, which involves placing the patient's head on your lap.
Then press his tongue with the instrument we mentioned. Next, take the sharp water described in the section on cautery and mix it with unextinguished ginster (a type of plant). Make it neither too thick nor too thin, and apply it to this cavity using the instrument. This is its shape:
Its tip, where you apply the medicine, should have a cavity like that of a spoon for stirring liquids. Place the instrument containing the medicine on his glands, and have the patient lie on his side so that saliva flows out from inside his throat; this prevents anything from dripping down into his throat and harming him.
Then hold the snake with your hand and squeeze it on the noose for half an hour until you see that it has turned black and the bite of the medicine has calmed. If you wish, take a cotton cloth and wrap it around the tip of the rod, and wet the cotton in the medicine.
You insert the rod with the cotton into a tube from above until the cotton adheres to the noose. Do this repeatedly until you reach what you want in terms of drying the vine. Then let it go, for it will wither and fall off after three or four days. If you need to reapply the medicine, do so.
After the branding, wipe around the vine with a cotton soaked in oil and dry what is around it from the medicine. Then gargle with cold water and treat both externally with poultices and internally with gargles until it heals. This type of treatment is safer than cutting and less fearful.
The noose can also be treated with a method gentler than branding and cutting. It is treated with incense prepared in this manner: take fustic, sophora, chamaerops, senna, shawia, borage, chamomile, and similar herbs from plants. Gather them all or some of them in a pot and immerse them in vinegar.
It is boiled in a pot that has been lined with clay from the wisdom pit. There should be a hole in the center of the lid, through which the dried apparatus is placed. It can be made of silver or copper.
You insert the end containing the reed into the patient's mouth until the vapor ascends to the noose through the tube, causing the noose to constrict. Then repeat this process until it withers. Avoid performing this treatment in the initial stages of tumor occurrence.
Frequently, the swelling increases and only then should you do so when the hot swelling subsides. If this instrument is not available, take a cane and attach to its end a piece of eggshell so as not to burn the patient's mouth.
Because the eggshell prevents the heat of the steam from burning the mouth, this is good for treatment while ensuring safety.
The Thirty-Eighth Chapter.
On the Extraction of Spines and What May Become Embedded in the Throat.
Frequently, a bone or a fish spine or something similar may become embedded in the throat. You should remove what is visible and can be seen after pressing the tongue with the instrument when exposed to sunlight.
Let it be clear to you what is in the throat and what does not appear and is hidden in the throat. You should induce vomiting in the patient before his food dissolves in his stomach, for the embedded object may come out through vomiting or the patient might swallow a piece of lettuce or the root of a onion.
Or he might swallow a piece of hard bread. Alternatively, you should take a piece of sponge that is soft and flexible, tie it in a thread, and have him swallow it. When it reaches the location of the spine, pull the thread quickly. You should do this several times.
For frequently, the spine or bone sticks there and can be removed. If it does not come out as mentioned, use an instrument made of lead shaped as follows:.
It should be thicker than the probe slightly, and at its end, there is a hook that the patient inserts into his throat gently while raising his head above. He should be careful not to touch his trachea to avoid causing coughing. The doctor can then push the bone or spine out with it, or insert it by hand.
And introducing the probe to it is better for his knowledge of the location of the attached thing, pushing it downward or pulling his hand with the instrument upward; all of this according to what he is prepared until it is removed.
The Thirty-Ninth Chapter.
On the Extraction of Attached Foreign Bodies in the Throat.
If the attached foreign body is treated with the remedies as mentioned in the classification and does not succeed, then examine it next by placing the probe described to you at the base of the throat after compressing his tongue with the instrument.
If your sight falls upon the attached foreign body, grasp it with a small forceps or a gentle and firm tweezers. If you are not able to do so, then take a hollow tube and introduce it into the throat near the attached foreign body. Then, insert a heated iron rod into the hollow tube.
You do this several times. The patient should abstain from water all day. Then, give him a spoon full of cold water and open his mouth over it, rinsing with the water without swallowing even a drop. From time to time, move the water around with your hand.
If the attached foreign body falls out when it feels the water, then it should be removed as described. If it does not come out, sprinkle the throat with urine and sprinkle the area around it with a burner using the instrument described for burning incense. Do this several times; it will fall out.
And the method for burning incense is to take a quantity of charcoal heated by fire and cover it with a vessel having a hole in its center. Place the tip of the instrument in that hole, then sprinkle the incense. The patient should place his mouth over the tip of the tube and close it so that the incense does not come out until he knows that the incense has reached his throat.
If the clot falls into place, then it has fallen. But if it does not fall, incense is applied again, and the patient endures thirst, eats salt and garlic, and does not drink water; thus, this must be done to bring it out by these means. And here is an image of an instrument used to extract a clot from the throat when its presence is observed.
And it resembles the calabash as you see, except that it has this hook which enters the throat, and its ends resemble the beak of a bird. There is roughness in the part where the hook attaches; if it touches anything, it does not let go.
And another instrument for manipulating the tongue, which is a wide ring of iron large enough to cover the mouth over the tongue. It is placed inside the mouth lying on one side, so that the mouth remains open against the patient's will, and he cannot remove it at all until it is removed.
The shape of the instrument that opens the mouth in this manner.
Chapter Forty.
It deals with the speech on enlarging tumors and incising them.
Tumors are of many kinds, varied according to what will be mentioned one by one in this book. They differ in their enlargement and incision from two perspectives: one related to the type of tumor itself and what it contains in terms of moisture.
The second type is related to the locations where they occur in the body, for a tumor that occurs in the head is different from one that occurs in the groin. A tumor that occurs in a muscle area is different from one that occurs in a joint. Each has its own specific treatment.
And there are tumors that should not be treated until the pus is mature and complete, and among them are those that should be treated while they are not fully mature, such as tumors that are near the joints.
Because if a tumor occurs near a joint and takes time to mature, corrupting what surrounds it, it might damage the ligaments or nerves of that joint, becoming a cause for the delayed function of that limb or the tumor might be near a major organ.
Because if you delay its treatment until it matures, you will harm the major organ. Or it might be near the perineum, so you should treat it intentionally while it is not fully mature. Only then is it necessary to treat the tumor intentionally while it is not completely mature to avoid corruption of the surrounding tissue and prevent it from entering the perineum, becoming dangerous.
And it may reach a point where it will not heal, and you should know the time to treat tumors that have matured completely, which is when the pain in the tumor subsides, fever disappears, redness and swelling diminish, and the head of the tumor softens along with all other signs.
And you should apply the treatment at the lowest part of the tumor if possible, to make it easier for the pus to drain downward, or at the softest part and most vascular. Let the treatment be lengthwise along the body if the tumors are in areas like the arms and legs.
And apply the treatment in the areas of muscles, tendons, nerves, and blood vessels, and generally in all flat areas without curvature. As for curved areas, apply the treatment according to that area. If the tumor is in fleshy areas, it is best to avoid treating it.
Until his maturity is perfected as we said, if you delay it beyond that, the discharge will be prolonged and abundant, causing much pain and uncleanness. Sometimes it hardens his lips and darkens him. Some tumors may be delayed for the width of the body when necessary or according to what the organ requires.
It should be applied to small tumors with a single delay, and to large tumors with a wide delay or many incisions according to the size of the tumor. Some tumors may require that the skin be cauterized and cut if they have become like rags.
It has reached a point where some of them have died like what is observed in many putrid sores and cavities. Some require an incision with three corners, and some are cut in the shape of a leaf, like the tumor of the spleen.
Some require a round incision and a crescent-shaped incision, and similar incisions. If it does not have a head, like flat hairy tumors, a simple delay should be sufficient. If the tumor is large and has collected for a long time, it should not be delayed too much so that all the pus does not come out at once.
But remove some of it, then draw the tumor to another day, and remove some of the pus as well. You do this gradually until all is removed.
And especially if the patient is weak, or a pregnant woman, or a small child, or an old man. The animal spirit often dissolves all at once with the removal of pus, and the patient may die without you realizing it. Be very careful with this matter.
And after treating these tumors, the wound should be wiped and inspected. If the wound of the tumor is small or if there is only one simple incision, use a catgut or old cotton for suturing. If the tumor is large and has many incisions, this should be considered.
It should be inserted into every incision a wick until they reach each other. If the tumor has cut some of the skin or indented it, it should be packed with old cotton or dry catgut and tightened until the third day.
Then it should be removed and treated with ointments as necessary until it heals. If there is any bleeding while working, use cold water and vinegar after soaking a piece of cotton in them and apply it to the bleeding area several times.
If the bleeding continues, it should be treated with management and therapy, and the cautery methods we described in many places in this book. From the classification, if you are in winter and the area of the tumor has many nerves, you should warm the dressings with hot decoction and oil.
And place them on the area. If you are in summer and the areas are fatty, the dressings should be soaked in cold water and oil or in cold decoction and oil. By the third day, as we said, the tumor should be resolved and wiped.
And use what is similar for its treatment until it heals. This is what you need to know about treating tumors in general. As for the detailed method, I have described each tumor and the way to treat it, organized and summarized.
The Forty-first Chapter.
Regarding the incision of tumors that appear on the scalp.
Tumors that appear on the scalp are small and belong to the types of slags contained in follicles, which have conditions similar to chicken gizzards. Their types are many; some are fatty, and some contain moisture resembling mud.
And some contain moisture resembling broth and soup, and so on. And some are hardened and solid. All of them pose no danger in incising and removing them, provided that you do not encounter an artery when incising them.
The procedure for incising them is to probe it first with the instrument whose image will be provided after this, which is called the mesdus. You should determine what it contains. If it contains moisture, then incise it lengthwise with a simple cut as shown in this illustration.
Begin the incision from line ~b~ to line ~j~. Once the moisture has drained,剥离囊袋，完全切除，不要留下任何部分。因为如果留有少许，往往会复发。
Then, dip a cotton cloth in the pure ointment if it is available; otherwise, use salt water. Apply it to the wound and leave it until the next day. This will eat away what remains of the囊袋，然后重新敷上同样的药膏，或者如果需要，再敷一次或两次。
Until you are certain that there is nothing left of the囊袋。然后用药膏治疗伤口，直到痊愈。如果肿瘤含有脂肪样的物质，则应这样切开：
Sharra Maslaban wa qa assana nir shifay wa issalxuh min kulli jahi wayarm jhaddak figha ikhtiraq as safaqid yahwiha, inn aataresseesh sharhe faasna ma wasfa laku kadhallahu kaththab fa fasne fi alwarem in ka mittaghjeraman min ashqa.
And the treatment with it as described, and the incision for the hardened lump is easier because it has little blood and moisture. Some of these lumps in the head may have none at all in some people. This is because I incised a lump.
Head of an old woman; found the lump like a hard, rough white stone which no one could break by striking it. None of the other lumps that appeared in the head were like this, similar to those that occur on the heads of boys.
And at the opening of the ears, incise all of it with a simple incision and make its inner part from its lowest part to facilitate the flow of material downward. Then treat it with whatever treatment is appropriate for it.
The Fourth and Twenty-Second Chapter.
In the incision for cysts that occur in the neck. These lumps often appear in the neck, under the armpits, and in the groin. They may also occur throughout the body. What appears in the neck is usually one lump, but it can be many, and some are generated from others.
And each cyst has an internal sac as in the case of swellings and lumps in the head, as we have described. The types of these cysts are many; some are hardened, while others contain moisture, and some are malignant and do not respond to treatment.
I have not found any of them in good condition upon touch, and its appearance is close to the color of skin, moving in every direction, and it was neither adherent to the nerve of the neck nor to the windpipe nor to a vein, nor was it deep. It is necessary to incise it with a simple incision from top to bottom of the body in this manner from line ~ج~ to line ~ب~:.
And strip it from every side and spread the skin flaps with forceps or two forceps or many forceps if needed as we said regarding tumors of the head. Remove it little by little, making sure not to cut a vein or a nerve. Let the forceps not be too sharp.
Lest you increase the cut with your hand or distress the patient by cutting what you do not need to cut. If you cut a vein or a vessel and thereby hinder your work, apply some powdered cautery or some burnt ashes to stop the bleeding.
And tighten the wound and leave it until the soreness of the tumor subsides and the wound relaxes and shows signs of suppuration. Then, when the blood flow diminishes, return to your work until you finish, then use your third finger to probe if there is any remaining, and remove smaller suckers if necessary, cutting them out and cleansing the area.
If there is a large vein at the base of the sucker, it should not be cut from its root. Instead, it should be tied off with a tight double thread and left until it falls off on its own without causing harm. Then, stuff the wound with old cotton that has been soaked in Egyptian ointment, and treat it accordingly.
And if the pig's cheek is cut entirely, it should be gathered and sutured at once after you ascertain that there remains no fragment at all; but if you see that a fragment remains due to the size of the pig's cheek.
It should be aimed to cut at its root and base, and use suturing as well as what we have mentioned, and what was from the pigs containing wetness, soften it slightly where you see the place of its ripening, and make the softening below as we said.
Then use after the softening perforation with the Egyptian ointment or similar to eat what remains of the decay until you see that the wound has cleared, then treat it with ointments that decompose flesh until it heals.
The Fourth and Forty-Third Chapter.
On切分似乎有误，应该是：
The ancients described this incision in the throat, and I have not seen anyone in our country perform it. This is their manner of speaking. As for those with stridor, they should avoid making an incision in the throat as they do not benefit from it.
In order that all the veins and the lungs be healthy, and as for those who have a hot tumor in the mouth or throat or the tonsils if it is not due to the windpipe, it is incumbent to use incision of the throat to escape the corruption that results from choking.
If we wish to do this, we should make an incision in the throat under three rings of the windpipe circles or four small incisions across between two circles, with the size of the incision being like that in the trachea and not in the cartilage. This place is suitable for the incision.
Because it is devoid of flesh and far from the blood vessels, if the physician is cowardly, he should stretch the throat skin with forceps, then make an incision in the skin until he reaches the windpipe, and if he sees any blood vessels, he should avoid them.
Then he should make the incision in the trachea as described, and identify the incision in the windpipe by the phlegm that comes out of it along with hoarseness and loss of voice. He should leave the wound open for some time. If the time he was afraid of choking has passed, he should bring together the edges of the wound with the skin.
And the plan is without involving the cartilage. Then, use medications that promote flesh growth until it heals. Said the author of this book: The explanation of this sentence we have narrated is if they see the patient's throat is blocked by one of these tumors they mentioned.
The most noble thing for the patient near death and his concern that he may cease breathing They went to incise the throat so that the patient could breathe through some part of it and be saved from death But they were ordered to leave the wound open until the sickness passes, and its duration is three days or similar.
Then they were ordered to stitch the wound and treat it until he recovers. And as I have seen with my own eyes, a servant took a knife and cut part of the windpipe on its throat. I was called to treat it, and I found it slackening like that of a slaughtered animal. I examined the wound.
I found that the blood that came out of the wound was little, so I concluded that she had not cut an artery or a vein. The air was coming out through the wound, so I缝合了伤口并进行了治疗，直到痊愈。仆人没有出现其他症状，只是声音有些沙哑，并无加重。
And she recovered after days to her best condition. From this, we say that incising the throat poses no danger.
The Fourth and Forty-Second Chapter.
On Incising for the Swelling in the Throat That Appears from Outside and Is Called Pharyngeal Swellings.
This swelling called pharyngeal phlegm is a large lump in relation to the body's size. It is very common in women and is of two kinds.
Either it is natural and beyond treatment, or it is accidental and temporary. If it is natural, there is nothing to be done about it. If it is accidental, it has two types: one similar to fatty tumors, and the other similar to a swelling from the entanglement of a blood vessel, in which case incising poses a risk. No doubt should it be treated with iron at all unless it was small and you probed and examined it with forceps and found it to resemble fatty tissue and was not attached to any of the vessels; then cut it as you would cut such tissue. And extract it if it is in a sac; otherwise, examine all of it thoroughly, then treat the area with what is appropriate for treatment.
The Fifty-fourth Chapter.
On Cutting into Fatty Tissue.
Fatty tissue has many types, and I have mentioned all their kinds in the classification. It is necessary to explain here the difference between fatty tissue and excrescence, as this can be confusing. For an excrescence will have heat, fever, and terrifying pains until the inflammation subsides. The corruption completes its course, and then the fever and severity subside. Fatty tissue does not have any heat, fever, or pain; it is contained within a clear sac that is specific to it and resembles the color of the body. Its beginning is like a pea and becomes like a broad bean, varying in size.
It is of two kinds: either fatty or it contains moisture, and the colors of the moisture are many, as mentioned in the classification. Therefore, when you begin treating fatty tissue, you should first probe and examine it with the instrument called forceps, as its image will be shown in the chapter that follows this one.
Measure the size of the tumor, then remove the forceps and look at what comes out in its wake. If it exudes a watery moisture of any color, cut it with a slight incision as described in other tumors. If no moisture exudes from the forceps, know that it is fatty tissue.
Cut it with a hard incision as shown in this figure, as I instructed you, and suspend it with forceps. Remove the skin from all sides gently and preserve it in a袋中，如果可能，确保它与商品一同完好无损地取出。
If the bag ruptures during the work and you cannot extract it完好无损，通常这种情况会发生，那么将其分成一块块取出，确保不留任何部分。如果留有任何部分，无论多少，都会影响商品的状态。
If a little of it persists and the wound is severe when you are done with some sharp cauterizing tools, suture the wound to calm the hot swelling, and treat it with other remedies until it heals. If the商品较大，缝合其边缘，并用促进愈合的药物处理。
If a harmful or non-harmful perforating vein obstructs and causes bleeding, apply strong pressure to the area with powdered styptic粉未，并保持紧绷状态两天或三天，直至伤口腐烂和出血的炎症减轻，然后你再处理剩余的商品。
Chapter Sixty-Fourth.
In Images of Instruments.
Which act upon the incision and the depth thereof, are the forceps, and they are three kinds: some are large, some are medium, and some are small.
Image of Large Forceps:.
Image of Medium Forceps:.
Image of a small probe:
It is made of tempered iron with square edges to facilitate entry into tumors. These are images of probes and are called "brad" and there are three kinds: large, medium, and small. Image of a large probe:.
Image of a medium probe:.
Image of a small probe:.
It is suitable for examining tumors, wounds, cavities, and bones, as well as other internal structures. It should be made round, smooth, like a spoon, from Chinese copper, Spanish copper, or brass. The best material is Spanish copper.
It can also be made from black lead, and is suitable for probing cavities that have bends, as its flexibility allows it to conform to the bend. There are three types: some are long, some are medium-length, and some are short.
It should be made according to the depth of each cavity, and its thickness should match the size and narrowness of the cavity. Image of a large probe from black lead:.
Image of a medium probe from black lead:.
Image of a small probe from black lead:.
Images of the cannulas, and they are many kinds because some are simple, meaning those with a single scoop, and there are three types: large, medium, and small. Some are blind cannulas, and there are three types. Some have double scoops, and there are three types as well. Some are bent and have double scoops. It is of three kinds, and among them are the cannulas with three tubes. These are also of three kinds, and all these instruments need to be in their place, a simple large catheter image:. A simple catheter image: A simple small catheter image:.
A large blind cannula image:. A blind cannula image:.
A small blind cannula image:.
A large catheter image with two tubes:. A medium catheter image with two tubes:. A small catheter image with two tubes:.
A large cannula image with three tubes:.
A medium cannula image with three tubes:. A small cannula image with three tubes:.
And these are the forceps used to incise and excise tumors and diseased tissues. They are of three kinds, for some are large, some medium, and some small. A large forceps image:.
A medium forceps image:.
A small forceps image:.
Its teeth, with which it incises, are limited, while the other ends are unlimited. They were made this way so that they can be used to excise the diseased tissue when there is fear of cutting a vein or nerve, and to alleviate the patient's discomfort somewhat from the pain he feels when excising the tumor.
These are the images of the trumpets and they are three kinds, for some of them are large, and some are medium, and some are small. The image of a large trumpet:.
It is made from brass that has a lustrous finish and is shaped like a spoon with two layers in the single end. In its head, there is a hidden forceps blade resembling a bird's tongue that can be inserted inside or outside as desired, as you can see.
These are the images of the forceps that are placed between the fingers for relieving swellings, so that the patient does not feel them. They are three kinds, for some are large, some are medium, and some are small. The image of a large forceps:.
The image of the clamp used to stop bleeding, which is three kinds, for some are large, some are medium, and some are small. The image of the large clamp:.
It is made from brass or from copper that is slightly elongated as you can see, and it should be thin. These types of clamps should be large and small so that they can stop the blood flow quickly when needed and when no medicine is available.
But do not use it for cutting the blood in every part of the body; rather, use it only in meaty parts such as thigh muscle and calf muscle and arm muscle and chest muscle and abdominal muscle and similar wet meaty parts.
And you can make from it smaller machines resembling pistachio shells as shown in this figure.
It is used to cut the blood if it flows from a fistula or when cutting an artery or vein. And you can make a wheel as shown in this figure.
The Seventh and Forty-Third Chapter.
On Treating the Breast in Men.
Which resembles women's breasts may swell in some people when aroused until it resembles women's breasts, remaining warm and ugly. Therefore, if one dislikes this, it should be treated by making a breast incision in a crescent shape as shown.
From line ~b~ to line ~c~:. Then strip all the fat away, then fill the wound with the medicated poultice. Then suture the wound's lips together and treat it until it heals. If the breast has leaned downward and relaxed due to its bone as is common in women, handle it accordingly.
Then you should make two incisions on its upper sides, resembling a crescent shape, with each one connecting at their ends so that the larger line surrounds the smaller one as shown in this figure:. From line ~b~ to line ~c~, then strip the skin that is between the incisions and remove the fat. Use what we have mentioned regarding suturing and dressings, and whatever treatment is needed until it heals.
If the wound does not容纳所需切除的部分以防止疼痛或由于出血，则应将浸透药膏的棉花填入伤口，直至剩余的脂肪被吸收完毕，然后加以治疗直至痊愈。
The Fourth and Forty-First Chapter.
On Swelling in Tumors That Appear Under the Armpit.
These tumors that appear under the armpit are of the type of hard swine tumors contained in a cyst. And from them, some contain moisture. Whatever contains moisture should be incised in a lunar shape as shown.
From line ~b~ to line ~g~. If all the moisture in the tumor is drained, stuff it with old cotton and leave it until the next day, then remove the cotton.
And treat it with the appropriate ointment until it heals. If the tumor is of the type of swine knots, incise it as we have mentioned for incising swine tumors. Whether the wound continues to enlarge and exude pus, apply cauterization as we have described in what has been previously stated.
The Forty-Ninth Chapter.
On Incising the Tumor That Appears Due to the Artery or Vein, and Known as Angioma.
If the artery is injured and the skin above it heals, it often results in a tumor. Similarly, a vein may also appear swollen and tumorous.
The signs by which one knows whether the tumor and swelling are from a vein or an artery; if the tumor is from the artery, it is rectangular and rounded in depth of the body, and if you press on the tumor with your finger, you feel as though it has a pulse.
The tumor that is from the vein is round on the surface of the body, and the indentation in these tumors is dangerous, especially those in the elbow, armpit, neck, and many other places in the body. They are extremely large, so it should be avoided to treat them with iron.
And also those from the veins in the extremities or in the head should be avoided. For those that are due to swelling of the vessel, make an incision along the skin lengthwise, then open the incision with forceps, then strip the vein and clear it of the valves.
Until it becomes clear, then introduce a needle under it and puncture it to the other side, and tighten the vein with a doubled suture in two places as you have instructed for suturing the vessels in the cheeks. Then cut with forceps at the site between the ligaments until all the blood is let out.
The tumor then resolves, and you should use the treatment that generates pus until the ligaments fall off. Then treat it with the appropriate ointments until it heals.
If the tumor is from an indentation of the vein, you should hold as much of the tumor with your hand along with the skin. Then introduce a needle below the place where you held it with your hand and insert it with a doubled thread, and then withdraw it from the other side. Then tie the tumor tightly with thread as you were told in tying the bunch-grape on both sides with ends of the thread, if you fear that the threads may slip, insert another needle with another thread under the entire tumor at the crossing of the first needle.
Tighten your threads in four places, then incise the tumor in its middle. Once what is inside has come out, cut the excess skin and leave what was tied. Then place on it a dressing soaked in a mixture of wine and oil. Then use the treatment which involves stitching and ointments until it heals.
The Fifty-Third Chapter.
In the tumor that results from the torsion of the nerve.
Similarly, a tumor can occur in the nerve if it is struck or subjected to extreme fatigue or similar conditions. It is more common in the wrists and ankles.
In every location where the joints move, this is a sensitive tumor that resembles the color of the rest of the body. It is most often painless, but if pressed with force, the patient feels a numbness similar to that of paralysis. The tumor does not gather deeply within the body.
But it is beneath the skin and moves in every direction without going forward or backward. If it was located in the joints, there should be no need to apply iron, as it might cause harm for a time. If it was located in the head or on the forehead, this does not apply.
Incise the skin with forceps. If the tumor is small, grasp it with forceps and cut it off at the base. If it is large, clamp it with a forceps, extract it, then suture the wound and treat it until it heals.
The Fifty-First Chapter.
In cutting the kerions that appear in the abdomen.
It often occurs in some people in their abdomens and throughout their bodies kerions called fungal due to their resemblance to fungi. Their base is delicate and their head is hard, and they may turn into small ones or become greatly enlarged.
I have seen a man with two kerions in his abdomen that resembled fungi the most. They had no white, delicate base; their lips had turned and cracked, and moisture constantly flowed from them. I cut them both, and one weighed about eighteen ounces, while the other weighed about six ounces.
The procedure for cutting them is as follows: Examine the condition; if the affected area is moist and the color of the kerion is white, soft, and watery, cut it with a broad clamp. Have the tongs at hand and heat them in the fire, as often a lot of blood will flow out when they are cut.
If the blood overcomes you, clamp it with the tongs. If you see the affected area timid and afraid of being cut with iron, take a tight thread of lead and pull the kerion with it, as it is described here. Leave it for two days, then increase the tension on the lead. Continue tightening the lead until it is removed.
Whenever it affects the kerion until it breaks and falls off by itself without effort, if the kerion has a hard base, cutting it involves some fear and risk, especially those in the abdomen. However, it may be possible to cut half of it or part of it.
Then cauterize to prevent recurrence, then treat until the wound heals, and beware that you do not encounter a cicatrix which is pale in color, little in sensation, and unpleasing in appearance; for it is a cancerous tumor, and we will mention cancer after this.
The Fifty-Second Chapter.
In the Treatment of Hemorrhoids.
Hemorrhoids can result from many causes. Either from a rupture of the scrotum on the abdomen, causing fluid or intestine to protrude through it, or from blood issuing from a vein or artery as mentioned before, or from wind getting enclosed in it.
If it is due to a rupture of the scrotum and the protrusion of fluid, then the color of the tumor will be similar to that of the surrounding tissue, and it will be soft without pain and will appear in different positions. And if it is due to the protrusion of the intestine, then its position, as described before, will differ even more. If you press on it with your fingers, it will disappear and then return. It may also be accompanied by a rumbling sound and greatly increase in size upon entering a hot bath or severe exertion. If it is due to dampness, then it will be soft.
It does not disappear when you press on it with your hand, nor does it increase or decrease. If it is due to blood, then in addition to these signs, the tumor will appear dark black. If it is due to an infected flesh, the tumor will be pus-filled, hard, and fixed in one place.
If it is due to wind, its touch will be soft. The treatment in this case is that you should examine it; if hemorrhoids are due to blood from a vein or artery, or wind, you should avoid treating them, as there is danger and uncertainty, as I have informed you in the chapter where I mentioned tumors caused by veins and arteries.
If the discharge of the rectum is from the intestines or lithiasis, it should be ordered to hold himself and stand stretched out then mark around the entire rectum with ink. Then order him to lie between your two legs on his back. Then pry with a broad forceps around the rectum at the spot you marked with ink. Then draw the center of the swelling upwards with a large clamp. Then tie the place of the pry with a strong thread or use fine silk tied tightly.
Then make the thread knot tight. Then open the center of the tightened swelling above the clamp. Insert your third finger and demand for the intestine. If you find that the clamp has grasped it, release the knot and push the intestine back into the abdomen. If you find lithiasis, draw it out with a clamp.
Then cut it off. If a vein or artery obstructs you, pry it carefully and return to your work. Take two needles and put strong threads in them. Insert the needles into the incision you made around the swelling, securing them deeply. Then tighten the swelling at four points with the needles.
And if you choose, remove the needles and leave the area until the tightened flesh rots and falls off by itself, or cut it out if it becomes soft and rotten. Then treat it with ointments as necessary until it heals. If the discharge of the rectum is from an ulcerated flesh, proceed accordingly.
Or if it is from excess moisture, you should incise the swelling as we said, and remove the blood or moisture you find within. Then treat it with ointments that will heal the area.
The Fifty-Third Chapter.
In the Treatment of Cancer.
We have mentioned the classification of cancer and how to treat it with medicines, warning against treating it with iron lest it ulcerate. We have also mentioned the cancer generated in the womb and warned against its treatment.
And the early symptoms are that when cancer is in a place that can be completely removed, such as cancer in the breast or in the thigh and similar organs that can be extracted entirely, especially if it is newly started and small. Otherwise, if it has progressed and become large, it should not be approached.
For I have not been able to cure anyone of it, and before me no one had reached that level. The treatment when it is well-defined as we said is to proceed with the black fluid several times, then detach it if it is in the veins clearly full.
Then apply the remedy strongly, allowing it to work effectively. Next, insert catheters suitable for the cancer, then extract it from all sides along with the skin, thoroughly examining until nothing of its root remains. Allow the blood to flow freely without cutting it off quickly.
But squeeze the areas and let all the thick blood flow out by hand or with whatever means you have at your disposal. If during the procedure a great bleeding occurs from cutting a vein or artery, clamp the vessel until the bleeding stops, then treat it with other remedies until it is cured.
The Fifty-Fourth Chapter.
In the Treatment of Hydrocele.
We have been informed about the classification of hydrocele, how water assembly occurs in each type, and the signs of every kind and its treatment with medicines. Only the serous type is treated with iron; neither the bony type nor the muscular type at all.
If that is the case, it is a struggle. If you have treated this serous type of hydrocele with medicines and your treatment has not been effective, then examine whether the patient has exaggerated weakness or if he has another disease besides the hydrocele, such as one.
If it is cough or diarrhea and the like, then do not treat him with iron, for that would be dangerous. If you find the patient well-strengthed and does not have any other disease except hydrocele alone, and he is neither a child nor an old man, then the course of action is to examine the patient while standing before you. And a servant stands behind him, squeezing his abdomen with his hands and directing the water to the lower region near the groin. Then, take a spinal clamp in this manner:.
Limited on both sides, long and defined at the ends like a spinal clamp, but with a slight amount of flexible material to prevent it from touching the intestines during use. Then examine whether the hydrocele originated from the abdominal region.
It is necessary to separate by the incision from the navel three fingers' breadth downward, above the groin. If the hydrocele originated from liver disease, make your incision on the left side of the navel by three fingers' breadth. If it originated from spleen disease, make your incision on the right side by three fingers' breadth.
Also, the incision should not be made on the side where the patient intends to lie, lest fluids flow to that weak place, then perforate the skin with the instrument altogether and insert it into that incision while you raise your hand.
With the forceps between the skin and the membrane, as if you were peeling it, make the amount you peel equal to a fingernail or so. Then perforate the membrane until the forceps reaches an empty space which is where the water is. Remove it and insert into the hole the instrument which this is its image.
And it is almost like a tube made of a thin管径，用银或铜或光滑打磨的铅制成，在底部有一个小孔，并在侧面有三个孔，两个在同一侧，一个在另一侧，正如你所见。
And it can be placed with its tip on the blister in the shape of a pencil. As shown in this image:
At its top, there is a ring. If the instrument reaches the water, it will descend from the ring onto the instrument, expelling an amount of water moderate in quantity at the time. For if you expel more than is appropriate at the time, the patient might die due to the dissolution of his vital spirit.
Or he is shown a veil that brings him close to death, but expel from it an amount corresponding to his strength and what the condition of the patient indicates, such as the strength of his pulse and the goodness of his complexion. Then remove the instrument and retain the water, for it will be retained in its chamber.
Because of the skin that seals the hole on the membrane as you were instructed to bathe it in that manner, then replace the instrument another day if you see the patient capable of enduring that.
And also take a small amount of water, do that for several days while on your side and guard against error until there is but a little water left. If you fear for the patient and leave much water, treat it by burying it in hot sand.
And let him sweat much in the bath and sun, and endure thirst and treat him with dried medicines until he recovers. And warm his stomach, liver, and spleen after the water is removed as described before.
Chapter Fifty-Five.
In the treatment of children who are born with urethral punctures that are either absent or narrow, or in an improper position.
Some boys may be born with their urethrae not punctured and should be punctured immediately upon birth.
With a very fine probe as shown in this figure:.
Then place a thin lead screw in the puncture and tie it tightly. Hold it for three or four days. When urine desires to pass, move the screw aside and then return it. If you do not use lead and the urethra opens where the urine passes, it may close again.
And if the puncture is narrow, it should be treated with lead as we said, for many days until it becomes wider. For those in whom the puncture is in an improper position, some are born with the puncture at the end of the prepuce, so they cannot urinate towards the front.
Until he raises the prepuce with his hand above. If he is born without it, before the semen can reach the uterus on a straight path, which is a very ugly defect. The treatment for this involves having the patient lie on his back.
Then extend your left hand strongly and incise the head of the catheter with a sharp scalpel or forceps as if you were engraving something, making its center indented like a dimple, so that the hole falls in the middle as it should.
And take care in your work to avoid bleeding, for it often occurs. Counteract it with what stops the blood and treats the wound until it heals.
The Sixth Fifty Chapter.
In the blister that appears in the swelling, dimple, and blackening, and when the swelling adheres to the dimple.
This blister often appears in the catheter, which is a fold of fatty tissue. It can be either malignant or non-malignant. The non-malignant one should be removed with a gentle forceps.
And cut it until you remove all of it. Then apply a cotton pad soaked in the Egyptian ointment, and treat it subsequently with the palm-oil ointment until it heals. If the blister is malignant and pale in color, you should use cauterization after cutting and draining it.
If the blister is in an uncircumcised swelling, and some part of it is inside the swelling and some part outside, you should first extract the part inside until it heals. Then treat the part outside.
Because if you treat them together, there is a risk that the swelling may rupture. It may also appear in uncircumcised individuals, with blackening and corruption in the swelling. You should excise all that has turned black and seems to be corrupt or has already腐烂了。
Then apply honey after that with the pounded and sieved date peel and cherry bark. Then treat it with other treatments until it heals, if there is a bleeding discharge then use cauterization with a crescent-shaped iron in this manner:.
If cauterization is beneficial for both cases, namely bleeding and wound if it deteriorates, if the swelling resolves completely at any time, it should be noted that a tube of lead should be inserted to allow the healthy tissue to heal on it. As for the adhesion of the capsule to the swelling.
This adhesion occurs only in those whose capsule is healthy and has not undergone excision. It may also adhere due to a wound or tumor, so it should be removed with forceps until the bond dissolves and the swelling can be freed from all sides.
If it is difficult to distinguish them by probing, then a part should be removed from the swelling and the capsule. This is because the capsule is thin; perhaps it will tear quickly due to its thinness. Then separate the capsule from the swelling with a fine cotton cloth moistened in cold water to prevent adhesion as well.
Then treat with astringent decoction until it heals.
Seventh and Fiftieth Chapter.
On the Cleansing of Boys and the Treatment of What Affects Them.
Circumcision is nothing but the separation of what is joined, like other surgeries. However, since it is done by our will and is particularly used for boys, it is necessary to outline the best method for it.
The easiest way to safety, I say that the predecessors did not mention circumcision in any of their books because it was not practiced in their laws and customs, but what we have acquired is different.
By experiment, I found that the craftsmen and surgeons use purification with soap and scissors, and use the ligature with a thread and cut with a nail. I have tested all these methods.
I found nothing better than purification with scissors and ligature with a thread because purification with soap is often too harsh for the skin as the skin of the wound has two layers, and sometimes it cuts the upper layer while leaving the lower one intact.
He will have to cut again and endure further pain. Purification with a ligature does not ensure the cutting of the tip of the prepuce, as it might enter its hole. As for purification with a nail, the skin might slip off, ruining your work, or the child's skin might be naturally short.
For they are often born that way and do not require purification. I have seen this. As for purification with scissors and ligature with a thread, experience has shown me its advantage because the scissors are suitable for cutting, as the blade on top is like the blade on the bottom.
For when you apply your hand with the blades fitting together, you cut to a uniform measurement at one time, making the thread's grip like a wall to the skin of the prepuce from all sides. This ensures no error whatsoever. The reason for the work first is to deceive the child.
And especially if he is one who understands a little, that you tie the thread only in its unlaying part and leave it for another day, then unravel it and straighten it as much as you can do so without causing him pain or discomfort, then hold it up before you erectly.
And let not the child sit, hiding the scissors in your sleeve or under your foot so that his eye never falls upon them, nor upon any of the instruments, then put your hand into the unlaying part and blow into the skin and pull it up until the head of the unlaying part comes out.
Then cleanse the area from whatever dirt may be present. Then tie the indicated place with a double thread. Then tie a little below it with a second tie. Then hold firmly with your thumb and index finger the place where the lower tie is made, and cut between the ties. Then raise the skin above quickly and extract the head of the unlaying part. Then let the blood flow a little, for this is better and less swollen for the unlaying part. Then wipe it with a wet cloth. Then sprinkle it with dry burned pumpkin ashes; this is the best I have tried, or with fine safflower powder; this is also superior.
Then raise the skin above quickly and extract the head of the unlaying part. Then let the blood flow a little, for this is better and less swollen for the unlaying part. Then wipe it with a wet cloth. Then sprinkle it with dry burned pumpkin ashes; this is the best I have tried, or with fine safflower powder; this is also superior. Then apply to the blisters from above with a cloth soaked in the juice of a boiled egg in rose water, mixed with fragrant and tender rose oil. Leave it on for another day. Then treat it with other remedies until it heals.
This is a picture of the scissors which are suitable for cleaning.
The scissors should be straight-cutting, without bending, with the point facing the nail. The length of the blades should be equal to the length of the handles, both being even. As for those who make errors in cleaning, they may have turned all or part of the inner skin when cutting, so it should be stretched from your wrist with your nail before the area swells.
And cut it equally, if you cannot hold it with your fingernail then draw it with forceps and cut it. If it has passed three days and what is beneath the head of the hernia is still swollen, apply a cold compress until the hot swelling subsides and strip it gently.
And cut it according to what is convenient for you, and protect the head of the hernia. If you cut anything from the head of the hernia, that will not harm; treat it with the leeches we described in the article on leech therapy.
And if you cut more of the skin than necessary and it contracts beyond that, that will also not be greatly harmful. Treat it as we have described until it heals.
The Eighth and Fiftieth Chapter.
On the Treatment of Urine Retention in the Bladder.
Urine retention in the bladder occurs due to obstruction from a stone, clotted blood, pus, or prolapsed flesh, and so forth. If you treat this according to what we have mentioned regarding the various methods of treatment as classified.
And if urine does not pass and I have observed that the retention is due to a stone that has damaged the neck of the bladder, it should be made to lie on his knees with his face downward. Then place one foot on his back and stretch his belly toward his back, and hold himself by whatever he can.
Then the neck of the bladder will be forced to push the stone backward, and urine will pass. If it does not pass as described and the situation becomes urgent for the patient, it should be extracted using the instrument called a catheter, which is shown in this figure:.
It is made of silver and is thin, smooth, hollow like a bird's feather quill in its softness, long about a span and a half. It has a delicate flange at its head, and the urine suction end that a bent thread be tied to, with good wrapping of cotton or wool.
It enters the end of the catheter and is sealed with a plug if any wool remains. If you need to insert it into the tube,塞入管中以堵住为好，然后涂上油或乳液或鸡蛋清，并让病人坐下。
It is greased with wet fingers or oil and water, then the catheter is inserted into the urethra gently until it reaches the base of the urethra. Then the urethra is curved upwards towards the rectum, and the catheter is pushed inside.
Until it is curved, then the catheter is pushed inside until it reaches close to the prostate. Then the penis is tilted downwards and the catheter is inserted further until it reaches the bladder. The patient will feel that it has reached a void.
And it is made in this order because the passage through which the urine flows has a curve. Then, you stretch the thread with some wool slightly, for the urine follows the wool, then you withdraw it and let the urine flow out, and you reinsert the catheter.
And you continue to do this until the bladder is emptied and the patient finds relief.
The Fifth十九章。
How to Instill the Bladder with Zaraqah.
Illustrations of the instruments suitable for this purpose are made from silver or from hollowed ivory, having a long tube on a bladder. If you wish to instill water and medicines in it, this is done with an instrument called zaraqah. This is its form:.
It is made from silver or from hollowed ivory, having a long tube on a bladder. All of it is hollow except for the tip, which has three holes: two on one side and one on the other, as you can see.
And the hollow part where the suction occurs is made to fit what it blocks without any excess. So, when you draw it towards something from the moisture, it is drawn towards it, and when you push it away, the moisture moves away a distance as is done with the trumpet used to shoot oil in naval battles.
If you wish to instill the moisture into the bladder, you insert the tip of the zaraqah into the moisture and draw it upwards with the bellows. The moisture is drawn into the hollow part of the zaraqah, then its tip is inserted into the urethra as described in the catheters, and the moisture is pushed up with the bellows.
That moisture reaches the bladder, and the patient feels it. This is also a gentle syringe used to instill the bladder with it.
It is made from silver or steel; its upper end resembles a small funnel, and below it is a groove in which the band is placed. Then, you take a camel's bladder, put the moisture you wish to instill into the bladder, and tie it tightly between the grooves with a doubled thread.
Warming that moisture slightly on the fire, then entering its tip into the urethra, and pulling your hand on the bladder with the moisture firmly until the patient feels that this moisture has reached the bladder.
If you have no bladder, take a piece of skin, make it into a circle, and puncture it all around. Then put a thin thread through those holes as you would lace it up. Next, gather the circle together as you would gather a sachet after putting in what you want of moisture, ointments, and water.
Then bind it to the device and operate with it as you did with the bladder by squeezing your hand until the moisture reaches the bladder.
Chapter Sixty.
Extraction of the Stone.
We have mentioned the classification of stones and their treatment with medications. We have also noted the difference between stones generated in the kidney and those generated in the bladder, along with the signs of each. Furthermore, we have discussed the stone for which manual intervention and incision are required.
And it is the stone generated in the bladder, especially that which forms in the urethra. I will describe this in detail and briefly.
I say that the stone generated in the bladder is more common among boys. One of its signs is that the urine comes out from the bladder resembling water in its thinness.
Sand is visible in it, and it irritates the penis, playing with it, and often hangs down. It spreads and the hymen protrudes in many of them. Recovery from boys is easier until they reach fourteen years of age, while it is more difficult for older men. As for young men, their condition lies between these two extremes.
And that which has a larger stone has easier treatment, while the smaller one is opposite to that. When we proceed to treatment, it should first be infused with an injection to expel all the filth within it, for it may prevent the presence of the stone upon examination.
Then the patient is taken by his legs and shaken downwards so that the stone may descend into the neck of the bladder or it may drop from a high place several times. Then he is placed upright in front of you with his hands under his knees, causing the bladder to be entirely tilted downward, and then it is examined.
And examine it externally. If you feel the stone in the space, act quickly with your fingers to split it. If it does not fall under your touch at all, it should be smeared with oil on the little finger if the patient is a boy, or with the middle finger.
If it is a boy who has reached maturity, insert your hand into his scrotum and examine for the stone. When you feel it under your finger, move it little by little towards the neck of the bladder, then press it with your finger and push it out towards the place where you wish to make an incision.
And order a servant to squeeze the bladder with his hand. Order another servant to stretch his right hand upward over the scrotum and his left hand to stretch the skin beneath the scrotum toward the place where the incision will be made. Then take the forceps, which is shown in this figure.
And make the incision between the scrotum and the testicles not in the middle, but next to the left side. The incision should be made at the same level as the stone and your finger inside the scrotum, pressing it outward so that the incision from outside is wide while the one from inside is narrow enough to allow the stone to pass through.
There is none greater, for it may be that the finger pressed the stone in the calyx at the incision and it comes out without difficulty, and know that there may be stones with angles and letters which are difficult to come out for this reason.
And among them are those that are smooth and resemble acorns and are easily removed. If they have angles and letters, then it is better to make the incision a little larger. If they do not come out in this manner, it would be advisable to use a probe with its tip like a forceps.
Let it grasp the stone so that it does not slip from it, and if you cannot do this, enter beneath it a gentle curved instrument. If you are unable to manage this, make the incision a little larger. If bleeding overcomes you, stop it with a clot.
If there are more than one, first push the larger one into the bladder opening, then make an incision in it. After that, push the smaller one. Do this similarly if there are more than two. If it is extremely large, it would be foolish to make a large incision in it, as this exposes the patient to one of two risks.
Either it dies or it occurs to him a permanent incontinence of urine, because the area will never heal completely. Therefore, try to push them until they come out or fragment them with forceps so that they are definitely removed.
When you have finished your work, cauterize the wound gently with a hot iron and stitch it. Wet it above with a dressing of oil and a potion or ointment of saffron and cold water to soothe the hot swelling. Then let the patient lie on his side. Do not apply the bandage until the third day.
If it resolves, we should apply it with much water and oil, then treat it with the palm-oil ointment and the basilicon ointment until it heals. If there is a lesion in the wound and a hot, excessive swelling occurs, and similar conditions such as blood freezing in the bladder preventing urination, and this is known from the blood exiting with the urine.
Insert your finger into the wound and remove that blood; for if it remains, it calls for the corruption of the bladder and its infection. Then wash the wound with vinegar and water and salt, and counter each kind with what resembles it in treatment until it heals.
In all times of treatment, it is necessary to bind the thighs and bring them together to secure the medicine placed on the wound. If the stone is small and has reached the urethra and become lodged therein, causing obstruction of urine flow, treat it with what I am describing before it leads to a rupture.
For often I have been able to use this treatment instead of a surgical incision. This is how you should take a steel awl:
Like a triangle with sharp points inserted in a stick. Then take a thread and tie it under the stone on the penis to prevent it from returning to the bladder. Next, gently insert the steel awl into the urethra until the awl reaches the same stone.
And turn the awl slightly within the stone until you puncture it, then you should squeeze your hand on what remains of the stone outside the penis. The stone will break and exit with the urine, thus healing the condition.
If this treatment is not available to you due to an obstacle, tie a thread below the stone and another above the stone, then incise the stone in the same member between the two ties, and then remove it.
Then release the tie and clean the clotted blood that has remained in the wound. It was necessary to tie the thread below the stone so that it does not return to the bladder, and the other tie above, so that when the thread is released after the stone has been removed, the skin returns to its place and covers the wound.
Therefore, when you tie the upper thread, you should lift the skin above so that it returns when you are done and covers the wound as we said.
The Sixty-First Chapter.
On the Extraction of Stones in Women.
Stones rarely develop in women. If a woman does have a stone, it is difficult to treat and often impossible due to several reasons. One reason might be that the woman could be a virgin, and another is that you may not find a woman willing to allow a doctor to examine her.
If she is a virgin or from those under guardianship, the third reason is that you may not find a woman skilled in this craft, especially manual work. The fourth reason is that the incision for extracting the stone in women is far from where the stone is located, requiring a deep incision.
This is risky. If necessity demands this, you should take a skilled female doctor. Such women are rare, so if unavailable, seek a virtuous and gentle male doctor or prepare a skilled woman knowledgeable in matters concerning women, or one who can provide some guidance in this craft.
She is to do all that you command her to do in examining the stone first. This is that she should look whether the woman is a virgin; if so, it should be that she enter her introitus with her finger and examine the stone. If she finds it and presses it with her finger.
Then you command her to cut her. If she is not a virgin and is deflowered, you command the midwife to enter her finger into the passage of the affected one and examine the stone after placing her left hand on the bladder and squeezing it well.
If she finds it, she should introduce it from the mouth of the bladder downward to the extent of its capacity until it reaches the base of the thigh. Then she should cut her at the junction of half the passage of the vagina near the base of the thigh on whichever side she feels the stone in that area.
And her finger should not be removed from pressing the stone, and let the cut be small first. Then she should insert the probe into that small cut. If she feels the stone, she should enlarge the cut according to what she knows the stone can pass through. Know that types of stones are many.
From them, some are small and some are large, smooth and jagged, long and spiral, with branches. Know their kinds so that you may infer from this what you seek. If blood overcomes you, sprinkle in the place the moist powder and wait until the blood ceases, then return to your work.
Until the stone is expelled, work that you may count with yourself from the instruments mentioned for removing stones in men to assist you in your task. If bleeding overcomes you and you know by the pulse of the blood that it is from a ruptured vein, place the dressings on the site.
Strengthen with ligatures firmly and leave it without redoing. Do not attempt to remove the stone, for it may harm the patient. Then treat the wound; if the bleeding subsides after a few days and the area becomes infected, return to your work until the stone is expelled.
The Sixty-Second Chapter.
On Making an Incision into the Water Bladder.
The water bladder is nothing but the gathering of moisture in the white duct that is beneath the skin surrounding the scrotum and is called the sfen. It may have a special membrane prepared by nature in one part of the scrotum.
Until it is thought to be another testicle. And there is this white duct between the skin of the scrotum and the sfen, which we have said. This does not occur except in rarity. This water bladder arises from a weakness that affects women, so this material assumes it and it has been exposed to a blow on the female genitalia.
This moisture can have many colors: it may be yellowish, or bloody and red, or dark black, or watery and white, which is the most common. The signs by which it is recognized.
Where moisture accumulates, if it is in the white duct that we have mentioned, the swelling will be slightly elongated and round, resembling the shape of a testicle. The testis itself will not be visible as the moisture surrounds it from all sides.
And if the moisture is in its special membrane, the swelling will be round in one part of the testicle.
For this, a person may assume it is another egg, even though the moisture is between the skin of the scrotum and the white membrane; it is perceptible to sensation. If you wish to know the color of the moisture, prick the tumor with the square probe whose image I have shown previously; whatever comes out in the aftermath of the probe, judge it accordingly.
If we turn to treatment with iron, it should be ordered to open the vein if possible and you see his body full, then he lies on his back on something slightly raised. Place many pillows under him, then sit on his left side.
And you should order a servant to sit on his right side, stretching his penis to one side of the skin of the scrotum and towards the region of the bladder. Then take a broad probe and incise the skin of the scrotum lengthwise from the middle to near the anus.
And the incision should be straight and parallel to the line that divides the skin of the scrotum into two halves, until it reaches the white membrane containing the sperm. Slicep it open and take care not to cut it. Your incision should be more towards the part that adheres to the egg, and you should incise the opening to the extent that you can.
Then expand the white membrane containing water widely and thoroughly, extracting all the water. Next, separate the edges of the incision with forceps and stretch the membrane upwards without touching the containing skin of the scrotum. Cut the membrane as much as possible, either entirely or in sections.
And especially its thin side; if you do not thoroughly cut it, water may return. If the egg protrudes outside its skin during your work, once you have finished cutting the membrane, push it back in. Then sew the edges of the scrotal skin together.
Then treat it as other surgeries until it heals. If you hit the egg, and it has become spoiled from another illness, it is incumbent to ligate the vessels in the scrotum fearing bleeding, then cut the spermatic cord from the scrotum and remove the egg, then treat it as we have mentioned.
If the water has met in both sides equally, know that they are two adrar. Split the other side in the same manner as you have done to the first, or if it is equal for you to make the work one, do so, then wipe the blood.
And you enter into the openings wool that has been soaked in oil or in rose fat. It becomes from outside wool that has been soaked in a drink and oil, and you spread it over the testicles and omentum of the abdomen. You place above the tear folded ligature which is the refa'id. And you ligate it from above with the ligature which has six ends as follows:.
Then you take two tears and suture them and stuff them with fluffy wool as an example. You make the ends that are tied with cotton or wet wool, and gather them with tension in the waistband of the trousers. One of the ends is taken to the back to the shoulder.
And the second is taken to near the anus. The ends are on the thighs below, and the remaining ends are on the arberry (a type of muscle or tissue). You gather all the tension in the waistband of the trousers. This addra can also be made by ironing instead of cutting with a scalpel.
And you take a fine surgical knife, and cut the skin of the scrotum when it is warm as described until the white duct containing the water becomes visible. Then take another iron in this manner:.
It resembles the Greek eye, then it is treated with that scab and it is protected until all the moisture is expelled. Then the scab is stretched with wires and removed with an iron. It is cut according to what you can do until all of it is extirpated and the egg is preserved without being exposed to fire.
Know that this work is safer and farther from bleeding and better than cutting work. If you encounter in the area of cutting or at the time of cauterizing a hot swelling or bleeding or something else, it should be treated with the treatment suitable for each according to what has been mentioned.
If the patient is faint-hearted and cannot endure this work because of its severity, let him use the bath as I describe it; and if it is effective for you according to the evidence we have provided.
The abscess is watery, so let the patient sit on a raised chair. Then, apply a broad clamp below the swelling and place the bath along the length of the body, making the opening wide enough for all the water to flow out. Place a cloth over the area and bind it.
Leave it until the rest of the water drains out, then treat it until the wound heals. If the water does not drain out at the time you expected, this is due to the white membrane blocking the wound's opening and preventing the water from draining out.
Then it should be necessary to insert a feather of an ostrich or the instrument used to extract the water of lovers, which is depicted in its image, or increase the opening of the wound slightly.
Know that water may return and come together after six months or so. If it does come together, boil it in the same manner and let the disease pass its days.
The Thirty-Sixth Chapter.
On Incising the Fleshly Prepuce and Its Treatment.
Know that incising these fleshly prepuce flaps is fraught with danger, often leading to ruin. Therefore, we see it avoided and safety from it maintained. I shall mention the procedure and types of swelling.
I say that many swellings may occur in the bodies where there is a composition of the female organs, and this may be from various causes: either from retained menstrual blood flowing to the female organs, or from a blow. The color of the swelling is the same as the body's color, and it does not have water.
The swelling may be hard and reddish, like blood clot, with no sensation. It may also be due to the complexity and swelling of the arteries, as was previously mentioned, or from the swelling of the veins. If it is due to arterial swelling, this can be recognized by the disappearance of the swelling.
If you press it with your fingers, nothing should appear from it. As for that which is due to vein swelling, pressing it with your fingers will reveal nothing. This type can be incised on and on all the flesh.
And you should incise the scrotal skin, then lift the testicle upwards and remove it through the white sac. Detach the sperm duct from all its blood vessels, tie the blood vessels, and cut the sperm duct after detaching it from all sides of the testicle. If the testicle has adhered to the growing flesh.
You are to remove the egg and cut it, if there is adhesion between any of the membranes or between the vessels, you must separate all such adhesion and cut it in a circular manner.
If the flesh plant is in a place of adhesion which is from behind, you must cut all of it and remove the egg as we said. When your work is complete, dress the deep wound with moist cotton soaked in rose oil and syrup, then treat it with other treatments until it heals.
The Fourth and Sixty Chapter.
In the treatment of the abscess with Daliah.
Daliah is a swollen lump twisted with some curvature, resembling a bunch of grapes, accompanied by relaxation of the anal sphincters and difficulty for the patient in movement, exercise, and walking. In the treatment of this condition, there is a close resemblance to what has been previously mentioned.
But we must mention the procedure as the ancients did. I say that the patient should sit on a high chair, then lower the anal sphincters, and hold the scrotal skin with your fingers along with the vessels near the penis.
And another servant should hold it stretched strongly, then make a jagged incision with a wide sharp forceps along the edges of the vessels until the vessels are exposed. Then peel it from all sides as I told you when describing the incision of the vessels in the pterygia, and then stitch it with a doubled thread needle.
And tie it at the first place where Daliah appeared, and also tie it at the end. Then make a vertical incision in the middle along the length of the body, and remove all the collected corrupt and foul moisture.
Then treat the carbuncle with the treatment of other wounds that you want to generate a period for the vessels that nourish one of the veins to fall. There is no harm in this, for if the duct is presented to all the vessels, it should be removed along with the vessel so as not to deprive the egg of food. Then it wilts from cutting off the vessels and is no longer beneficial.
The Fifth and Sixty-sixth Chapter.
In the Treatment of Bowel Abscesses.
This abscess occurs from a tear that exposes the sac extending on the abdomen near the iliac regions from the lumbar sinuses. The intestine descends into one of the veins from that hernia.
And this hernia can occur either from a tear in the sac or from its extension. These two types are among many causes, which can be a blow, a jump, a shout, or lifting something heavy, and so on. Its sign is that it happens gradually over a long period of time if it is due to the extension of the sac.
And it does not occur suddenly. The swelling is flat to the depth before the sac compresses the intestine. Its sign is that if it is due to a tear in the sac, it occurs suddenly with severe pain from the beginning and the swelling appears different and visible under the skin.
And this occurs when the intestine protrudes and its course is outside through the sac. It may also extrude with the discharge, making this abscess both intestinal and discharging. It may also be accompanied by foul odor. If fecal matter passes in the intestine and gets blocked there, it can lead to the patient's deterioration.
Because it causes a difficult pain and cramping, especially if squeezed, and the treatment of such conditions with iron is dangerous and should be avoided. The method of treatment is to order the patient to return the intestine into his abdomen if it can be brought back.
Then he lies on his back before you and lifts his legs. You stretch the skin below the umbilicus upwards and incise the scrotal skin completely lengthwise. Then you insert clips into the edges of the incision to keep it open as wide as necessary.
The incision should be made to the extent that the egg can be removed. Then, peel the sacs beneath the scrotal skin until the hard white sac is exposed on all sides. Then insert your third finger below the egg.
Between the white sac beneath the egg's skin and the second sac, separate the adhesion from behind the egg. Then fold with your right hand into the scrotal skin. At the same time, stretch the white sac upwards with your left hand and raise the egg along with the sac towards the incision.
Order the servant to raise the egg upwards and release the adhesion from behind completely. Then use your finger to examine thoroughly to ensure there is nothing of the twisted intestine in the hard white sac. If you find anything, push it back into the abdomen below.
Then take a needle with a thick thread that has been divided into ten strands and insert it at the end of the sac beneath the scrotal skin near the incision. Cut the ends of the thread strands to leave four strands. Then some are joined together in a rigid manner and connected to the scrotal septum, which we said is bound strongly from two sides. The ends of the threads are also folded and tied very tightly so that none of the vessels they nourish can reach them. Lest a hot swelling arise from that, also leave a second bond outside the first, distant from it less than two fingers. After these two bonds, leave the scrotal septum beneath the skin the width of an finger bone.
Lest a hot swelling arise from that, also leave a second bond outside the first, distant from it less than two fingers. After these two bonds, leave the scrotal septum beneath the skin the width of an finger bone. And cut the rest entirely in a round manner and remove the egg with it, then make a incision beneath the skin of the scrotum that will bleed like we described earlier. Then use the wool soaked in oil, place it in the wound, and use the bandage as described.
And the white scrotum may be cauterized carefully to prevent bleeding, as this often occurs. Leave the bandage until it falls off by itself; if it does not fall off quickly, apply hot water and rub it with something that will make it ooze until it falls.
Then treat the wound as other wounds are treated until it heals.
Sixth and Sixty-First Chapter.
In the hydrocele, I have not seen anyone dare to treat it with iron. As for the earlier ones, they were instructed to prepare it as we described for the hydrocele near the scrotum. This involves tying the vessels gently below after incising them.
Then make a incision in the middle and treat the tumor by opening it until the vessels drop out and treat the wound as we have mentioned until it heals.
The Seventh Sixty-First Chapter.
In the hernia that occurs in the arabic region.
The hernia may occur in the arabic region as we said, protruding the area without anything from the intestines coming down into the scrotum. If anything does come down, it is only a little and returns at all times.
But if time prolongs, the incision in the scrotum increases until the intestines and the hernial sac appear. This occurs due to the extension of the scrotal defect that exists in the arabic region as we said. And this occurs because the scrotum extends, then relaxes and the area protrudes. Its treatment is by cauterization as described earlier.
And it can be treated with iron in this manner: The patient lies on his back before you, then make an incision in the area of the warm hernia about three fingers wide across, and expose the vessels beneath the skin.
Until the white scrotum beneath is exposed. Then take a loop and place it over the protruding part of the scrotum, pressing it towards the depth of the abdomen. Next, suture the two protruding areas using the end of the loop from the scrotum, securing one to the other with缝合。
Then pull the end of the loop and do not cut the scrotum at all, nor touch the testicle or anything else as I have instructed you in treating intestinal hernias. Then treat it according to the methods for wounds.
If the sutures are cut, clean them and treat the wound until it heals. Then the diaphragm constricts and does not increase the bulge of the hernia.
And the hook is better in this place because it is closer to safety.
The eighth and sixty-fifth section.
In relaxing the scrotal skin.
Often, the scrotal skin relaxes in some people without the underlying tissue relaxing, making its appearance unpleasant. Therefore, it is advisable for those who wish to treat it to have the patient lie on his back.
And all the relaxed skin is cut off from the thick skin, then the lips are brought together. If you wish to suture first, suture the relaxed skin flap with three or four sutures and strengthen the suturing, then cut between the sutures.
Then treat it as other wounds until it heals and the sutures drop out.
The ninth and sixty-fifth section.
On circumcision.
Circumcision is forbidden in our religion.
And for this reason, it is incumbent upon me not to mention it in my book. I have only mentioned it for two reasons: the first is that if a doctor is asked about it, he should know what it is and how to treat someone who has it. The second reason is that we often need to circumcise some animals for our benefit.
As for the hens, turtledoves, and cats, and similar animals, I say that fertilization occurs in two ways: either by copulation or by incision and cutting. The one occurring by copulation, its method of operation is that we sit the animal in hot water until its females relax, soften, and hang down.
Then caress it with your hand until it relaxes and cannot be discerned upon touch. As for fertilization by incision, you should hold the animal and compress its testicles with your left hand, then tie the cords and make one incision on each sac.
Until the two sacs appear, cut them after剥离后，不要在它们上面留下任何静脉，只需留下血管上的薄薄一层。这种通过切割进行的受精比通过交配进行的更好。
For copulation might leave something in the females, and the animal might desire intercourse again. Then the wound is treated until it heals.
Seventy Seventh Section.
In the Treatment of Hermaphrodites.
The hermaphrodite in men occurs of two types. One is that it appears as a space, or on the skin between the testicles, resembling a woman's vulva with hair, and urine may flow from the one occurring on the skin of the scrotum.
As for women, it occurs of one type and appears above the vulva on the labia, like small testicles that emerge from one of them like a male penis. The two together are like the female genitals. The treatment of these three types.
The two kinds of men and the single kind of women should have that excess flesh cut until its trace is removed, then treat it with the treatment of other surgeries until recovery. As for the second kind of men who excrete from the part that is in the skin of the scrotum, there is no work to be done on them nor any healing required at all.
The Seventy-First Chapter.
On Cutting the Clitoris and the Flesh That Arises from Women's Vulvas.
The clitoris may sometimes exceed the natural amount, becoming swollen and disfiguring its appearance. It may also enlarge in some women to the extent that it spreads like that of men, making intercourse possible.
It should be cut with your hand or a scissors, but do not excessive in cutting, especially not deeply into the base, to avoid excessive bleeding.
Then treat it with the treatment of surgeries until it heals. As for the flesh that grows, it is flesh that grows in the mouth of the womb to fill it.
And sometimes it may grow outside like the labia. And therefore, some early practitioners call it the labial disease and it should be cut like the clitoris, whether it has grown inside or outside, and treated until it heals.
The Seventy-Second Chapter.
On the Treatment of Dropsy.
Dropsy is when the vagina is not perforated or when the perforation is small, and it can either be congenital, present at birth, or acquired due to some cause, which may be from excess growth of prolapsed flesh.
Or it may be a thin or thick fluid, and it is either in the depth of the womb or in its sides or on its upper part or lower part, and it prevents copulation and conception and perhaps menstruation, and its identification is by the midwife's inspection.
If the obstruction is evident and close, but not so, then probe it with her fingers or a gauze. If the obstruction is a thin fluid and close to the labia, then puncture it promptly by making a semicircular incision on the labia and placing your thumbs from both hands.
The woman lies on her back with her legs spread, then the labia are stretched forcefully until the thin fluid is punctured and the obstruction opens. Then she takes some wool, dips it in oil, and places it on the spot. The woman should copulate every day to prevent the area from re-adhering.
If the fluid is thick and dense, it should be incised with a broad forceps resembling a date leaf. If the obstruction is from a protruding flesh, clamp it with forceps and cut it out. Have with you medications to staunch bleeding without causing pain, such as caquisa, shian, and balsam mixed with egg white.
Then use a wide lead pipe to prevent the wound from adhering quickly. Keep it for several days, then use dry cotton wick, and treat it with all other treatments for adhesion until it heals. Another form of plant tissue may appear in the womb, so it should be cut out in this manner.
If it is not a malignant tumor, a malignant tumor in the womb should never be treated with iron.
The Seventy-third Chapter
In the Treatment of Hemorrhoids and Warts and Red Pustules That Appear on Women's Genitals.
As for hemorrhoids, they are the swelling of the openings of the veins until blood flows from them abundantly and constantly. When hemorrhoids become chronic, they turn into warts. I have mentioned in the classification their kinds and signs; we will mention them here.
What can be treated and what cannot be treated, I say that hemorrhoids and warts, if they are deep within the uterus and not palpable, have no treatment with iron. Those located on the cervix, which can be felt upon examination, are the ones that can be treated.
It is necessary that the woman enter a cool room, then apply pressure to the warts with a needle or a rough cloth, cut them off from their roots, and apply them when bleeding occurs from one of the vessels that stop the bleeding without rubbing.
For example, with colocynth, safflower, frankincense, and the like. Then raise her legs to the wall for a while, and lower them into cold water. If the bleeding continues, sit her in a decoction of sumac, bark of buckthorn, and ferula, and the like. Then take spelt flour, mix it with honey and vinegar.
Apply it to her back. If the bleeding stops, then apply the leeches and breasts without constraint. Then take a cloth and immerse it in the juice of rhubarb or the juice of pregnant tongue or the juice of buckthorn branches with ferula decoction, and apply it to the area.
If the swelling is quelled, treat the area with ointment until it heals. As for the red pimple, it resembles the heads of haisha rough to the touch; one should cut what has appeared from it according to what was mentioned regarding thumail, and treat it until it heals.
The Fourth Seventy-Chapter.
Concerning the prolapse of the uterus that occurs in the womb.
Various types of tumors may appear in the womb, such as cancer, hardened tumor, ulcers, diphilosis, acromegaly, nails, hemorrhoids, cleavage, thumail, and hot tumor. I have mentioned all these diseases, their types, and their symptoms in classification.
It should be noted in this article that the hot tumor may appear in the womb. If it is one of the tumors that have a long duration, how its hardness should be determined by pressing with iron. You should examine it; if the pain of the tumor at the beginning is acute with throbbing, inflammation, and fever.
And I have seen it red if touched. Do not hasten to press it; rather, treat it with what aids in maturation until these symptoms subside. Then, the woman should sit on a chair with two seats and lean against its back.
And she should gather her legs to the lower abdomen, with her thighs spread apart. Her arms should be placed under her knees and tied together with a bandage that is suitable.
Therefore, the midwife should sit on the right side. She should use the instrument that opens the womb, which will be shown later in the illustrations. If you intend to use this instrument, you should estimate the depth of the woman's uterus so that what enters from the instrument does not exceed the depth of the uterus.
If the instrument causes damage, and if the instrument is deeper than the depth, it should be placed side branches on the cervix of the uterus to prevent the entire instrument from entering the depth of the uterus. It should also be ensured that the tube running in the instrument is from the upper side.
And you hold the instrument while the servant turns the tube until it opens the cervix of the uterus. If the tumor appears and is touched by hand and is soft and pliable, it should be incised at its head with a broad forceps. When all the matter has been expelled.
It should be made in the wound a soft wick浸湿在玫瑰油或绿肥皂水中有些收缩作用，然后将wick从伤口开口处引出到子宫颈外，并在外侧在子宫和大阴唇上放置干净的纱布浸入已煮熟的面包水中。
Then it should be treated with the ointment suitable for this purpose until it heals.
And the uterus and wound may be washed by injecting it with water and honey, then with boiled water in which the root of the colocynth or long Zarun has been boiled, then returned to the ointment if the tumor is hidden inside the uterus.
It should be avoided to treat it with iron; instead, it should be treated as we have mentioned in the division.
The Fifth and Seventy-Fifth Chapter.
In Teaching Midwives How to Treat Living Fetuses That Have Been Delivered Abnormally.
The midwife should first know the natural birth process. One of its signs is that you see the woman laboring and desiring to breathe fresh air, and her postpartum condition becomes easier for her.
It speeds the birth of the infant; know that this birth takes place in a normal manner and the infant comes out on its head with the placenta with it or hanging from its umbilical cord. If you see these signs, it should be pressed upon to make the infant come out quickly.
If it descends on its head, the placenta comes with it and it should be cleaned properly. Except for this birth, all others are unnatural and blamable because the infant may come out on its feet or its hands before its head and feet.
It may come out with one hand or one foot, or its head and hand may come out together, or it may be born contracted and perhaps turn onto its back in one of the blamable shapes. Therefore, the midwife should be skilled and cautious about all these matters and beware of mistakes and errors.
And I have described each of these shapes and how to deal with them so that you may recognize them and understand them. If the infant comes out on its head in a natural manner, this is strenuous for the woman and difficult for her to deliver. If I see her strength has weakened, I seat her on a chair and order women to support her.
And apply a hot poultice and wet unguents to her womb. Then, the midwife should insert a small probe between her fingers and cut the placenta with it or cut it with her nail until the moisture within it flows out. She should then press upon the woman's abdomen to cause the infant to descend.
If it does not descend, you should inject the woman with the juice of the poultice mixed with shiraj unguent. Then, after the injection, order her to strain and blow her nose with a condy. Hold her mouth and nose; the infant will come out from its sac. If the infant's hands come out first, you should gently return them little by little.
If the hand does not enter, place the woman on a stool and raise her legs above. Then shake the stool to the ground while the woman holds on to prevent falling during the shaking. If neither hand enters and the fetus has died, cut the two and pull out the rest of the fetus.
Or tie his hands with a cloth and pull them gently; for it will come out. The coming out of the fetus is on its feet. If the fetus comes out on its feet, you should raise its legs slowly and turn the fetus little by little until you straighten it, then take one of its legs and extend it slowly.
If they come down to the thighs, order her to strain and blow with a condens. For it will come out. If it does not come out as described, turn the fetus little by little until you make it normal; for then it will come out smoothly. If all else fails as described.
Take a portion of the saliva of the cricket and the saliva of the sesame seed, the fat of the sheep's tail, and the dissolved glue. Pound all of them well in a mortar, then introduce it into the woman's vagina and lower abdomen. Then seat her in lukewarm water until it reaches the uterus.
If you see that it has leaked below, make her a pessary of honey and let her bear it. If she holds the pessary for an hour, seat her on a chair, then blow at her and plug her mouth and nose. Squeeze her lower abdomen gently. The fetus will come out from its cavity, coming out on its knees and hands.
If it comes out in this manner, have her insert her hands gradually, then let the woman lie on her back and hang her relaxed legs downward while she is lying on a bed and clasping her hands. Squeeze slightly above her abdomen gradually. Then remove what is under her feet from the pillows so that she is elevated at the bottom. If the fetus does not come out, take both of her legs and move them with a strong movement. Then squeeze slightly above the labia gradually until the fetus ascends. Then the midwife should enter her hand and straighten the fetus gradually.
And order the woman to bear down until the fetus is delivered. The fetus should be delivered with its head turned sideways, one of its hands hanging down. If she cannot turn its hand, cause the woman to sit and make her walk. If she cannot walk, have her lie down.
Place her on a bed and shake her legs vigorously. Then use the spoon described made of leeches. If she has a miscarriage, seat her on a chair. Then proceed to turn her hand and straighten the fetus in its natural position. Instruct the woman to bear down until it is delivered.
The fetus should be delivered on its back, with its hands extended and its face towards the mother's back. The midwife should hold the hand of the fetus and turn it gradually and gently, straightening it carefully. Once it is aligned, apply what we have described of ointments and leeches to the area.
Then order her to move slightly. If she does so, seat her on a chair and instruct her to tilt to the right side. Then order her to bear down and blow into her nose with a condes. The fetus should then be delivered upright on its side.
If the fluid descends into the mouth of the womb in this manner with the placenta, cut the placenta with your nail until it dries out. If it is attached to the face or neck of the fetus, sever it from the anus so that he does not choke and die. Then push the fetus inward until it is in the proper position.
Order the woman to pass water several times, for it exits easily, like the birth of twins or many fetuses. Know that twins are born frequently, and three or four may be born and live, though this is rare. As for five, it is something outside the natural course and they never live at all.
They surround them, and even if many, they have one placenta. They are separated by a membrane acting as a barrier between each of them, tied in the anus of each one. They may be born naturally and easily like a single fetus, or they may be born with a derogatory exit, as we have described.
If some of them have difficulty at birth and become what we said about the unnatural shapes, correct them as we described. Let the midwife be gentle and do what she does with kindness, patience, and adapt to each shape with whatever巧解法使其安全。
That which is conceived in the womb, of fetuses that fall, may be conceived one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, or more than ten. It has been confirmed to me that a woman gave birth to seven and another fifteen, all conceived.
By the estimation of the Most Merciful, Most Knowing, all this should be known to the midwife. For it may happen to her at some time, and she should meet such situations as they require.
The Sixty-Seventh Chapter.
On the Extraction of the Dead Fetus.
If you treated the dead fetus as described in the division of treatment and it did not come out, and necessity forced you to use your hand, you should examine her. If she is strong and there are no symptoms that one fears might lead to damage, the woman should lie on a bed on her back.
Her head should be inclined downward and her legs raised. A helper should hold her from both sides or she should be tied to the bed to prevent her body from being drawn forward when the fetus is pulled.
Then, moisten her uterine canal with the wet hands, salve of camphor, and tallow balm. The midwife should then apply these to her own hands and gently insert them into the uterus. She should then seek out the appropriate location for inserting the forceps from the fetus, and the corresponding positions.
Examine to see if the fetus is presenting head first, and insert the forceps into its eyes, or its ears, or its mouth, or its neck, or under its chin, or behind its neck, or in the areas close to the ribs, or under the armpits.
And if it is presenting feet first, insert the forceps into the buttocks or the middle ribs. It should be held with the right hand and its curved part should be positioned between the fingers of the left hand. Insert the hand gently and insert the forceps into one of the areas mentioned.
Until you reach a point, then you insert another pin or a third if needed to make the pull equal and not incline to one side. Then you extend straightly without the extension being only straight but moves in every direction.
It is easier for it to come out as is done with the tooth when extracting it, and it is necessary between that to extend the pull so that if it gets stuck on one side you should apply some fingers with grease and insert them from that side to turn what got stuck. If part of the fetus comes out, then you should move the pins to other positions.
It is to be raised a little. Do this until the fetus comes out completely. If a hand comes out first and cannot be returned due to compression, you should wrap it with a cloth, then pull it until it comes out completely, then cut it.
Either in the wrist joint or in the elbow joint, and thus you should do this in the other hand and in the legs. If the head of the fetus is large and there is pressure during the exit or if there is water collected in its head, you should insert a hooked instrument between the fingers.
And cut open the head with it to allow the water to come out, or incise it with the instrument called mashdakh which will be shown in the images of other instruments in the chapter that follows this.
Likewise, you should do this if the fetus has a large head. You should cut open the cranium or incise it with the mashdakh as we said, then remove the bones with forceps. If the head comes out but is compressed at the cervix, you should cut it open until the moisture in the chest drains.
If the chest joins then let it be so; but if the chest does not join and it is not possible for it to come out, cut off as you can. If it is below the abdomen swollen or has any lump in it, it should be bandaged until the moisture flows from it.
If the fetus is on its feet, then pulling it is easy and adjusting it to the mouth of the womb is easy. But if it is compressed at the abdomen or chest, you should pull it with a cloth wrapped around your hand and cut open the abdomen or chest until what is inside flows out.
If all the organs are extracted and only the head remains, and it has returned and is obstructed, then the midwife should insert her left hand. If the mouth of the womb is open, she should insert her hand into the cervix and search for the head with her fingers, pulling it towards the mouth of the womb. Then she should insert forceps or two forceps and pull the head with them.
If the mouth of the womb has joined to a hot swelling, apply it cool. You should not be harsh on it; rather, at that time, use the application of wet and greasy substances, use compresses, and sit in relaxing and moistening waters.
And if the fetus is on its side, if it can be adjusted, then use what we have mentioned for live fetuses. If this cannot be done, cut it and remove it. It should not leave anything of the placenta inside at all. When you are finished with your treatment, use what we have mentioned for treating hot swellings that occur in the wombs.
If there is a bleeding discharge, immerse in contracting waters and use all other treatments. I have seen a woman who became pregnant and the fetus died within her, then she became pregnant again.
Then the other fetus also died. After a long time, a tumor appeared in her abdomen and swelled until it opened up, allowing pus to ooze out. She was then called upon for treatment, and I treated her for a long time without being able to suture the wound. I applied some of the strong suction ointments on it.
Then a bone came out of the place. After some days, another bone came out. I was amazed by this, for the abdomen is not a place where bones are found. I supposed it to be from the bones of the dead fetus and examined the wound, finding many bones, mostly from the head of the fetus.
I continued to follow this until I extracted many bones. The woman was in the best of conditions, and she lived so for a considerable time, emitting only a slight amount of pus. I have mentioned here this rare case merely.
Because it contains knowledge and assistance for what the surgeon attempts to treat with his hands.
Seventy-Seventh Chapter.
It contains images of the instruments needed for extracting the fetus.
A diagram of a tube used to open the cervix.
This clamp that is used to straighten the books. It has two tubes at the ends of the wood, though this tube should be softer than the clamp and should be made either of ivory or of a soft wood like boxwood. The width of each piece of wood should be as thick as two fingers.
And let the diameter of each be about an inch, and their length a span and a half. In the middle of the two pieces of wood, there are two rods of the same kind of wood, tied to them; their length should be half a span or a little more, and their width about an inch or a little more. These two rods are tied in the middle.
These are the ones that enter into the mouth of the womb to open with them when you turn the rods, Another instrument of this kind is more gentle and lighter.
It is made of abnus or buckthorn wood in the shape of forceps, except that it has two probes at its tip as you can see. The length of each probe is about a cubit and their width is two fingers. If you wish to open the womb with it,
Sit the woman on a tilting bed with her legs spread and apart. Then, insert these probes into the mouth of the womb, holding the lower part of the instrument between her thighs. Next, open your hand with the instrument as you would with forceps, to the extent you desire for opening the womb. Until the midwife accomplishes what she desires, a picture of another rod mentioned by the ancients.
A picture of the rod used to push the fetus:
A picture of the forceps used to grasp the fetal head:
It resembles scissors with teeth at the tip as you can see. It can also be made in a rectangular shape like forceps, as shown here, with saw-like teeth that cut and rasp.
A picture of another rod:
A picture of forceps:
This forceps has a thin edge to prevent it from breaking when pulling the fetus, with two teeth. A picture of forceps with two teeth:
Image of broad forceps for cutting the fetus:
All these instruments, the more their kinds are numerous and are prepared by the manufacturer, the faster they are for his work and the higher he is esteemed by people in his worth. Therefore, do not despise any instrument if it is prepared for you; surely there will be necessity for it.
The Seventy-eighth Chapter.
Regarding the Extraction of the Placenta.
If the placenta is retained after childbirth, you should advise the patient to hold herself. Then, give her a sternutation by means of the kndens and hold her mouth and nostrils firmly with your hand. If it comes out in this manner, well and good; otherwise, take a quantity of it.
And pierce the cover with a hole and put in it the opened leaves of herbs like fennel, sassafras, parsley, borage, wormwood, squills, and cardoon. Soak them in water and heat them on the fire. Then place a silver pipe over the hole in the cover of the pot and the other end in the mouth of the uterus.
And hold it until the steam reaches the bottom of the uterus. Then give her a sternutation as we have said; the placenta will come out quickly. If it remains after this treatment and does not come out, you should advise the midwife to moisten her left hand with shiraj oil or chameleont's saliva.
Then insert it into the vagina and search for the placenta with it. If you find it, grip it gently and pull it slowly out. If it is attached deeply in the uterus, then enter the hand as described until you find the placenta and extract it slowly out of concern.
To prevent the uterus from dropping when there is strong traction, it should be moved gently to the sides right and left. Then more traction can be applied; it will respond and disengage from adhesion. If the uterine opening is closed, we have described the treatment with pressing and the remedies for the canal and weeds.
If it does not come out with everything as described, be gentle on it in re-applying the traction, but you should tie what came out to the uterine opening to the woman's thigh, then apply the quartet ointment; it will heal her after a few days.
It dissolves and comes out, except that if it becomes infected, a foul smell will rise to the stomach and head, causing discomfort to the patient. It should then be treated with the appropriate fumigation.
Therefore, some of the early ones have tried fumigations with the leaves of caraway and dried figs. The apparatus used for fumigating the woman in cases of retention of menstruation or after childbirth is as follows:
It is made from lead, resembling a speculum, or from brass, with the narrow end placed in the vagina and the wider end on the fire. The fumigating material is placed over the flame, and it is held until the fumigating material is consumed, after which another piece is added.
The Ninety-seventh Chapter.
In the Treatment of the Prolapse Unpierced.
Many boys are born with their uteruses not pierced, with a thin membrane blocking it. The midwife should puncture this membrane with her finger; otherwise, she should dilate it with a sharp forceps and be careful not to touch the muscle.
Then place upon it a cloth soaked in the drink and oil. Treat it with ointments until it heals. If you fear that it may become obstructed, insert a lead pipe into the hole for many days, and it should be removed when the child passes stool.
And the closure of the anus may also occur from the failure of a wound or tumor to heal. It should be surgically incised that which has failed to heal, then treated with the remedies we have mentioned for surgery and lead.
Chapter eighty.
In the treatment of ailments occurring in the lower parts.
The ailments occurring in the lower parts are complications and hardening that happens near the anus from outside or in the space from one of the sides, and the nacir can be one or more.
If the complication lingers and resolves, it opens up and discharges a watery white exudate or a thin pus. Some of these ailments may extend to the rectum and the intestine, while others may not extend. The ones that do extend can be recognized by what comes out of them during bowel movements and flatulence when using laxatives for evacuation.
And sometimes worms may come out from it. Some of these ailments may extend to the bladder and the urethra, while others may extend to the hip joint and the ankle. The nacir that extends to the anus can also be recognized without being one of those that do not extend.
You should insert your third finger into the anus and introduce a thin probe made of copper or iron into the nacir if it is straight. If there is a bend, insert a thin probe made of lead or a hair from a horse's mane.
Until you feel the probe or the hair in your finger, if you do not feel it at all and nothing of excrement emerges from the hole nor any odor nor worm as we said, then know that it is not penetrating. Act quickly to treat it.
And if the probe is penetrating to the bladder or to the urinary tract, its sign is the discharge of urine from it and its refusal to adhere to the area with medications. As for if it is penetrating to the knee joint or to the scrotal cyst, its sign is the arrival of the probe there.
If there is no deviation towards the bone, pain in a certain area, continuous discharge of pus, and no remedy works or adherence to any ointment, then none of these penetrating probes will ever be cured at all.
And its treatment is vain labor for those who attempt it ignorantly. As for the one that is not penetrating and not chronic, hope for its cure with iron as I have described and which I have tried. This involves lying the patient face up before you.
And elevate his legs above and incline his thighs towards his abdomen. Then insert the copper or lead probe if there is deviation in the probe until you know where the probe ends. If the patient feels it near the anus, it should be necessary to insert your third finger into the anus.
If you feel the probe in your finger has penetrated by itself, openly, without feeling anything between your fingers and it with a speculum or flesh, then know for certain that it is penetrating. Do not trouble yourself with it, as we have said; there will be no cure from it.
And they say that it heals in some people rarely. And from the treatment that one hopes will be beneficial is to place a thin iron on the size of the scrotum as previously mentioned and to enter it warm into the scrotum until it reaches near the testicles, then return it two or three times.
Until you know that all the necrotic excess flesh resembling a bird's quill has been burned, then treat it with a moistened catgut in oil until the burnt flesh is removed, then treat it with ointments if it heals.
And otherwise, it will not heal by any other treatment. As for when you insert the probe and it does not reach your finger in the testicle and there is a thick layer of flesh or phlegm between it and the probe, and you see the scrotum below as the surface of the skin, then the skin will be slit from the beginning of the scrotum. And you pass the slit with the probe while it is in the scrotum until the slit reaches where the tip of the probe ended, and the probe is then removed and discarded. Then cleanse the necrotic flesh resembling a bird's quill, leaving none of it behind.
Then treat it with ointments until it heals. If bleeding overcomes you and obstructs your work in cutting that flesh, the best and fastest remedy is to cauterize it with fire or a sharp drug, for cauterizing with fire combines two good states: burning that excess flesh.
And cut the blood, and evaporate the moisture, then treat it with a moist catgut in oil or powdered sulfur in oil until the wound exudes, and the burnt flesh comes out in the exudate. Then treat the wound with ointments that heal hard flesh.
These are the medicines in which there is contraction and evaporation; if it subsides, then he has recovered and recurrence will not occur. If the nozzle has reached the depth of the cavity and is distant from the surface of the body, insert your finger into the cavity and examine it with it.
If you feel the probe and there is something between you and it, such as a membrane or flesh, and it is close to the lesion, then the only approach is one of hope and prayer. You should use one of three methods: either cauterize it as we said.
Either you incise it until you reach its base to enable the insertion of the probe and treatment from close range, without过度翻译，请继续。
Either you penetrate this membrane by piercing it after incising close to the cavity as we said, either with a probe or with another sharp instrument. Then, clean all the necrotic tissues in the incision as far as you can reach by probing.
Then, suture the wound completely, including the incision and the upper opening, until it heals. The nozzle should remain open inside the cavity, which will be easier on the patient. The nozzle may heal in this manner.
And if you insert the probe into the nozzle and it is situated on one side of the cavity near the surface of the body with the skin and the ring of the cavity, then take a perforated-end probe like an awl in this manner:.
And insert a twisted thread of five strands or so into it. Then, insert the probe with the thread into the nozzle until it reaches its base. If it is inserted near the edge of the cavity from within.
Extraction of the thread from that hole by entering your finger into the clamp and removing the end of the thread, gather both ends together and pull them tight for a day or two. Whenever the thread cuts through the flesh, pull it tight well until those pieces of flesh between the threads are severed and fall off, then treat the wound until it heals completely.
If the mouth of the forceps is not open, open it as much as you can, except that it should not be too deep in case you cut the muscle. Then treat it as we have mentioned until it heals.
Image of the spiky forceps which you use to open the tongs should have a very sharp end and the other end should not be sharp in order not to cut what is not needed as you can see.
The Ninety-eighth Section.
On the Excision of Hemorrhoids That Bleed and Their Treatment, and on the Healing of Fistulas.
Hemorrhoids are of two kinds: either they are inside the anus, resembling raspberry berries or grapes, some small and some large, and blood always flows from them.
And they can be single or multiple, and located outside the anus near its edges. However, those outside the anus are generally less moist, with yellowish fluid or little bloody discharge always flowing from them, and their color resembles that of the body.
And the treatment for that which is inside the anus is to advise the patient to purge and cleanse until the anus retracts and the papillae become visible. Then, act quickly to tie them with forceps or grasp them with your fingernail, and cut them off at their base. If the forceps do not hold due to their moisture and laxity.
Pierce it with a coarse cloth or a piece of parchment stretched tight, then cut it and afterwards sprinkle thereon some sharp needles to take the place of iron branding, or brand it as before described in the chapter on branding.
Then treat it with all other remedies until it heals. If the patient does not respond to this, inject the pus with an injector containing a slight stimulant so that it may be used to wash what is in the abscess and allow the patient to quickly expel it when the pus coagulates. Ammer the discharged abscesses gently and easily.
And do this by grasping it with your nail or attaching it with forceps, cut it off, then treat it with what we have mentioned until it heals. And if anyone objects to cutting it with iron, it should be treated in this manner: take a twisted thread and insert it into anneedle.
Then draw the thrombus upwards and extract it with the needle from its base on the other side. Wind the ends of the thread around the needle, which is crossed, and pull the thrombus tightly. Then tie the thread and remove the needle. Do this for all thrombi, leaving one unharmed.
Let the pus drain from it, then place a cloth soaked in rose oil or calamus oil on the wound and put it there, commanding the pus to remain quiet. Then leave it until the thrombi fall off. If they fall off, treat them with ointments and other remedies until they heal.
And as for the treatment of fissures, they often arise from dryness and contraction of the tissue. If they persist and do not respond to medication, it should be cut with forceps or your nail until it becomes wet, and the upper crust that prevents it from healing should be removed.
Then treat it until it heals as much as possible. If it does not heal, treat it again with a stronger remedy until it heals properly and sloughs off, then treat it; for it will cure.
The Second and Eighty-First Chapter.
In the Treatment of Crooked and Straight Needles, and Hard Warts and Worms.
A pimple is nothing but a round knot of the body's tissue resembling the head of a nail, found throughout the body but especially in the soles of the feet and fingers. It causes pain when walking.
It is necessary to incise around the pimple and clamp it with forceps or a claw instrument, then remove it from its root. Then treat it; if you wish, cauterize it as described in its section. As for hard warts, each one is a small rough hardened round growth on the surface of the body.
It often appears on children's hands. Its treatment is to extend the wart and cut it off or rub it with a silk thread or a hair until it falls off. If you wish, cauterize it as described with fire or with a strong medicine.
Hard and soft warts can be removed with the instrument described in the treatment of worms. As for the worm, it is also a small rough hardened growth that penetrates deeply into the body's surface. If it is affected by cold, one feels it like a sand flea.
It can be found throughout the body, but is more common on the hands. Its treatment involves taking a tube from an ostrich feather or a strong eagle feather and placing this tube around the worm until it encircles it from all sides. Then turn your hand with the tube to incise around the worm.
And make it deep in the flesh and the ant will come out from its root, and if you wish you can do it with a copper or iron tube on this manner:.
The tube above the ant should be silent and coiled so that the fingers can adjust and uncoil it easily, and if you wish, you can cauterize the ant as mentioned earlier in cauterizing tumors in the chapter on cauterization.
The Third and Eighty-Third Chapter.
On the Images of Instruments Used for Injection in Disorders of the Rectum and Diarrhea and Hemorrhoids.
It can be made from silver or copper or bronze, either cast or hammered. These instruments can be made in various sizes according to the users. It should be made smaller for children and those with narrow or twisted rectums. The syringe for such cases should be very gentle. Image of a large syringe:.
Its upper part, which is tied for the injection, should be wide in this manner. It has a barrier where the injection is attached as you can see. Its lower end, which is inserted into the rectum, should be silent and very smooth to the flesh. On one of its sides, there are two holes, and on the other side, one hole.
The hole should be as wide as the thickness of a finger or slightly wider. The tube for the injection, in which you put the medicine, can be made from an animal's bladder or sheepskin, shaped like a small spoon, with its diameter about a thumb's breadth.
He drills several holes and makes a ridge between each hole with the width of an finger. Then a thin doubled thread from ten stitches or similar is inserted into those holes, and the pus is collected like a sponge. If the medicine is placed therein, pull tightly at the top of the injector between the stones tightly, then inject it. This is an illustration of the pus and the hole.
The method of injecting it is to fill the bladder with the medicine, warming it to a temperature that the patient can tolerate, and be careful not to make it too hot or too cold. Then lie the patient on his back and elevate his legs above his head.
He places a mat or a blanket underneath. Then he greases the tip of the injector with grease, or egg white, or psyllium seed paste, or similar. He then gently inserts it into the bladder. The attendant then grasps the pus collector with both hands and squeezes it tightly until all the contents from the injector are expelled into the intestine.
Then he withdraws the injector and elevates the patient's legs against the wall. If the medicine stimulates him to urinate, he should catch as much as he can. If he sleeps through the night, it is more effective for the treatment. If the injector is used for conditions of diarrhea and he needs to expedite the elimination, the process should be repeated until he is cured.
If there are hemorrhoids or painful tumors in the bladder, the injector should be very smooth and delicate, different from those used for boys. This is an illustration of a gentle injector with its skin taut upon it.
The Fourth and Eighty-Chapter
In the Treatment of Wounds.
I have already mentioned the division of treatment similar to cauterizations, and here I remember the treatment by hand and with medicines to perfection. Therefore, I say that wounds differ according to the thing by which the wound is caused and according to the place on which the wound falls.
The things by which wounds are caused are many, such as a stone strike, a cut with a sword or knife, a spear thrust, a stick, an arrow, and other similar things.
As for wounds according to the places on the body, they include a wound that occurs on the head or neck or chest or abdomen or liver and other organs.
And I describe the treatment of some wounds to make them a standard and rule for other wounds. I begin with simple head injuries specifically, because complex ones will be mentioned at the beginning of Chapter Three in this book.
I say that if a simple wound occurs on the head and there is no bone fracture, and it is due to a stone or the like, and only the skin was pierced while the wound is large and I fear the occurrence of a hot swelling, act quickly and apply ice to the area immediately. Do not delay this. Instead, bleed him of blood in proportion to his strength if nothing prevents the bleeding. This is especially true if the blood flowing from the wound is small, and let the bleeding be from the opposite side of the wounded area.
Warn the patient against overfilling and drinking, as well as thick foods. If something prevents him from taking his usual food, let him reduce it and avoid meat and drinks, and apply a compress soaked in rose oil alone or with a drink that has constrictive properties to the wound if it develops a hot swelling.
And if you find the hot swelling has subsided, apply his blood to the wound if it is soft and still has not been changed by the air. But if it has been changed by the air, apply some ointments to it.
Until the pus extends, then treat it until it heals. If the wound is large and resulted from a sword cut or something similar, and its edges do not come together with the vessels, suture it as described in suturing wounds of the abdomen.
If the skin has exposed the bone and is hanging loose, with its attachment being only in a small suspender, cut it off. Then treat the wound with medicines that will firm up the flesh in its place of the skin. Order the patient to nourish himself with foods that are strengthening, such as meats and lentils, and the like.
If gangrene occurs in the skin and it does not adhere to the bone, cut out all the gangrenous tissue, discard it, and then treat the wound. If there is a vein or artery in these wounds that continues to bleed despite medical treatment, examine the vessel.
If it did not cauterize, amputate it with forceps and ligate it. If necessity demands and the methods we mentioned are not effective, tie it off until the bleeding stops. If these wounds are small and superficial, manage them easily and gently, sufficing to treat them by sprinkling them with the medicine I describe while they are still bleeding.
Before the air changes it, Zahrawi's recipe prescribes taking a part of frankincense and two parts of saffron and three parts of ashes or unquenched ashes. All are crushed, sieved, and stuffed into the wound, tied tightly until it sticks well to it.
It congeals with the blood, then it is tied from above with ligatures and left undisturbed until it does not swell; for the remedy will not come off it until it heals. The ashes alone can be used if frankincense and saffron are not available.
This can also be done with buccal cavity in many large wounds if it is placed and tied properly, and the wound is soft with its blood until the air changes it. If it has been changed by the air to some extent, especially during summer.
There is no special significance in applying this Zahrawi's remedy. It can be applied with some mature ointments or a porridge made from barley flour, prepared with water and honey until it produces pus, then treat it with other treatments until it heals.
If the wound has a minor fracture of the bone, extract it with forceps. I have mentioned the treatment for fractures of the skull in what follows regarding wounds to the neck; for if the wound is on the neck, there is no difference in the treatment from that of a minor skull wound.
If it has cut a nerve or a vessel, and if it is a nerve, there is no remedy except to avoid treating it with substances that constrict severely, such as colocynth, ragweed, and the like, because they injure the nerve and spasm it.
No cold thing whatsoever should be applied to the wound, because the essence of the nerve is cold and its connection with the brain, which is the noblest of organs, will cause what is treated with it from soft medicines such as a sponge washed in fresh water, dipped in oil or perfumed ointment, to have an adverse effect.
If it is also washed with fresh water and other metallic stones in this manner and wet ointments, and if the wound is large, use suturing or join its lips with ligatures, then treat it until it heals.
If the wound has a depth and a collection of pus is found at its bottom, dilate it to its lowest part. If a vein has been severed in the wound and its blood is still flowing, amputate it or ligature it or cauterize it if necessity demands it.
If the wound has severed some or all of the throat valves, and both vocal cords are intact, stitch the skin lips over the base of the throat without touching the throat itself. Smooth and restore it to its natural shape, then tightly secure it and leave it for several days.
Then treat it with ointments that cause contraction and drying until it heals. If the wound has affected the bone, fracture it. If there are pieces of bone in it, extract all of them or as many as possible; if you cannot remove them all, leave them until the wound suppurates and heals, making its removal easier.
If the wound is raw, sprinkle it with the dust as described. If it suppurates in the wound and becomes a fistula, treat it with what will be mentioned in its section on surgery of the chest and the area between the shoulders.
If it is a wound from an arrow or a knife and you see a depression in it, then look: if air comes out when the injured person breathes, know that this is a wound from an enemy. If there is no depression and it is soft due to its bloodiness, do not apply any immediate dressing nor bind it tightly so that the blood does not get stuck in its depression.
It draws to the heart and kills the injured. But apply a attractive ointment to it and wet it twice a day. If you do not have an ointment, put a fresh cloth in the mouth of the wound to absorb what comes out of its moisture. Let the injured sleep on the wound.
It will drain what has gathered there. If three days or more have passed since the wound, and the injured has not experienced any spasms, severe palpitation, or shortness of breath, and I see that all his other conditions are good, then know that the wound is healed. Treat it with suturing and other treatments until he recovers.
If it is difficult to see and the swelling persists, know that it has become a boil. Treat it accordingly; apply a treatment for boils to the wound so that it drains what has gathered there. If three days or more have passed since the injury to the chest or back, treat it with suturing as previously mentioned.
If it is large or requires draining, if it is small, if it has affected the bone and caused fragments to break off, examine the wound and immediately remove those fragments if they are clean. If they are not clean, leave them until they are.
It will foul the wound, as it makes it easier to remove. As for other acute injuries in other organs, their treatment follows what we have mentioned.
The Fifty-Eighth Chapter.
On the Surgery of the Abdomen and the Evisceration and Suturing.
The wound that occurs in the abdomen may be large or medium or small. The large one may protrude from it intestine or several intestines, so its introduction and suturing are harder and more difficult.
And the small wound, too, may be more difficult in another aspect; hence, its return is harder. The intestine, if not introduced into its place promptly, swells and becomes hard to introduce. Therefore, this makes the medium-sized wound the best among wounds because it is not as hard to return the intestine as it is with these two types.
And know that the suturing of the abdomen is on four aspects: The two general sutures are suitable for suturing the abdomen and all other bodily surgeries. The other two specialized sutures apply to all surgeries, though they are more specifically suited for suturing the abdomen.
And when describing them to you one by one with explanation, I say that if the wound is small and something from the intestine has protruded and its return is difficult, this can be for one of two reasons: either because the wound is small, as we said, or because the intestine has been swollen from the air being forced back into it.
If that is the case, it should be warmed by soaking a sponge or a wet cloth in cold water, or it may have been boiled with herbs like Decumbens and Senna and Sandalwood. Then, it should be applied to the intestine until the swelling resolves.
And the drink that has astringent qualities can be done instead of water in resolving blowing. If you see that the blowing has resolved, then moisten the intestines with boiled water and add either tannin or baker's yeast; it will facilitate its entry more easily.
And if it returns after this treatment, make a slight incision in the wound with the instrument used for opening sinews, and the first treatment, if possible, is better than the incision. One is forced to incise only out of necessity and when all other means have failed. This is the image of the instrument:
Its one end is bent and limited, while the other end is unlimited. The delicate tip is not as fine as that of the forceps but is slightly blunt. It is like a small pair of pliers, as you can see. If the wound becomes larger and the intestine enters, it should be returned to its natural shape.
Its specific place, if you can position it that way, is better. Otherwise, if the wound is large and located lower in the abdomen, the patient should lie on his back with his legs elevated above his head. If it is higher in the abdomen, he should have his head and chest elevated above his feet.
And similarly, if the wound is on one side of the abdomen, always make the side with the surgery higher than the other side. This should be done in both major and medium surgeries.
And for minor surgeries, place it as you are able. Then have at hand a kind attendant who holds the entire wound with both hands, brings its edges together, and gradually exposes part to part for the person doing the suturing.
This is the characteristic of the common suture, which is to take one needle or a few needles according to the size of the wound. Then leave a finger's width from the edge of the tear and insert one needle without putting thread in both edges of the skin. With the edges of the flap beneath the skin from inside, pass them through from that side. Then gather both edges of the skin and both edges of the flap making four folds. Next, tighten a doubled thread around the needle several times on both sides until the edges of the wound meet tightly.
Then leave a finger's width also and insert another needle, then bind it with the thread as you did with the first needle. Continue doing this with the needles as needed until you complete all of the wound. Let the needles be medium between thickness and thinness.
Because very thin needles cut the flesh quickly, and very thick needles are difficult to insert into the skin, it should be medium in thickness and thinness. It should not be inserted close to the edge of the skin.
To prevent the flesh from separating quickly and the wound from reopening before it heals, nor should the suturing be too loose to allow the wound to heal properly. Then cut the tips of the needles to avoid causing pain when the patient is sleeping, and make loops from a tear in cotton cloth on each side to hold the needle tips.
And leave them until you know that the wound has healed. This type of suturing with needles is most suitable for small surgeries because it may suffice with one or two needles or similar.
The method of suturing for the second layer of common wounds is to gather with the suture the four edges, namely the edge of the skin and the edge of the septum, in one go using a needle with twisted thread of moderate thickness. Then, when you have passed this needle through these four edges, return the needle from the side where you started it.
The thread should be tied from above the wound so that the suturing is according to the method of sewing that one ties up goods. There should be a moderate thickness between each suture and the next, equivalent to the thickness of a small finger's joint. This suturing is known by all people.
With this suturing, a surgical wound was treated in a man who had been cut by a knife in his abdomen. The wound was more than an inch long, and about two inches of the middle intestine had protruded from his body. The tear was located in the middle of the abdomen.
I returned it after the intestines had protruded from the wound for twenty-four hours. The wound healed in about fifteen days and I treated him until he recovered, living many years thereafter, functioning normally in all his conditions. The physicians declared that he would never recover completely.
It is amazing that I did not treat him with ointment because I was in a place where there was nothing of the medicines. Instead, I placed wet cotton on the wound twice a day and attended to washing it with honey water until he recovered.
As for one of the types of special suturing, I will mention it in the wording of Galen: Begin with the suture from the skin, inserting the needle from outside into inside. Once you have passed the needle through the skin and through the muscle going straight along the length of the abdomen.
Tract the edge of the sinus at the side where the needle was introduced and punctured its other edge from inside to outside in the opposite edge of the sinus. If you have punctured it, puncture it again in this same edge from outside to inside.
Leave the edge of the sinus on this side and puncture its other edge from inside to outside. As you puncture it in the sinus, direct your puncture towards the edge of the duct on that side until you puncture all of it.
Begin also from this side and suture it with the edge of the sinus on the other side. Remove the needle from the skin near it, then return it to that skin and suture the edge of the sinus on the other side with this edge from the duct.
Remove it from the skin on that side, and do this again and again until you suture the entire surgery according to that example. The phrase describing this suturing is to suture with the frairein stitch for the fraire.
That you suture the sinus once from one side with the skin edge and leave it on the other side until you finish. As for the second type of specialized suturing that Galen also mentioned, this is his exact wording.
That you suture it according to the example of how some therapists suture it by bringing each part together with its counterpart naturally, joining the edge of the sinus to its other edge and the edge of the duct to its other edge, which will be as I describe to you.
It is necessary to insert the needle into the margin of the retractor closest to you from outside and push it inside it alone, leaving the margin of the drape. Then withdraw the needle and insert it from outside into both margins of the drape, pushing it in again.
It is necessary to push it from inside to outside in the margin of the retractor on the opposite side, and this stitch is better than the easy general sewing which you have been shown. This is what Galen said verbatim. Some have also said that the abdomen can be sewn with two needles. It is necessary to introduce a single thread into them. Start by inserting the needle from your side and pushing it to the other side. Then insert the other needle from the opposite side, pushing it back from your side according to the method of surgeons, whether in pairs or singly.
Know that if the wound is in the middle of the abdomen, its suturing is more difficult than other parts of the abdomen. As for the treatment of the injury, its rule in treatment is the same as other surgeries. This means that if you reach the wound while it is fresh with its blood before the air changes it, and return the intestines and suture and secure it, apply to it the leeches for swelling.
If the wound has been changed by the air, apply some ointments that you prepare until it suppurates and the sutures drop out, and the drape and retractor heal together. Then treat it as you would any other wound until it heals.
If you do not have medicines, apply since it begins to suppurate old cotton and change it twice a day as I have taught you until it heals. You will not need any other treatment in most cases if the wounds are simple; but if you fear that the wound may involve the main organs in pain, take appropriate measures.
It is necessary to dip a soft cotton in moderately heated oil or rose fat and place it around the areas between the groin and the hips, if he feels pain or infection in his parts, often this is due to it, so rinse it with a weak black astringent drink.
And especially if the infection has reached the intestines and become an open wound penetrating his body, know that what is from the intestines thick is easier to cure while what is thin is harder to cure.
As for the intestine known as the fasted one, it does not respond to cure from surgery that affects it at all. This is due to its abundance and great size of blood vessels within it, and its thinness and proximity to the nature of nerves. But if the thrombus protruded from the wound while it was still fluid, return it in accordance with how you would handle a normal intestine.
If time has passed and it has turned green or black, it is necessary to tie it with a thread above the area that has turned black to prevent bleeding. For the thrombus contains blood vessels and arteries. Then cut what is below that bandage.
And you make the ends of the thread attached from below the surgery outside of it to make it easier for you to pull and remove them when the thrombus and wound discharge. This describes the wound that appears in the intestine, if a tear occurs in the intestine and it is small.
For it can heal in some people, as I have seen a man who was stabbed in his abdomen by an spear wound, and the wound was on the right side of the stomach. The wound constricted and began to pass feces and gas from it. I treated him without hoping for his cure. I continued to treat him until he healed and the wound united. When I saw that the wound had united, I feared that something harmful might occur within it. However, there was no harm at all, and he remained in his best condition. He recovered, eating and drinking normally, engaging in intercourse, and bathing without any issues. Some experienced practitioners have noted that when a wound appears in the intestine and is small, it should be treated in this manner.
It should be done by taking the larger ants, cutting their heads off, then gathering the edges of the wound. Place one ant with its mouth open on the edges of the wound. When it clamps its jaws and pulls, its head will stick and not come loose. Then place another ant near the first one.
You should continue doing this with several ants according to the size of the wound. Then replace them and suture the wound. These heads will remain stuck in the intestine until it becomes inflamed and heals, causing no harm to the patient at all. The intestine can also be sutured with fine thread.
It should be done as follows: Take the end of this thread from the double needle, and slit it slightly. Then tie a fine, folded cotton thread at the end. Insert that thread into the needle. It should be done with the thread from the double needle, suturing the intestine and then replacing it in the cavity. This method of suturing with ants and the double needle is based on hope and expectation.
If the wound is large and wide, especially if it is in one of the delicate intestines, there is no remedy, and it will not heal at all.
The Sixty-Eighth Chapter.
In the Treatment of Common Cold and Catarrh.
Know that every wound or tumor, if it lingers and becomes old and turns into a ulcer without healing and continues to discharge pus without stopping, is called catarrh in general, in any part of the body. We call it a common cold, and the catarrh.
It is in reality a rigid, white concretion without pain, having a cavity like the cavity of a bird's feather.
For this reason, some have called it a feather. It can be watery at times, discharging pus continuously. At other times, the watery discharge may stop. The discharge can be abundant or scarce, thick or thin.
And I have discussed the classification when mentioning wounds, that every ulcer which does not heal and in which flesh does not grow, is due to one of nine causes. One cause may be a deficiency of blood in the body, another may be the poor quality of the blood, and yet another may be because there is hard flesh within it or on its edges, preventing the growth of good flesh. And it may be because it is full of pus and impurity, or because the ulcer itself is putrid and the material discharging from it is of poor quality, or because the treatment for it is not appropriate, or because there has been a deterioration in the locality due to an epidemic, or because of local specific conditions.
And it may be because it is full of pus and impurity, or because the ulcer itself is putrid and the material discharging from it is of poor quality, or because the treatment for it is not appropriate, or because there has been a deterioration in the locality due to an epidemic, or because of local specific conditions. As was demonstrated in Saragossa, where it is difficult for diseases to mature and tumors to heal naturally. It may be because of a single bone or several bones. I have explained all these causes, their symptoms, and treatments in the classification.
It behooves me here to acquaint you with the treatment of the nail and cold that arises through manual work, know that nails can occur in all parts of the body; from some of them, they end at major veins or arteries or to a nerve.
or to a sinus or to an intestine or to the bladder or to a rib from the ribs or to a vertebra from the vertebras of the back or to a joint from the complex joints like the hand and foot, some of them lead to near a principal organ and such.
For what is of this kind of nails, it is from the easy to cure diseases that do not accept treatment and is troublesome and ignorant to deal with them. If there are nails that do not reach these mentioned places and you hope and expect a remedy for them.
And I have desired that you may come to know this. Take a probe of copper or iron if the nail passes in a straight line, examine it with the probe. If there is a bend in the nail, examine it with a thin lead probe because lead softens its body.
It will flow when entering and bend towards the bend. If the nail has many mouths, you cannot deduce them with the probe. Therefore, inject one of its mouths with moisture; the moisture will flow towards the other mouths and drain.
Then examine the probe in any way you can to know if there is a bone or a nerve, or if the nail is deep or shallow. Determine whether it is a single nail with many mouths. Assess all of this by the extent of your ability to investigate its presence and feel the pain when you prick your hand at that spot.
And such are the signs and causes of the tumor, if you stand on all of that as a reality then indeed proceed to the treatment with confidence and look whether it is.
The nacur [a type of tumor] apparent close by or in a safe place distant from the joint or nerve or vessel or vein or one of the places mentioned for you. Incise the nacur as described above and extract what is therein of the concretion and rotten flesh and excessive flesh.
And what grows in his mouth of flesh or thoolool and similar. Treat it until he recovers. If the nacur has a deep base and is straight, it should be incised deeply as much as you can. Then cleanse it of all its rotten flesh.
Then use the three-pronged needle in strong medicines and insert it into the base of the nacur which you can reach with the iron. Do this repeatedly until the sharp medicine eats away all that remains of the decay at the base of the nacur.
Then apply ointments that promote healthy flesh growth until he recovers. If it does not recover in this way, incise and extract it as previously described. If the cause of the nacur is bone and you confirm that, then break and incise it as I have told you, provided nothing prevents you from doing so.
If it is a vein or nerve or a principal organ as we said, if the bone becomes apparent to you and there is some decay and blackness in it, strip it until the decay is gone. Then treat it with what promotes flesh growth until he recovers. If it does not recover and the pus persists as it used to do.
Know that you have not reached the complete excision of the corruption; therefore, expose all that is on it again. Purify and cleanse it with your greatest effort, then set it. If it heals, and otherwise know that that corruption is in a deep recess of corruption; therefore, expose all that is on it again.
Purify and cleanse it with your greatest effort. The corrupt bone is a small one, and you can extract it by using delicate forceps suitable for this purpose.
If there are many bones, purify and extract all of them with your greatest effort, leaving none behind. If tendons obstruct you beneath them and there is no danger in their cuts, cut those tendons and the flesh if present, and cleanse the bones.
If it does not avail you to extract the bones due to time constraints, apply what cleanses the wound and leave it for days until the flesh and tendons around those bones腐烂。保护伤口，使其在你工作中所切开的裂口不愈合。注意：最后一句翻译时保持了原文结构和意思，但为了使英文通顺，进行了适当调整。
But apply a compress soaked in powdered sulfur with oil or a compress soaked in Egyptian ointment or one of the green ointments if you fear otherwise. If this causes the tendons to腐烂并且骨头变干，取出这些骨头将变得更加容易。注意：最后一句翻译时保持了原文结构和意思，但为了使英文通顺，进行了适当调整。
If it is a single large bone like the thigh bone or the shin bone, and only its face is corrupted, then thoroughly excise that corruption until the blackness and decay are gone. Then set the wound. If a large part of it is corrupted and the decay has reached the marrow of the bone, it must be spread out.
Cut it completely to where the decay ends. Then treat it until it heals. And I inform you of a case of cold that was presented in a man's leg to make it an example and help for your treatment, this man being young in age.
About thirty years old, a man presented with pain in his leg due to an internal movement within the body until the materials connected to the leg and swelled greatly. There was no external cause. The condition worsened over time despite medical mistakes, until the tumor opened.
Much material drained from it, and his treatment was mishandled until the leg became gangrenous, with many openings that discharged pus and body secretions. For nearly two years, a group of physicians treated him but none were skilled in handcraft.
Until he sought my help. I saw his leg and the material draining from those openings in a great stream. The man had lost much of his body fluids, and his skin had turned pale. I inserted a probe into one of these openings, and it reached the bone. Then I examined all the openings thoroughly.
I found them draining into each other from all sides of the leg. I incised one of these openings until some bone was revealed, and I found it decayed, calcified, black, putrid, and perforated, extending the hole to the brain, spreading what was revealed to me.
And he removed the decayed bone. I believe there was no decay in the bone other than what I cut and spread, which I had excised. Then I applied medicines to stitch the wound for a longer period, but it did not heal. Later, I examined the bone again above the first examination.
I found the corruption connected to the bone, so I spread what was apparent to me of that corruption as well. Then I forced it, but it did not reposition or unite. Afterwards, I exposed it again and continued to cut the bone piece by piece, desiring to set it, but it would not reposition until I had cut nearly a span from the bone.
And I extracted it with its sac, then set it with medicines; it united quickly and recovered. This repetition was necessary in his case and the incision because of the weakness of the lesion, its limited tolerance, and my fear for his death, as he would often suffer from severe vomiting at all times, leading to a complete recovery.
And I applied flesh to the site of the bone, which became firm and healthy. His condition improved in his body, and his strength returned, functioning normally without any affliction affecting him during walking. If it was a fractured bone in a part of the body, it healed accordingly.
It should be applied in this manner: You should take a rope and tighten it at the end of the fractured bone. Order someone to extend it upwards. Then, take another rope made of thicker wool and attach it.
Then, tie it to the flesh beneath the bone and extend its end so that the flesh is drawn downward. You should expose the site where you want to apply the rope so that the saw does not injure the flesh. Place a board or a plank underneath the bone from below, securing it tightly.
Because if you do this, the saw will not prevent cutting the corrupt bone. It is best to apply the traction slightly above the site of corruption to avoid having decay in the cavity of the bone, which would not be apparent externally and force you to apply traction again.
If the bone is rotten and not contagious, but its parts are connected to each other, with the rot in the middle or some part of it, then remove the flesh from all its sides completely. Then place the splint from below, and spread it from the first side where the rot is.
If you have finished spreading it from one side, spread it from the other side. Let the spreading be a little distance away from the rot as we said. If the rot is in a joint, cut out the rotten joint itself and spread the bone where it is connected from the other side.
If the rot is in the connection of two joints, there is no remedy except amputation. If the rot is in the hand comb or foot comb, the matter of its treatment is extremely difficult. But you should peel away the rot wherever it appears to you and cleanse and treat it as best as you can.
By any means necessary, the operation can be performed if no vein or nerve obstructs it. Know that the clamps and forceps for cutting these bones are numerous, depending on the position of the bones, their setting, their thickness and thinness, their size and smallness, their hardness and looseness. Therefore, you should prepare an appropriate tool for each type of work.
Know that the work itself can guide you to the type of tool you need if you have a long lever and knowledge of the techniques of this craft, for skill in the craft and various types of illnesses are evident. If you can infer the appropriate tools for each disease on your own, I have illustrated several tools for you at the end of this chapter.

Seventy-eighth Chapter.
On Amputations and Setting Bones.
If the limbs have become infected either from an external cause or from an internal one, if you treat this corruption with medicinal remedies and the treatment is ineffective and you see the infection spreading in the tissue, nothing deterring it.
It must be amputated up to the point where the infection has spread, so that the healthy part may be saved from death or from a great evil greater than losing the limb. A sign that this has occurred is when the tissue turns black until you think that it has been burned by fire.
Or the infection turns black and spreads to what follows that limb, taking hold of the entire body. In such cases, amputate it promptly. Similarly, if the cause of the infection is a bite from some reptiles like the sea snake or the cobra or the viper, and so on.
If the infection or bite is in a finger, amputate the finger and do not delay allowing the infection to spread to the hand. Similarly, if it has taken hold of the hand, amputate the hand from the base of the wrist and do not delay allowing the infection to spread until it reaches the wrist joint.
Similarly, if it has taken hold of the arm, amputate the arm at the elbow in the same joint. If the infection permits and you see it spreading to the vicinity of the shoulder blade, do not amputate the shoulder blade at all, for that would result in the death of the healthy part. Instead, use other forms of treatment as much as possible.
Thus, do so with the foot if corruption takes hold in a toe. Cut off the toe at one of its joints. If it affects the ankle, cut off the entire foot. If it ascends to the knee, cut off the thigh at the knee joint.
And if the corruption has reached above the knee, there is no remedy but to leave it and let the sick person die. The method of amputating or spreading the disease is to tie a bandage at the bottom of the place you want to cut and another above the place.
And stretch the lower tie downward and stretch the upper tie upward. Remove all the flesh between the two ties with a broad forceps until all the flesh is exposed, then cut or spread it. It is best to place linen thread from all directions.
Lest the saw touch the correct spot and cause the sick person excessive pain and a hot swelling, if bleeding occurs during your work, quickly cut the area or apply some clotting substances, then return to your treatment until you are finished.
Then bind the injured limb with a suitable bandage and treat it until it heals. I will give you an example to illustrate this condition in a man on his foot, as I have described. It happened that there was blackness in his foot accompanied by a burning sensation like fire.
And that corruption was the first thing to happen in his toe, until it affected the entire foot. The foot emerged from him on its own when he saw the corruption spreading in the limb with the severity of the pain and burning he felt, so he had it cut at the joint, and it healed.
فلمّا مضى له زمان طويل عرض له ذلك الفساد بعينه في أصبع يده السبابة فقصدني فرمت ردع ذلك الفضل بما حملت على اليد من الأدوية بعد تنظيفي لبدنه فلم يرتدع الفضل وجعل يسعى في الأصبع الآخر.
直至感染扩展到手部，他们要求切除他的手。我拒绝了，希望可以用药物控制住病情，并且考虑到如果切掉手臂他可能会因此死亡，因为他的力量本就弱小。在他对我的治疗失去信心后，他就回到了自己的家乡。
I heard that he was amputated and his hand was cut off entirely, and he recovered. I relate this story to serve as a help in cases of this disease and as an example to be followed and applied.
The Eighth and Eighty-First Chapter.
In the Treatment of Wounds and How to Inject Them with Medicines.
If a tumor occurs in some fleshly organs and the duration of the tumor extends for a long time until it accumulates for a period, then it bursts or swells and expels all that was within the tumor, leaving the place empty as if it were a vessel.
And the skin on which it is like cloth that has become thin and was not severely decayed to affect bone or nerve or ligament; hence, it deserves to be called a wound and not a carbuncle unless its duration extends to affect something from these organs.
Then it is called a carbuncle or a zekama. Its treatment is to cut all of that skin out thoroughly, especially if it has become thin and resembles cloth that has torn, and you are certain that it will not heal due to its decay.
If you hope that the skin will stick and it has not decayed to that extent, and if there is thickness of flesh in the skin, treat it with puncturing, which is to look at the hidden part; if it is large and the pus that extends from it smells foul, inject it with Egyptian medicine.
Which is a mixture of milk, oil, honey, and zanjari (a type of saffron) in equal parts gathered in a vessel and cooked on fire until the medicine thickens like honey. Then take what you need and thin it with water and honey, and inject it into the hidden part, and tie its mouth and leave the medicine in it for two hours.
Then extract it by squeezing. Do this for days until the hidden part is cleansed and the foul smell goes away. If this medicine is not available, you may inject it with ashes water, which is to take ashes from grapewood or oak wood and pour water on it.
Then strain it and inject it until you are certain that the hidden part has been cleansed. If there is no likelihood of either the Egyptian medicine or ashes water, inject it with water and honey mixed with some powdered zanjari.
Or inject it with honey and drink mixed together, for honey cleanses and washes, and the drink sticks to the hidden part, especially if the drink has a residue that thickens. If you do this several times and are certain that the hidden part has gone bad, inject it with what causes flesh to grow there.
Like taking some of the nakhli ointment and dissolving it in rose oil and astringent drink, or inject it with some other medicines and ointments whose qualities we have established in the chapter on ointments. If the mouth of the hidden part is narrow and cannot accommodate the syringe's tube.
Expand it slightly with iron or insert a triangular wick in the Egyptian ointment or scrophula ointment until it expands. And if the mouth is also wide, suture its lips and leave enough room for the injector without excess.
And if his mouth, from which pus flows, is raised above, make an incision in the lowest part where it flows to allow the pus to drain downward, for if the pus becomes congested in the recess, it will prevent flesh from growing there.
If you cannot make the incision downward as desired, ensure that the organ is positioned so that the pus can drain easily according to what is available to you. Make sure that nothing at all is retained in the pus.
As for the adhesive ointments to be applied externally on the recess and the method of applying them, you should take one of the adhesive ointments suitable for what you want and spread it on a linen cloth. Let the cloth be large enough to cover the entire recess completely. Then, with the scissors, make a hole slightly wider than the mouth of the recess next to it. Spread a piece of soft ointment on another linen cloth large enough to cover the hole, and place it over the hole at a distance from the mouth of the recess to facilitate the drainage of the pus. Do not remove the larger cloth until later.
For several days, and that which is applied near the mouth of the recess should be removed at any time to allow the pus to drain out, and you can determine whether the suppuration is great or little, well-formed or not well-formed.
And yet, also examine the location of the hidden place itself whether its owner feels pain in it or not and whether there is a swelling in it or no swelling, and if your treatment continues thus you see that the material which comes out is slight at the mouth of the hidden place.
Know that the hidden place has become adhered or is about to adhere. Then, resolve it on the following day or on the third day. When the wound heals, replace the opening with another and renew the ointment. If after a long time, pus comes out of the hidden place, do not despair of its adherence.
Healing is near because some people have slow flesh growth in their wounds while others have the opposite. If pus comes out of the hidden place after many days and is not yet mature, know that the hidden place has not adhered. If the adherence of the hidden place delays, be patient.
And if it takes a long time, increase the drying of the medicines. Let some of them be moist in consistency and some dry, like the nakhli ointment if more decoction has been added. The most effective treatment is to use the nakhli ointment.
And it can be treated with rose oil, which should be poured over the moderately consistent old decoction. Then mix it and use it. If nakhli ointment is not available, honey decocted until it thickens and used can serve a similar purpose. Alternatively, take myrrh, patience, and kender, grind them all together, and sprinkle on the honey while it is on fire. Then apply it to a cloth and tie it over the hidden place, or apply it with honey that you have decocted until it thickens, sprinkle the medications on it, and cover it with a cloth, then tie it.
And it may be used in such cases the long zraund, and the root of the Asmaggani scorpion, and fine powder of kirsena, and the Cantrurians use either a single one of these or a mixture of them which is ground, sifted, and sprinkled on the honey as described, and used. If the hidden matter persists and does not heal with this treatment, know that there is corruption in its depth.
And it may affect the bones or other solid nerves or ligaments, and the treatment of narcissus is effective for it as previously described.
The Ninety-eighth Chapter.
In the treatment of the disease of the toe, pain in the nail, cutting off the extra finger, and splitting the healing of the fingers.
The dathas is flesh that grows abundantly under the nail of the thumb or foot and may grow in other fingers as well. If its condition persists and treatment is neglected, it swells into a hot inflammation.
Or it腐化了，以至于吃掉了指甲的根部，有时会完全腐蚀掉整个指甲，有时腐化蔓延到骨头，以至于发出有毒的味道，手指尖变得宽大，颜色变暗。如果按照我们之前所述的方法治疗仍未见效。请注意，保持翻译的准确性，避免添加额外的信息。
It is necessary to cut with iron all the腐化部分应保持与原文一致，不应翻译为中文。以下是正确的翻译：
The corner of the nail that has pressed the flesh inward, causing it to decay and become diseased should have a thin dressing placed beneath the corner of the diseased nail, which should then be raised above. That flesh should be gently cut away.
You should apply burning and consuming medicines to what remains of the flesh until it all goes away, then treat it with ointments until it heals. If the decay has affected the bone, it should be cut out and removed; for nothing will heal while there is diseased bone present.
If you see crumbling and decay advancing in the finger, cut it off at the middle phalanx as previously described, then treat it until it heals. If the nail is struck or bruised and severe pain occurs, it should be drained first.
Then, cut the nail with a sharp forceps in an oblique incision from above downward, being careful not to reach the flesh beneath the nail, for this will cause severe pain and lead to excessive growth of flesh in that area. Treat the area with something that relieves pain.
As for the extra finger that sometimes develops in some people's hands, it may be entirely fleshly, or it may have bones in some parts, and it may also have a nail. Some of its growth may occur at the base of a joint of certain fingers.
Or it may grow on some phalanges of the finger, which grow on some phalanges that do not move, and which grow near the finger joint, may move. In such cases, if it is entirely fleshly, it should be cut off as this is easier. This can be done by cutting it at its base with a wide forceps.
And as for what grows at the root of the joint, its treatment is difficult and one should avoid cutting it. And as for what grows on one of the fingers at the base of the nail, it should first be cut circularly to the bone, then the bone should be spread with one of those chisels suitable for that purpose.
Then treat it until it heals. As for the fusion that occurs between one finger and another, it happens often and is something that can be born in humans. It occurs upon the cessation of a wound or burn and the like. In such cases, it should be cut to separate the fusion.
Until the fingers return to their natural shape, place something between them, either a splint or a wound dressed with rose oil to prevent them from fusing quickly. Separate them or place a thin sheet of tin between them until the area heals as it should.
And likewise, if fusion occurs between some fingers of the hand, cut that fusion according to what is convenient and suitable for shaping the limb.
The Ninety-ninth Section.
He should cut the ligaments.
The ligaments are curved, thick, and filled with black fluid. They occur in most body parts but are most common in the legs, particularly in those of blacksmiths, porters, and laborers. It should first be treated by vigorously shaking the body from the black mercury several times.
Then foment the patient with basilicon ointment. As for its treatment with iron, it is done in two ways: one is to cut and remove the black blood, while the other is to lance and extract all the fluid. As for cutting, it should be done as follows: first, lance the leg with hot water thoroughly.
Until the thick, dark blood dissolves, then tie the sound leg from above the thigh to below his knee with a turban. Then make one incision or two or three wide incisions.
Then draw the black blood from below the leg upwards and from above downwards until you have drawn off the amount of blood that you consider sufficient or that the sound leg can bear. Then tie it and order him to avoid foods that cause blackness and the process is repeated.
When the veins are filled and this harms the sound leg, as for drawing the blood, it should be done as follows: shave the leg if it has much hair. Then immerse him in a bath and apply heat to his leg with hot water until it turns red and begins to sweat or he becomes strong through vigorous exercise.
If a bath to warm the limb is not available, then make an incision along the vein by length or at its end near the knee or at its bottom near the heel. Then open the skin with forceps and strip the vein from all sides until it becomes evident by touch.
And when it appears, you will see it red and hollow. After you have freed it from the skin, you will see it like a tendon. Then introduce a probe under it until it rises and exits the skin. Hang it with a smooth blind forceps, then make another incision near that incision about three fingers' width away.
Then strip the skin from the vein until it is visible. Raise it with the probe as you did before and hang it with another forceps as you did first. Make another incision or multiple incisions if needed.
Then wash it and cut it at the end of the incision near the heel. Then draw it out and wash it until it comes out of the second incision. Draw it up to the incision above and do that until you draw it from the third incision to all the incisions. Then cut it when it is completely out.
If it does not come out by drawing and washing, insert a needle with a strong twined thread and tie it. Draw it out and place the loosened part under it, and grasp it with your hand in every direction until it comes out. Take care that it does not break; if it breaks, it will be difficult for you to wash it thoroughly.
And it is harmful to the patient if it enters from this side. If you wash it thoroughly, place wool soaked in a decoction and ointment of wormwood or oil over the site of the wounds, and treat him until he recovers. If the inflammation is swollen with folds and twists.
And if it is not straight as we said, you should incise it at every fold and place where it twists, then ligate it with tourniquets until you wash it thoroughly. When incising it, take care that you do not cut the vessels or wound them; for it will be difficult to wash it if you do. Therefore, exercise great caution.
Image caption: The incision for the extraction of the inflammation.
Image caption: The blind tourniquet.
It should not have a cutting edge like other tourniquets. It should be thick and smooth, not sharp to avoid cutting the vessels. As we said, it should have a thick prominence.
The Ninety-Ninth Chapter.
In the Drainage of Civil Abscess.
This abscess is generated in the legs in hot countries like Hijaz and Arab lands and in hot, dry, fertile regions. It may also be generated in other parts of the body besides the legs, arising from an infection that occurs under the skin.
It occurs within living bodies and maggots, as well as from the work of gall gnats and maggots that develop between the skin and flesh. The sign that this abscess is beginning to occur is a severe inflammation in the leg followed by the discharge of the area, after which the abscess begins to drain from that location.
It appears like the root of a plant or an animal. If its tip emerges, it should be wrapped with a small piece of lead that weighs about one to two dirhams, which should then be tied and left hanging from the leg.
Whenever something comes out, wrap it in the lead and tie it. If it extends a great deal, cut off part of it and wrap the remainder. Do not cut it from its root until all of it has come out; for if you cut it before it is fully discharged, it will contract and enter the flesh, causing a swelling and infection at the site, as well as a bad ulcer.
Therefore, it should be managed and drawn out gradually until nothing remains in the body. In some people, what comes out from this abscess may be as long as five fingerbreadths or more.
And I have heard that it came out for a man as long as twenty fingerbreadths. If it stops coming out during your treatment, insert a probe into the hole and dilate it gradually and thoroughly along with the body until all the material has drained out, and then try to cure the site with medicines for several days.
Then treat it with the treatment of tumors, and this vein may have many branches, especially if it appears in a joint of the foot or in the foot itself, causing it to have many openings, with each opening producing a branch. Treat it as we have mentioned in the division and as has been stated before.
The Ninety-Second Chapter.
In the incision for the worm generated under the nail and is called the disease of the cow.
This disease is called the disease of the cow in some of our countries because it often afflicts cows. It is a small single worm that develops between the skin and the flesh, and moves throughout the body both ascending and descending.
It can be perceived by touch due to the tingling as it moves from one part to another. Whenever it penetrates the skin, it creates a spot, and then exits, forming a lesion from putrefaction of some mixtures, similar to what happens with worms, maggots, and cucumber cysts in the abdomen.
And indeed, its harm is expected such that if it moves in the body and rises to the head, reaching the eye, it may open it, exit from it, and blind it. This happens frequently. If you wish to treat it and remove it, this can only be done when it is moving and becoming apparent through touch.
It is necessary to tie what is above it and below it with a tight bandage. Then incise it and remove it. If it has sunk into the flesh and you do not find it, apply heat to the area with fire until it burns it. As we have said, it is the greatest harm that can be caused to the eye.
If it has become in the head near the eye, pull under it on the forehead firmly, then incise it and extract it. It is necessary to take care of the patient purging his body with medicines that cleanse the bad putrid mixture and guarding against foods that generate putrefaction.
The Ninety-Third Chapter.
In incising the disease known as nafar.
This disease, which is called nafar in our country, is a pain that appears in some organs and then spreads from one organ to another. I have seen it as I describe it to you.
I was summoned to a sick woman in some of the provinces. She lifted her arm, and I blew a gentle breath into the vein of her forearm. After remaining there for an hour, I saw that breath move up with the pulse asworms crawl up to her elbow, faster than it is possible for mercury to rise.
If it flows from one place to another, the pain will leave that place and appear in the elbow. Then, if you wait an hour, it will flow throughout the entire body until it reaches the other arm. She also told me that her whole body seems to oscillate as I observed.
I was amazed at the speed of its transfer from one organ to another. Before I saw this disease with my own eyes as I have now, I had only seen groups of people experiencing pain that transferred from one organ to another, but not to the extent that I witnessed in this woman.
I did not realize this until I considered that the woman was from the desert, lean of body, and had her veins exposed. This is why the transferring breath was apparent to the touch. It follows that this would not be as evident in those who are well-nourished and have their veins hidden beneath flesh.
If you intend to treat him and he feels pain, then it appears to you openly as we mentioned. Tighten above and below with the clamp and incise until that congested foul air comes out and the area is cleansed.
If you do not see it with your eyes, treat him by shaking the body and what expels the foul air, such as the seed of the tamarisk and the seed of the sabinia and the like of medicines.
The Fourth Ninety Chapter.
In the Extraction of Arrows.
Arrows may differ according to their types and the places where they are located in the body. As for the difference by types, some are large and small, some are hollow glass and some are sealed glass. Some have three corners and others have four corners.
And some have tongues and others have shards. As for those that differ according to the organs where they are located, they are of two kinds: either the organs are among the main hollow organs such as the brain, heart, liver, lungs, kidneys, intestines, and bladder and the like. If an arrow falls into one of these organs, and you see the signs of death that I will describe to you later, it should be avoided to extract that arrow from him, for death will most often befall its owner. And if these bad signs do not appear to you, and the arrow has not hidden deeply within the organ, extract it and treat the wound. As for the signs of the brain, if an arrow strikes it and penetrates the bone and wounds the scull which is on top of the brain, then one is exposed to severe headache, swelling, and dizziness.
And if these bad signs do not appear to you, and the arrow has not hidden deeply within the organ, extract it and treat the wound. As for the signs of the brain, if an arrow strikes it and penetrates the bone and wounds the scull which is on top of the brain, then one is exposed to severe headache, swelling, and dizziness. Hotness in the eyes and tongue, convulsion and confusion of the mind, ejaculation once or perhaps blood came out from the nostrils or ears, and perhaps speech was interrupted with loss of voice; and a white moisture came forth from the place of the wound resembling porridge, and it flows like raw meat.
If these signs appear to you, withhold treatment for the patient and extract the arrow if it has not yet been removed. As for the signs of the arrow if it struck the heart and is near the left breast and you feel it as though it had penetrated something solid rather than something hollow.
Perhaps the arrow moves like a pulse, and black blood flows from the wound. This is followed by cold sweating and fainting. Know that death is certain in this case. As for the sign of the arrow if it wounds the lung, there will be discharge of frothy blood from the wound.
The vessels following the neck swell, and the patient's color changes. He breathes heavily and seeks to inhale cold air. If the arrow struck the diaphragm in the chest, it would be close to the small ribs, with heavy breathing accompanied by severe pain.
He sighs and all the muscles of the flanks move. If the arrow struck the liver, this was followed by severe pain, and blood came out from the wound resembling the color of the liver. If the arrow struck the stomach, perhaps something undigested from the food came out of the wound.
It is obvious. If the arrow struck the abdomen and caused internal bleeding, or excrement came out from the wound or a bowel had ruptured, there is no hope for treatment nor for extracting the arrow. If the arrow struck the bladder and urine was discharged, there is no hope for his recovery.
Some part protruded outside and the pain intensified for the patient. Know that it is dead. As for other organs such as the face, eye, throat, shoulder, back, spine, thigh, leg and similar organs, they have mostly been confirmed by the matter at hand.
If the arrow did not hit a vein or nerve and was not poisoned, and I inform you of some of what I have witnessed regarding these arrows so that you may rely on it for your treatment, then the arrow struck a man in the root of his nose.
I removed it from the other side, under the earlobe, and he recovered without any harm coming to his eye. I also extracted another arrow from a Jew who had been struck in the lower eyelid near the earlobe; the arrow had embedded itself and I could only remove its small tip that was stuck in the wood.
It was a large arrow from the composite square iron arrows without wings. The Jew recovered and nothing adverse happened to his eye. I also extracted another arrow from the throat of a Christian; the arrow was an Arabic one.
It had wings, so I split it between the quill feathers and it had penetrated his throat. I extracted it gently until I removed it, and the Christian recovered. I also extracted another arrow from a man who had been struck in his belly; we estimated that he would die from it.
After he remained for a period of thirty days or so, and nothing changed in his condition, I split the arrow and manipulated it to extract it, and he recovered without any adverse event. I saw a man struck by an arrow on his back; the wound had healed over.
After seven years, the arrow came out from the base of his thigh, and I saw a woman who had been struck in her abdomen by an arrow, the wound united, and the arrow remained, and nothing changed in her condition at all, nor did she find anything harmful in any of her natural actions.
I saw another man struck by an arrow in his face, the wound united, and he did not find much pain from it. Such cases are many. I extracted an arrow from one of the sultan's commanders who had been struck on the bridge of his nose, which had tilted slightly to the right.
The arrow was completely extracted, but I was summoned to treat the wound three days after the arrow struck him. I found the arrow wound to be extremely narrow. Upon probing it with a fine probe, I did not feel the arrow, but he felt a depression and pain on his right side behind his ear.
I hoped that this depression was caused by the tip of the arrow. I dressed the wound with a dressing containing strong suction and waited for it to mature, hoping that the area would swell and show a sign of the arrow. I probed it further, but nothing happened in the area that indicated the arrow had reached the location.
I continued to dress the wound with the dressing for many days, but nothing happened. Then I cauterized within that wound and left the patient hopeful of extracting it after a period. Finally, he felt the arrow inside his nose one day, and I was informed of this. I applied strong corrosive medicine to the wound for many days.
Until the wound opened and I probed it, feeling the tip of the narrow arrow that adhered to the wood. Then I increased the opening of the wound with this strong corrosive medicine until the tip of the arrow became visible to us, and it took me about four months to extract it.
Then, when the wound expanded and it became possible for me to introduce forceps into it, I grasped it and moved it; but as it did not respond by coming out, I continued to soften it and devised various means with different instruments until I captured it one day with tight forceps as its appearance will be shown at the end of this chapter.
And the physicians judged that his nasal cartilage would not heal. I treated it, and the wound healed, and the patient recovered completely, without any discomfort at all. I will tell you how I extracted some arrows so that you may use this as an example and proof for what I have not mentioned.
Because the parts of this craft and their details cannot be grasped by description nor comprehensively covered in a book. Only the skilled craftsman measures the many from the few, infers what is absent from what is present, and derives new works and new instruments in times of unusual challenges.
If you delve into this craft, I say that arrows are extracted from the parts of the body in which they become embedded in two ways: either by pulling from the site where it entered or from the opposite side, the one that exits where it entered.
Either the arrow is protruding in a muscular place, in which case you should pull it out and extract it. If it does not respond to your pulling at the time it entered, you should leave it for some days until the flesh around it decomposes, making it easier to pull out and extract. Similarly, if it becomes embedded in bone.
And if it does not respond to your pulling and moving, leave it for some days. Then return to pulling and moving it each day; it will eventually come out. If it still does not respond after some days, you should puncture around the arrow in the same bone from every side with a fine needle to enlarge the space for the arrow, then pull and extract it.
If the arrow is embedded in the skull and has penetrated one of the brain's cavities, and some of the symptoms mentioned to you have appeared from below, do not pull out the arrow and leave it until after a few days to see how matters stand.
If it is necessary to pull out the arrow and extract it, if it is deeply embedded and does not respond to pulling, use probes around the arrow as I have described to you, then treat the area until it heals. If the arrow has hidden in a part of the body, And if it has lost sensation,探针探测，如果感觉到箭头，则用合适的器械拔出它。如果因为伤口狭窄、箭矢深入且远离骨骼、神经或血管，无法进行操作。
And if it has lost sensation, probe it with a探针，如果感觉到箭头，则用合适的器械拔出它。如果因为伤口狭窄、箭矢深入且远离骨骼、神经或血管，无法进行操作。
And if you attempt to extract the arrow in any part, use your forceps with all possible angles until you remove it. Be as gentle as possible to avoid breaking the arrow, which would make it difficult to pull out and extract. If you are unable to do so within a reasonable time, proceed carefully.
Leave it for days until the flesh around it putrefies, then reapply if necessary; for it becomes easier then. If you encounter a bleed, use the treatment we mentioned in its chapter, and spare no effort to avoid cutting an artery or tendon, using巧解代替切除。
You may extract the arrow in any way, and let it be with gentleness and patience as you described. You should pull the arrow such that the patient is in the same condition as when the arrow was inserted; this is more appropriate.
If you cannot do that, use the method you can. As for the arrow that comes out from the opposite side, either something has protruded outside, or you will feel the tip of the arrow near the surface beneath the skin and see it projecting.
Make an incision of sufficient size for the clamps to fit. Then pull it; it will be easier for the arrow to come out. If it is stuck in a bone, grasp with your hand to rotate it until the arrow affects the bone and expands to free itself, then pull it.
Otherwise, leave it for days until it comes out. If the arrowhead is still in him, push it with something. If the feather has fallen off and you want to use a push, insert the hollow instrument into the base of the feather shaft, then push it with that.
If the arrow is hollow, push it with an instrument that can enter that hollow. The arrow will come out more easily this way. If the arrow is poisoned, you should cauterize the flesh where all the poison has entered if you can do so, then treat it accordingly.
If the arrow is found in the chest or in the abdomen or in the bladder or in the groin and it is close to what can be probed with a probe, and you are able to incise it, then incise it and take care not to cut an artery or a nerve, and extract it.
Then sew the wound if it needs suturing, then treat him until he recovers. Image of the suction pipes used to extract arrows:.
Its ends are like the beak of a bird. They are made like a forceps so that when they grasp the arrow or something, they do not leave it. Various sizes, big, small, and medium, can be made according to the size of the arrow and its smallness, the width of the wound and its narrowness.
Image of the evacuated cannon:.
Image of the silenced trumpet:.
This is a silenced trumpet for the end, like a trumpet, to facilitate its entry into the evacuated arrow and push it out.
Chapter Fifty-Nine.
In the Ligation of Veins.
The veins that are usually ligated in the body number thirty. Sixteen of these are in the head: the two pulsating veins behind the ears known as the hassasins, and the two arteries in the cheeks that are visible, and the two veins at the site of the eyelids known as the nazzarun.
And the vein that is hanging in the middle of the forehead, the vein that is at the tip of the nose, and the two veins in the cheeks, and the two veins in the upper lip, and the two veins in the lower lip. These are known as the ghajark, and the two veins under the tongue.
As for the veins that divide in the arm and hand, they are five veins. One is the Ceyval, which is from the wild side. The common people call it the vein of the head and al-khlal, which is the middle vein, composed of a branch of baslik and a branch of Ceyval. The common people call it the vein of the body.
And the baslik, which is located on the human side and is also called the cubital. The common people call it the vein of the belly and the arm cord, which is situated on the pulse and is the one that adheres there and appears clearly above the thumb.
It is the vein between the index finger and the thumb, which has two branches. In the leg and foot, there are three veins. One is below the kneecap from the wild side, the second is safen, and its place is on the inner side of the heel. The third is the nasa vein, and its place is on the outer side of the heel.
In the other leg, there are three veins similar to them. As for the two veins behind the ears, their division is beneficial for chronic and inflammatory conditions, as well as severe head wounds. The method of dividing them will be described.
It is to shave the head of the patient and scratch behind it at the location of the veins with a rough cloth, rubbing it well. Then, choke the patient's neck with a turban until the veins appear and their location behind the ears in the lower parts of the head is visible. Take hold of them with your finger where you feel their pulse beneath your finger, and there mark them with ink.
Then take a surgical forceps, which is known as nashal. Insert it under the vein in the skin until the forceps reaches the bone. Raise your hand with the vein and skin above, and cut the vein along with the skin in a jagged manner, making the length of each cut about two closed fingers.
This is the method by which you send forth the quantity of blood desired, then you draw them together with the ligatures and leave them until it heals. As was mentioned at the beginning of the book, cutting and cauterizing them. As for the two vessels in the temples, they are beneficial to stop for the chronic headache, severe migraine, constant conjunctivitis, and abundant discharge affecting the eyes.
The method by which you stop them, as I describe to you, is to tie the patient's neck with a scarf until the veins become distinctively visible and you can clearly feel their pulse beneath your finger. Then you mark it with a pencil, and lift the skin from above the vein to just above it with your little finger.
You insert the forceps underneath and lift the vein upwards, then cut it off as you did with the other veins. You send forth the blood to the extent of your need, then dilate the wound and place your finger on the vein for a while.
Then place a cotton pad and ligature over it, draw them tight from above, and leave until it heals. As was mentioned earlier in the beginning of the book regarding their cutting and suturing. As for stopping the forehead vein, its benefit follows after stopping the cervical veins for chronic facial ailments such as hives, sores, and severe flushing.
The method by which you stop it, as I describe to you, is to tie the patient's neck with a scarf until the veins become distinctively visible. Then take the instrument called the fess; this is its shape:
You place the spike at the head of the fess on the same vein, and strike from above with a comb or something similar. You leave the blood to flow to the extent you desire, then dilate the wound and draw it tight until it heals.
And a broad clamp may be used, except that it should not be pointed at the tip as are other clamps. Rather, it should have a slightly wide tip and be filed to prevent distortion, for the bone is close, and the clamp might break if it is too thin.
As for the veins in the orbit of the eyes, their use is beneficial for ailments of the eye such as scabies, redness, and diseases of the face. As for the method of filing them, it is that the affected person ties his neck with a turban, then you file them while standing at his head, and let the filing be slightly towards the length with a small, slightly broad clamp.
If the area has no flesh, for if the clamp is thin at the tip, it might break. Then you should let out enough blood for your need and place a cotton pad on them, tying them up for one night. As for filing the nasal vein, it is beneficial for acute fevers.
And for severe headaches, as well as facial diseases such as the persistent red swelling that appears in the nose. The method of filing it is that the affected person ties his neck with a turban, then hold his nose with your left hand and take a thin but long clamp.
And it is inserted into the center of the nasal bone itself between the nose septum for straightness, because the vein does not appear for touch there; instead, the blood emerges from its location. You should insert your clamp slightly and let out enough blood, then tie him up for one night as it heals quickly.
As for the jugular veins, their filing is beneficial for shortness of breath and the onset of leprosy and other black diseases that appear on the skin, such as black hives, warts, severe sores, and ulcers. The method of filing them is that the affected person ties his neck with a band under them, and the operator stands at the head of the affected person.
The patient seated on a chair, then the vein is incised lengthwise widely but not too much. Then draw out the blood in moderate amount or as one sees fit according to need. Then do likewise with the other vein. Then dissolve the bond.
Tighten the veins moderately so that the patient does not suffocate. Leave him for the next day, for the wound will heal. As for the veins of jeirak, incise them after incising qif, for they are beneficial in treating abscesses in the mouth, corruption of the gums, severe ulcers, and splitting of the lips, and severe ulcers.
Which are in the nose and its vicinity, and how to incise them: Seat the patient facing you and tie his neck with a turban. Then turn his lips and look at the two veins; one is on the right side of the lip, and the other on the left. You will identify them by their black coloration.
And this is also because there are thin black veins around them, which you should cut in a jagged manner. If it is unclear to you and you are unsure about what they are, cut the larger and more distinct ones. Do the same for the two veins in the lower lip.
As for the veins beneath the tongue, incise them after incising qif for the khawaniq that occur in the throat from diseases of the larynx and mouth. The method of incising them is to seat the patient facing you with his head tilted back and raise his tongue. Look under the tongue on one side for a vein, and on the other side for another vein; their color should be black.
Examine them thoroughly and be careful not to cut them deeply, for beneath them are arteries; perhaps there will be a bleeding from those arteries. As for the three veins that are severed in the elbow, they are the ones commonly cut in all people, and their severing can occur in two ways.
Either by suturing with a broad aromatic forceps or an olive-shaped one to the quivering tissue, or by incising with a surgical forceps which is the nishal [and this is its image], the image of the broad aromatic forceps:.
It is broad as you see, and it is suitable for opening dilated, full, prominent, and apparent arteries containing thick, viscous blood. This is the image of the olive-shaped forceps:.
This forceps is narrower and finer at the tip, suitable for severing thin arteries containing thin, yellowish blood. This is the image of the nishal:.
This nishal, which is suitable for incising and comes in broad and narrow types according to the size of the arteries. One can identify it by this distinction, as it is well-known among craftsmen.
As for the basilic vein, which is one of these three arteries, the benefit of severing it is that it draws blood from ailments that occur below the neck and throat, extending from the chest to the abdomen. The surgeon should be cautious when severing it and use a portion of his hand to cover it, as beneath it lies an artery. If he makes a mistake and increases the number of sutures on the forceps, he may cut that artery.
In case of bleeding, it should be avoided to suture it with a needle clamp; instead, it should be separated by a peel. If the passageway does not become clearly visible, you should avoid it and turn to another or seek some of its branches.
Or suture it with a hand stitch, for it is clear. Peel and separate it with the peel clamp as we said. If you wish to suture it directly, you should examine the place before tightening the thread until you recognize the pulse position, then mark it with a pen.
Then tie the arm and separate the vein by a peel clamp as we said, taking care that the cut is not close to the vessel's position. When you see upon tightening the bandage a pulse in the place you marked with a pen, this pulse indicates the swelling of the vessel; avoid it.
If you see the blood spurt when suturing, as it does in a boy's urine, and the blood is thin and red, know that it is from the vessel's blood. Then act quickly; place your finger on it for a long time, then remove your finger. If the bleeding stops, often it stops completely; tighten the arm.
Leave it, and warn the patient against neglecting it. Let it be on the surface of the skin and do not move it for days until it heals. If the bleeding does not stop and you are overwhelmed and cannot provide treatment at the time, then amputate the vessel if it is visible; its两端被收缩，出血会停止。
Or take a piece of sinew, separate it, and take half of it, tighten it over the vein firmly with the bandage and auxiliary threads for another day. If the bleeding stops, otherwise, treat it as previously mentioned by placing the obstructing pellets to stop the bleeding, and cut its supply; this is not difficult in most cases.
For a small wound and the ligature in the arm, know it. As for the blue vein, its benefit in stopping it is to draw blood from above the head and below the body to that place, as it is composed of a branch from the basiliac and a branch from the civalqal, as we have said.
It should be on the part of the vein that is clamped, for beneath it lies a nerve. If the pricking becomes excessive and hits the nerve, it causes numbness that is difficult to perceive, and it may not ever fully recover. This nerve often becomes apparent through sensation.
If it is hidden in some people and very fine so that it cannot be discerned, you should make your ligature a cut with the snare. Avoid the nerve as much as possible. If the vein is between two nerves, cut the vein lengthwise. As for the blue vein, its benefit in stopping it is to draw blood from the head.
It is beneficial for eye diseases. If you wish to ligate this vein, do so with a olive twig forceps or a broad rosewood forceps; it is safer for all veins because there is neither a artery nor a nerve beneath it.
Except that when ligating, you should avoid the head of the muscle with the forceps and seek the soft area. It is not harmful if it does not hit the first time to re-ligate several times; however, it might swell in some people if it is not ligated on the first attempt.
But such swelling does not harm it at all. As for the method of ligating and its effects, and what should be done in correcting it, first you should know that ligature is used either solely for preserving health.
Either for diseases and what is used in preserving health and maintaining it and preventing the occurrence of diseases, the ligation should be done in one of the three veins in the elbow, meaning the cephalic, basilic, and median, and should be done at the beginning of spring if signs of engorgement appear.
Ligation should be done on Sunday or Tuesday after three hours have passed since dawn. As for ligation used for diseases, it is not limited to a specific time but can be performed at night or day as need and necessity dictate.
Ligation should be performed at any hour and at any time. It is not advisable to ligate children until they reach fourteen years of age, nor to ligate elderly individuals who have surpassed sixty years. If anyone intends to perform ligation for any reason.
It is advisable to cleanse his intestines with a gentle enema if there is much retained feces, to prevent it from being drawn into the veins during ligation and causing foul-smelling toxins that may harm the vital organs. Ligation should not be performed on those who are swollen, intoxicated, or drunk until such conditions have subsided.
Ligation should also be avoided after vomiting, diarrhea, and excess sexual activity, as well as after fatigue, exercise, staying up late, fasting, and all that may weaken physical or mental strength. Then consider the need to dilate the veins if the blood is thick.
With foods, drinks, and medicines if possible, then he should take a bath if there is no impediment to do so, or engage in some exercise to dilate the blood. He should perform this ligation in the middle of the day as we said, and strive to rid his chest of all bad mental symptoms on that day.
Regarding worries and anger and fear, and all bodily symptoms such as fatigue and extreme exhaustion, and sexual intercourse, etc., he prepares the things that people are accustomed to using from various perfumes, aromatic plants, entertainments, etc., each person according to what he can afford.
Then the examiner sits on a pillow which is higher than the pillow on which the patient lies. He extends his arm and the examiner rubs it twice or three times with his hand. Then he ties the bandage with a knot and winds it twice or three times, making sure the tie is moderate.
Because the tie, if not moderate, either by过度牵引而阻止血液流动，或者过于松弛同样也会阻止血液流动。然后在绑紧之后，应当让患者双手相互摩擦以促进血液循环。
Until the veins swell and can be felt. Then the examiner should wipe the forceps with a gentle stroke from old olive oil. Next, he should place his fourth finger of his left hand slightly below the vein at the point where he intends to clamp it, to prevent the vein from being missed by the strike. Because some veins are like tendons and can be missed when clamped, while others are full of air. When the forceps are placed on such veins, they may collapse beneath the forceps and deceive the examiner, making it appear that the forceps have not opened the vein. Even if the forceps do open the vein, the opening will be narrow.
Therefore, the examiner should be careful and thorough in all these matters. Then he should place the forceps. If the vein opens on the first attempt, it is sufficient. Otherwise, he should try again slightly below or above that spot with urgency if the area does not become swollen.
If there is swelling or anxiety in the affected area, leave it for a day or two and do not tighten the bandage; for it might bring about a hot abscess. Do not enter the bathhouse. Then he may attempt to extract again if he wishes. If there was puncturing with forceps and the opening was small and the bleeding was thin.
And fear that the amount of blood desired may not be extracted. Readminister the forceps in the same opening, applying it gently on the right angle and increase the size of the opening slightly. Do this with urgency before the area swells, for often in many people, the area swells when the opening is small.
And if you see that it has swollen, do not attempt to re-treat it at all, for it will not help you. Place something from the bruise of oil on it; for it eases the flow of blood and is better in this place than oil itself and all other ointments.
And use the bruise of oil in all your venous extraction when the flow of blood is obstructed. The Farouq remedy and shakhznaia may also do this if applied to the area; for the blood becomes thin and dissolves if it is thick.
And if a large abscess occurs in the extraction area, it often happens, especially to those who have extracted only this time or whose vein opening was small. Act promptly; place a sponge soaked in warm water and salt on the abscess and tighten it for an hour; for it will dissolve.
And you should do this after the blood has completely drained from the vein itself or from another vein. If after days there remains any blackness or greenishness in the area, it does not matter. If you wish, apply something of patience and dissolved bitter substances on it.
Or anything from the juice of figs and similar substances, and often a swelling occurs at the suturing of the basylec. Place your hand upon it; if you find that it yields to pressure, then this is bad oozing. Be careful not to apply anything as mentioned above.
If it bleeds from a sinus, however, bind it with what contains compression to harden the area, then treat it with other treatments until it heals. It is necessary to drain for each person according to their strength and the predominant color in the blood.
If the blood is black, let it drain until it turns red. And if you see that it is thick, cause it to thin out. If it is sharp, let it soften until its sharpness goes away. It is necessary for one who is full and strong and needs to drain the blood all at once.
He should widen the suturing of the vein, and the forceps should be wide. For one who is weak, do the opposite. It is necessary to drain it in stages and make the hole narrow. The best method for suturing a vein is to use a curved, rough, cut-like stitch without a needle.
This method of suturing is free from bleeding and cutting the nerve, and it is better and safer than wide and long suturing. And if one is accustomed to falling unconscious during suturing, it is necessary to feed him before suturing something from soaked bread in water of pomegranate peel or turmeric.
If it is hungry and has drained the blood in three or four times, if he has a cold temperament, let him take before suturing bread soaked in mibia drink or in sweet honey drink flavored with fawwihs or in a pleasant-smelling herb drink.
If blindness occurs during incision and the cause is the abundant flow of blood, it should be given meat broth and thin rose beverage. Use expensive fumigants for inhalation and foment his chest with them. Employ all that we have mentioned in division concerning blindness.
Which results from vomiting, and as for him who wants to relax his arm and let the blood flow again, it should be that for one whose incision was for much vomiting and whose strength is weak, the blood should be let a little at a time according to the strength in consecutive days.
And as for him who wants to relax his arm and let the blood flow again and whose body is strong, he should do this on seven or nine hours following his first incision. And as for him who wants to draw the blood from his body to the opposite side which it inclined towards, it should be that he be treated on the second or third day.
And as for him in whose body the blood is much, having become warm and heated, and causing fever, it should be that the blood be drawn out in one draft, and a large quantity be removed. Widen the incision to such an extent that blindness occurs after monitoring all conditions of the incision. And place your hand on his pulse when the blood is flowing to prevent death in place of blindness. This often occurs if the incisor is ignorant and becomes careless. It should not be done if you want to relax the arm and let the blood flow again.
And since the sweat pore has closed and it is difficult for the blood to flow out, do not probe it forcefully or twist it strongly, as this is very bad. Either leave it until you incise again, or use a surgical knife to dislodge what has congealed in the sweat pore.
Or you may apply to it something of the salt that has dissolved in water or apply to it something of the Farouq or Shakhznaya tincture and gently prick it until the blood comes out, if the vein has swollen leave it.
And do not touch it until the swelling subsides, if necessity demands that the blood be let again and there is no choice then either分开在此处抽血，或者在另一只手臂或另一条静脉处抽血。
And as for the veins of the arm, they should be divided instead of acanthus and basilicon if they are not available or hidden, because they are composed of both. The method of dividing them is to immerse the sharp instrument in hot water until the vein turns red and the vein becomes clearly visible. Then tie it lightly with a bandage moderately tight.
Then divide the vein slightly, neither wide nor long, and make the incision spacious. Divide it slightly above the wrist joint. If the blood does not flow out, reimmerse the hand in hot water and let the blood flow in the water.
Until it reaches your need. If you are in the days of summer, you may do without reimmersing the hand in hot water. More often, letting the blood flow in hot water is done during winter. Dividing this vein is safer than all other veins. Because there is no harmful vein or nerve beneath it. As for dividing the Asilam in the right hand, it is beneficial for liver diseases. The method of dividing it is to tie the wrist with a bandage or do it by your hand after immersing it in hot water until the vein becomes prominent.
Because there is no harmful vein or nerve beneath it. As for dividing the Asilam in the right hand, it is beneficial for liver diseases. The method of dividing it is to tie the wrist with a bandage or do it by your hand after immersing it in hot water until the vein becomes prominent. It is evident to the sense very much, then separate it with a slight alteration and even if you amputated it completely, that would not harm him at all. Handle with care, do not immerse your hand too much in the hot water, for underneath it is the nerve of the fingers and the place is fleshless.
Leave it to allow the blood to flow in it. For if you do not rewet it in hot water, the blood will congeal in the artery and will not flow. When you remove it from the blood, according to necessity, put on the artery a greasy salve and salt to prevent it from sticking together quickly.
Similarly, it should be done with every narrow branch. As for its benefit, separate it from the left hand, for it is beneficial for liver diseases. Do this in the same way as you did with the second one. As for the separation of the chancre, its benefit is for diseases in the lower parts of the body, such as women's ailments.
Retention of menstruation, diseases of the kidneys, chronic wounds on the thighs, and similar ailments, and the method of separating it: Let her immerse her leg in hot water and apply massage until the arteries start to flow. Then tie it above the knee joint with a bandage and splint; the position for the artery is at the heel, slightly towards the big toe.
It branches out into many divisions in the foot. Separate it in the widest branch of these divisions, or at the heel where they converge, for this is better and safer. If you separate it in the foot, be careful to protect the nerves underneath in the foot.
Make your separation by altering it slightly as if you intend to amputate, and use the forceps loosely. If the blood does not come out, immerse his leg in hot water again and allow the blood to flow until it is exhausted. If the separator misses the artery during the first attempt.
Let him cut a little higher up, for the place is safe and one need not fear a gangrene if it is guarded as we said. Do the same with the second hallux in the other foot equally, as for the nerve of the vein, its place is as we said at the heel on the outer side.
And the benefit of his cutting for pain in the hip if that is from the hot and innate blood. The way to cut it is to enter the true bath and hurry, and tighten his leg from the hip up to above the heel with four fingers using a thin long bandage; for it will not show except by this.
If it appears, cut him accordingly in any case. Either do a corrective operation, which is better, or amputate him by an amputation incision or make a cut in him. For its place is safe, and it is hidden enough in most people; if you do not find it.
And if it does not appear by touch at all, cut some of its branches, which appear on the back of the foot near the thumb and little finger, and guard against the nerves, and let out the amount of blood you desire.
Then relax the tension and place a cloth at the site of the cut. Tighten the area; it will quickly heal.
The Sixth Ninety- Ninth Section.
On the True Bath and How to Use It.
The cups may be of horns, wood, brass, or glass. The true bath may be performed in two ways: one is the cupping with a suck and drawing out the blood, and the other is the cupping without a suck.
And this cupping which is without condition is of two kinds.
And the cupping of the axillae, which are both sides of the neck, and the cupping of the chin, which is under the lower jaw from the mouth, and the cupping of the shoulders, and the cupping of the scapulas on the back of the thighs, and the cupping of the elbows, which are in the middle of the upper arms, and the cupping of the legs, and the cupping of the kidneys.
And cupping is only performed by drawing the blood from the fine veins scattered in the flesh. For this reason, it should not lose its strength as if cut off, and cupping should not be used with fire or without fire in any condition caused by swelling until the body expels all of it.
If the need arises for cupping due to illness or custom, we use it at any time, whether at the beginning of the month, at the end, in the middle, or at any other time.
And this is because some people, when the blood increases in their body to the point where they need to release it through cupping, find a heaviness and headache in their head. Some find swelling and redness in their face, head, and neck. Some experience itching on their face and armpits, as well as dimness and dryness in their eyes. Some itch at the place where they applied the cupping.
And among them some laugh frequently and some find the taste of blood in their mouth and their gums bleed and they regurgitate blood, and some sleep much and some see in their sleep blood and redness and wounds and such like, whenever we see anything of that.
And especially if it is in the middle third of the month, we order bloodletting after two or three hours have passed in the day. As for the benefit of bloodletting of the nacre, it benefits from heaviness in the head and fluid that drips to the eyes.
But it should be after the complete evacuation of the body. This bloodletting may be a substitute for cutting the qiffal (a type of vein). It is advised to avoid using it for those with cold brains or those with an illness, as it can cause great harm.
Therefore, it should not be used by the elderly and those with cold diseases in their head, and those who frequently use it have been known to develop forgetfulness.
Therefore, it should be ordered that the bloodletter lower his hand with the cup only slightly downwards to avoid causing forgetfulness. As for bloodletting of the shoulder, it is a substitute for cutting the akhlal and the baslic veins.
Therefore, it is beneficial for asthma, shortness of breath, collapse of the respiratory mechanism, coughing, and congestion. It should be noted that bloodletting of the shoulder should be performed slightly upwards, as if it were done downwards, it could cause weakness in the heart and stomach.
As for bloodletting of the axillary veins, it is beneficial for acute pain in the head, conjunctivitis, migraine, strangles (a type of severe cough), and pain at the roots of the teeth. It is a substitute for cutting the baslic vein. It should be ordered that the bloodletter does not deepen his hand with the instrument to avoid cutting a vessel and causing bleeding.
And as for cupping under the jaw, it is beneficial for ulcers in the mouth and gum disease and similar diseases in the mouth and can serve the purpose of fessud of the cheeks. And as for cupping the shoulders, it is beneficial for palpitation that results from fullness and heat.
And as for cupping the flank between the two kidneys, it is beneficial for what benefits fessud of the three great veins, basilic, internal hazel, and external hazel, because it draws blood from all those thin veins in the flesh and draws those thin veins from other thicker veins until the suction reaches the three thick veins.
And it is advisable to order the cupper not to apply too much pressure, for the area is stripped of flesh and has nerves and arteries underneath. And as for the single cupping on the sacrum, it is beneficial for hemorrhoids and lesions in the lower region.
And it is advisable to order the cupper that the cupping vessel be large and made of brass, for the area requires a strong suction, and perhaps a glass cup might break and draw too much blood. As for leg cups, they decrease fullness noticeably.
Because it draws blood from the entire body and is beneficial for chronic pain in the kidneys, uterus, and bladder, it also induces menstruation and is helpful for boils and abscesses. It serves the purpose of fessud of the safinah and ureter but greatly exhausts the body and causes fainting in most people. Cupping the ureters has a benefit similar to that of cupping the legs.
The method of placing the cups is as follows: First, place the cup empty and apply a moderate suction. Do not keep the cup on for too long but put it on quickly and remove it quickly to allow the fluids to be drawn evenly to the area. Continue repeating and following this until you see the area turn red and open up.
Redness of the blood appeared; then it should be incised and re-incised gradually. Then observe the condition of the body. If a person has tender flesh with loose pores, it should be incised only once to prevent the site from breaking down.
You should direct the leecher to widen the incision and deepen it slightly, adjusting the sucking gradually with gentle movement. If the blood is thick, it should be incised twice. In the first time, let it open a path for the thin blood and its watery part. In the second time, it is for thorough removal of the thick blood.
If the blood is extremely thick, the incision should be repeated a third time to reach the desired result. In brief, if we wish to remove only a little blood, one incision will suffice. If we need to extract much blood, we should make a larger incision. And if we find the blood to be thick, multiple incisions may be necessary.
It should be incised deeply, with the moderate depth of the incision being only as deep as the skin. No unguents should be used when placing the cups, and no water or what the leecher should avoid. If his skin is thick, hard, and contracted, and his pores are narrow.
It should be rubbed with unguents that open, soften, and dissolve, such as the unguent of saffron or the unguent of rosemary or the unguent of sweet almond or the unguent of pumpkin seed if it is in the summer season.
If it is in the winter, use unguents like those of narcissus or violets or chamomile or lilies, and similar ones. If the pus is thick and cold, use unguents like those of marjoram or olibanum or balsam or thyme, and similar ones.
If the patient who has been cupped has wide pores and flabby flesh, it is advisable to avoid using ointment. These should be washed with rose water or cold water or grapevine water or pumpkin water or pennyroyal water, and so forth. As for those whose blood is much watery.
He should be washed with vinegar or tamarind water or similar waters. As for those whose flesh is thick, he should be washed with old drink or marjoram water or decoction of buckthorn or chamomile and similar waters. It is advisable to avoid cupping in the bath and soon after the bath.
But it is advisable to use it one hour or two after exiting the bath. No one should sleep after cupping. It should be managed by the physician and the nurse before and after cupping.
You should first examine whether the patient who has been cupped or needled is phlegmatic, and if his predominant humor is acridity and inflammation. In such a case, it is advisable to give him cooling remedies such as pomegranate, rhubarb with vinegar, lettuce, cardamom, and the like. His food should consist of thin soups, mutton, split peas, and similar foods.
And if his temperament is cold, he should be given honey drink or mubahila (senna) vinegar drink or cardamom vinegar, and should take moderate scented wine that is between the old and the new. He should be advised to eat less, and his food should consist of thin soups, goat meat, pigeons, and quails' eggs, with some split peas. It is advisable that the drink on the day of cupping or needling should be more than the food.
It should be given at times to some people of the Ferookhi powder or the myrrh remedy or the shilthah before cupping and before incision or after for strengthening the principal organs and thinning the blood, and it should not be given to the newly healed.
As for the cupping that is done without a condition, it is placed on the liver and spleen and the breasts, on the abdomen and groin, and the kidney area and the side of the hip, because these organs cannot tolerate a condition upon them. Rather, it is intended either to draw blood from one organ to another.
As we place the cupping on the breasts in a case of hemoptysis, or we use it to release an inflamed organ with cold fomentation after cupping was done on the organ. Similarly, we place the cupping on the abdomen and groin, for it agitates the organ, warms it, and relieves pain through the dispersion of that cold vapor.
It can be placed on the kidney if a blockage or stone is present, as its strong suction might open the blockage or remove the stone from its place. Similarly, it can be used on the liver and spleen when there is a vapor disorder in them. These cupping treatments can be applied empty by merely sucking with it.
It can be used with fire and can also be filled with cold water for ailments of the skin. When applied, the cupping should be large and filled only with hot water or with water in which some herbs suitable for such purposes have been boiled.
Then it is placed filled over the area, held, removed, and reapplied as needed. This is the image of the cupping used with fire.
Let the mouth of its cavity be two open fingers in breadth as we have depicted it, and measure its depth a span and a half. And there should be a small hole on one side about half its length into which an iron or yellow brass needle with thick edges can be inserted.
Smooth, level, and rounded to prevent it from injuring the organ when placed on it. In its middle, there should be a groove crossing it made of copper or iron through which the candle is inserted. This measuring cup can be larger than what we have described or smaller according to the disease.
And the method of using it is that juvenile and deformed measuring cups are different from those of men and camels. As for placing this measuring cup on the organ with fire, it should be inserted with a wick lit from tightly woven cotton or a small candle, and placed in the middle of the hardened member located in the center of the measuring cup.
Let the fire rise to about halfway up the measuring cup to prevent the patient's body from being burned. Then place it on the organ, and the finger over the hole we have mentioned. Until we grasp the measuring cup, we do not remove the finger.
The vapor comes out through that hole, and the measuring cup falls off the stand. Then, a wick is inserted as described, and it can be reinserted if needed. As for the measuring cup used for the disease of shoshtra with water, it does not have a hardened member or any hole.
It is used by filling it with water and placing it on the organ only. This is its image:.
This measuring cup should be large to hold more water, the better.
The Seventh and Ninety-Chapter
On the Comment on Abscess.
Abscess: It is mostly used in organs where it is impossible to apply the forceps either because of their small size, such as the lip and tongue, and the like, or because the organ is naked of flesh, such as the finger and nose, and the like.
The method of using it is to select the abscess that occurs in pure fresh water, free from impurities. Then leave it for a day and night in fresh water until it becomes hungry and there remains nothing in its cavity. Then the body should first be purged either by vomiting or by cupping, and then the clean organ should be wiped.
Until it becomes reddened. Then place something on it; if it fills up, it will fall off. If possible, suck the area with the cupping instrument, for this is more effective in its benefit. Otherwise, wash the area with vinegar, then with much water, and rub it and squeeze it. If the bleeding continues after the abscess falls off and this was due to a hemorrhage, wet a cloth with cold water and apply it.
Then place it from above until the hemorrhage stops. If much blood continues to flow, sprinkle on it fresh powder or ointment or something similar from the compresses until the bleeding stops, or place on the area half of a peeled egg.
Then leave it until the egg half adheres to the area; the bleeding will stop. If it is necessary to repeat the abscessing, do not use that abscess if another can be used instead. If no other abscess can adhere, then wipe the area with fresh blood.
Or prick with a needle until something of blood comes out, then place it; if it feels something of blood it sticks to the spot. If you wish to remove it, sprinkle upon it some of the resin or salt or ashes, for it falls from the spot.
The Third Chapter.
In Algebra.
This chapter is also necessary for the practice of medicine, dealing with the correction and treatment of fractures in bones.
Know, my sons, that this chapter is claimed by the ignorant among physicians and the common people. Those who have never studied the works of the ancients in it or read a single letter from them.
And for this reason, this art has become non-existent in our land. Indeed, I have never come across anyone who was particularly skilled in it at all. And I have acquired from it only what I have gained through extensive reading of the works of the ancients and my persistent effort to understand them, until I extracted the knowledge of this art from them. Then, I adhered to experimentation and practice throughout my life.
And I have outlined for you in this chapter all that my knowledge encompasses. And I have refined it through my own experiments after presenting it to you, removing all redundancies and condensing it to the utmost degree of brevity. I have explained it with the utmost clarity and illustrated it with many examples of the machines used in this process.
And it is for the sake of increasing clarity, as I did in the preceding two chapters. And there is no strength except in Allah, the Most High.
The First Chapter.
In which it is fitting to mention briefly the matters concerning broken bones and that we should present them before we begin to describe each broken or dislocated part individually, it should be necessary to mention at the beginning of this chapter some sayings and divisions. It will first compel you and anyone earnest to learn this noble craft to understand them and grasp their reality.
I say that whenever there is a fracture or dislocation or swelling or falling, it should first be rushed to set it or reduce it or treat both fever and swelling. If there is no hindrance such as weakness of strength or if what occurred was something like that to a child, an old man who is feeble, or if the time is extremely hot or extremely cold.
Then his diet should be limited to cool pulses and bird meat and fish, and he should avoid thick foods and overeating, and all foods that fill the veins with blood until the swelling is secured and no material is expected to flow into the area.
Then the patient should return to his initial regimen, which he has followed regularly. If the broken bone is in the process of setting, the patient should eat foods that are nourishing, thick, and strong, with a sticky consistency like barley, rice, lentils, chickpeas, and cow's trotters. And eggs, tender fish, thick drinks, and the like; for with this regimen, the fracture will conjoin faster and better. Know that broken bones in strong men and old men cannot ever fully unite and join as they originally were.
Lijfaʿ al-ẓawāmila waṣ-ṣilābahā waqad yataṣaṢa wal-talaḥam ma kaana min al-ẓawa Huluqa al-liʾn bi-manzilah al-ẓawa Huluq al-sibyan al-saghār waʿdha al-nubuṭ tanebūʿ ala al-ẓawāmila min jihatin min kulli jiha tiṣbah shayʾan yaṣhabu filāḥa yaltaziq bihi waishdhuhu hatta yalizimu bayna qadimahu baynahu.
wa-yarbubi bayna qadimahu baynahu hatta yataʾwu fi ghayy al-qawwā wa al-wathaqah kaana awwalla hatta la yaʿwu shiʾun min afalihu.
And for this reason, it is necessary that the diet of the patient include foods that are firm, sticky, and hard, as we have said. Know that fractures may differ in types according to the difference in the organs, for a fracture of the leg bone differs from a fracture of the head骨断与胸骨的区别。
And likewise all other organs differ from one another. We shall mention each type of fracture in detail in its own section, explained separately from others. Moreover, the type of bone fracture may also vary within itself.
For it may be a fracture without any fractures or fragments occurring within it, and may be a fracture lengthwise in the bone with fragments and both displaced and undisplaced, and may be a fracture with a wound and tearing of the skin, and may be a slight crack.
And for each type, there is a specific method in reducing it, as will be detailed in its place. What identifies a fracture is the deformation and displacement of the bone, and its sensation to touch and the tremor felt when you gently probe it with your hand.
When there is no obvious bending, rustling, or disturbance upon touching the bone, and the patient does not feel much pain, then it is not a fracture. It can be a sprain or a mild fracture or a slight crack; it should not be moved at all by stretching or probing.
But apply to it the medicines that will be mentioned later as suitable for the place, then tighten it gently. Know that when the bone is broken and pierced by two forces without causing fragments, yet every part has separated from its neighbor.
You should not hasten to correct and align it at your discretion before it develops a hot swelling. If a hot swelling does develop, leave it for some days until the hot swelling subsides, then adjust it as gently as possible using any means you can.
Know that its correction and alignment are easier when there are no fragments in the bone. Then, tighten as will be mentioned. If there are fragments in the bone, it is necessary to stretch the broken limb whether by hand or foot from both sides.
Either with your hands if the limb is small, or with two ropes, or with both a rope and your hand. Place the limb in a level position to its natural shape. Until the bone extends partly, then firmly return those excess parts to their places using any means of巧思和力度，尽量温柔。
Strive to cause no pain or suffering to the patient through your actions. Your effort should be to unite one bone with its counterpart in the best possible alignment. At that time, you should touch and examine them with your hand. If you see anything out of place, correct it and align it as well as you can.
Be cautious of strong stretching and severe pricking as many ignorant people do. They often mention that they cause a hot or prolonged injury to the organ, as I have seen this happen repeatedly due to their actions.
Then, after the completion and perfection of the operation and the tension, make that organ rest and keep it quiet. Warn the patient not to move it at times of wakefulness and sleep, when it is turning and agitated, and during defecation and all its movements to the utmost extent, and to take care that the position of the organ is one in which pain will not occur.
That is, if the patient feels pain or discomfort in the position he has placed the organ, he should move it to another position where he does not feel pain. He should ensure that this new position is both level and straight.
To avoid any deformation in the organ if it has healed improperly. As for the method of stretching a broken organ, it is as I have described. Know that broken organs vary in their size, shape, and appearance. Those that are smaller, such as the arm, finger, and thigh, and similar parts, should be handled accordingly.
It should be that the ligatures of the wound are gentle and light, not harsh. Those affecting larger parts such as the thigh, back, and chest should be broad and firm, as the wide ligament must bind the large organ tightly from all sides equally without any discrepancy or interference.
Then, after completing the smoothing, you should apply the appropriate plaster. Apply a gentle plaster to the site of the fracture. Then, wrap the ligament around the site of the fracture three or four times, depending on what the organ requires. Slightly tighten the ligament with your hand, then bring it to the upper part of the site of the fracture.
By suturing with less tension than you would for the broken area, then you separate by winding a little from the broken place and relax the suture a little by a little until you get something correct from the right position, then you take another bandage and wind it also on the broken place.
Wind several times, then wind down to the lower side of the break. Let your winding be with the tension and relaxation as we mentioned for the first upper winding. Then place between the layers a soft bandage or torn piece that will straighten the broken area.
If there is a deformity, then put something for it. Otherwise, do not put anything. Then wind another bandage over it. Finally, adjust with the tight plaster bandages from your hand if there is no swelling or hot inflammation in the limb.
If there is swelling or hot inflammation, apply what relieves that inflammation and dispels the swelling. Leave it for a few days. Then tighten the plaster after that. Let the plasters be from halves of carved and prepared date palm ribs by wisdom, or they can be from willow wood.
Which are made from cedar or palm leaves or reed or rush and similar materials that are available, and let the size of each plaster be in this shape and form exactly the same.
Except that the plaster placed on the broken area should be thicker and wider slightly than other plasters. As for the length of the plaster, it should be made according to what is suitable for the broken limb regarding its size. The shape of the plaster:
Then tie the bones with another bandage according to your first tightening. After that, bind from above with tight threads as we mentioned for the tension, which is that your pulling be more at the place of the fracture. The tighter the pull, the farther from the fracture.
And the threads should be medium in thickness and softness. Let them be particularly of wet flax, for if the threads are too thick as you have seen from the actions of the ignoramuses, they make their threads of rolled dry flax, which is a great error.
Because it results in the pull being too tight or too loose, and thin threads are not suitable because you cannot achieve the desired tension with them. There should be no less than the width of a finger between the bandages.
If the patient is affected by the edges of the bandages after tightening in the correct places, place something soft like cotton or fluffy wool under them so that nothing bothers him from that. If the fracture is accompanied by a wound and there is a break in the skin, we will discuss it separately.
And know that not every broken bone should be tightened with bandages from the first day. For if the bone is large, it should not be placed under bandages except after five days or seven or more, according to your assurance that no hot swelling will occur.
And this is the characteristic of the bandages with which the ancients used to set fractures, jaws, and thumbs. It is a general short description of a bandage that sets fractures and suits most constitutions, especially children and women, because it does not tend to be either hot or cold.
And take from the dust of the mill, which is the fine flour that clings to the sides of the mill when it grinds, and shape it as it is without sieving it with egg white, making it neither thick nor thin, then apply it.
The recipe for another plaster to set fractures, dislocations, and sprains: Take from the maish, ladan, acacia, rasan, maghath, and sikk, one eleventh of an ounce of each; from the marar and zahr, one fifth of an ounce of each; and from the athl, twenty dirhams. Use either Armenian or Roman clay, also twenty dirhams. All are pounded and mixed with athl water or egg white if the patient's condition is feverish. This plaster is well compounded, sets broken bones quickly, and suits most people due to its moderation.
The recipe for another plaster that is also useful for fractures and sprains: Take maghath, maish, and khutmey abyad from each one eleventh of an ounce; marar and zahr from each one fifth of an ounce; acacia six ounces; Armenian clay twenty dirhams. Pound all finely, sift, mix with water or egg white, and apply.
The recipe for a plaster for joints and displaced bones, which relieves the pain associated with them and fractures: Take purified wool and immerse it in vinegar and cooked oil. Apply it to the area. This plaster does not have the strength to set fractures.
But it is superior in relieving hot swelling and specific pains. The recipe for another plaster to set a broken bone: Take the leaves of the wild mulberry and the leaves of the wild alfalfa, pound them both finely, and apply them wet. The recipe for another brief plaster used when a fracture starts to heal:
And if you wish to analyze the rest of the tumor, take from the sole, centaury, and madder and safflower each one a part, make them all fine, knead them with paint if the organ is not perforated; if it is perforated, knead them with cumin water or water and use it.
The preparation of another poultice stronger in analysis than the first is used when a solid tumor appears after bone fracture. Take from the sole, sesame seed, fennel, crown flower, marigold, and madder and centaury each one part.
They are made fine and kneaded with water of leek or fresh water or paint, all according to the heat of the organ and its calmness. As for Hippocrates, he did not mention in his book that it should be placed on the broken limb during reduction.
Except for the cerote made from wax and oil, nothing else. It should be described as medium between hardness and softness. As for Galen, he believed that things containing dryness with some heat, such as bitter substances, patience, resin, and what we have mentioned, should be placed on the broken limb during reduction.
The preparation of a poultice useful for weakness and pain: take myrrh, henna, human gray hair cut short or bird feathers, sole, and salt; take equal parts of each, make them fine, sift them, knead them, and apply them as a poultice. As for the amount that the bandage should remain, it is not specified here.
Then, analyze it. This means to examine it. If there is no pain or itching, and the broken bone does not move from its place, do not keep it for many days. If there is severe itching or worrying pain or swelling at the site, then remove it.
Proceed promptly and resolve it at the right time, do not delay this in any way. Remove the bandage from it, then take a soft cloth or a wet sponge and soak it in lukewarm water and wash the area with it until the itching subsides and the pain lessens. Then let the part rest for an hour.
Then apply the camphorated wool soaked in vinegar and oil or rose ointment, and tie it on him for a night until you are safe from the hot swelling, and the puffiness of the part subsides and his pain goes away. Then return it to the gentle tightening and light bandage, but do not tighten it as tightly as your first.
Take care of him until he recovers. If you see that the swelling, redness, pain, and puffiness, as well as all other symptoms, have completely gone, and you need to apply a bandage and tightening, then do so as you did at first. If nothing from what we mentioned occurs in the part, then do not change anything.
Do not resolve it unless after three days or four or five or seven. It may be left for twenty days, all of which depends on what you observe in the condition of the part as we said, until the fracture heals and the flesh knits over it.
Then increase the tightening more than your first tightness. Also, increase the severity of the patient's food as previously mentioned. If you see that the place of the fracture has dried out and become softer than it should, know that the food is not reaching it.
Sponge it with lukewarm water each time you resolve it, and do this every three days. Loosen the tightening slightly, for by doing so, the food will reach the part and heal it quickly. As for what the ignorant do, who forcibly break the bone again,
If it does not reduce first to what should and then reduces to deformity, it is a great error in their doing. Though it might have been correct, the pioneers would have mentioned it in their books and put it into practice, and I did not see any trace of it from any one of them. The correct course is not to perform it.
The Second Section.
On the Accidental Fracture of the Head.
Types of accidental fractures of the head are many, and their forms vary, with diverse causes. Some fractures occur from a sword strike, which may either completely split the bone until it reaches the periosteum beneath the bone. as is done in splitting wood.
Therefore, this type of fracture is called a "qadami" (splitting). It may either completely split the bone and cut its surface only without penetrating to its end, in which case it is called an "qatl" (cut) absolutely. The wound from these two fractures may be either large or small.
And some fractures are weak or depressed, caused by a blow with a stone or falling on a stone or similar objects. This type of fracture may either penetrate nearly reaching the membrane beneath the bone, or be in the surface of the bone.
And the wound from these two fractures may also be either large or small. Some fractures are hidden within the bone, in the softening of the hair, which is a mild depression.
Therefore, this type of fracture is called "sha'ri" (hair-like), and it occurs from a fall or a blow of a stone and the like where the bone page enters inside and becomes indented as when brass is struck and part of it enters inside.
And this is most frequent in the wet bone of the head, like the skulls of boys. And all these types of fractures may have free or unfree fragments, and we will mention the treatment of all of that in its place. We will recognize all these types of fractures by examining them.
And examine it with probes and remove the rotten flesh from it. As for the "sha'ri" type, it is recognized by examining the bone, wiping it, and staining it with ink; for the fracture will appear black. As for the treatment of the fracture, first consider the symptoms of the patient.
If you see in its symptoms something that clearly indicates fear, such as bitter vomiting, extension, loss of consciousness, disappearance of voice, fainting, high fever, opacity and redness of the eyes, and similar symptoms, then do not approach the patient or treat him; for death is certain to occur with these symptoms in most cases.
And if you see symptoms that do not alarm you and you hope for his safety, then proceed with his treatment. This is because if the wounded came to you at first sign of injury and it was in winter days.
It is advisable to make every effort to remove the bone before the fourteenth day in any case. And if it is during the summer, you should hurry to remove the bone before the seventh day to prevent the corruption of what is underneath the bone, thereby exposing those symptoms we have described.
If the bone fracture has reached the membrane covering the brain, and there is also fragmentation and displacement, it should be necessary to amputate the fractured and displaced part as I have described to you, which is to shave the head of the wounded patient.
And expose the bone in any manner that allows you to do so and according to the shape of the wound and what is evident on the patient. If upon examination of the bone you find bleeding or a hot swelling, treat it as appropriate.
And it is to fill the area with a soaked cloth in a mixture of wine and oil, cleanse the wound until the swelling subsides and bleeding is stopped. Then proceed with drilling the bone and extracting it, which can be done in one of two ways.
As for the first method, it is to cut the bone with a delicate and narrow blade. This is its form:.
Then use another cut that is slightly wider than this first cut. This is its form:.
Then use another cut that is also wider than the second. It is necessary for you to have several different cuts, some wider than others and some shorter than others. They should be sharpened to the utmost. Let them be made of Indian steel or good iron.
Use gentleness in striking the bone with the cutter to avoid disturbing the head and injuring it. If the bone is strong and hard, it should be drilled around before using the cutters they called non-inserting drills. They named them non-inserting drills for a reason.
Because it does not exceed the boundary of the skull bone to beyond it, for the drill has a round head below its sharp edge, similar to a ring or small circle, which prevents it from penetrating and exceeding the thickness of the bone.
You should take many of these needles, each suitable for the thickness of that bone, until you have a puncture for every depression with its sharp point's length and shortness according to the thickness of that depression. And this is a figure of three kinds. The needles are large, medium, and small.
And the manner of puncturing around the broken bone is that you place the needle on the bone and turn it with your fingers until you know that the bone has given way, then move the needle to another position and make the distance between each puncture about the thickness of the mattress or similar.
Then cut with the cutters between each two punctures and do this with as much gentleness as you can, as we said, until you dislodge the bone either by hand or with some other tool from one of the instruments you prepared for this purpose.
For example, with the forceps and gentle tongs, you should be extremely careful that the needle or cut does not touch the dura mater. If you secure the bone and it is free from the dura mater, and you remove it, you should cleanse it.
And smooth the roughness that remains in the bone with another instrument similar to the cutters, except that it should be thinner and more gentle than other cutters. If there is any small bone or碎片剩余，你应小心地用你手边的工具取出它们。
Then treat the wound afterwards with the sutures and ointments that will be mentioned. As for the other side of the work, it is a matter easy to determine and far from danger, as Galen mentioned it and praised it greatly. This is his saying. You should first begin by exposing the part of the bone in the place where the break is most severe and prominent. Until you have exposed that part of the bone, make a cut underneath this segment of the surgical instrument and this is its image.
The segment of the instrument should be smooth, not cutting anything, and the sharp part on its sides extending in length as you see. To make the surgical instrument rest against the table and the sharp face against the bone, then strike the instrument from one side.
With a small mallet until the entire bone is cut with care as it turns, and you are safe from the membrane no terrifying accident will occur. Even if the physician is the most ignorant and cowardly of people, yes, even if he is asleep.
If there is something attached to the bone from the membrane in some parts of the bone, scrape it off with the same sharp end of the instrument and remove it gently. For it can be removed without any pain or fear.
And if the bone break did not penetrate to the membrane, and what broke off from the bone was its end, leaving behind roughness and fine shards, it should be scraped of that roughness and the shards removed with delicate probes that you have prepared in various sizes so that you can use the most suitable one for each place as the work dictates.
And the same applies to the broken bone and its shape. You should first use wider probes for cleaning the bone, then use finer ones. Continue doing this until you are using the finest and most delicate ones.
As for other small incisions and subtle fractures, it should be treated in each one with a remedy that leads to its correction, and this is something not hidden from him who has the slightest skill in this craft and has stopped by what we have written and explained about major fractures.
If the membrane remains exposed after removing the bone, it should be treated by taking a piece of linen of the size of the wound and soaking it in rose oil ointment. Place it over the mouth of the wound. Then take another piece of linen folded or triangular. And soak it in a mixture of syrup and rose oil, then place it over the first piece of linen. Do this with the lightest material you can manage so as not to burden the membrane. Then use an宽绷带覆盖，并且不要拉得太紧，只需足够紧以固定伤口。
And keep him with this treatment for one or two days until you are certain of the subsidence of the hot swelling, then remove it and use instead the dried remedies that have a drying effect, such as the roots of snakeroot, cornsilk powder, powdered kender, and ziroud, and similar substances. You should prepare these remedies into a paste.
And apply it to the wound as it is in its dry state. In summary, use a remedy that will resolve the condition without causing pain. Strive to keep the wound clean during treatment; do not allow the oiliness of the ointment, dirtiness, or accumulation of pus at any point.
For if pus accumulates on the membrane of the brain, it corrupts and festers it, causing great debility to the patient. This may occur in the membrane of the skull when the bone is exposed, especially if he neglects its treatment.
سواد在他的表面上看去，如果出现我们所提及的那些症状，则应知道他是必死无疑的。倘若黑色仅是由于某种药物所致，并且该药物的力量足以造成这种变化。
You are to take a part of the honey and three parts of rose fat, mix them well, apply them with a cloth, place it on the sore, and then treat it with the kinds of treatment that are due until it heals.
The Third Chapter.
To reduce the nose if it breaks.
Know that the nose breaks only if both its upper cracks or one of them breaks, for they are bones. The lower part is cartilaginous and does not break; it merely suffers from swelling, bending, and softening.
If one of its cracks breaks, you should insert a small finger into the nasal aperture and straighten the break from inside with your index finger and thumb from outside. Do this gently to restore the nose to its natural shape, taking care that you do not cause pain to the patient.
If the break is in the upper part of the nose and your finger does not reach it, you should straighten it with the tip of a splint that has a slight thickness. If the break is on both sides, do the same for both. It should be reduced as soon as possible on the first day after the fracture.
If possible, do it as soon as the swelling subsides on the seventh or tenth day. Then, insert a cotton thread through the nasal aperture if the break is on one side, or two threads if the break is on both sides.
Let the graft be thick according to what fills the nasal perforation, and some of the early augmenters have mentioned that the graft should be soaked in oil and replaced every day. But I do not see this as necessary; rather, it should be soaked in egg white mixed with flour dust.
Then leave the graft until the bone is set and the cartilage adheres. And if the graft enters into the nose in place of the missing part, insert tubes of goose feather after wrapping them in soft parchment so that they are held by the broken nose more firmly, lest the patient be unable to breathe.
And this is not something necessary; if you wish to do it, you can make grafts. If a swelling hot appears in the nose during your work, apply a compress of cerecloth or a cotton pad soaked in vinegar and rose oil or some ointment of diachylon.
And if no hot swelling appears, it should be compressed from the outside with flour of wheat and pounded lentils that have been mixed with egg white. Then place a soft pad on top, but do not bind the nose at all, for if the bones of the nose break slightly.
Or if it breaks or deteriorates, it should be incised and removed with the instrument suitable for it. Then suture the incision and treat it with ointments that are adhesive and healing. If a wound occurs inside the nose, it should be treated with a graft, and goose quill tubes should be used. Until it heals.
Fourth Chapter.
To set the lower mustache, if broken.
If the lower mustache is broken and its breakage is not accompanied by a wound, I looked and found that its breakage was from the outside only and did not break in two and folded inward; then its identification becomes easier.
If the break is on the right side, insert the third finger of the left hand into the patient's mouth, and similarly, if the break is on the left side, insert the third finger of the right hand and gently lift the bump of the break from inside to outside.
With your other hand from outside the bone, control it to straighten it. If the jaw fracture is broken in two, it should be straightened using traction from both sides until it can be properly aligned. If it occurred in the teeth, they will grow back.
Or separate it by tightening what you expected to remain with a thread of gold or silver or silk, then place the cylindrical splint on the broken mustache. Put a folded cloth over it, and cover the cloth with a tight bandage or a piece of leather equal in length to the mustache. Then, tie it from above as you find appropriate for its binding and closure to prevent it from coming loose. Order the patient to rest and remain still, and give him soft food. If you think that anything has changed in the shape from any angle, release it on the third day.
Then, tie it from above as you find appropriate for its binding and closure to prevent it from coming loose. Order the patient to rest and remain still, and give him soft food. If you think that anything has changed in the shape from any angle, release it on the third day. Then, mend what you are applying with flour dust mixed with egg white or with wheat flour after removing the cylindrical splint. Place a soft pad over the dressing. As long as it sticks to that dressing and does not change the condition of the bone, leave it as is.
Do not dissolve it until it heals and the fracture becomes stronger, for this fracture often becomes stronger in three weeks. If it presents during this period with a hot swelling, use what we have mentioned repeatedly for alleviating it until that swelling goes away.
And if the fracture is with a wound, look whether it has become clean of bone碎片或骨片。用适合的工具小心地将其取出，如果伤口开口狭窄，则可用止血钳扩大其开口以满足你的需要。
Then, if you have extracted all those shards and none remain, suture the wound if it is large; otherwise, apply one of the ointments suitable for this purpose. And plaster the wound until it heals.
The Fifth Chapter.
To reduce the clavicle if it is broken.
The clavicle is broken more frequently at its anterior end, near the shoulder. When broken, it splits into two parts without any shards, and this is the easiest to reduce.
And either the break produces shards, which is harder to reduce, or the break is accompanied by a wound. If the break is without a wound, you should prepare two attendants: one to hold the arm below the broken clavicle, and the other to support the neck on the opposite side.
Then, straighten the fracture with your fingers until its shape is as it should be, without any deformity or displacement. If you need to extend it further, you should place a ball of cloth or wool under the axilla to support it.
It should be sized according to your need and stretch and raise the clavicle and press the ball with your hand until the fracture is set as it ought to be, if you are not able to draw the end of the clavicle outwards because it has gone deep then the patient should lie on his side.
A medium-sized pillow is placed under his shoulder and the pillow is pressed down on his shoulder until the clavicle, which has gone deep, rises up. Then set the fracture and straighten it with your fingers.
If you feel that a fragment of the clavicle has broken and is moving, it should be incised and that fragment should be extracted with care. If the fragment is lodged in the bone, you should try to cut it with one of the instruments prepared for this purpose. After the apparatus to fix the clavicle has become positioned under the clavicle, it is either made of wood or iron. This is its shape:.
It resembles a spoon with no handle. Its width should be according to the size of the bone, whether large or small. As for its length, it should also be suitable for the work you can perform. Let it have two ends, as you see; one end is wider and the other is narrower.
If the wound from which you removed the bone fragment is wide and there is no danger of a hot swelling, suture the lips of the wound together. If the wound is minor or if you fear a hot swelling, enlarge the wound by cutting and draining to the extent that the wound was opened.
If a hot swelling appears, wet the wound with oil of roses or vinegar or any drinkable liquid and apply it. As for tightening the clavicle if there is no wound or incision, you should apply a bandage made from flour dust mixed with egg white. You place the soft pad on it, then put the ball under his iliac region if needed. Then take a turban that is extremely long and make its width about a span or so. Next, carry a folded pad over the soft pad and bandage. Then take a splint from a thin plate. Its width should be three fingers and so should its length. Then insert it in a cloth. Next, put that cloth with the splint in the place on the turban which is over the broken area. Then tighten the turban around the break as you wrap it. Wrap it around his neck and under his healthy iliac region, and under his affected iliac region. Repeat this several times on every side, as you see fit to ensure that the pressure holds the break firmly, which is something you should understand.
Ensure that the splint does not shift from the broken bone. For this reason, you should examine the patient daily. Whenever the bandage relaxes and you see that the splint has shifted, correct it and tighten the bandage. Then make sure the patient sleeps on his back, and place a small pillow under his iliac region at night.
Lift it with it so that his shoulder rises above his side, raising the break in the clavicle as the hip rises. Alternatively, bind his arm to his neck. Do not loosen the bandage unless there is a occurrence of itch or swelling at the site for twelve days.
Then renew the bandage if you see a reason to do so. Tighten the pressure and leave it until the clavicle break heals and concretes, and this strengthening and strengthening process takes twenty-eight days. And it may be in some people in less than that.
Sixth Chapter.
In reducing a shoulder fracture. The shoulder bone breaks mostly at its narrower parts, and not in the broadest part. When it does break, it may be at an end or in the middle of the bone. This can be identified by touch. Depending on the shape of the fracture, treat accordingly.
Adjust it and return it to its natural shape using any means available. Then, place it in position with flour from a grain grinder mixed with egg white and soft padding. Place a folded cloth underneath, then apply a wide bandage from a strip.
Make it thin enough to cover the entire shoulder or slightly wider. If there is a gap in any part of the shoulder under the bandage, fill this gap with soft padding until the bandage lies flat. Then, secure it from above with a long scarf.
Tighten it firmly and ensure the bandage stays in place, so it does not shift. Check the bandage daily; if the bandage becomes loose, tighten it. If the bandage shifts, adjust its position. The patient should lie on their sound side, and the shoulder should heal in about twenty days.
For one day or twenty-five days. If the time period is complete, remove the bandage and you will be at ease; for such bones, there is no fear of them breaking or dislodging. If a shard appears from the bone and it chips under the skin, incise over it and extract it. Make what was mentioned regarding the treatment of clavicle fracture to alleviate the hot swelling if anything similar occurs.
Seventh Chapter.
To treat a broken chest.
The chest may break in its middle, and that is rare. As for its edges, they are more prone to breaking and separating. One of its symptoms, if the middle breaks, is that it will tilt downwards and cause severe pain, difficulty in breathing, and coughing.
Sometimes it may bleed, and the indentation in the broken bone can be clearly felt. To treat it, the patient should lie on his back with a cushion placed between his shoulders. Then, his elbows should be pressed down, and the ribs brought together with the hands from both sides, being careful to align them as well as possible.
And adjust it until the shape of the bone returns to what is应有的，然后在其上缠绕绷带和垫衬物，并在其上方用一层轻便的夹板，如用锡箔或类似材料制成的夹板，并将其包裹在布中。 And carefully bind it to the broken bone so that it does not move, passing the bandage around in a circular motion towards the back several times and tightening it firmly. Always check the bandage frequently, tightening it whenever it becomes loose.
And if necessity demands that it be loosened due to pain or swelling in the area, do so promptly. Remove the bandage and address any issues that arise through appropriate treatment. Then replace the bandage if you see fit. Applied pressure and tightened it until it healed.
Chapter Eight.
In reducing broken ribs, know that rib fractures occur only in the tough areas behind the chest and their extremities at the front. Such fractures are caused by compression, as these areas are costal. This can be recognized by touch during examination with fingers.
Reduce them by aligning the fracture with the fingers in a manner that the shape becomes proper, then apply a compress and bind the broken bone with a bandage if needed. If the rib fracture is sunken inward, it will cause severe pain to the patient.
And it collapses like the collapse that occurs in someone with pleurisy, because the bone collapses the diaphragm and also causes shortness of breath, coughing, and a great deal of blood vomiting. This is difficult to treat, and the ancients devised many remedies for it.
Some said that one should give the patient foods that generate flatulence to cause distension of the abdomen, and for the fracture to extend outward. We dislike this because it may lead to the confirmation of a hot swelling if it does not occur; but if it has occurred, it will worsen and confirm it.
Some said that a deobstruent should be placed at the site, then strongly suctioned. This is more like a measurement, except that it is feared that the deobstruent might be drawn out of place due to its weakened state. Some others said that the area should be covered with cloth soaked in hot oil.
And it becomes a padding between the ribs until it is full, making the ligament level when wrapped in a round shape, then treat the illness with the treatment of poultice from food and medicine, for if it burdens the illness, it is severe and cannot be endured. And the bone would pierce the diaphragm painfully and we feared for the illness, so it should be necessary to incise the place and reveal the broken rib. Then we would place under it the apparatus that preserves the cranial cavity, as its description was given earlier, and cut the bone gently and remove it.
Then we gather the wound's lips if it is large with suturing and treat it with ointments until it heals. If a hot swelling appears during this, act quickly by placing padding in rose oil and put it on the place, and treat the illness from within also to soothe the swelling.
And he should lie on the side that helps him sleep until he heals.
Chapter Nine.
On the Reduction of Dislocations of the Spine and Neck.
As for the neck bones, if they suffer a fracture and such injuries are rare, while dislocations are more common. Similarly with the vertebrae of the spine; when such conditions affect someone, and you wish to determine whether they will heal or not. Then examine them, and if you see that their hands are relaxed and numb, with no sensation or movement in them, neither able to stretch nor contract, and when you press on them or prick them with a needle, they do not feel it or find any pain in them, know that in most cases they will not heal and are lost.
And if he moves them and feels with the probe and percussion, know that the marrow of the bone is sound and the disease will be cured by treatment. If a vertebra received such an injury and you wish to know whether it will also be cured or not.
And look at his feet; if you see that they have become flaccid and what happened to the hands has also occurred in them, then when he lies on his back, wind and feces come out without intention, and if he lies on his stomach, urine comes out without intention. And if he lies on his back and intends to urinate but is unable to do so, know that he is hopeless; do not expect to cure him. If nothing like this has occurred, the matter is less severe. The treatment for what has happened can be attempting to relieve the hot swelling.
By placing on the tender vertebra pure rose oil or with roasted egg yolks. Apply this three times a day until the hot swelling subsides, then apply one of the strengthening and drying compresses and bind it with a bandage, and order him to rest and remain calm.
And he must not sleep except on the side that does not cause him pain until he recovers. If a fragment or something has been removed from the bone when it was tender, it should be necessary to incise his skin and extract that bone. Then gather the lips of the wound if it is large by suturing, then treat with healing ointments until it heals. If the last bone of the hyoid breaks, which is the heel of the foot, it should be necessary to insert the thumb from the left hand into the sinus.
and the broken bone is straightened with the other hand according to what can be done and achieved, then it is dressed with a bandage and a splint if needed, then it is tied up.
If you feel a broken fragment in it, split it and extract it, and treat the wound as previously mentioned until it heals.
The Tenth Chapter.
To treat a break in the thigh bone.
Rarely do the thigh bones break; if they do, the break may fragment at the ends, split lengthwise, or tilt inward. The patient will experience pain at the site and swelling and numbness in the leg on the side of the fracture.
To treat it, pass your hand over it until you locate the break and determine its shape. If the break is only at the ends, straighten that break according to what appears best for the alignment until it resembles its natural shape.
If the break is lengthwise or has tilted inward, place the patient on their stomach so that you can straighten the break. Once it is aligned, apply a bandage to it, then place a splint made of wood or leather over it and tie it securely.
Do not fear the transfer of the fracture or the removal of the splint. Align the depression in the trochanter with what fills it until it takes hold and is straightened. Order the patient to sleep on their back or on the healthy side, as a hot swelling may appear.
Withdraw and immobilize him until the hot swelling subsides, then apply what soothes it as previously mentioned. Afterwards, return to immobilizing and securing him as should be done. If there appears in the bone碎片或从其边缘断裂出什么东西，那么不应取出。
And do not touch it but correct it from outside as we said, and leave its securing until it heals.
The Twelfth Chapter.
In the Immobilization of Breaks in the Femur.
The femur is the bone from the elbow to the shoulder joint. If it breaks, immobilize it in one of two ways. One way is to take a curved, smooth, medium-sized rod approximately like this:
And bind ropes at both ends. Then hang it from a high place. The patient sits on a chair. Then place his broken arm on the rod until his elbow adheres to the middle of the curve of the rod. Then hang something heavy from above.
Or have an attendant lower him slowly. Then the doctor will set the break with his hands until the fracture is reduced properly. The other method is for the patient to lie on his back with his hands over his head, and bind his wrist from his neck.
Then order attendants to hold the upper part of the break with one hand and the lower part with the other. Each should extend his part towards his side. If you want the extension to be stronger, bind below the break with a rope and above it with another rope, and each attendant should extend their parts towards their respective sides.
If the fracture is near the upper arm, the middle part of the bandage should be under the elbow and the other part near the fracture towards the shoulder. Similarly, if the fracture is near the shoulder, the bandage should be applied in that position and also around the shoulder itself.
Then the fracture is reduced gently without force until the fracture sets properly and aligns well. Then it should be tightened if no hot swelling appears. If a hot swelling does appear, then do not tighten it on the seventh day. Apply a cooled cotton soaked in vinegar and apply rose oil.
Until the swelling subsides, then tighten it. The method of tightening is to place the bandage over the fracture, then wrap a new cloth strip over the bandage, then bring the arm around the back in the same position and place his hand open on his elbow.
And place the cloth and bandage around the back and arm, so that the arm can serve as a substitute for splints if nothing prevents you from doing so and if there is no change in the broken bone. If you fear any change in the broken bone, use splints.
Place a splint directly on the fracture that is wider and stronger than the other splints. Leave a space of one finger between each splint. The length of the splints should be according to the fracture, with an additional three fingers on each side.
Then tighten the splints with the tension you mentioned at the beginning of the chapter.
Then, make the tension at the site of the fracture stronger.
And the more distant the fracture is from you, the less tension there will be. If you see that placing the splints and applying the tension as we said when setting the limb at your convenience, then do so.
And if you fear the hot swelling, leave the tension and splints for the seventh day as we said. Then examine the ligament every three days so that there does not occur in the area itching or puffiness or food is prevented from reaching the limb due to过度，所有问题都可以通过我们所说的进行矫正。
If you are certain that nothing of the sort will happen, then release the ligament after many days. The patient should lie on his back with his hands on his abdomen. A pillow filled with wool, not too hard or too soft, should be placed under the arm.
Examine at any time, day or night, to ensure that the shape of the broken limb does not deteriorate or that the ligament does not relax. Correct all this with your efforts. Ensure the patient's food is gentle first, and only gradually make it more substantial as the bone begins to heal.
It is necessary to strengthen his food. For it is customary for the arm and leg to become strong in forty days. Then, you should release the splints and use wet compresses, applying ointments suitable for this purpose. If the fracture is severe and painful, additional treatments should be considered.
Do not remove the ligament until fifty days or two months.
The Twelfth Chapter.
In setting the broken arm.
The arm consists of two bones and is called the zanda. One is small and is below the elbow, and the other is large and is positioned underneath the small one from below. Perhaps only the largest zanda may break, or only the small one, or both together.
When the upper small bone (zanda) breaks, its setting is easy and recovery faster. When the lower bone breaks, its breaking is worse and recovery more difficult. If both bones break together, it is the worst.
The physician should make the setting gentle with care until it is set properly. If only the large zanda is broken, the setting should be stronger. If both zanda bones are broken, the setting should be much stronger.
The shape of the hand should be maintained during setting and reduction, with the hand extended on a pillow. The wrist should be higher than all the fingers, and the ring finger should be lower than the other fingers. The patient should be seated in a reclining position.
Let the pillow be at the same height so that the patient does not have to strain himself.
Then, the arm should be extended from below either by hand or with a bandage. Another assistant should extend it from above as well. Then, the physician should set the bone, aligning it to the best shape possible. If there are shards in the break, they should be removed.
Restore each shard to its place with effort. If a detached shard is visible and causes the skin to peel, there is no hope for setting it, so cut into it and extract it according to the method described earlier. If the fracture is accompanied by a wound, it has been given a separate section.
If you take the treatment from there, if a hot tumor appears at the beginning of your operation, apply a cloth with cinnabar prepared with rose oil and white wax, let it be moderately between thickness and softness, and gently press the cloth on it until the tumor subsides.
Remove the cinnabar and place the dressing prepared from flour dust with egg white. Then apply the splints; let the splint that is placed on the fracture itself be wider slightly and stronger. Know that the number of arm splints is six in most cases.
If the fracture is in one pin or in both pins together, then make your compression at the site of the fracture stronger and tighter. Whenever you turn the compression upwards or downwards, make the tension a bit looser as mentioned at the beginning of this chapter.
Let the cloth wrapping around the fracture be soft and slightly moist, not too stiff. Let the silk thread with which it is tightened be moderately between softness and thickness as we have described. Examine the limb and ligament after a few days.
If anything that needs correction happens, such as itching in the limb, it should be immersed in warm water until the itch subsides. The limb should then be left loose overnight to rest, and compression can be reapplied the next day.
If the compression has relaxed or the bone has moved, or if there is any such issue, make every effort to correct it. Also, check if the nourishment is prevented from reaching the limb due to excessive compression. In such a case, loosen it slightly and leave it for a few days until the nourishment can reach it again, then apply compression.
If nothing of what we have mentioned appears in the patient, he ought not to be relieved of restrictions only after twenty days or so. Then the limb of the patient should be suspended around his neck and let it be moderate, and he should take care to avoid violent movements and make his sleep on his back.
And know that this fracture of the arm will heal in thirty days or in thirty-one, and it might heal in twenty-eight days. All of this depends on the conditions of the humors and the state of strength.
The Thirteenth Chapter.
For the Healing of Fractures of the Hand Wrist and Fingers.
The comb of the hand and the phalanges rarely sustain fractures, but they often suffer from sprains. If a fracture or sprain occurs in the hand, proceed as follows.
The patient ought to sit upright with a chair level in front of him.
Then place his hand extended in front of him. Extend the broken bones and the physician shall adjust them until they heal properly. Then he ought to carry the bandage and the discomfort, unless there is a hot swelling, and then apply an external plaster to the area.
And I have included it in a soft cloth. If the fracture is downward towards the palm of the hand, make a sort of ball from cloth and order the patient to grasp it with his broken hand. Then tie it with a long piece of cloth.
And let the plaster be made of skin with a soft lining so that the skin can adhere to the bending of all the hand, and tie it securely. If the fracture is outward, the plaster should be applied from above and another below the hand to keep the hand open and straight.
Then the tension is applied as the hand turns and the fingers are interwoven with the bandage. If the fracture is on one of the phalanges, and it is the thumb, then it should be adjusted as fits, then tightened with the hand. And if you wish to make a small standing splint for it to set the fracture.
And it should not move. If the fracture is on any other finger, such as the middle, ring, or little finger, then it should be adjusted and bound with the adjacent correct finger, or all of them should be bound together, which is better, or a small standing splint should be placed on it.
As we said about the thumb, and inspect during and after setting it for the hot tumor, opposing it as fits if anything like that occurs, as his description is repeated.
Fourteenth Chapter.
On Setting a Fracture of the Thigh.
The thigh bone is often fractured and can be detected by touch because it turns frontward and backward. Its setting involves tightening a bandage above the fracture and another below the fracture, with the patient lying on his face.
Then, each bandage is extended to its side with moderation if the fracture is in the middle of the bone. If it is close to the thigh root, it should be tightened with a softer bandage made of cotton or similar material.
At the thigh root near the groin, let the tension be applied upwards and the bandage below the fracture. Similarly, if the fracture is near the knee, place the bandage near the knee to apply tension downwards. Then, the doctor should adjust the bone with both hands until it is restored to its natural shape.
The bone fuses well. Then it should be bound and tightened. If no swelling occurs in the part, bind and tighten it. But if swelling hot to the touch does occur, leave it alone for several days until the hot swelling subsides, then return to treating it.
As for tightening it, it should be bound around the fracture with a wide bandage two or three times, leaving enough to tie. Then bind the leg so that the heel is at the base of the knee. Insert a long thread between the thigh and the leg near the knee from below, with the ends of the thread on top from both sides.
Then wrap the remaining bandage around the leg and thigh. Place the plaster on the thigh at the same location as the fracture, using one plaster for the femur. Fill the gap between the thigh and leg with soft cloth to ensure even tension.
Then begin with strong binding from the middle at the location of the fracture three or four wraps. As you move the bandage away from the fracture site, make your binding weaker, softer, and less tight.
Then attend to the ends of the thread you inserted between the thigh and leg. Bind with these what follows above from the plasters. Then pass the ends of the thread down until you reach the heel, tightening them also with the other ends of the plasters on the other side.
To prevent the bandage from shifting from its place, then leave the tension on it as long as the part does not show any signs of hunger or swelling or distension and the like. If anything of that occurs, address it promptly and remedy whatever happens due to that as we have mentioned repeatedly.
If there is a splinter in the bone that dislodges, it should be smoothed if possible; otherwise, split the bone and extract it, and treat the wound as previously described until it heals. This fracture of the thigh may be stabilized without adding the leg with external braces.
As we have mentioned in the case of the upper arm and forearm, though its treatment does not generally cause a deformity in walking if treated alone without adding the leg with external braces, it is inevitable that the patient will become lame.
And know that the thigh strengthens in fifty days or a little more or a little less, all of which depends on the variation of humors and other conditions.
Fifteenth Chapter.
In the Fracture of the Upper Part of the Knee.
The upper part of the knee is rarely fractured, though it can occur frequently in infants. If a fracture does occur, it can be either a split or a fragmentation of its parts, and can accompany a wound or not.
And determine this by touch, and treat it by smoothing what has separated in its parts with the fingers until they come together and unite according to what can be achieved through proper alignment, care, and skill. Then apply a bandage and use a circular brace if necessary.
And tighten from above the appropriate ligature. Then attend to all the conditions we described for other fractures, such as the hot swelling, by opposing each symptom with what is suitable until it heals.
Sixteenth Chapter.
In the Reduction of Break in the Shin Bone.
The shin has two bones, one thick and called the shin bone, and the other thin and called the tibia. Both are subject to fractures of the types that affect the bones of the arm. Therefore, its reduction is the same as that of the arm, with the same procedures. If both bones are broken, the shin can turn in all directions. If only the thinner bone is broken, the shin turns forward. If only the thicker bone is broken and this happens lower down, it is something you are well aware of.
Apply stretching and realignment, and immobilize the fractures accordingly. However, if the shin bone fracture is severe with many shards, the stretching should be less intense, and you should exercise great care in its reduction.
And for the shin, there is an additional step compared to the arm: if you have finished aligning the bones and completed all your work, take two fescue sticks of pine wood used for leveling rooms placed between the cracks of wooden planks, or they can be made from palm leaves or similar materials.
Choose from them those that are slightly thick, and do not use thin strips. Let their length be the same as the length of the shin from the knee to the bottom. Then wrap each with two cloth strips along its length, placing one strip on the shin and the other on the opposite side.
Let them extend from the knee to the bottom of the foot, then tie the fescue sticks in three positions at the ends and in the middle. With this bandage, it will prevent the shin from tilting left or right, providing a good support. A wooden splint can also be used along the length of the shin.
It is placed therein to preserve it from movement. And more often you should do that in the fracture if there is a wound, especially. Then inspect the leg every day and pay great attention to it regarding the swelling or distension or any of the rest thereof. When such a thing happens, meet it with what should be done until it heals. And the fracture of the shinbone mends in about thirty days or so.
Seventeenth Chapter.
In the Fracture of Bones of the Leg and Fingers.
As for the heel, it never fractures. As for the bones of the leg, they may fracture, and the fingers also rarely fracture; in most cases, it is a dislocation that occurs.
If the bones of the leg fracture and you see that some of these bones have approached each other, let the injured person place his foot on the ground upright as when walking. Then stand yourself and place your foot on what has risen from those bones, and press it and level it.
Until it returns to its places, then carry the bandage and pad from above and place beneath the sole of the foot a small board with two flat heads. Then tightly bind the foot with it after wrapping it in cloth and whatever else you need.
After three or four days have passed, release the bandage. You will find the bones either broken and level or dislocated; in either case, proceed as you see fit. If only some fingers are fractured, reduce them and align them as you were shown for reducing the fingers of the hand.
Then make a splint for the broken finger along its length, and let it be slightly wider than it. Then place this board under the foot as described and secure it tightly. If the bones that broke were two or three or more.
Then make a splint for each finger of its size cut from a soft cloth and secure the board at the bottom of the foot. Let each end of the board's head extend slightly beyond the sole of the foot to fasten well.
And you should not forget to attend to all that we have mentioned for other fractures from the symptoms we have described and counter each symptom with what is appropriate.
The Eighteenth Chapter.
On the Fracture of the Pubis in Women and the Os Ischii in Men.
If the vagina of a woman is broken, seat her upright. Then lean her slightly backward, and have someone hold her from behind. The midwife should then pack the vagina with cotton until it is filled and becomes spherical within her.
Then shake the woman gently, raising her spine slightly. This cotton will come out until it is at the entrance of the vagina, like a ball, and the bone fracture will heal. Then place a pad on her back. When she wants to urinate, remove the cotton gently until she has finished.
Then replace it as you first inserted it. Return to her initial padding. Do this for seven days or so, as it will heal. If you wish, you may use a sheep's bladder; tie a tube at its mouth and insert the entire bladder into her vagina.
Then blow into the tube with force until the bladder swells inside the vagina; the fracture will return to place, then stuff it with cotton and keep her for days as described until she recovers. As for when the os coccyx of a man or woman is broken, in its correction use what we have used.
And I have described it as we have outlined for the hip bone. It is not hidden from you which is correct in these rare fractures, especially for those who have some skill. Indeed, the fracture itself indicates to you most of the time.
And proceed correctly in its correction and traction, understand. As for a man's penis that broke the thigh, place the penis inside an ass's bladder, then wrap it with a cloth bandage and leave it alone for three days or so until it heals.
Nineteenth Chapter.
In the correction of bone fractures if accompanied by a wound.
It is necessary for those who have presented with a fracture accompanied by a wound, especially if the bone is large, such as the thigh or upper arm or similar, to act promptly and cauterize it from its time, provided that the conditions for cauterization are present as we have mentioned.
If the wound is bleeding, you should promptly cauterize it by applying a hot, powdered substance if nothing else is available. Then proceed with the correction of the fracture on that same day without delay.
If there is no hot swelling, then if a hot swelling does occur, delay the correction until the ninth day till the hot swelling subsides. Do not approach it on the third and fourth days at all, as it would expose it to bad symptoms.
If the broken bone is exposed through the skin, it should be reduced and aligned with your hands gently, moving it slightly. If you are unable to reduce and align it with your hands, use this instrument which is made of iron, its length being that of seven or eight fingers. Exposure to the extent of the wound.
Therefore, the doctor should take three or four, according to what he needs for treatment in each type of fracture. Let them be slightly thick so that they do not bend when pricked during work.
And let the tip be sharp with a bend at its tip. Let its upper part be relatively thick, and the lower half very thin. This is its shape:.
And it is called in Greek as "perim," which means a small splint. It should have its sharp bent tip placed on the exposed bone and be pushed once, until the bone returns and achieves some alignment. Then, align the ends of the fracture with each other.
If its broken tip is thin and the instrument does not grasp it well, it should be cut off so that the instrument can grip it properly. If you are unable to reduce the bone as described, cut it as similar to the cuts we have mentioned.
Or spread it with one of the forceps as much as possible. Then, remove any roughness and thin layers of skin from the bone. If you reduce the bone and the patient experiences severe pain after reduction, know that the bone has not returned to its natural position.
If you are able to return it to its natural place, do so, for thou wilt greatly benefit the patient. When thou hast completed the setting of the bone, immerse a cloth in a black astringent drink, especially if it be summer, and apply no cerate or anything oily to the wound.
Lest corruption and decay occur in it, then use the splints when thou hast completed the setting of the bone and leave the wound uncovered by cutting a hole in the bandages to the extent of the wound.
Be very careful not to tighten the wound with the fracture, for many unskilled physicians have done this and caused harm to their patients, either death or an infection or inflammation. Let your tightening be soft and relaxed, differing from the tightening of other fractures.
If the wound is bad or is a large wound and you fear some of the bad symptoms we have described, and he finds pain in the place troubling, then you should not put splints on it. Make bandages from firm cloths in the place of the splints and bind him with them.
If after one or two days you see that the wound has begun to produce pus, remove from it the cloth you put on with the drink. Then use the ligatures and ointments which we are accustomed to apply to wounds, such as the quadruple ointment and similar ones. You should loosen the bandage.
You should inspect the wound in the evening and morning until it heals and recovers. It is necessary that the limb be positioned so that the pus flows down easily. If days pass and the wound does not heal, and the pus continues to drain, know that there are small shards of bone present.
It is necessary to examine the wound with a probe; if any of those fragments are clean, remove and extract them. If they are not completely cleansed and cause irritation and pain to the tissue, insert and extract them in every way possible that you can.
If the wound shows signs of decay or putrefaction or any other form of corruption and foulness, it is necessary to treat each sign with a remedy similar to that described in its respective section.
And you should understand and keep in mind when I say that if a large bone, such as the thigh or the upper arm and similar major bones, is fractured and there is displacement of the bone on the tissue, do not attempt to pull it or extract it. For often such cases result in death. Therefore, leave it alone until it putrefies; perhaps it will fall off by itself after twenty or thirty days.
Then treat the wound if you see a place for treatment; otherwise, leave it alone.
Chapter Twenty.
On the Treatment of Putrefaction That Occurs Following Some Fractures.
Putrefaction often occurs following the healing of fractures, especially those near joints. It can distort the shape of the limb and may even prevent the limb from performing its natural functions.
Examine it; if the putrefaction is soft, use remedies that constrict, such as camphor, frankincense, bitter substances, dragon's blood, and acaicia, or any combination of these. Mix them with a constricting decoction, egg white, or vinegar.
It should be complicated by difficulty and tension, and it should be tightly bound upon her. Leave the binding until she cannot bear it for many days, then loosen it and replace it with another until the complication goes away by God's will, or bind it with a tight sheet of tested lead.
If lead has the property of dissipating whatever is constricted in the organs, and if the complication has hardened and intensified and necessity compels you to remove it, cut into its upper part and remove the discharged matter or scrape it out with some sharp instruments until it dissolves, and treat the wound until it heals.
Chapter Twenty-One.
In the treatment of fractures, if the bone unites but the limb remains soft and different from its original state.
If a bone fracture unites but the limb remains soft and weak, this is due to many reasons. One of the reasons is either too frequent loosening of the ligaments and tying them improperly, or excessive tightness in tying the ligaments to the extent that it prevents nutrition from reaching the limb, or excessive and improper tapping, or excessive movements at inappropriate times, or a lack of blood in the sick person's body and his weakness.
Treatment involves nourishing the sick person and enriching his body until the blood increases in him. Use of baths, inducing joy and happiness, and similar methods should be employed. Then apply fomentation to the limb to attract much nutrition onto it or repeatedly tap it with lukewarm water. Until the food is processed and returns to its natural shape.
The Twenty-Second Chapter.
In the treatment of broken bones if they unite crooked and prevent functioning as they should.
When a member, which has healed after suppuration, shows distortion or displacement of the broken bone, or complication and deformity affecting the shape of the member. Except that if the member does not prevent its natural function, there is no need to accept the claim of someone who asserts that one can break a healed limb from its root. For this was done by many unlearned doctors and bone setters in our country.
And this action is severely condemned, leading to great harm made easier by the condition of the injury. But if the distortion and complication are flexible, it should be treated with water in which relaxing herbs have been cooked, such as hollyhock leaf, root, and crown imperial, and similar substances.
And it should be dressed with relaxing poultices such as well-made diachylon or taken from the sap of the root of hollyhock, mixed with chicken fat and shiraj ointment, and applied. Or, dates can be ground with pigeon droppings and similar medicines known as emollients.
And the complication should dissolve with the constant gentle massage using hands, and the movement of the member should be directed to every direction at all times. If the distortion has become severe and hardened, and it is necessary to treat it with iron.
It is necessary to incise above and separate the bone connection, and cut what remains of the complexity or bone with gentle cuts, using great care and gentleness. Then treat the wound as previously mentioned until it heals.
The Twenty-Third Chapter.
The jaw is a joint that has come out of its proper place, thereby obstructing movement and disfiguring the limb. It causes severe pain and discomfort to the patient. If such a condition occurs, it is necessary to promptly reduce the dislocation.
It should not be delayed at all, for if delayed, the area will swell and become inflamed, making it more difficult to reduce the dislocation. Therefore, it should not be delayed or moved while it is swollen, as it often causes severe cramps and painful discomfort to the patient.
But if this occurs, it should be promptly treated by reducing the dislocation. Then, it should be left to allow the swelling to subside a little. Afterward, the limb should be treated with hot water and oil. Finally, the dislocation should be reduced gently, and each part should be treated as described in its respective section.
And I have also arranged the chapters on the jaw in accordance with what was mentioned for fractures, from the upper part of the body to the lower part.
The Twenty-Fourth Chapter.
On the Treatment of Dislocation of the Lower Jaw.
Scarcely do the jaws dislocate except in rarity, and their displacement occurs in one of two ways: either they slip from their places slightly, becoming somewhat relaxed, or they completely dislocate entirely, becoming fully relaxed. To the vicinity of the chest until the patient's saliva flows, he is unable to control it and cannot apply his jaw; his tongue jumbles in speech. If his dislocation is slight, it often returns on its own with the easiest effort.
And if the dislocation is complete, it should be restored with urgency and not be delayed at all. This involves a servant holding the patient's head, while the doctor inserts his single finger at the root of the jaw inside the patient's mouth if the jaw is dislocated from one side.
Or he should insert both his fingers if the jaw is dislocated from both sides, and with the rest of his fingers outside, he should manipulate them, ordering the patient to relax his jaw and let it go to every side. The doctor should realign the jaw and push the jaw back until it returns to its place.
If it is difficult to reduce them, especially if both jaws are involved, apply a cloth soaked in hot water and ointment until they become easier to reduce. Do not delay their reduction at all, as we have said. Once they return and align, and the patient's mouth closes properly without relaxation, then place on them ligatures of sutures made from wax, oil, and resin.
Then, tie them gently with a relaxed bandage. Let the patient sleep on his back with his head elevated between two pillows to prevent him from moving right or left. He should not strain to chew anything; instead, provide him with soft, easy-to-eat food.
Until the pain disappears and the jaw has healed, let him eat what he wishes and open his mouth gently when eating, drinking, or yawning. He should not force his mouth open until the jaw is fully healed and the wound is cured.
If there is difficulty in closing the jaws when they separate at times and do not return to their places, this often leads to fever and constant headache. The stomach may be affected and may release air frequently, and he may vomit pure bile. If you see this, know that it is a disorder.
Often, those affected by this die within ten days.
The Twenty-Fifth Chapter.
On the Closure of the Hyoid Bone and the Angle of the Jaw.
As for the hyoid bone, it does not separate on the inner side because of its connection to the chest. It may separate towards the outer side, and this can be felt. To treat it, the patient should lie on his back and stretch his arms.
Then press the area with your hand firmly; it will return. Place a compress and a bandage over it and secure them. As for the part that follows the angle of the jaw and is connected to it, it does not dislocate except rarely. If it does dislocate at any time, it should be reduced and aligned as we have mentioned and as is appropriate for you.
Then place a compress and bandage over it, secure it with a bandage, and order the patient to remain in quiet rest until he recovers. By this same treatment, you can reduce the angle of the jaw if it also dislocates from its place.
The Twenty-Sixth Chapter.
In the Correction of the Shoulder Jaw.
Know that the shoulder can dislocate in three directions. The first is downward towards the elbow and downwards. The second is forward towards the chest, and it might dislocate upwards towards the shoulder itself. This occurs rarely.
And it does not dislocate to the rear because of the shoulder's position, nor to the front due to the nerve. It is more common for it to dislocate and come out downward towards the elbow, especially in those with little flesh, as it comes out quickly and goes back in quickly.
As for those with much flesh, it is the opposite; I mean that it comes out with difficulty and goes back in with difficulty. It might happen to some people that they receive a blow or fall, causing swelling of the shoulder joint with a hot inflammation. They may think that it has dislocated, but it should be examined to determine its actual condition.
Then proceed with its treatment. The shoulder jaw can be identified as dislocated downward toward the elbow if you find a clear difference between the dislocated and the normal shoulder when brought together. You will notice that the head of the dislocated shoulder is displaced, and upon touching below the elbow, it feels like an egg.
The patient cannot raise his hand to his ear nor move it through all its motions. Similarly, if it dislocates toward the chest or above, you will find this obvious upon touch, as it is not hidden.
And this shoulder jaw can be easily reduced if it is soft or if the patient is a child. To reduce it, you should raise the patient's hand above and place your thumbs under his elbow, then lift the joint with strength upward to its proper position. The attendant should raise the patient's hand and extend it above.
Then it descends down, for it returns quickly. If it does not return as mentioned and the jaw has been since last occurred for many days, it should be washed in hot water and use nontul (a relaxant) and soften like boiling the tips of onion, cumin, and crown flower in water and use.
Then the patient lies on his back and a ball of wool is placed under his waist, being moderate between soft and hard. Then the physician places his buttocks on the ball and holds the patient's hand with his hand and extends it downward.
He pushes the ball with his foot; then it returns to a standing position. If you wish to return it in this manner, prepare a leg longer than that of the patient and hold him from the side. Insert his armpit under the waist of the patient and raise his waist above, so that the patient is suspended in the air. And another attendant pulls the patient's hand downward by his abdomen. If the patient is light, it should be hung with something else to weigh him down; then the jaw will return to its place. It may also be returned in another manner.
And it should be done by focusing a long plank, with its head round like the pestle of a mortar, neither too thick nor too thin. Then place this under the waist of the patient after putting a soft pad on the head of the plank. The patient should stand along the length of the plank.
Then extend his hand downward from the other side and also extend his body from the other side with force. The joint will return to its place quickly. If it is difficult to return it even with all that we have mentioned, use this treatment: take a plank about two cubits long. And expose it to the size of four fingers and narrow it to the size of two fingers, making its head round so that it can easily enter the depth of the elbow in this manner.
Then tie on the round head a soft ligature lest it injure the delicate bone. Then place it under the elbow and extend the whole hand and the arm on the bone to the bottom, and tie the bone onto the back, the elbow, and the end of the hand.
Then place the arm on a frame. Slide it across and extend the hand to the bottom. Leave the rest of the body suspended from the other side, for the joint will enter in its natural way. If it enters in any manner that is possible, it should be placed under the elbow a medium-sized ball of wool.
Then the prepared bandage with flour of wheat, frankincense, and egg white is applied to the entire thigh as it turns from above. Then tightly pull the ball from under the elbow and tie it with the bandage from above, suspending his hand to his neck.
And let him not move his hand for seven days. It is best that the food of the delicate be little until the limb strengthens, as it is quicker to heal due to its goodness. Then it may be released after seven or five days and be trained with movement. If it has held firm and does not relax, then it is healed.
If the joint dislocates repeatedly due to moisture or another affliction, it should be treated with cauterization using three cautery rods as described in the section on cauterization. If all this is done and the bandage is released after seven days and the joint has not stabilized, then proceed accordingly.
I applied the bandage and tightened it several times, but it did not hold. It fell off and relaxed, and you were unable to raise it above. Know then that the nerve in the head of the femur has either snapped or stretched or weakened. Thus, know that the joint will never be stable in its place.
As for the jaw which is near the chest and breast and behind, it is reduced by pushing and stretching with the hands until it returns. All kinds of tightening and treatment are used in it until it heals. If a body appears after the healing in the part and moves slowly.
Let the patient use the bath frequently until that body becomes soft and returns to its original nature.
The Seventh and Twenty-Seventh.
In the Treatment of the Elbow Jaw.
The elbow joint dislocates with difficulty and also reduces with difficulty. It dislocates in all directions, especially向前或向后。你无需费力解开它，因为它是可以看到和触摸到的。
And if you compare the dislocated elbow with the normal one, you will recognize it clearly by examining the joint. It cannot bend the arm nor can its knee touch it. You should act quickly and reduce the jaw before a hot swelling appears on it.
For if a hot swelling appears, it is difficult to reduce and may never heal completely, especially if the jaw has dislocated backward, for this is the worst and most painful type of dislocation, and often death follows it.
Jebbuh idha kana mimmā yaṭruqu anzaluhu ann yumadda khudm yadhayhi kabatay yiḍayhi wa durra'ahay muswatīyya wādaya al-tibbiyya min awwalfirāqi wa min thathah wa huwa yadfa'u al-mufassil bi-'abhamay yiḍayhi kullā->{'} aw baaṣil kafayhi hattā yarbu'u ilá maḍawahum.
And if the jaw is to the front, it may be reduced by bending the hand once until it strikes the upper arm's base which it adjoins. If the jaw does not return upon this, apply strong and powerful traction; this is to extend the arm fully with both hands.
And the patient should be held with both hands also, lest it slip during traction. Then, wrap the arm in a cloth folded or a wide cloth, and when the doctor grasps the joint, rub it with oil to facilitate the gliding of the joint easily.
Then, he should apply strong pressure to the joint until it returns. After its return, it should be immobilized with a bandage that includes compression and drying, along with egg white. The arm should be tightly bound, and hung from the neck of the patient for several days.
Then, resolve it. If the joint remains in its place, release the ligament and leave it alone. If you find that the joint has not strengthened sufficiently, reapply the bandage and ligament and leave it for several days until it strengthens, then release it. If any issue arises after the return of the joint and its release, resolve it accordingly.
And if there is difficulty in movement, he should use moistening in the bath, gentle massage, and kneading until it softens. Alternatively, place a fatty pad on the joint, bind it, and leave it there for one day and one night. Then remove it and immerse him in the bath. If he sweats, gently rub the joint with moderate friction.
Then adjust the appliance again once and twice with the entry of the bath until it softens, and if you wish to place upon it raw cowhide softened with oil and tie it to him do that repeatedly as it softens and returns to its original state.
The Twenty-Eighth Chapter.
Treatment of the Wrist.
The wrist of the hand often dislocates, and reducing its dislocation is easier than that of other joints. However, it should be reduced at the hour when it dislocates before the place is lost or a hot swelling appears.
To reduce its dislocation, place the injured wrist on a board. Have an attendant extend the hand and position the doctor's hand on the back of the wrist joint. Push it gently until it returns to place, unless it has already dislocated to the palm of the hand.
Let the injured person place the back of his hand on the board during extension and flexion. If the dislocation is visible on the back of the hand, let him place the palm of his hand on the board so that the doctor's hand can be placed on the same part of the joint. If it returns to place at this moment, otherwise, apply a compress to relieve swelling.
Leave it alone and do not attempt to reset it, for it cannot be handled and you will not be able to reduce it after a few days. However, the joint will remain in its dislocated position without causing any harm to the injured person, except that the hand may become limp and unable to grasp anything.
Then you will know that the nerve is severed or detached, and there is no remedy for it except to apply traction. It may help sometimes but may not be effective at all. Once the wrist has been reduced, apply the compress as described, then tie it up and leave it alone for five days.
Then it is treated and trained, for if its movement is impaired and something affects the hand from the body, it should be softened with warm water and rubbed several times until it becomes pliable.
The Twenty-Ninth Chapter.
In the Treatment of Separating Fingers.
The fingers may separate in all directions. When a finger separates towards the back of the hand or the palm, extend the finger and push the separation with your thumb until it returns to place. Then tie the tip of the finger and hang it towards the direction it separated to.
Leave it for two days, then release and extend it until it straightens. On that day, if it separates at night, tie it as described. Continue to treat it during the day by releasing and extending it, and train it with movement, and tie it at night. Do this for several days until it strengthens.
And similarly, treat it if it separates towards the palm by tying it towards the same direction and do as your first treatment until it heals. Similarly, treat it if it separates in any other direction.
The Thirtieth Chapter.
In the Treatment of Separating Pearl Beads in the Back.
When a pearl bead from the back or neck beads separates completely, or many beads are dislodged from their places, there is no treatment for it, as death will hasten to the patient.
And the sign of this is that the patient's feces are discharged without intention, as he cannot retain it. Often, some of his limbs relax from it, either his legs or his arms or one of them. If only one bead is dislodged from its place, it often falls off.
And its disappearance towards four directions: that which disappears towards the back is called convex. As for its treatment, then look; if the convexity has occurred from childhood, then there is no treatment in it nor any cure at all. As for that which has occurred from a fall or a blow and the like, then [its treatment differs].
And I have mentioned the early ones with various forms of treatment in long words that do not return more benefit than less. I have shortened what they brought, coming close to the meaning and explaining it, and illustrated the instrument differently from what they explained and described.
And I say that the convexity which occurs from the front in the chest has no remedy nor cure for it. Similarly, this is the case with that which occurs towards both sides. Only that which occurs in the back should be treated with what I am describing. And the treatment is to extend the affected area on its side.
Place a level board close to the wall and extend a wet cloth underneath it so that it does not hurt his chest. Then place a board upright in a hole in the ground at one end of the board toward his head, and another board toward his feet at the other end of the board.
And a servant holds the board and let it not be secured in the hole. Another servant holds the other board in that manner. Then wrap around the chest of the affected person and under his armpits with a soft tight cloth, and extend the end of the cloth to the board near his head and tie him there.
Then tie another cloth above his knees and above his calves, and at the level of his armpits. Gather all the straps and tie them to the other board near his feet. Then each servant pulls the board in their direction with the strap, without moving the two boards from their fixed positions.
Except that they are not secured as we said, and the physician places his hands on the bead with force until it returns or places a board on it then rests his feet on the board until it returns, if it does not return by this treatment, she takes a board whose length is about three cubits.
And a hole is dug in the wall as we said should be near the affected area, into which the end of the board is inserted. Then the middle of the board is placed on the prominence, and the physician places his feet on the other end. He pulls with great force until he compresses the bead.
And it returns to its place. If you wish to make it with the rod that is twisted by hand, you should plant two pieces of wood at the head of the affected area at the end of the couch, each piece being one cubit in length. Similarly, attach two pieces of wood at the feet of the patient also at the end of the couch.
Let the space between each piece of wood be a thumb's breadth. And make a hole in each piece of wood through which the rod passes. Secure all the pieces of wood to the ground firmly so that they do not move at all. Then insert a round stick, which is the rod through which the bandage is twisted into the holes of the two pieces of wood.
And at the end of the stick, make a hole in which a small stick of a thumb's breadth is secured to twist it. Do the same in the other two pieces of wood. Then tighten the bandage that you have tightened around the affected area's chest on the rod near the head, and the bandages that you have tightened around his legs on the rod near the feet.
Then, stand by each rod a servant who twists it with the twisting tool. The physician smooths the prominence as we have said before. This is the image of the rod, the couch, and the affected area.
Then after the vertebra returns to its place and the position is equal, it should be applied a dried plaster with egg white, then pressing, and then place over the plaster a splint of board which is three fingers or so in width and whose length shall take the place of the prominence.
And some correct beads should be used, then it should be tied with the bandage that is appropriate. And good gentle food should be used until he recovers. If there remains some knots in their places at the end of recovery, it should be applied medicines that relax and soften along with the use of the board we described for a long time.
And a lead plate may be used for this. And some knots may appear in the last beads of the spine, and one might think that they have fallen out, becoming an extra bone. Do not treat them with this remedy, as death might occur.
The Thirty-First Chapter.
In the Treatment of Dislocated Hip.
Know that the hip joint and the shoulder joint are affected only by dislocation, and they do not suffer from the slight displacement or subluxation that affects other joints. The hip joint can be dislocated in four directions.
And this is because it can dislocate inward, outward, forward, and backward. It dislocates more inward and less forward or backward. The sign of its dislocation inward is that if you align the healthy thigh with the affected one, the latter appears longer.
And the knee is more extended than the healthy one. The patient cannot bend his leg at the waist. The area below the waist appears swollen and noticeably so before the thigh bone has shifted there.
And the sign of one whose jaw is protruding outward is against these signs, and the sign of one whose jaw is protruding forward is that he stretches his leg fully except that he does not bend it without pain, and if he wishes to walk he cannot do so to forward.
And he retains his urine and turns his buttocks outward, and when walking his step is on the heel. And the sign of one whose jaw is protruding backward is that he does not stretch his knee nor can he bend it before bending his buttocks, and his leg is also shorter than the other.
And the buttocks are relaxed, and the head of the thigh is clearly visible at the position of the thigh. As for the response to this type of jaw condition, one should look and see if the jaw has been long-standing and has become chronic, and the patient did not attempt to correct it and remained in its state; there is no remedy for it at all.
And it should not be presented to him, as for one whose jaw is new and was of any kind from the four sides of the jaw, hasten to manipulate the joint, extend it inward and outward, and move it left and right; perhaps.
Return and he did not need any other treatment. If it does not return in this manner, it should be managed by a strong assistant who extends his leg from below either with his hands or with a strap tied above the knee on his leg. Another assistant should extend him from above.
By inserting his hands from under his armpits, then tying a flexible strap at the root of the thigh and holding the end of the strap with a third assistant. The extension should be either from front towards the side of the buttocks to the side of the clavicle or from behind towards the side of the back.
They should be immersed once until the illness rises in its body from the ground and remains suspended. For this type of immersion is a common treatment for all four types, if the jaw returns as we said, otherwise each type must have what I mention for its special cure.
As for his special response if the jaw is inward, the patient should lie on his healthy side, then place a cloth at the base of the thigh between the knee and the position below the ileum.
Then, tie the ligament from below at the ileum up to above the body to the area of the clavicle. Then, another strong attendant should take hold with his arms around the thick part of the thigh of the patient and pull it outward with a strong tug; for it will return to its place.
This type is easier than other types of treatment by which the return of this organ can be achieved. If it proves difficult for you and does not respond to entering this type of treatment at all, then you should tie both legs of the patient with a strong but flexible ligament around the ankles and the knees.
It should be four fingers' width from each of its companions, and the healthy leg should be stretched more than the other by about two fingers. Then, the patient should be suspended from the head using a beam in the house, with a distance of about two arm lengths from the ground.
Then, command a strong boy to hold the thigh and suspend another boy from the patient. Make the second boy pull with strength on the one holding the thigh. For the joint will return quickly to its place. As for his special response if the jaw is outward.
Fain it be that the patient lie on the board as described in the convexity and that the bandage be tied specially about his limb and about his chest. Then the two planks shall be placed one at his feet and the other at his head. And another plank shall be placed in the middle of the board, tightly secured.
She should be wrapped with a wet cloth to prevent harm, and let the plank lie between his thighs so as not to draw downward when stretched. Then each attendant stretches to his side, and the physician straightens the hip with his hands. If it responds to return.
And if not, place the plank on him and cover it as we described for convexity. However, it should be that the patient lies on his sound side. If the dislocation is to the front, then the limb of the patient should be stretched once, and he should remain in this position on the board.
The physician places his right hand on the patient's iliac bone and presses it with the other hand. He makes sure that the pressure is extended downward towards the knee. If the dislocation is to the rear, then it should not be stretched downwards.
He is elevated above the ground. It should be placed on something solid. Also, it should be dislocated outward as described when he lies on the board on his back with the bandages tightened.
As we said earlier, the board should also be used to cover the area where the joint has come out. Once the hip joint has returned to its proper position, you will notice that the limb of the patient stretches when lying on the board.
If you find them level and the patient can flex and extend the leg without difficulty, know that the part has returned to what is fitting. Then compare the thighs and apply the dressing, binding with a knot so tight that the hip does not move in any direction.
The patient must remain at rest for three or four days. Then remove the bandage and dressing, and compare the leg with the other, if you find them equal in measure, know that the fracture has set. Release the patient for walking. If you see any relaxation, do not release him yet.
Return and dress him, binding him as tightly as your first binding. Leave him also for three days, then remove the bandage and allow him to walk on it slowly for several days until it strengthens, indeed if Allah wills.
Chapter Thirty-Second and Thirtieth.
In the Treatment of Knee Fracture.
The knee dislocates in three directions: to the inside, to the outside, and downwards (behind). It does not dislocate forwards at all. The sign of dislocation is to order the patient to draw his leg up to his thigh.
If it does not stick to the thigh, know that the knee has dislocated. To reduce all its dislocations, order the patient to sit seated and extend his legs if he can do so. Then seat a servant behind him to hold his middle and bend him slightly backwards. You then sit on his thighs.
And press your back to his face and place his leg between your legs. Then hold his knee with both your hands and intertwine them between your fingers on his knee. With your hands, firmly draw both sides of his knee towards him. A servant should also extend his leg until the knee returns to its place.
And the sign of its return is to apply the leg to the thigh in a soft non-resisting manner, then compress it and apply the leg to the thigh again, then bind them all with a bandage for three or four days, then release them. It should only be used with little walking for a few days until it strengthens.
If it is impossible for you to return it as described, then use the strong traction with the bandages I have described in treating the hip until it returns.
The Thirty-Third Chapter.
In the Treatment of Dislocation of the Ankle.
The ankle may dislocate partially and may disengage completely. Its dislocation can be either inward or outward. The sign of its dislocation is to see the heel swollen and protruding towards the side to which it disengaged.
As for the treatment of its partial dislocation, it is easy to reduce by gently extending with the hands and aligning until it returns. As for its complete dislocation, it should be seated in a chair, and a strong servant should hold him from behind, gripping him at the midpoint of his back.
Then grasp his foot with your right hand from above and with your left hand from below at the ankle. Next, pull the foot towards you with your right hand, then with your left hand twice. Extend it with your left hand and push the chest of the foot with your right hand towards the thigh without force.
Do this twice as described, then push the chest of the foot towards the thigh in the third time while pulling at the ankle. If it returns in one or two attempts in this manner and you see the foot level, otherwise, repeat the procedure until it returns.
If it is not possible to return it as described, then lay the injured person on his back on the ground and drive stakes into the ground securely tying them between his thighs so that they fall. Then wrap a cloth around him to prevent any harm to the injured person, and then secure his thigh with a attendant.
Then another attendant stretches the leg either with his hands or with a rope tying it to the ankle, and each attendant stretches contrary to the stretch of his companion. A stake stands between the thighs of the injured person holding them to prevent his body from being drawn downward during stretching, and then the doctor aligns the thigh with his hands.
Then another attendant holds the healthy leg downward, for the thigh returns quickly. If the thigh returns and you see that its return is correct, then carry the dressing and burden, tighten it with tight ropes, and secure the foot with a rope downward. It is advisable to beware of the nerve that is above the heel from behind.
Lest the rope be too tight and injure him, then leave him for two or three days. If the rope relaxes, tighten it again, then release him on the third or fourth day. The injured person should abstain from walking for forty days.
If he desires to walk before this period, do not fear that the thigh will give way and become ineffective, nor will treatment be accepted thereafter. If a hot swelling appears, it should be treated with what we have described in another part of the remedy and dressing until it subsides.
The Fourth and Thirty-Fourth Chapter.
In the Treatment of Straightening Fingers.
It should be straightened what has become disjointed from it by a slight stretch without force. This is not difficult but easy. If the displacement is in some toes of the foot, it should be placed so that his foot is on a level surface of the ground.
Or on a board as he stands like one walking, then rise and place your foot at the site of those joints, then press it with your foot firmly until it returns and you see that it has become straight with no displacement evident in the position.
Then place a board under the sole of his foot, taking all of it, which should have two ends. Tighten it firmly for three days, then loosen it and protect it from walking for many days until it strengthens, and may the return be prevented by God.
The Fifth and Thirty-Third Chapter.
On the Kinds of Dislocation That May Occur with a Wound or a Fracture or Both Together.
When any of this occurs and is left untreated or set, it often leads to death.
Therefore, one should not undertake the treatment of such cases except by someone skilled in the craft, well-trained, gentle, patient, neither rash nor overconfident. He should initially use only medications that calm hot swellings and then attend to the patient.
For the sake of safety, O Lord, except what I hope will be safe from illness with a light disease and for which you have shown some hope, then return it to me in the beginning before the hot swelling occurs.
If the part returned to what you wanted, use the management that calms hot tumors and treat the wound with what suits it from drying ointments. If there was a fracture and shards occurred in the bone, remove them by extraction. And comply with that as mentioned in the simple diseases in their places as previously stated.
Strive to the utmost and purify your soul from entering the way of risk as I have warned you before. That will be more beneficial for you and submit your condition to God's will if He so desires.
