Of the fracture of the ribs	On the repair of ribs when they are fractured.	0.44455335
Know that rib fractures occur only in the thick parts near the back, and at the ends inside, and they only bend because they are flexible; and it can be easily felt by probing with fingers.	You should know that fracture of the ribs occurs only at the thick parts bordering on the vertebrae, whereas the anterior extremities are only contused, because they are cartilaginous; this is easily diagnosed on examination with the fingers.	0.81804436
And the restoration is that you set the fracture evenly, as necessary. Then apply the poultice, and bind it with a splint, if needed.	They should be set by levelling out the fracture with the fingers in any manner you can so that the form is as it should be; then apply the plaster and bind the broken bone with a splint, if necessary.	0.76488817
And if the rib fracture is inclined inward, the patient feels great pain and sharpness, like pleurisy, because the bone pierces the tissue; and breathes with difficulty, and coughs and vomits a large amount of blood, and this is very serious, and the ancients devised great ingenuity for it.	If it be a depressed fracture of the ribs, then the patient will have a vehement pain and a piercing sensation like that of pleurisy, since the bone is piercing the pleura; in addition he will have difficulty in breathing and will cough, and vomit much blood; the treatment of this is difficult. In this the Ancients practised many devices.	0.889607
And there are some who say that it is necessary to administer foods that swell the belly, to push the fracture outward.	Some said that the patient should have food of such a kind as to generate wind and inflation to blow out and stretch the belly and so push out the fracture.	0.6507881
We do not do this, lest hot abscesses occur, if they have not already occurred. And if it has occurred, treat it.	We, however, reject this, since it will excite an effusion if one has not already arisen; and if one has arisen it will increase and confirm it.	0.5954232
And some of them say to apply cups to the spot, to draw out forcefully, and this seems reasonable; however, there is a concern that the cups might draw impurities to the spot due to weakness.	Some of them said a cupping-vessel should be applied to the place and strong suction be made; this seems more reasonable except that there is a risk of the vessel's drawing superfluities to the place on account of his weak state.	0.77739364
And some of them say to cover the spot with wool soaked in hot oil, and place tents between the ribs to even the bandage around, then treat as pleurisy, with food and medicine.	Some of them said that the place should be covered with wool soaked in warm oil and that a pad should be placed in the intercostal space to fill it up so as to make the bandaging level when you wind it round. Then treat the patient with diet and medicines as for pleurisy.	0.8095027
And if the patient feels great pain that he cannot endure because the bone pierces the tissue, and there is a concern for the patient, then cut above the broken rib, and place an instrument underneath to protect the surface; and then the bone should be cut, and removed carefully, and then sew the two lips of the wound if it is large, and treat with poultices, until it is healed. And if a hot abscess occurs, place cloths soaked in rose oil on the spot, and treat the spot as necessary for abscess, and the patient should lie often on the side where he should, until it is healed.	If the patient is in such a bad way that he cannot bear it, the bone painfully piercing the pleura, and we are afraid for him, then we shall have to cut down upon the place and lay bare the broken rib; then we place under it the instrument to protect the membrane, which has been described, and gently cut out the bone and remove it. Then the edges of the wound should be joined, with a suture if large, and dressed with ointments until healed. If meanwhile there arise an abscess, quickly soak pads in oil of roses and apply them to the place and treat the patient with internal remedies against abscess too. Let him lie upon the side which is easier for him to sleep on, until it heals.	0.90076447
