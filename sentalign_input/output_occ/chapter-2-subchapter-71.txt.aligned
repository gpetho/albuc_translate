On lentigo and protruding flesh from causes in women.	On cutting the clitoris and fleshy growths in the female genitalia.	0.63978416
Lentigo is often joined to natural causes when it is stressed and made the target of attention; and sometimes it is enlarged in some women to the extent that it spreads like in men and becomes involved in intercourse.	The clitoris may grow in size above the order of nature so that it gets a horrible deformed appearance; in some women it becomes erect like the male organ and attains to coitus.	0.5505706
Then you need to hold the excess of lentigo with your hand or with a hook and cut it.	You must grasp the growth with your hand or a hook and cut it off.	0.69497806
And do not delay in cutting, especially at the base of the root, so that it does not cause a flow of blood.	Do not cut too deeply, especially at the root of the growth, lest haemorrhage occur.	0.7745713
Then treat it with wound care until it is healed.	Then apply the usual dressing for wounds until it is healed.	0.7208122
But new flesh is flesh that grows in the orifice of the mother until it fills it, and often it is expelled to the outside in the form of a tail (and for this reason some first called it "tailed disease"); so we need to cut it as we cut lentigo, and treat it until it is healed.	As to the fleshy growth, that is, flesh growing in the cervix and filling it, and also often protruding like a tail (on which account some of the Ancients called it 'caudate disease'); this too you should cut away as you do for the clitoris, and dress until healed.	0.7142054
