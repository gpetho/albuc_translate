of the dislocation of the heel
The heel is sometimes sprained, and sometimes fully dislocated, both inwards and outwards.
And the sign is that the ankle is swollen, and leans forward on the side where it is dislocated: the reduction is easy, and one should extend it gently with their hands when it is only sprained.
And when it is completely dislocated, you must have the patient sit upright, and have an assistant hold him firmly by the leg, above the ankle; then pull the foot towards you with your right hand, and then with your left twice, then extend it upwards, and gently push the foot upwards; and do this twice, as we have said, pushing and pulling the foot; if it returns, that is good; if not, repeat the process, for it will return; and if it cannot be returned this way, have the patient lie on his back on the ground, and firmly plant a stake in the ground between his thighs, and tie cloths around it, so that it does not injure the patient; then have the assistant hold the thigh, and another assistant extend the foot with his hands or with a strap, which he ties above the instep; then each assistant extends evenly, and the stake remains between the patient's thighs to restrain the patient while he is being extended; then the physician evenly sets the dislocation with his hands, and another assistant holds the healthy leg underneath, and the dislocation will return quickly.
And when it is in place, apply the plaster and padding on it, and bandage it tightly, and tie the foot to the leg, and be careful of the nerves that are on the ankle behind, that the bandage is not too tight; then leave it for two or three days, and if the bandage loosens, tighten it; then untie it on the third or fourth day, and forbid the patient from walking for four days; and if he walks before that time, it is not certain that it will not dislocate again.
And if a hot abscess develops there, you must treat it, as we have said elsewhere, until it is healed.
