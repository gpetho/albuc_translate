Third chapter.
Of the cauterization of recent migraine.
When sudden pain arises in the part of the head, or pain is extended into the eye, evacuate the head with cleansing medicines, and administer the other treatment which I have mentioned in the divisions of diseases; and if all that does not help, then cauterization in that place is done in two ways: either with acute burning medicine or with iron.
But cauterization with burning medicine is that you take a clove of garlic, peel it, and cut off the ends of both heads.
Then incise the spot of the pain in the temple with a broad lancet until a space is made beneath the skin, until it is hidden.
Then press on it with a stopper for gradual constriction, and leave it for three hours; then untie it and remove the garlic, and leave the wound for two or three days, then place cotton soaked in vinegar over it until the spot makes a scab.
Then treat it with ointment until it is healed.
And if you wish, do this with some burning medicines which I have written about in the twelfth treatise of burning medicines.
But cauterization with iron in this manner: ignite the cautery iron of which this is the form:
It is called "clavis clavis", because its head is like the shape of a nail in which there is some curvature, and in the middle of it there is a small eminence.
Then place it on the spot of the pain, and hold your hand — so that the artery beneath it is not burnt — and rotate the iron little by little with speed.
And if the amount that is burnt is approximately half the thickness of the skin, lift your hand so that the artery beneath is not burnt, so that no blood flow comes.
Then soak cotton in salt water and place it on the spot, and leave it for three days; then place cotton soaked in vinegar, and then treat with ointment until it is healed.
And if you wish, cauterize with the tip of the surgical knife according to the cautery, and beware of incision of the artery in this recent migraine.
