Of the dislocation of the elbow	On the treatment of a dislocation of the elbow.	0.6050689
Know that the elbow joint is dislocated with difficulty, and with difficulty returns; and it is dislocated in all directions, and especially forward and backward, and the dislocation is not hidden, for it is easily seen and felt; and dislocates according to each position. And when you compare the injured elbow with the healthy one, you can see it clearly. For the joint is locked, and he cannot bend his arm, nor touch his shoulder at all.	The elbow is with difficulty dislocated and with difficulty put back. Now dislocation may be in all directions, and particularly forward and backward. Whatever way it is dislocated it will not be concealed from you, because it is both visible and palpable, and whenever you compare the dislocated elbow with the sound one it is quite openly and plainly manifested; for the elbow joint is hollow and the patient cannot flex the forearm back or touch his shoulder with it.	0.89936143
And you must reduce it before a hot abscess develops, because if a hot abscess were to develop, it would be difficult to reduce; and perhaps it cannot be reduced completely, especially when it is backward; it is worse than other dislocations, and is more painful, and perhaps death results.	You must hasten and reduce the dislocation as rapidly as possible before an abscess occur. For if an abscess occur the reduction of it is difficult and maybe it will never be healed; especially when it is a posterior dislocation, for this is the worst and most painful of all the kinds of dislocation, and often it is fatal.	0.83201385
And the restoration, if it is such that it can be reduced, is that you extend his hand with your two hands; and his arm should be extended, and the physician's hands around the elbow, above and below, and push the joint together at the base of his thumb or at the base of his palm, until it returns to its place.	Now when it is one of those that can be reduced, the way to reduce it is for an assistant to perform a two-handed extension of the patient's hand, the patient's forearm being opened out, while the doctor's hands are above and below the elbow joint and he thrusts the joint with both thumbs together or with the root of his palm, until it returns to its place.	0.80682987
And if the dislocation is forward, it returns when he folds his hand over, and strikes the dislocated elbow with the base of the palm.	If it be an anterior dislocation, it may go back if the hand is bent sharply back until it strikes its own shoulder with the root of the palm.	0.7352823
And if the joint is firm in its place, untie the bandage and leave it; and if you see that the joint is not tight, reapply the plaster and the bandage, and leave it like that for a few days, until it is firmly set; then untie it.	Then undo it; and if the joint remains fixed in its place, then untie the bandaging and leave it. If you see that the joint is not thoroughly firm, replace the plaster and bandaging and leave it for a few more days until it is firm; then untie it.	0.9418758
And if he feels severe pain after the reduction of the joint, and it moves, bathe and rub it gently, and compress it until the pain subsides; or you can put a fatty sheep's caul on the joint, then leave it for a day and a night, then remove it, and have him enter the bath; and when he sweats, rub the joint temperately, then put the caul back on, and then have him enter the bath; and do this two or three times, until he is healed; and if you wish, apply warm, moist cow dung with butter, and bind it on; it will return to its normal state.	If, after the reduction and unbandaging of the joint, it becomes stiff and is difficult to move, soften it in the bath and apply gentle friction and massage until it is softened, or apply to the joint the tail of a fat-tailed sheep; bind it on and leave it on for a day and a night; then remove it and send him to the bath, and when he sweats apply moderate friction to the joint; then replace the tail and again and again, alternating with the bath, until the joint softens. If you prefer, apply to it, and bandage on, fresh cow-dung lightened with butter. Do this a number of times and it will soften and return it to its original state.	0.9123198
