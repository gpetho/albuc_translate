Chapter fifty-three on cauterizing inverted and non-inverted nails.
This ailment frequently occurs on the soles of the feet, and it is a rough thing that pains the man.
Cauterization for it is of two types: either cauterization by fire or cauterization by strong water.
As for cauterization by fire, it is that you heat the hollow iron, similar to an eagle's feather, made of iron to the extent that it surrounds the nail on all sides, and it has a thin edge, then you place it hot on the nail, then you rotate your hand with the iron around the nail until the iron reaches the depth of the nail, and you leave it for three days while it suppurates, then you dress it with wild mallow pounded with salt, and you leave the dressing on it for a night, then it will be uprooted, then you treat the site of the wound with the ointment that generates flesh until it heals.
If the nails are not inverted, and they frequently occur on the surface of the body, especially on the hands and feet, then you should take a tube of copper or of iron or of eagle's feather, and place it on the nail or wart, then you pour into the tube a small amount of strong water, and you hold your hand while rotating it with a slight pinch of your hand so that the edge of the tube affects the base of the nail, and the strong water finds a way to penetrate to the base of the nail, and the patient bears the sting of the strong water for a short time, then you leave it, then the nail will be uprooted.
Thus, you do to them one by one until you have treated all of them in the body, then you treat their places after they are uprooted with what generates flesh from ointments.
