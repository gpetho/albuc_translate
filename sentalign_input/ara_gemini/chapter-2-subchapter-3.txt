The third chapter on the consumption/inflammation of the two arteries which are in the temples.
If a person experiences chronic migraine or acute catarrh due to sharp humors and heat in the muscles of the temples, or severe chronic headache and the like, and is treated with various medical treatments, but that does not work
then we have experimented in these diseases with incising the arteries of the temples or cauterizing them as we have described.
And the way to incise them is that the patient shaves the hair that is on the temples
and you aim for the artery that is apparent in the temple, for it will be clear to you from its pulse.
And it rarely hides except in a few people or during intense cold.
If it is hidden from you, then let the patient tighten his neck with the extra part of his garment.
Then you rub the place with a cloth or compress the place with hot water until the artery appears clearly and distinctly.
Then you take the lancet, which is pictured here:
Then gently flay the skin until you reach the artery.
Then insert a hook into it and pull it upwards until you bring it out of the skin and free it from the membranes beneath it on all sides.
If the artery is thin, twist it with the tip of the hook.
Then cut a part of it to the extent that its ends separate and contract without causing bleeding.
For if it is not severed and cut, the blood will not thin at all.
Then let out blood from six to three ounces.
If the artery is large, it is necessary to tie it in two places with a strong doubled thread.
And let the thread be either silk or lute strings so that putrefaction does not quickly reach it before the wound heals, causing bleeding.
Then cut the excess between the two ligatures.
Do this at that time or after another time.
And if you wish, cauterize it to the bone with a knife-shaped cautery until its ends are severed, which will serve the same purpose, or better, as we have said.
Except if the patient has a fever or a hot temperament, because cauterization helps to destroy moisture, so it is more effective in benefit.
It is necessary after severing the arteries to stuff the place with worn cotton and place tight bandages on it.
And after the resolution, treat it with dry medicines that grow flesh and with bandaging until it heals, God willing.
If bleeding from the artery occurs during your work, immediately cut it either by cauterization
or fill the place with vitriol and tighten your hand until the bleeding stops.
If none of that is available to you, put your finger until the blood clots.
And wash the place with very cold water until the sharpness subsides and tighten it as necessary.
And what is lighter and easier than severing the artery is to cauterize the vessel with this two-bladed cautery after marking the two places with ink and applying it very hot until it reaches the bone and the vessel is cut in two places so that the space between its ends widens.
For it will not heal with this cauterization at all.
And this is the image of the cautery:
The sharpness of the two knives resembles the two small intestines, except that they are much less sharp than the knife, because if they were as sharp as the knife, the cold would reach them faster and the meat would not be cut quickly.
So if there is some thickness in them, the heat of the fire will be retained in them, and they will cut the meat quickly.
And this method is better than any other method, lighter, and easier.
And let the distance between the two knives be the thickness of a finger.
