Of tremor
Formice is a small foul appearance around the body, and goes very deep;
and sometimes it is found cold, and it is felt like death tremor, and it comes in the whole body, and more in the hands than elsewhere.
And the treatment is to take a quill of a goose feather, or a strong vulture feather, and place that quill on the tremor, so that the circles take the tremor all around;
then turn your hand with the quill until you cut all around the tremor, and put it deep, and scrape the tremor from its roots.
And if you want, do this with a brass or iron quill in this form, and it should be fine below and pulling above:
not piercing, for better holding to the finger, and better pressing. And if you want, cauterize the tremor, as mentioned in the chapter on cautery.
