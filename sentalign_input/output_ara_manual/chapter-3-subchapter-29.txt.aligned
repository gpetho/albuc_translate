Fingers may be dislocated in any direction.  When a finger is dislocated towards the back or the palm of the hand, extend the finger and push the dislocation with your thumb until it returns (to its place). Then bind the tip of the finger and suspend it towards the side to which it was dislocated.	The fingers may be dislocated in any direction. When one of the fingers is dislocated dorsally or ventrally, then extend the finger and thrust the dislocation with your thumb until it goes back.	0.89989126
Leave it for two days then release it and extend it so that it becomes straight during that day. If it is nighttime, bind it in the same manner. Continue to release it during the day and exercise it with movement, and bind it at night. Do this for several days until it becomes strong.	Then unbind it and extend it so that it may straighten out all that day. Then at nightfall bind it in just the same way. Continue to loosen it by day and to exercise it with movement, bandaging it by night. Do this for some days until it is knit.	0.8605113
And likewise, do the same if it is dislocated towards the inside of the hand, binding it towards the same side. Do with it as you did before until it heals.  And likewise, do the same whenever it is dislocated in other directions.	Do the same with it if it is a ventral dislocation, binding it in that direction, and treat it as explained above until it is healed. Do likewise with dislocations in other directions.	0.7884155
