Chapter thirty-two on the treatment of knee dislocation.	CHAPTER THIRTY-TWO. On dislocation of the knee.	0.7787584
The knee dislocates in three directions: it dislocates inwards, outwards, and downwards, I mean backwards, and it does not dislocate forwards at all.	The knee is dislocated in three ways; it is dislocated interiorly and exteriorly and inferiorly, that is, posteriorly. It is never dislocated anteriorly.	0.86288095
And the sign of its dislocation is that you order the patient to bring his leg to his thigh, and if it does not stick to the thigh, then know that the knee is dislocated.	The sign of dislocation is to bid the patient flex his leg on his thigh, and if it does not reach the thigh you may know the knee is dislocated.	0.8446747
And the treatment of all its dislocations is that you sit the patient down, having extended his legs, if he is able to do that, and you sit a servant behind him to hold his waist and twist it backwards a little, then you sit on his thighs, putting your back to his face, and you put his leg between your legs, then you grasp his knee with your palms, interlocking them between your fingers on his knee, then you squeeze both sides of his knee with your palms strongly, and another servant extends his leg until the knee returns to its place.	The way of setting all the types of dislocation is to make the patient sit down with both legs extended, if he can, with an assistant sitting behind him to hold him by the middle and incline him slightly backward. Then do you yourself sit on his thighs with your back to his front, and put his leg between yours; then the palms of your hands should be applied to his knee, and join them together by twining the fingers; then with the palms put strong pressure on both sides of his knee while another assistant extends his foot until the knee goes back to its place.	0.8901552
And the sign of its return is that the leg sticks to the thigh softly, without force.	The sign of its return is that the leg can be flexed back easily and without hindrance upon the thigh.	0.7679932
Then bandage it, and stick the leg to the thigh, then bind them both with a bandage for three or four days, then release them.	Then apply a plaster and flex the leg on to the thigh and bandage them together for three or four days; then loosen them.	0.8940822
And he should not engage in anything except a little walking for some days, until it strengthens.	He should do little walking for some days until it gains strength.	0.7769383
If its return is difficult for you with what we described, otherwise, use strong extension with the bandages that I previously described for the treatment of the hip, until it returns.	But if you cannot effect reduction by this method, apply powerful extension by bandages as we have described above for the treatment of the hip, until it goes back.	0.8153018
