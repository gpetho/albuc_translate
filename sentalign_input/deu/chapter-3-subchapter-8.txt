Chapter 8:
Restoration of fractured ribs.
Know that rib fractures occur only in thick parts near the back; fractures in the front do not happen because they are cartilaginous.
Detection of a fracture is not hidden from touch with fingers.
Restoration involves aligning the fracture with fingers as much as possible until it is set, then plastering and tightening the broken bone with a splint, if needed.
If the rib fracture leans inward, the patient will have severe pain and puncture similar to pleurisy, because the bone pricks the membrane; causing difficulty breathing, coughing, and often spitting blood; this is hard to cure.
The Ancients have worked on this with many inventions.
Some said the patient should eat foods that cause bloating and gas, so the abdomen swells and the fracture is pushed outward.
But we avoid this as it may cause an abscess, and if it happens, it is helpful.
Some said to use a cupping glass to suck forcefully; this seems reasonable but feared to draw impurities to the area due to weakness.
Some said the area should be covered with wool soaked in hot oil, with padding between the ribs to fill it, wrapped with bandages in a rounded manner; and the patient should be treated as for pleurisy with diet and medicine.
If severe pain constrains the patient, with the bone puncturing the membrane and causing distress, cut over the area, expose the broken rib, use the instrument to hold the diaphragm (mentioned earlier), cut the bone, and extract it.
Then align the wound edges if large, with stitching, and treat with plasters until healed.
If an internal abscess occurs, quickly apply soaked pads in rose oil to the area, and treat the patient appropriately for the internal abscess.
Have the patient lie on the side they usually sleep on until healed.
