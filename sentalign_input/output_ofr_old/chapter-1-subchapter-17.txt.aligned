on the treatment of fistula by cautery	On cauterization of a fistula in the angle of the eye.	0.5220345
When you treat a fistula as we have described in the sections on diseases, and your treatments are not effective, then you must cauterize it in this way.	When you have treated a fistula in those ways mentioned in the sections on diseases, without success, it should be cauterized after this manner.	0.87603366
Then squeeze the fistula if it is open, and draw out the pus, and dry it; and if it is closed, open it, and draw out the matter; then apply the very hot cautery, and hold your hand on the cautery on the side of the nose above the eye, so that your hand does not make a mistake; and place the cautery in the fatty tissue of the eye, and destroy it.	Then press on the fistula if it be open and get the matter out of it and wipe it away; or if it is not open, then open it. Then apply to it the cautery, which should be very hot, and press it in with your hand till it reaches the bone. While you are burning keep the hand away from the eye slightly toward the nasal side, lest your hand slip or the patient draw away so that you put the cautery into the ball of the eye and destroy it.	0.85755515
If you reach the bone at the beginning of the cauterization, that would be good. If not, repeat the cauterization once more, and again if needed, and leave it for three days; then apply cotton soaked in butter, and treat it with the desiccative ointment until it is healed, and if forty days pass and it is not healed, apply a sharp corrosive medicine until the bone is exposed; and treat it according to what is appropriate in its chapter.	And if you reach the bone at the first cauterization, good; if not, repeat the cauterization if necessary. Leave it a few days, then put on cotton wool with butter and treat with hygroscopic ointment till it heals. And should forty days have passed and it does not heal, apply a sharp corrosive ointment so as to expose the bone, and strip it as will be explained in the appropriate chapter.	0.89158916
And there is a method of cauterizing a fistula that some of the ancients described. Make an incision in the fistula, and split the area; then put in the incision a thin reed whose form is as follows: and make it the size of a lead weight of 3 [units]; and hold your hand or the reed firmly, and the patient should not move at all, so that the melted lead does not run into his eye; and it is necessary to place over the patient's eye cotton soaked in egg white or water: the lead burns the fistula site, and heals it with marvelous efficacy.	Another method of cauterizing a fistula is that which some of the Ancients mentioned: apply yourself to the site of the fistula and incise it; then insert into the incision a fine funnel, this being the figure of it, and pour into it a drachm of molten lead; and keep your hand on the funnel, holding it firm all the time, and do not let the patient move at all, lest the molten lead run into his eyes. Then you should put cotton wool soaked in egg-white or water upon the patient's eye. For the lead cauterizes the site of the fistula and acts as a marvellous cure.	0.8855047
And if the fistula is healed by the cauterization we have described, that is good. If not, then it is necessary to administer medication through the syringe and return the fistula to the body of the syringe as appropriate to its proper place.	If the fistula heals by the cauterization and medication we have described, well and good; otherwise perforation of the nose will undoubtedly have to be undertaken to lead the fistula into the meatus of the nose, by the technique that will come in its own place.	0.79283416
