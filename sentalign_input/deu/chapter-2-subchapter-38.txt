Chapter 38.
On the extraction of thorns and other things stuck in the throat and other issues.
Many times a fishbone or some other cause gets stuck in the throat.
Then you must extract whatever is visible, which you can see when you press the tongue with an instrument in the sunlight, so that you can clearly see what is in the throat.
And for what does not appear and is hidden in the throat, make the patient vomit before food is digested in the stomach, because very often the cause stuck in the throat will be expelled by vomiting; or the patient should swallow a piece of turnip or lettuce root or a piece of dry bread; or take a piece of dry sea sponge, tie it firmly with thread, and have the patient swallow it, because when it reaches the place where the thorns are, it will be pulled out, and then they will be expelled.
And also take an eel and tie it with thread, place it inside and then pull it out gently; or take a leek, insert it gently, and then pull it out gently.
But if they are not expelled with the methods we have described, then use an instrument made of lead in this form:
It should be a bit thicker than a rod, and at the end it should be concave, which you can easily insert into the throat.
And the patient should have their head elevated, and be careful that touching the bone of the throat, so that it does not become inflamed by the bone or the thorn, or that the doctor handles it with his hand.
But it is better if the patient inserts it themselves, due to their knowledge of the location of the stuck object, and they push downwards and pull their hand with the instrument upwards, all according to the amount necessary until it is expelled.
