On the cauterization for twists.	On cauterization for contusion.	0.85679877
When pain occurs in some members due to a fall or an impact, and that pain persists for a long time and does not respond to medication, it is necessary to cauterize with a pointed cautery.	When pain occurs in some limb due to a fall or a blow and the pain becomes chronic and medical treatment has no effect upon it, you should cauterize it with the punctate cautery.	0.8088242
And the cautery should be done according to the size and strength of the member, and the location of the twist and pain.	In each case the cauterization should be in proportion to the size of the limb, its strength or weakness, and the chronicity of the pain and contusion in it.	0.61721337
Therefore, if it heals with the first cautery, it is good; if not, then repeat the cautery. For the custom of these pains is that they are punctured from one member to the next, and it is necessary to continue with cauterization until the patient is healed.	If it is cured at the first cauterization, good; otherwise repeat the cauterization. For it is customary for these pains to move from one part to a neighbouring part, and you must follow them with the cautery till the patient is cured.	0.8779511
