On the method of cauterizing for gout and joint pains.
Chapter 46.
When joint pains result from cold humors that spread to various body parts, then when pain occurs in the feet, it is customary among doctors to specifically call it gout.
Therefore, when gout of a cold cause is treated with various methods, and the pains are not relieved, then cauterization removes them.
And this is done by cauterizing around the joints of the feet after evacuation, with multiple cauterizations: and the cautery should be olive-shaped.
This is its form.
And if you need to prick the surface of the foot, then do so with a pointed cautery.
If the pains extend up to the knees or other joints, as often happens, then cauterize each knee with three or four cauteries on all sides, with this same key-shaped cautery.
And if more cauterizations with this cautery are necessary, then cauterize it.
Do not sink your hand deeply with the cautery; rather, only to the thickness of the skin.
But if the pains rise to the knees and back, then apply what we mentioned in its section on cautery.
If the pains are in the hands only, then prick around the joints, as two lines are traced.
If any pain remains in the fingers, then prick each joint and along the ridge of the hand.
If the pains rise over time to the elbows or shoulders, then cauterize both from all sides.
And do not evacuate the patient if they follow a good regimen and receive medicines.
For if a good regimen is followed, and phlegm is evacuated, they will be healed by Godâ€™s help with this cautery.
