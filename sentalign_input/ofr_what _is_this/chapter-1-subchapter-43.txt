Many times this disease comes to small children, and the sign of the beginning is that they have restricted breathing when they stand up, and fear; and you find on the last spinal process of the back and around it the appearance that comes on the other spinal processes.
When you see this and you want to treat it, cauterize it with a circular cautery in this form.
So that the cautery affects each part of the spinal process equally.
And if you wish, cauterize around the spinal process with the point cautery, two or three lines, and let the points be close to each other.
Afterward, treat the area until it is healed according to what we have said, and be careful not to apply cautery to a gibbosity which is in a spasm of the nerve.
