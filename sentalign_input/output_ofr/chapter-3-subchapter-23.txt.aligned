Dislocation is the displacement of a joint from its place, because of which it cannot move, and the limb is deformed, and the patient feels great pain and great injury.	A dislocation is a displacement of any of the joints from its place, whereby the movement of the joint is hindered, the member is deformed, and the patient is caused violent pain and hurt.	0.85052526
When a dislocation happens to someone, it must be reduced immediately without delay.	When anyone sustains a dislocation he should hasten to have it reduced, not delaying it at all.	0.789722
For if one delays, the area swells, and perhaps it can only be put back in place with difficulty;	For if it is delayed the place will swell up and the reduction will be thereby made difficult.	0.6998255
therefore it should not be moved at the time when it is swollen: often it causes spasms and other pains;	So it should not be delayed, nor moved or extended during the time it is swollen, for that often leads to spasm and excruciating pain.	0.7181306
however, when this happens, have the patient bled, then leave it alone until the swelling has subsided;	Instead, when this occurs, you must hasten to venesect the patient, and then let be until the swelling has subsided a little.	0.77118444
then bathe the limb with hot water and oil, then reset it gently, and treat each limb as the treatment comes to its place.	Then massage the member with hot water and oil and let it be gently reduced. And treat every member with the things that will be mentioned in their place.	0.7843048
And I have ordered the chapters on dislocations from the head down to the feet.	I have disposed the chapters on dislocations in the same order as the foregoing ones on fractures, that is, from the upper part of the body to the lower part.	0.616272
