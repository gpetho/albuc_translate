Chapter eleven on the types of twitching of the eye.
If extra eyelashes grow on the eyelid in an unnatural way under the natural eyelashes and persist, they harm the eye and cause various diseases such as constant tearing, relaxation of the eyelids, whiteness, and thickness, until this becomes a cause of blindness.
Lifting the eye has four aspects: either by cauterization with fire, or with a sharp medicine as mentioned in the chapter on cauterization.
Or the lifting can be done by cutting and stitching, or with reeds as I will mention.
You should put the patient's head in your lap, then turn the eyelid with your left hand; if it turns over, then fine, otherwise insert a needle with a thread from the bottom of the eyelid and pass the needle with the thread from above, and this should be near the hair itself, and pull the thread up with the eyelid and turn it over with the probe, then make an incision inside the eyelid below the extra hair with the lancet, from the larger corner to the smaller corner, then remove the thread and place a small pad of cotton or cloth under the eyelid, then mark on the eyelid with ink a shape like a myrtle leaf, except that the shape should be as much as you want to lift the eyelid, because people may differ in this; some need to cut from the eyelid a suitable amount according to how much the eyelid has relaxed, and some need to cut less; all of this depends on the degree of relaxation of the eyelid.
Then you make an incision with the scalpel on the two lines that you marked, and start from the larger corner to the smaller corner, and one incision should be near the natural hair, about the thickness of the probe, then insert the hook into one of the corners of the skin, then peel it all off, then join the two edges by stitching with a needle and thin wool thread, and wipe the blood and stick the remaining threads on the eyebrows with some sticky substance if you want to do that, otherwise it doesn't matter.
Then leave the stitching and the threads for about three or four days, then treat it.
If you wish, you can leave the wound without stitching and treat it with something that dries and constricts, for the eyelid will rise when the wound closes and joins, and stitching is better.
This method of lifting was mentioned by the ancients, but it is a burden on the patient, although it is good work and there is no danger in it.
And another method of lifting is to mark a shape on the eyelid like the shape of a myrtle leaf as we described, then lift the eyelid with three hooks that are either separate or joined in this way.
Then you cut what remains of the eyelid with small scissors in this manner, cutting moderately.
If you cannot restrain the quivering and it does not settle for you, take a needle with thread in it and insert it in the middle of the figure, insert another thread near the larger corner, and a third thread near the smaller corner, and gather the threads between your fingers evenly, then raise your hand with it moderately and lift the marked skin entirely as we have described.
Then bring the edges of the wound together by stitching and treat it until it heals; if a hot swelling appears at your cutting or incision, soothe that swelling with qayruti and similar soothing ointments.
It may also happen to the lower eyelid that its lashes turn inward, so it is necessary to use what we have mentioned of cutting, stitching, cauterizing with fire and with a sharp medicine, and cauterizing with fire or with a sharp medicine is more effective and gentler on the patient than cutting and stitching, and cutting and stitching are more effective.
Cauterization with reeds is done in this manner: you turn the eyelid and make the incision from the inside as described, then you make two thin reeds or pieces of wood the length of the eyelid and their width less than the width of a lancet, and notches are carved in their ends on both sides where the threads hold, then you bring them together gently over what remains of the eyelid and tighten the two reeds from both sides tightly and firmly and leave it for days, so the tightened skin dies, blackens, and rots until it falls off by itself, and if it is slow, cut it off with scissors, then treat it until it heals.
When it heals, the eyelid will be raised and the lashes will not prick the eye, and this is the picture of the two reeds, make it in this shape and this size in length and width precisely.
