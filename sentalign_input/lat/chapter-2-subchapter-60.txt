On the extraction of the stone.
Chapter 60.
I have already spoken in detail of the types of stones and their treatment with medicines: and I have explained the difference between a stone formed in the kidneys and one in the bladder, and all its signs: and I have mentioned the stone upon which surgery and incision fall: it is the stone specifically formed in the bladder, and also that which is lodged in the penis: and I am narrating this with a clear explanation and in a concise manner.
I say, therefore, that a stone formed in the bladder occurs mostly in boys.
And one of its signs is that the urine flows out from the bladder, similar to water in its thinness: white sand appears in it, and the patient rubs his penis, struggles with it, and often it becomes erect.
Then it rises, and the anus protrudes with it in many of them.
And healing is easy in children, up to the time when they reach fourteen years.
And it is difficult in the elderly.
In young people, it is intermediate, between the two: and for the one whose stone is larger, treatment is easier; and if it is small, it is the opposite in treatment.
Therefore, when we proceed to the treatment, it is necessary first to cleanse the patient with an enema, which will remove all the feces in his intestines: for sometimes this obstructs the detection of the stone during the examination.
Then the patient should be taken by his feet, shaken, and moved downwards: so that the stone descends to the bottom of the bladder, or jumps from a high place at times.
Then make him sit, positioned between your hands, with his hands under his hips, so that the entire bladder is inclined downwards.
Then examine him, and touch him externally.
If then you feel the stone in the space, proceed immediately with the incision upon it.
But if it does not fall entirely under your touch, then you should anoint the index finger of your left hand with oil if the patient is a boy, or the middle finger if he is a grown youth: and insert it into his anus, and search for the stone, until it is under your finger: and gradually move it towards the neck of the bladder.
Then press on it with your finger, and push it outward toward the area where you wish to make the incision: instruct an assistant to press the bladder with his hand, and instruct another assistant to extend the testicles upwards with his right hand, and with his other hand to pull back the skin below the testicles in the area away from where the incision will be made.
Then introduce the cutting Spatumile, which has this shape.
And make the incision in the area between the anus and the testicles, not in the middle, but to the left side of the buttocks: and let the incision be upon the stone itself, with your finger in the anus: and make a transverse incision, so that the outer part is wide and the inner part is narrow, according to a size that allows the stone to pass through, but no larger.
For sometimes the finger, which is in the anus, compresses the stone at the incision, and it exits without difficulty.
And know that some stones have corners and edges, which makes their passage difficult for this reason.
And some stones are smooth, similar to a gland, and round: and their passage is easy.
For the one with corners and edges, enlarge the cut.
But if it does not exit this way, then you must use ingenuity on it: either press on it appropriately with a tool whose end is shaped like the moon, to grip the stone, so that it does not escape from it; or insert beneath it a slender instrument with a curved end.
But if you are still unable to reach it, then enlarge the opening a little.
But if some bleeding overwhelms you, cut it with a zegi.
But if there is more than one stone, then first push the larger one towards the mouth of the bladder.
Then cut over it.
Afterwards, push the smaller one after it: and do the same if there are more than two.
But if it is very large, it is unwise to cut over it with a large incision.
For one of two things happens to the patient: either he dies, or he suffers from a constant dribbling of urine, because the place does not heal completely.
Rather, aid its expulsion until it exits: or use ingenuity in breaking it with forceps, until you extract it piece by piece.
When you have completed your operation, then fill the wound with frankincense, aloe, and dragon’s blood: bind it, and place over it a cloth soaked in oil and wine, or in rose oil and cold water, to calm the warm swelling.
Then lay the patient back on his neck, and do not loosen the bandage until the third day.
When you loosen it, then wash the area with water and plenty of oil.
Then treat it with dyafinicon ointment and basilicon ointment until it heals.
If, however, a hot swelling occurs in the wound, along with corrosion and similar issues: such as when blood clots in the bladder and obstructs the urine: and this is recognized by the passage of blood with the urine.
Then insert your finger into the wound, and extract that blood.
For if it remains, it causes the bladder to decay and rot.
Then wash the wound with vinegar, water, and salt: and apply every kind of treatment suitable until it is healed.
And during all treatment times, you must bind the two thighs and bring them together, to keep the medicines in place over the area.
If the stone is small, lodged in the urethra, and blocks the exit of urine, then treat it with what I am telling you before you resort to incision.
Many times you can avoid incision by using this treatment, as I have already proven.
And it involves taking a perforator made of iron from alfaric, in this form, with a triangular, sharp end fixed in wood.
Then take a thread and tie it around the penis below the stone so it does not return to the bladder.
Then insert the perforating iron into the penis gently, until the perforator reaches the stone itself: and slowly rotate the perforator on the stone with your hand: and try to perforate it, until you make it pass through to the other side.
Then the urine flows out immediately.
Then press your hand over what remains of the stone on the outer part of the penis.
For it breaks, exits with the urine, and the patient is healed.
But if this treatment cannot be prepared for you due to some obstruction, then tie a thread below the stone and another above it.
Then cut over the stone in the penis itself, between the two ties.
Then extract it.
Afterwards, untie the binding and clean the clotted blood that has formed in the wound.
And the thread binding below the stone is only necessary to prevent it from returning to the bladder, and the upper thread binding is only necessary so that when the thread is loosened after the stone’s removal, the skin returns to its place and covers the wound: and for this, it is necessary when you tie the upper thread to lift the skin upward, so that it returns in its completion and covers the wound, as we have said.
