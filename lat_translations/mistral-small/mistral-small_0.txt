Praefatio.	 Preface.
Postquam compleui uobis o Filii, librum hunc, qui est postremus scientiae in medicina cum complemento ipsius, et consecutus sum finem in eo, ex expositionibus eius, et ipsius declarationibus, uisum est mihi, ut compleam ipsum uobis cum hoc Tractatu qui est pars operationis, id est, chirurgiae cum manu.	 After I have completed for you, O Sons, this book which is the last in medicine with its complement, and I have reached the end of it through its explanations and declarations, it seemed to me that I should complete it for you with this Treatise which is a part of operation, that is, surgery with the hand.
Quoniam operatio cum manu prostrata est in regione nostra, et tempore nostro priuata omnino: donec fortasse periit scientia eius, et abscissum est uestigium eius: et non remanserunt ex ea, nisi descriptiones paruae in libris antiquorum, quas mutauerunt manus: et accidit eis error et haesitatio, donec clausae sunt intentiones eius, et elongata est uis ipsius: Visum est mihi, ut uiuificem eam cum ordinatione huius Tractatus in ea secundum uiam ex positionis, et declarationis, et abbreuiationis: et ut ueniam cum formis ferramentorum Cauterii, et reliquorum instrumentorum operis: cum fit ex declarationis additione, et ex properatione eius quod est necesse.	 Since operation with the hand is abandoned in our region and time altogether, so that perhaps its knowledge has perished and its trace has been cut off; and nothing remains of it except for small descriptions in the books of the ancients, which have been changed by hands; and errors and hesitations occurred to them, until their intentions were closed and their strength was weakened. It seemed to me that I should revive it with the arrangement of this Treatise on it according to the way of positioning, explanation, and abbreviation; and that I would come with figures of the cautery iron and other instruments for work: as is done by adding explanations and hastening what is necessary.
Caussa autem propter quam non inuenitur bonus artifex eius cum manu sua in hoc nostro tempore, est: quia ars medicinae est longa, et oportet auctorem eius exercitari ante illud in scientia anatomiae, quam narrauit Galenus, donec sciat iuuamenta membrorum, et ipsorum formas, et eorum coniunctionem, et separationem, et habeat cognitionem ossium, et neruorum, et lacertorum, et numerum ipsorum, et eorum egressionem, et uenarum pulsatilium, et quietarum, et locorum exitus earum.	 But the reason why a good artisan of it is not found with his hand in this our time is that the art of medicine is long, and it is necessary for its author to be trained beforehand in the science of anatomy, as Galen narrated, until he knows the supports of the members, and their forms, and their conjunction and separation, and has knowledge of the bones, and nerves, and sinews, and their number, and their exit, and of the pulsatile and quiet veins, and of the exits of these.
Et propter illud dixit Hippocrates, quod nomen cum nomine est multum, et cum opere est paucum, et praecipue in arte manus.	 And because of this, Hippocrates said that a name with a name is much, and with work it is little, especially in the art of the hand.
Nos uero iam diximus de illo in introitu huius libri.	 But we have already spoken about that at the beginning of this book.
Quoniam qui non est sciens, quod diximus de anatomia, non euacuatur, quin iam cadat in errorem, quo interficiuntur homines: sicut ego uidi multos ex illis, qui formantur de hac scientia, et iactant se de ea absque scientia, et sine experimento.	 "Since he who is not knowledgeable about what we said regarding anatomy is not purged of error, whereby men are killed: just as I have seen many of those who claim to be formed in this science and boast about it without knowledge or experience.
Quod est, quia uidi medicum stolidum secuisse apostema scrophulosum in collo mulieris, et incidit quasdam arterias in collo: quare fluxit sanguis mulieris, donec cecidit mortua inter manus eius.	 "Which is to say, I have seen a foolish physician cut out a scrofulous abscess on a woman's neck, and he sliced into some of the arteries in her neck; therefore, the woman’s blood flowed until she died in his hands.
Et uidi medicum alium, qui praesumpsit ut extraheret lapidem uiro, qui processerat in aetate, et lapis erat magnus.	 "And I have seen another physician who presumed to remove a stone from a man who had grown old, and the stone was large.
Peruenit ergo ad eum, et extraxit ipsum cum frusto uesicae.	 "He came to him and removed it along with a piece of the bladder.
Quare mortuus est uir in tertio die.	 "Wherefore the man died on the third day.
Et ego quidem iam uocatus fueram ad extrahendum ipsum: et uidi ex magnitudine lapidis, et dispositione infirmi, quod moriretur.	 "And I was called to remove it, and seeing the great size of the stone and the condition of the patient, I knew that he would die.
Et uidi medicum alium, qui accipiebat stipem apud quendam Ducum terrae nostrae propter medicinam: et accidit eunucho nigro, qui erat apud ipsum, fractura in crure eius prope calcaneum: et properauit medicus cum ignorantia sua, et strinxit fracturam super uulnus cum puluinaribus, et astellis strictura forti, et non dimisit uulneri expirationem.	 "And I have seen another physician who received payment from a certain Duke of our land for his medical service: and it happened to a black eunuch who was with him that he suffered a fracture in his leg near the ankle; and the physician, in his ignorance, hastily bound the fracture over the wound with bandages and strong clamps, allowing no air to reach the wound.
Deinde absoluit eum secundum desyderia sua.	 "Then he released him according to his wishes.
Postea dimisit eum diebus aliquot, et praecepit ei, ne solueret ligamentum: et stetit sic donec apostematum est crus eius, et ipsius pes, et peruenit ad perditionem.	 "After that, he released him after a few days and ordered him not to loosen the bandage; and so it remained until his leg became gangrenous, along with his foot, leading to its destruction.
Vocatus sum ergo ad eum: et properaui ad soluendum ligamentum: et consecuta est tranquillitas, et euasit a doloribus suis.	 "So I was called to him and hastened to loosen the bandage; and he found relief and was freed from his pains.
Verumtamen corruptio iam confirmata erat in membro: et non potui refraenare ipsam.	 "But the corruption in the limb had already taken hold, and I could not stop it.
Pon ergo cessauit corruptio perambulare in membro, donec periit.	 Therefore, the corruption ceased to walk in the limb until it died.
Et uidi medicum alium, qui perforauit apostema cancerosum: et ulceratum est post dies, donec magnificata est malicia eius cum domino ipsius.	 And I saw another physician who pierced a cancerous abscess, and it became ulcerated after several days until the evil of it was greatly increased with its lord.
Quod est, quia quando est cancer purus ex humore melancholico, tunc non oportet ut perueniatur ad eum cum ferro omnino, nisi sit in membro quod toleret, ut abscindatur totum eius.	 That is, because when the cancer is pure of black bile, then it is not necessary to approach it with iron at all unless it is in a member that can bear it, so that all of it may be cut off.
Et propter illud o Filii, necesse est uobis, ut sciatis, quod operatio cum manu diuiditur in duas diuisiones: scilicet, operationem cui associatur salus: et operationem, cum qua est periculum in pluribus dispositionibus.	 And because of this, O sons, it is necessary for you to know that the surgical operation is divided into two divisions: namely, the operation associated with health and the operation which involves danger in many dispositions.
Et ego iam excitaui in omni loco huius libri, in quo uenit operatio, in qua est terror et timor.	 And I have already pointed out in every place of this book where an operation occurs which involves fear and dread.
Quare necesse est uobis, ut caueatis illud, et dimitatis ipsum: ut non inueniant stolidi uiam ad loquendum, et dehonestandum.	 Therefore it is necessary for you to beware of that and to avoid it, so that the foolish may not find a way to speak about it and dishonor it.
Accipite ergo mensuram cum sollicitudine et protectione, et infirmos uestros cum facilitate et firmitudine, et utimini uia meliore perducente gratia Dei ad salutem et successionem laudabilem: et dimittite aegritudines terribiles difficilis sanationis: et tollite animas uestras ab eo quod facit uos timere, ut ingrediatur super uos haesitatio in fide uestra et commodo uestro.	 Receive then the measure with diligence and caution, and your sick with ease and steadfastness, and use the better way which leads by the grace of God to health and praiseworthy success: and leave behind terrible diseases of difficult cure; and lift up your spirits from that which makes you fearful, so that hesitation may not come upon you in your faith and interest.
Est enim magis remanens ad gloriam uestram, et sublimius in mundo isto, et postremo ad quantitates uestras.	 For it remains more for your glory, and is higher in this world, and finally to the degree of your abilities.
Galenus enim iam dixit in quibusdam suis admonitionibus.	 For Galen has already said in some of his advice.
Non medicetis aegritudinem malam: ne nominemini medici mali.	 Do not treat the bad disease, lest you be called a bad physician.
Iam autem diuisi hunc Tractatum secundum tria Capitula. ¶	 Now, however, I have divided this Treatise into three Chapters.
Capitulum primum.	 Chapter One.
De Cauterio cum igne, et Cauterio cum medicina acuta, capitulatum, et ordinatum a capite usque ad pedes, et formis instrumentorum, et ferramentis Cauterii: et omni quod necessarium est in operatione. ¶	 On Cautery with Fire, and Cautery with Sharp Medicine, this Chapter is arranged and ordered from the head to the feet, including the shapes of the instruments and tools for cautery, and everything necessary for the operation.
Capitulum secundum.	 Chapter Two.
De sectione et perforatione, phlebotomia et uentosis, et uulneribus: et extractione sagittarum, et similibus illius: et totum capitulatum, ordinatum formis instrumentorum. ¶	 About incision and perforation, bloodletting and ventoses, and wounds: about the extraction of arrows and similar things: and all this is arranged according to the forms of the instruments.
Capitulum tertium.	 Chapter Three.
De restauratione, et dislocatione, et curatione torsionis, et similibus illius: capitulatum, ordinatum a capite usque ad pedes, et formis instrumentorum.	 About restoration and dislocation, and the cure of wrenching, and similar things: arranged from head to foot, according to the forms of the instruments.
Soli Deo Gloria.	 To God alone be the glory.
Liber Chirurgici Albucasis.	 The Surgical Book of Albucasis.
Pars I.	 Part One.
¶ De Iuuamento, et Nocumento Cauterii: et quibus complexionibus conueniat, et quo tempore: et si cum ferro, uel auro.	 ¶ About the help and harm of cautery: and in which temperaments it is suitable, and at what time: and whether with iron or gold. ✨
Caput I.	 Chapter One.
Sed Ante Quidem Quam rememorer operationis cum eo, oportet ut dicam qualitatem Iuuamentorum eius, et Nocumentorum ipsius: et in qua complexione exhibeatur.	 But before I remind you of the procedure with it, it is necessary for me to say about its benefits and harms, and in which temperament it should be administered.
Dico ergo, quod sermo de qualitate iuuamenti Cauterii, et nocumenti eius, est sermo prolixus, et subtilis, scientia, et secretum occultum.	 Therefore, I say that the discussion about the quality of the help and harm of cautery is a lengthy and subtle science, and an obscure secret.
Etiam locuta fuit in eo multitudo sapientum, et dissenserunt in eo: et mihi quidem sufficit parum ex sermonibus eorum, timens prolongationem.	 Many wise men have also spoken about it and disagreed about it, and for me, a little from their discussions is enough, fearing prolixity. ✨
Dico ergo, quod Cauterium confert uniuersaliter omni complexioni, quae est cum materia, et absque materia: excaeptis duabus complexionibus, quae sunt complexio calida absque materia, et complexio sicca absque materia.	 Therefore, I say that cautery benefits every temperament, whether material or immaterial, except for two temperaments: the hot temperament without matter and the dry temperament without matter.
In complexione autem calida et sicca cum materia dissenserunt.	 About the hot and dry temperament with matter, they disagreed.
Quidam enim dixerunt, quod Cauterium iuuatiuum est in ea.	 For some said that cautery is helpful in it. ✨ ✨ ✨
Et dixerunt alii contrarium illius, scilicet quod Cauterium non est conueniens in aegritudine, quae est ex caliditate et siccitate: quoniam natura ignis est caliditas: et inconueniens est, ut sanetur ex agritudine calida et sicca, cum calido et sicco.	 And others said the opposite of this, namely that cautery is not suitable in an illness caused by heat and dryness; for the nature of fire is heat, and it is inconvenient to cure a hot and dry illness with heat and dryness.
Et dixit ille qui dicit contrarium illius: quod per Cauterium fit iuuamentum in omni aegritudine calida et sicca, quae accidit in corporibus hominum: quoniam quando tu comparas corpus hominis, et humiditates eius, ad complexionem ignis, inuenis corpus hominis frigidum.	 And he who speaks against this said that cautery is beneficial in every warm and dry illness that occurs in the human body; for when you compare the human body and its moistures to the complexion of fire, you find the human body to be cold.
Et ego quidem dico per sermonem eius: quia ex perimentum iam detexit mihi illud aliquotiens.	 And I say through his speech: for experiment has already revealed this to me many times.
Verumtamen non oportet, ut ueniat super illud, nisi qui iam probatus est, et exercitatus in capitulo Cauterii exercitio ultimo, et cognouit diuersitatem complexionum hominum, et dispositionem aegritudinum in se ipsis, et caussas earum, et accidentia ipsarum, et spacium temporis earum.	 However, it is not fitting that anyone should approach this unless he has already been tested and trained in the final exercise of the chapter on cautery, and has recognized the diversity of human complexions, and the nature of illnesses in themselves, and their causes, and their accidents, and their duration.
Ex reliquis autem complexionibus non est super uos timor: et praecipue in aegritudinibus frigidis et humidis.	 As for the other complexions, there is no need to fear; especially in cold and moist illnesses.
Iam enim conuenerunt omnes medici super eas: et non dissenserunt in iuuamento cum Cauterio in eis.	 For all physicians have agreed on these matters and have not disagreed with the use of cautery in them.
Et scitote filii, quod ex secreto curationis per Cauterium cum igne, et bonitate eius super Cauterium cum medicina comburente est: quoniam ignis est simplex, cuius actio non peruenit, nisi ad membrum quod cauterisatur: et non nocet membro alio coniuncto cum eo, nisi nocumento paruo.	 And know, my sons, that the secret of cure by means of a cautery with fire and its efficacy over a cautery with combustible medicine is that fire is simple, whose action does not extend except to the member that is cauterized; and it does no harm to another member joined with it, except for a slight injury. xspace
Medicinae uero comburentis actio peruenit ad illud quod elongatur ex membris: et fortasse facit accidere in membro aegritudinem difficilis sanationis, et fortasse interficit.	 But the action of combustible medicine reaches even what is remote from the members; and perhaps it causes illness of difficult cure in a member, and perhaps it kills.  xspace  xspace
Ignis autem propter subtilitatem suam et bonitatem substantiae suae, non facit illud, nisi superfluat.	 But fire, because of its subtlety and the goodness of its substance, does not do this except in excess.
Iam uero innotuit nobis illud per experimentum, propter longitudinem seruitutis et studii cum arte, et stationem super ueritatem rerum: et propter illud excusor a longitudine sermonis.	 Now indeed this has been made known to us through experience because of the length of our service and study in the art, and our dedication to the truth; and for that reason I am excused from prolonging the discussion.
Et si non esset, quia non licet huic libro meo, afferrem uobis secretum occultum in igne, et qualitatem operationis eius in corporibus expulsionis suae, qua expellit aegritudines sermone philosophico demonstratiuo, qui acueretur a mentibus uestris.	 And if it were not allowed to this book of mine, I would bring you the secret hidden in fire and the quality of its operation in bodies for the purpose of expelling illnesses, demonstrated by a persuasive philosophical speech that would be accepted by your minds.
Et scitote filii, quod ipsi dissentiunt in tempore, in quo conuenit fieri cauterium, et ponunt melius tempus ueris.	 And know, children, that they disagree about the time when it is best to perform cautery, and they say that spring is the better time.
Et ego dico, quod cauterium conuenit in omni tempore: propterea, quod nocumentum accidens propter tempus submergitur in iuuamento, quod attrahitur cum cauterio.	 And I say that cautery is appropriate at all times because the harm that occurs due to the time is overshadowed by the benefit that is drawn from the cautery.
Et praecipue si cauterium est propter dolores ex doloribus necessariis, fortibus, festinis, qui non tolerant tarditatem: propterea quod timetur ex eis, quod accidat malicia quae est maior, quam paruum nocumentum intrans propter tempus.	 And especially if the cautery is due to severe, urgent pains that do not tolerate delay; because it is feared from them that a worse outcome will occur than the slight harm caused by timing.
Et non cadat in mentibus uestris o filii illud, quod non extimant, nisi uulgus et stolidi medici, scilicet quod illi aegritudini quae sanatur per cauterium, non est reditio semper: et ponunt illud consequens, et res non est sicut putant: propterea quod cauterium non est, nisi loco medicinae, quae alterat complexionem, et exiccat humiditates quae sunt caussae, quare accidunt dolores.	 And do not let it enter your minds, O children, that only the ignorant and foolish physicians believe that the illness treated by cautery does not always recur; and they conclude this, but it is not as they think. Because cautery is nothing other than a remedy which alters the complexion and dries up the humors which are the cause of the pains.
Verumtamen cauterium superfluit super medicinam per uelocitatem ualetudinis suae, et uirtutem suae operationis, et uehementiam dominii sui: et possibile est, ut redeat aegritudo hora aliqua temporis secundum complexionem infirmi, et locationem aegritudinis suae, et uirtutem eius: et quod praeparatur in corpore eius ex aggregatione superfluitatum in eo: et quod peruenit ad ipsum in acquisitione sua ex cibis, et similibus illis ex caussis, nisi fit aegritudo, in qua administratur cauterium.	 However, cautery is superior to medicine because of its quick effectiveness, the power of its action, and the intensity of its control. And it is possible that the illness may return at some point in time according to the constitution of the patient, the nature of his illness, its strength, what is prepared in his body from the accumulation of superfluous matter, and what reaches him through food and similar causes, unless the illness for which cautery is applied is fatal.
Aegritudo subtilis in membro paucarum superfluitatum, et humiditatum, sicut cauterium dentis, propter dolorem, et similia illi, possibile est enim, ut non redeat in eo ille dolor.	 A subtle illness of a member with few superfluities and humors, such as tooth cautery for pain and similar conditions, it is possible that the pain may not return.
Sed illud fit in paucis.	 "But that occurs rarely.
At uero sermo uulgi iterum, quod cauterium est postremum medicinae, est sermo rectus: non ad illud quod ipsi intendunt in illo: quoniam ipsi credunt, quod non est curatio quae conferat cum medicina, neque cum alio post occasum cauterii.	 But the common saying again is true, that cautery is the last resort of medicine; and their intention is not as they themselves intend in it, for they believe that no treatment can be applied together with medicine after the effect of cautery.
Res autem est econtrario illius, et intentio, quod cauterium est postremum medicinae, non est, nisi quod quando nos administramus modos curationis in aliqua aegritudinum, et non conferunt illae medicinae: deinde administramus in fine rei cauterium, et confert: tunc inde cadit, quod cauterium est postremum mediciuae, non secundum intentionem quam intelligunt uulgus et multistolidorum medicorum.	 But the truth is contrary to that saying, and the meaning, that cautery is the last resort of medicine, does not exist except in this sense: when we administer treatment methods for some diseases and they do not help, then at the end we apply cautery, and it helps; thus it follows that cautery is the last resort of medicine, not according to the intention that the common people and many stupid physicians understand.
Antiqui autem dixerunt, quod cauterium cum auro est melius, quam cauterium cum ferro: et non dixerunt illud, nisi propter aequalitatem auri, et sublimitatem substantiae suae: et dixerunt, quod non facit pus locus cauterii.	 The ancients said that cautery with gold is better than cautery with iron; and they did not say this except because of the balance of gold and the nobility of its substance; and they said that cautery does not cause suppuration in the place where it is applied.
Verum non est illud absolute: quoniam ego iam probaui illud, et inueni, quod ipsum non facit illud in quibusdam corporibus absque aliis.	 However, that is not absolutely true; for I have already tested it and found that cautery itself does not do this in some bodies without other factors involved.
Et cauterium cum ipso est bonum, et melius quam cum ferro, sicut dixerunt.	 And cautery with gold is good, and better than with iron, as they said.
Verumtamen quando tu ignis cauterium in igne ex auro, non declaratur tibi, quando ignitur secundum quantitatem quam uis, propter rubedinem auri: et quando properat ad ipsum frigus, et si addis super ipsum ignitionem, liquescit in igne, et uertitur in laminas.	 Nevertheless, when you cauterize with fire from gold, the fire does not show you when it is ignited to the degree that you wish, because of the redness of the gold; and when it quickly turns cold, if you add more fire upon it, it melts in the fire and turns into plates.
Quare cadit artifex ex illo in occupationem: et propter illud fit Cauterium cum ferro apud nos uelocius et propinquius, ex rectitudine ad operationem.	 Therefore, the craftsman falls short in that respect; and because of this, cautery with iron is faster and more convenient for us, in terms of correct practice.
Et ego quidem iam ordinaui hoc Capitulum in Cauterio, secundum capitula: et ordinaui ea a capite usque ad pedes: ut alleuient quaerenti illud quod uult ex eo.	 And I have indeed already arranged this chapter on cautery according to chapters, and I have arranged them from head to foot, so that those who seek it may find what they want from it.
¶ De modo cauterizandi Caput in commissura coronali.	 "On the method of cauterizing the head at the coronal suture.
Caput II.	 "Chapter II.
Confert hic cauterizatio ad dominium humiditatis et frigiditatis super cerebrum: quae duae sunt caussae sodae, et multitudinis fluxus humorum ex capite ad partes oculorum et aurium, et multitudinis somni, et doloris dentium, et doloris gutturis: et uniuersaliter omnis aegritudinis, quae accidit ex frigiditate, sicut paralisis, et sodae, epilepsiae, et apoplexiae, et similia illis ex aegritudinibus.	 "This cauterization is beneficial for controlling moisture and cold on the brain: these two conditions are causes of headaches, excessive flow of humors from the head to the eyes and ears, excess sleep, toothache, throat pain, and universally all illnesses arising from coldness, such as paralysis, headaches, epilepsy, apoplexy, and similar diseases.
Modus cauterizationis est, ut praecipias infirmo: ut euacuetur in primis cum medicina solutiua mundificante caput tribus noctibus, aut quatuor, secundum quod exigit uirtus infirmi, et eius aetas, et consuetudo eius.	 "The method of cauterization is that you instruct the patient to first empty the head for three or four nights with cleansing medicine, according to the strength of the patient, age, and habit.
Deinde praecipe ei, ut radi faciat caput suum cum nouacula.	 "Then instruct him to shave his head with a razor.
Deinde fac eum sedere inter manus tuas quadratum, ita quod iam posuit manus suas super pectus suum.	 "Then have him sit upright between your hands, placing his own hands on his chest.
Deinde pone radicem palmae tuae super radicem nasi sui inter oculos suos.	 "Then place the base of your palm on the base of his nose between his eyes.
Vbicumque ergo peruenerit digitus tuus medius, signa locum illum cum incausto.	 "Wherever your middle finger reaches, mark that spot with ink.
Deinde igni Cauterium Oliuare: cuius haec est forma.	 "Then heat the cautery in oil. This is its shape.
Deinde pone ipsum super locum signatum cum incausto, descensione, qua constringatur manus tua paulatim, et tu reuolues ipsum.	 "Then place it on the marked spot with ink. Gradually lower your hand to press it firmly and rotate it.
Deinde leua manum tuam uelociter, et aspicias locum.	 "Then quickly lift your hand and examine the spot.
Quod si uides iam detegi ex osse quantitatem capitis alkiel, aut quantitatem zeuherbi, tunc eleua manum tuam.	 "If you see that the area as large as a lentil or a grain of barley has been exposed from the bone, then lift your hand.
Et si non, itera manum tuam ferro ipso, aut cum alio ab ipso si infrigidatur: donec uideantur ossa, quae dixi tibi.	 "And if not, repeat the process with the same iron or another if it cools, until you see the bone as I have told you.
Deinde sume aliquid ex sale, et solue illud in aqua, et imbibe in ipso cotum, et pone super locum: et dimitte ipsum tribus diebus.	 "Then take some salt, dissolve it in water, and soak a cloth in the solution. Place the cloth on the spot and leave it for three days.
Deinde pone super ipsum cotum imbibitum in butyro, et dimitte illum super locum, donec destruatur eschara ignis.	 Then place a piece of cloth soaked in butter over it and leave it there until the fire burn is destroyed.
Deinde cura illud cum unguento tetrapharmacon, usquequo sanetur.	 Then care for it with tetrapharmacon ointment until it heals.
Iam dixerunt, quod quanto uulnus plus remanet apertum, emittit pus: quare est melius et magis iuuatiuum.	 Now they say that the more a wound remains open, the more pus it sends out; therefore it is better and more beneficial.
Et dixerunt quidam eorum, ut cauterizetur cutis usque ad os: et teneatur Cauterium, donec aduratur quiddam spissitudinis ossis.	 And some of them said that the skin should be cauterized to the bone, and that the cautery should be held until a thick part of the bone is burned.
Deinde radatur post illud quod adustum est ex osse, deinde curetur.	 Then that part which has been burnt from the bone is scraped away, then it is cleaned out.
Et dicunt alii, quod oportet ut cum cauterio perueniatur ad ultimum, donec imprimat in os impressionem for tem, ita quod cadat os, quod fit sicut forma kirate: aut instrumentum quod mulieres ponunt infuso alphabeti parui: et extimant, quod exspirantur ex hoc loco uapores capitis, et dimittatur uulnus apertum tempore longo.	 And others say that it is necessary to go with the cautery to the very end, until it makes an imprint in the bone like a tem, so that the bone falls away; this happens just as if one were using a kirate or the instrument which women put into alphabet infusions. And they believe that from this place the vapors of the head are expelled and the wound is left open for a long time.
Deinde curetur, donec consolidetur.	 Then it should be cleaned out until it heals over.
Mihi autem non uidentur hae duae species Cauterii omnino nisi in quibusdam hominibus secundum uiam timoris.	 But these two types of cautery do not seem to me to be suitable except in some people according to the way of fear.
Et dimittere ipsum, apud me est melius cum salute ipsius.	 And to let it go is, in my opinion, better for the patient's health.
Debilitatur enim caput ex solutione continuitatis ipsius naturalis: sicut testificati sumus in reliquis membris: et praecipue quando caput infirmi debile est natura: et species quidem Cauterii prima est magis salua et melior apud me, et ea utor: operare ergo cum ea in salute.	 For the head is weakened by the dissolution of its natural continuity, as we have shown with other members; and especially when the head of the patient is naturally weak. The first type of cautery is safer and better in my opinion, and that is what I use. So, work with it for the sake of health.
¶ De modo cauterizandi capitis in dolore totius capitis.	 ¶ On how to cauterize the head for pain throughout the entire head.
Caput III.	 Chapter III
Quando in toto Capite accidit dolor chronicus: et prolongatur illud in infirmo, et utitur hyeris, et cochiis, et caputpurgiis, et oleis, et empleumatis.	 When chronic and persistent pain occurs throughout the entire head, and the patient uses syrups, powders, purges, oils, and fumigations.
Et praecipue si iam cauterizatum est cauterio uno, quod narrauimus, et non confert ei aliquid ex illis: tunc considera.	 And especially if it has already been cauterized with that one-pronged iron I mentioned, and nothing else helps: then consider.
Nam si caput infirmi est fortis creationis natura, et non est debile, et inuenit frigus uehemens: tunc cauteriza cum cauterio alio sub illo parum.	 For if the head of the sick person is of strong and robust nature, not weak, and he finds extreme cold: then cauterize him with a different iron under that one.
Deinde cauteriza ipsum super omne cornu capitis sui cauterio, do nec pertranseat cutis, et discooperiatur ex osse quantitas, quam narrauimus.	 Then cauterize him over every horn of his head with the iron, so that it does not pierce the skin, and expose the amount of bone I mentioned.
Et cauteriza ipsum cauterio uno in occipitio capitis sui, in loco qui nominatur uas: et est locus in quo ponitur uentosa: et eleua matum tuam in hoc, et non discooperias os.	 And cauterize him with a single iron on the back of his head at a place called 'uas', which is the location where the windpipe is placed. Raise your hand in this manner, and you will not expose bone.
Infirmus enim inuenit propter illud dolorem uehementem, et diuersum a dolore reliquorum cauteriorum capitis omnium.	 For the sick person finds on account of this an intense pain, and different from the pain of all other head cauteries.
Et ego dicam hoc Cauterium in loco suo: et oportet quod sit cauterium, quo cauterizantur cornua capitis, et occiput eius subtilius cauterio, quo cauterizatur medium capitis.	 And I call this the Cautery in its place. And it is necessary that it be a finer iron than the one used to cauterize the horns of the head and the back of the head.
Et haec est forma eius.	 And this is its shape.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in hemicrania, tam cum medicina adustiua, quam cum ferro.	 ¶ On the method of cauterizing for headache, both with burnt medicine and with iron.
Caput IIII.	 Chapter IV.
Quando accidit in parte capitis dolor et soda, aut extenditur dolor usque ad oculum, et euacuatur cum medicinis mundificantibus caput, et administratur reliqua curatio, quam dixi in diuisionibus aegritudinum, et non confert illud totum: tunc cauterizatio in eo est secundum duos modos: aut cauterizatio cum medicina acuta comburente: aut cum ferro.	 When pain and headache occur in any part of the head, or when the pain extends to the eye and is evacuated with purifying medications, and the rest of the treatment is administered as I mentioned in the divisions of illnesses, but it does not help entirely, then there are two ways to cauterize: either with a sharp burning medicine or with iron. ︎
Cauterium autem cum medicina acuta comburente, est, ut accipias dentem unum allii, et excortices ipsum, et abscindas extremitates eius ex duobus lateribus.	 Now, to cauterize with a sharp burning medicine, take one clove of garlic and peel it, then cut off its ends from both sides.
Deinde scinde locum doloris in tempore cum phlebotomo lato, donec fiat in eo locus sub cute, in quo dens capitur.	 Then divide the place of pain with a broad lancet, until there is a space under the skin where the tooth can be placed. ︎
Intromitte ergo eum in ipso sub cute, donec occultetur: deinde stringe super ipsum cum puluillo constrictione decenti, et dimitte ipsum quantitate quindecim horarum deinde solue eum, et extrahe allium, et dimitteuulnus duobus diebus, aut tribus: postea pone super ipsum cotum submersum in butyro, donec locus efficiat pus: deinde cura ipsum cum unguento usquequo sanetur.	 Insert it under the skin until it is hidden; then bind it with a suitable bandage above. Leave it for fifteen hours, then remove it and extract the garlic. Leave the wound open for two or three days; afterwards place a pledget soaked in butter over the wound until pus forms; then treat it with an ointment until it heals.
Et si uis fac illud cum quibusdam medicinis comburentibus, quas ego scripsi in tractatu duodecimo, de Medieinis adurentibus.	 And if you wish, make this preparation with some of the warming medicines that I have written about in chapter twelve on heating medicines.
Cauterizatio uero eius cum ferro, est secundum hunc modum.	 To cauterize it with iron is done as follows:
Igni Cauterium, cuius forma haec est.	 The fire brand, which looks like this.
Et nominatur Clauilis: quoniam forma capitis eius est sicut forma claui, in quo est quiddam curuitatis, et in medio eius est quaedam eminentia parua.	 And it is called a "Claw"; because the head of it resembles the shape of a nail with some curvature, and in its middle there is a small projection.
Deinde pone ipsum super locum, et retine manum tuam: et tu reuolue ferrum paulatim cum uelocitate: et sit quantitas quae aduritur ex spissitudine cutis, sicut medietas eius.	 Then place it on the wound and hold your hand firmly; and slowly rotate the iron with speed; and let the amount that is burned be half the thickness of the skin.
Et eleua manum tuam, ut non aduratur arteria, quae est inferius, et accidat fluxus sanguinis.	 And raise your hand so that the vein underneath is not burned and bleeding occurs.
Deinde imbibe cotum in aqua salis, et pone super locum, et dimitte ipsum tribus diebus: deinde pone cotum cum butyro: postea cura cum unguento usquequo sanetur.	 Then soak a pledget in salt water and place it on the wound and leave it for three days; then place a pledget with butter; afterwards treat it with an ointment until it heals. ︎
Et si uis, cauteriza hanc hemicraniam cum extremitate cultellari secunda Cauterii.	 And if you wish, cauterize this half-head wound with the pointed end of a second cautery.
Et caue ab incisione arteriae in hac hemicrania, non antiqua proprie.	 And be careful not to cut an artery in this half-skull, unless it is necessary. ︎
¶ De modo cauteriezandi in hemicrania antiqua.	 ¶ On the method of cauterizing in old half-skulls.
Caput V.	 Chapter Five
Quando curas hemicraniam, cum eo quod diximus ex curatione praecedente, et quod diximus in diuisionibus aegritudinum, et non confert curatio: et uides ex aegritudine, quod non sufficit ei quod diximus ex cauterio primo cum medicina, aut cum cauterio cum igne, tunc oportet ut ignias Cauterium cultellare, donec albificetur postquam signas super locum doloris cum linea, cuius longitudo sit medietas digiti, aut quasi illud: et depone manum tuam uice una, et stringe eam donec incidas arteriam, et peruenias usque ad os.	 When you are treating half-skull with what we have said in the preceding treatment and in the divisions of diseases, and it does not heal; and you see from the disease that what we have said about cautery with medicine or with a heated iron is not enough, then you should heat a pointed cautery until it whitens after marking the place of pain with a line whose length is half a finger or similar to that; and raise your hand once, and bind it until you cut the artery and reach the bone.
Verumtamen necesse est tibi, ut caueas a continuatione mandibulae, quae mouetur apud masticationem, ne aduratur latus, aut neruus qui mouet ipsam, unde accidat spasmus.	 But you must be careful not to burn the side or the nerve that moves the jaw during chewing, lest a spasm occur.
Et esto super custotiam, et cautelam de fluxu sanguinis arteriae, quae abscisa est.	 And be on guard against the flow of blood from the cut artery.
In abscisione enim eius est timor, et praecipue ei qui ignorat illud quod facit, et non est studiosus, nec expertus: et dimittit operationem cum eo in primis.	 For its incision is dangerous, especially for one who is ignorant of what he does, unstudious, and inexperienced; and he leaves off the operation with that in particular.
Et ego ueniam cum rememoratione regiminis fluxus sanguinis accidentis ex arteria secundum modum suum, et in loco suo huius libri.	 And I shall pardon myself by remembering to give rules for stopping the flow of blood from an artery according to its manner and in the proper place in this book.
Quod si uides ex aegritudine, quod non sufficit ei hoc Cauterium, et uides corpus infirmi tolerans cauterium in medio capitis, sicut narrauimus, cura uulnus, donec sanetur.	 But if you see from the illness that this cautery is not enough, and you see the patient's body tolerating a cautery on the middle of the head, as we have said, care for the wound until it heals.
Et si uis, administra Cauterium, quod diximus in capitulo extractionis arteriae cum Cauterio habente duos cultellos.	 And if you wish, administer the cautery that we have mentioned in the chapter on extracting an artery with a two-bladed knife.  />
Est enim cauterizatio melior hac et magis conferens.	 For this cautery is better and more beneficial than that one.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in dolore Aurium.	 ¶ On the method of cauterizing for earache.
Caput VI.	 Chapter Six
Quando accidit in Aure dolor a frigore, et curatur cum solutiuis, et reliqua curatione quam diximus in diuisione, et non remouetur dolor, tunc igni Cauterium: et est illud quod nominatur Punctum, cuius forma est haec.	 When earache occurs from cold and is treated with solutions and other methods of treatment as we have said in the division, but the pain is not removed, then use fire for cautery; and this is what is called a "Puncture," the form of which is as follows:  />  >
Deinde puncta cum eo post eius ignitionem in circumitu auris totius, sicut reuoluitur: aut in circumitu utriusque, si simul dolor est in utrisque.	 Then, after it is heated by fire, make punctures with it around the entire ear, as shown here: or around both ears if the pain is in both at the same time.
Et elonga te cum Cauterio a radice auris parumper, postquam signaueris loca cum encaustro: et sit cauterii quantitas decem punctorum in omni aure, et quasi illa.	 And keep the cautery a short distance from the root of the ear after marking the places with the iron: and let there be ten punctures on each ear, as shown here.
Deinde cura loca, donec sanentur.	 Then care for the places until they heal.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Tortura.	 In the way of cauterizing in Torture.
Caput VII.	 Chapter VII.
Tortura quae curatur cum cauterizatione, non est nisi ex speciebus, quae accidunt ex phlegmate, secundum quod diximus in diuisionibus aegritudinum.	 The torture that is treated with cauterization is not anything other than the types which occur from phlegm, as we have said in the divisions of diseases.
Et deuita cauterizationem speciei, quae accidit ex exiccatione, et spasmo nerui.	 And avoid cauterizing the type that occurs from dryness and nerve spasm.
Quando curas hanc speciem torturae cum hyeris, et caputpurgiis, et gargarismis, et non confert curatio tua, tunc oportet ut cauterizes infirmum tribus Cauteriis: uno apud radicem auris, et secundo parum inferius a timpore suo, et tertio apud coniunctionem duorum labiorum.	 When you treat this type of torture with medicines, purgatives, gargles, and your treatment does not help, then it is necessary to cauterize the patient with three cauteries: one at the root of the ear, another a little below its tympanum, and the third at the junction of the two lips.
Et pone Cauterium tuum ex contrario partis infirmae.	 And place your cautery on the opposite side of the diseased part.
Quoniam mollificatio non accidit, nisi in parte quae apparet sana.	 Because softening does not occur except in the part that appears healthy.
Et forma cauterizationis est, ut cauterizes ipsum Cauterio in directo extremitatis auris superioris sub cornu capitis parum: et alio in timpore: cuius longitudo sit secundum longitudinem pollicis.	 And the manner of cauterization is that you cauterize it with a cautery directly at the tip of the upper ear, a little under the horn of the head: and another one on the tympanum, whose length should be according to the length of the thumb.
Et depone manum tuam cum cauterio, donec comburatur quantitas medietatis spissitudinis cutis.	 And place your hand with the cautery until the amount equivalent to half the thickness of the skin is burned.  /> Si quis non est prudens in hac arte, vide ne uelimus, ne uideantur perforationes in ea parte.
Et haec est forma Cauterii, et est species ex cultellari, cuius forma praemissa est: uerumtamen non est subtilior ea parum, sicut uides: et oportet ut sit cultellus in eo superfluae grossitudinis parum.	 And this is the form of the cautery, and it is a species made from an old knife, whose form has been mentioned above; however, it is not a little subtler than what you see: and it is necessary that there be a little excess in the thickness of the knife.
Deinde cura loca, cum eo quod praecessit: donec sanetur.	 Then treat the places with what was mentioned previously until they heal.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Apoplexia antiqua.	 ¶ On the method of cauterizing for old apoplexy.
Caput VIII.	 Chapter VIII.
QUando antiquatur Apoplexia, et curas eam cum eo quod diximus, et non confert medicatio tua, et infirmus non habet febrem, tunc cauteriza eum quatuor cauteriis super omne cornu capitis sui, et cauterio in medio capitis, sicut diximus, et cauterio in occipitio capitis, secundum quod praecessit: et modus cauterii sit secundum quod praecessit.	 When apoplexy becomes chronic and you treat it with what we have mentioned, and your treatment does not help, and the patient has no fever, then cauterize him with four cauteries on every horn of his head, and a cautery in the middle of the head as we said, and a cautery at the back of the head, as previously stated; and let the manner of the cautery be as previously mentioned.  /> Et si fuerit in infirmo fomes, nequeas curare eum: sed poteris curare eum cum cauteriis, et praedicta medicamenta, secundum quod diximus, et si non sanabitur nisi uerecundia tua in deum.
Etiam cauterizatur cum Cauterio super os stomachi: et est magis ultimum.	 And it is also cauterized with a cautery over the mouth of the stomach; and it is more ultimate.
Deinde curetur, cum eo quod praecessit.	 Then it should be scraped, along with what has preceded.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Obliuione.	 On the Method of Cauterization for Forgetfulness.
Caput IX.	 Chapter IX.
Oportet ut in potu dentur in primis infirmo hyerae magnae, et pillulae mundificantes cerebrum.	 It is necessary that in the first place large henbane seeds and purifying pills for the brain be given to the patient to drink.
Deinde rade caput infirmi totum, et pone super occipitium eius emplastrum de synapi descriptum in tractatu emplastrorum: et pone ipsum aliquotiens.	 Then shave the entire head of the patient and place on his occiput a plaster made from mustard, as described in the treatise on plasters; and apply it several times.
Ipsum namque est modus Cauterii: et fac illud secundum ordinem eundem, quem dixi illic.	 For this is the method of cautery; and do it in the same way as I have said there.
Si ergo sanatur per illud, bonum est.	 If therefore he is cured by that, it is good.
Si non: tunc fac ei cauteria tria in posteriori parte capitis sui, quae sint descendentia a superiori parte capitis usque ad inferiorem partem oculi: et pone inter omne cauterium grossitudinem digiti.	 If not, then make three cauteries on the back of his head, which should descend from the upper part of the head to the lower part of the eye; and put the width of a finger between each cautery.
Deinde cura Cauterium, cum eo quod praecessit.	 Then treat the cauteries as described above.
Si autem uis additionem, et infirmus est tolerans illud: tunc fac ei Cauterium in medio.	 If you wish to add more and the patient is able to bear it, then make a cautery in the middle.
Quod si uis additionem: tunc cauteriza ipsum super duo cornua.	 If you wish to add more, then cauterize him over both temples.
Deinde cura ipsum, donec sanetur: sitque Cauterium oliuare secundum formam, quae praemissa est.	 Then treat the patient until he is cured; and let the cautery be oiled according to the shape described above.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Paralisi, et mollificatione.	 On the Method of Cauterization for Paralysis and Softening.
Caput X.	 Chapter X.
Oportet ut procedas in mundificatione capitis cum hyeeris, et cum eo quod diximus.	 It is necessary that you proceed with the purification of the head using henbane and as we have said.  /> ¶ Et sit haec modus Cauterii.
Deinde rade caput infirmi: postea cauteriza ipsum cauterio in medio capitis, et cauterio super omne cornu capitis, et cauterio super posterius ipsius, et tribus super spondiles colli.	 Then shave the patient's head. After that, cauterize him with a cautery in the middle of his head, and with a cautery over each temple, and with a cautery on the back of his head, and with three cauteries on the vertebrae of his neck.  /> Et si fuerit necesse: tunc fac ei cauteria quatuor ad uires eius, et sit illud in capite, et inter oculos, et in medio colli, et in medio thoracis.
Si autem indiges in aegritudine mollificatione corporis pluribus illis, et infirmus est tolerans, et aegritudo est fortis: tunc cauteriza ipsum quatuor cauteriis super spondiles dorsi, et ultima cum cauterio, donec comburatur ex cute plurimum eius, et eleua manum tuam.	 If however you need to soothe the body with many of those during illness, and if the patient is weak and the disease is strong: then cauterize him with four cauteries on the vertebrae of the back, and with the last cautery until most of the skin is burned off, and lift your hand.
Deinde cura ipsum, donec sanetur: et sic cauterium Oliuare.	 Then care for him until he heals; and thus ends the section on cauterization.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Epilepsia.	 On the manner of cauterizing in epilepsy.
Caput XI.	 Chapter XI.
Non Cauterizatur epilepticus, nisi ille cuius epilepsia est ex phlegmate.	 An epileptic is not to be cauterized unless his epilepsy is due to phlegm.
Oportet ergo ut mundifices cerebrum eius in primis cum hyeris, et cum reliqua curatione quam diximus in diuisione: quando infirmus est magnus, aut est tolerans in accaeptione medicinarum.	 Therefore, it is necessary that you cleanse his brain first with cupping glasses and with the rest of the treatment which we have said in the division, when the patient is large or can tolerate the taking of medicines.
Si autem est puer, qui non tolerat medicinas, tunc administratur gargarisma, et masticationes mundificantes cerebrum, ante illud diebus multis cum bonificatione ciborum.	 But if he is a child who cannot tolerate medicines, then let him be given gargles and cleansing foods to chew for many days before that, with the improvement of his diet.
Deinde rade caput eius, postea cauteriza ipsum Cauterio uno in medio capitis, secundum quod praecessit in modo: et cauterio alio in occipitio eius, et super omne cornu capitis sui cauterio.	 Then shave his head; afterward cauterize him with one cautery in the middle of his head, according to what was said before about the manner; and with another cautery on the back of his head, and over each horn of his head with a cautery.
Quod si infirmus fuerit fortis, et fuerit tolerans, tunc cauteriza ipsum cauteriis, quae dixi in habente paralisim, et mollificationem corporis super spondiles colli, et spondiles dorsi: et sit Cauterium oliuare secundum modum qui praecessit.	 But if the patient is strong and can tolerate it, then cauterize him with the cauteries which I mentioned for those with paralysis, and to soothe the body on the vertebrae of the neck and back: and let the final cautery be according to the manner which was said before. 》
Si autem infirmus est puer, tunc pone cauterium subtile, secundum hunc modum.	 But if the patient is a child, then place a fine cautery accordingly.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Melancholia.	 On the manner of cauterizing in melancholy. 》 》
Caput XII.	 Chapter XII.
Quando caussa melancholiae sunt humiditates corruptae, et phlegma grossum, tunc cauteriza ipsum Cauteriis, quae diximus in habente paralisim.	 When the cause of melancholy is corrupted moisture and thick phlegm, then cauterize him with the cauteries which we mentioned for those with paralysis.
Et si caussa melancholiae est superfluitas decliuis ad melancholiam, et est corpus infirmi humectum, tunc da ei in potu quod mundificet cerebrum eius, secundum quod praecessit in diuisione: deinde rade caput infirmi, et fac postea tortellam decenter factam ex lino, sicut circulum.	 And if the cause of melancholy is an excess of black bile towards melancholy, and the body of the sick person is moist, then give him to drink that which cleanses his brain, according to what preceded in the division: then shave the head of the sick person, and afterwards make a neatly made tortilla from linen, like a circle.
Deinde pone ipsam in medio capitis: et infirmus sedens quadratus teneatur ab omni parte.	 Then place it in the middle of the head; and let the sick person, sitting square, be held on every side.
Deinde praesenta linimentum.	 Then present a poultice.
Et est dignius ex butyro ouium antiquo.	 And it is more suitable from old ewe's butter.
Et calefac ipsum super ignem calefactione temperata mensura, quam toleret digitus, quando intromittitur in ipsum.	 And heat it over a fire with a moderate amount of warmth, so that when the finger is inserted into it, it may bear it.
Deinde euacua ipsum in medio capitis eius in circulo, et dimitte ipsum donec infrigidetur.	 Then evacuate it onto the middle of his head in a circle, and leave it until it cools.  />  Et quando frigida facta est, tollens illud de capite infirmi, fac quod uelis.
Fac illud infirmo omni hebdomada semel, cum reliquo regimine eius bono, donec sanetur.	 Do this for the sick person once a week with the rest of his good regime until he is cured.
Aut si uis, cauteriza ipsum faciendo puncta parua plurimum eius, praeter quod teneas manum cum cauterio: imo sit odorando.	 Or if you wish, cauterize it by making many small punctures, except that you hold the hand with the cautery; rather let it be fragrant.
Haec enim species cauterii humectat cerebrum cum qualitate.	 For this kind of cautery moistens the brain with its quality.
Deinde pone super ipsum cotum imbibitum in butyro, aut adipe gallinae.	 Then place upon it a cloth soaked in butter or chicken fat.

When the beginning of water in the eye is declared to you by the signs that I have mentioned in the division, then begin and give the sick person to drink that which cleanses his head.
Et custodi ipsum ab omnibus humiditatibus, et fac eum sedere in balneo, in ieiunio diebus aliquot.	 And keep him away from all moist things, and make him sit in a bathhouse in fasting for several days.
Deinde praecipe ei, ut radat caput suum, et cauteriza ipsum in medio capitis sui.	 Then instruct him to shave his head, and cauterize it in the middle of his head.  />  Et sit hoc in diebus plurimis: et postea fac eum radere caput suum.
Deinde cauteriza ipsum super duo timpora duobus cauteriis, si est incaeptio descensus aquae in duobus oculis simul: aut ex latere uno, si est incaeptio aquae in oculo uno: et abscinde cum cauterio omnes uenas et arterias quae sunt sub cute: et sint cauteria in ea longa in latitudine timporum: et caue a fluxu sanguinis.	 Then burn the patient above both temples with two irons, if the water flow is beginning simultaneously in both eyes; or from one side only, if the flow is starting in one eye. And cut off with an iron all veins and arteries that are under the skin: and let the cauteries be long in the breadth of the temples; and take care to prevent the flow of blood.
Quod si uides aliquid ex eo, tunc abscinde eum statim cum quacumque medicina est possibile: et ego ueniam cum sapientia, quae est in extractione arteriarum, et abscisione earum, et cautela a fluxu sanguinis.	 If you see anything from it, then cut it off immediately with whatever medicine is possible; and I will come with the wisdom which is in the extraction of arteries, and their cutting, and care to prevent the flow of blood.
Et quandoque cauterizatur in ceruice, sub duobus ossibus, duobus cauteriis ultime productis.	 And sometimes it should be burned on the neck under two bones with two irons fully extended.

Quando lachrymae oculorum sunt antiquae, assiduae: et sunt super uenas, et arterias quae sunt in manifesto capitis exterius, uerificatur quod illud est ex superfluitatibus frigidis, phlegmaticis: tunc cauteriza cauterio eodem quod narraui in incaeptione aquae descendentis, cauterio in medio capitis, et duobus cauteriis super duo timpora, et duobus cauteriis in ceruice sub duobus ossibus.	 When the tears of the eyes are old and persistent, and they are over the veins and arteries which are evident on the outer surface of the head, it is verified that this comes from cold, phlegmatic excesses; then burn with the same iron as I described in the case of water starting to flow, with one iron in the middle of the head, and two irons over both temples, and two irons on the neck under two bones.
Et si indiges additione, tunc cauteriza ipsum in omni latere caute oculi, super extremitatem supercilii cum cauterio paruo.	 And if you need to add more, then burn the patient carefully on every side of the eye, at the outer edge of the eyebrow with a small iron.

¶ De modo cauterizandi in mollificatione Palpebrae.	 In the manner of cauterizing for the softening of the eyelid.
Caput XVI.	 Chapter 16.
Quando mollificatur Palpebra oculi ab aegritudine, aut humiditate: tunc cauteriza Palpebram cauterio uno, cum hoc cauterio lunari.	 When the eyelid of the eye is softened by illness or moisture, then cauterize the eyelid with one cautery, and this lunar cautery.
Et si uis, cauteriza ipsum supra duo supercilia parum duobus cauteriis in omni parte: et elongentur a duobus timporibus: et sit longitudo omnis cauterii, secundum longitudines supercilii: et non ultimes manum tuam cum cauterio, imo secundum quantitatem quod aduritur tertia palpebrae.	 And if you wish, cauterize [the area] above the two eyebrows a little with two cauteries on every side, and let them be distant from the two temples; and let the length of every cautery be according to the length of the eyebrow, and do not touch with your hand the cautery, but according to the amount that the third eyelid is burnt.
Et haec est forma cauterii secundum hunc modum cauterii lunaris.	 And this is the shape of the cautery in this manner of the lunar cautery.
¶ De modo cauterizandi Palpebram cum pili inuersantur pungentes oculum.	 In the manner of cauterizing the eyelid when the hairs turn in and prick the eye. )))

Cauterium in eo est secundum duos modos: aut cauterium cum igne: aut cauterium cum medicina comburente.	 There are two ways to cauterize it: either with a hot iron, or with a burning medicine.
In cauterio autem cum igne, praecipe infirmo ante illud, ut dimittat pilos suos, si est ex illis qui mundant eos, donec prolongentur et aequentur.	 But in the case of the hot iron, tell the patient beforehand to let his hairs grow, if he is one of those who plucks them out, until they lengthen and become even. ))) ))) ))) )))
Si autem pungunt eum apud ortum suum: tunc constringe oculos eius cum uitta, ut non moueantur, donec nascantur.	 But if they prick him at their origin, then bind his eyes with a bandage, so that they do not move, until they are born. )))
Cum ergo nascuntur et aequantur, tunc pone caput infirmi in sinu tuo: deinde signa super Palpebram oculorum eius cum encaustro, signo quod sit secundum figuram folii myrti: et sit principium signi prope pilos.	 When they are born and become even, then put the patient's head in your lap; then mark on his eyelid with caustic, a mark that should be like the shape of a myrtle leaf; and let the beginning of the mark be near the hairs.
Deinde pone cotum imbibitum in albumine oui: aut in mucilagine psilii super oculum.	 Then place a cloth soaked in egg white, or in slippery elm mucilage, over the eye.
Deinde igni cauterium, cuius forma est haec.	 Then, for the cautery iron, which looks like this.
Deinde cauteriza super figuram, quam signasti paulatim in uicibus multis, donec comburatur superficies cutis, quae est sicut figura folii myrti, totam apparentem proprie.	 Then cauterize over the figure which you have marked little by little in several places, until the surface of the skin, which is like a myrtle leaf, is entirely burned and appears properly.
Et signum sanitatis operis tui est: ut si uideas Palpebram oculi iam contrahi, et pilos eleuari apud puncturam oculi.	 And the sign of health in your work is that if you see the eyelid already contracting and the hairs rising at the point of the eye.
Eleua ergo manum tuam tunc: et dimitte ipsum tribus diebus.	 Then raise your hand (i.e., stop treating): and leave him for three days.
Deinde pone super ipsum Cotum cum butyro, donec eradicetur eschara.	 Then put on him cotton with butter, until the scab is removed.
Deinde cura ipsum cum unguento, donec sanetur.	 Then treat him with ointment, until he heals.
Quod si redeat aliquod ex pilis post horam, et mollificetur palpebra: tunc itera Cauterium super illum locum, sicut fecisti in primis.	 If any of the hairs returns after an hour and the eyelid softens, then repeat the cautery on that spot as you did at first.
Si autem pili sunt in inferiori: tunc cauteriza ipsam, donec eleuetur ad locum suum naturalem: et aequetur ut non pungant pili oculum.	 If however the hairs are on the lower (eyelid), then cauterize it until it rises to its natural place and is even so that the hairs do not prick the eye.

Est ut praecipias infirmo, ut dimittat pilos, donec prolongentur et aequentur.	 It is that you advise the patient to let the hairs grow until they lengthen and even out. ︎
Fac ex charta de panno formam folii myrti.	 Make from a piece of cloth the shape of a myrtle leaf.
Deinde accipe ex sapone cognito, et ex calce non imbibita ex unoquoque pondus uncia I aut quasi illud: deinde tere ea simul contritione bona, et fac illud cum festinatione, ut non infrigidetur.	 Then take from known soap and from unslaked lime one ounce each or so: then grind them together well until you make that quickly, so it does not cool down.
Deinde ex pande ex eo super chartam quam fecisti sicut formam folii myrti, et pone ipsum super palpebram oculi unius, aut duorum.	 Then spread it over the shape of the myrtle leaf that you have made on the cloth, and place it on the eyelid of one or two eyes. ︎
Et pone sub oculo cotum imbibitum in albumine oui: et caput infirmi sit in sinu tuo.	 And put under the eye cotton soaked in egg white; and let the patient's head be in your lap.
Et pone digitum tuum indicem super medicinam, et preme ipsum parumper.	 And put your index finger on the medicine, and press it slightly.
Et tu moueas ipsum quotiens sentit infirmus mordicationem medicinae: quoniam inuenit eius mordicatio sicut ignis.	 And you shall move it whenever the sick person feels the biting of the medicine, for its biting is like fire.
Dum ergo perseuerat hoc quod ipse inuenit mordicatio, tunc dimitte medicinam, et moue ipsam cum digito tuo.	 Therefore, while this biting that he has found persists, then leave off the medicine and move it with your finger.
Cum ergo quiescit mordicatio, tunc remoue medicinam, et ablue oculum cum aqua.	 When therefore the biting ceases, then remove the medicine and wash the eye with water.
Et considera tunc, si uides palpebram eleuari, sicut eleuatur apud contractionem cum igne, aut cum incisione, est bene: et si non, tunc itera super ipsam ex medicina super locum, in quo non imprimit medicina, et non denigrat, donec aequetur operatio tua, et contrahatur oculus.	 And consider then, if you see the eyelid lifted up, as it is lifted up with burning or cutting, it is well: and if not, then repeat on that same spot of medicine where it does not make an impression and does not blacken, until your operation is made equal and the eye contracts.
Deinde pone super ipsum Cotum cum butyro, donec eradicetur cutis adustionis.	 Then place on it Kohl with butter, until the skin of the burn is removed.
Deinde cura ipsum cum unguento diaphinicon, aut alio, donec sanetur.	 Then care for it with diaphoretic ointment or another, until it heals.
Et necesse est tibi apud operationem, ut custodias ultima custodia, ne in oculum cadat aliquid ex medicina.	 And it is necessary for you during the operation that you guard with the greatest care, lest anything from the medicine fall into the eye.
Quod si mollificatur palpebra post dies, et pugnat ex capillis aliquid in oculo, tunc itera medicinam super illum locum, qui mollificatur ex palpebra proprie, sicut fecisti in primis.	 But if the eyelid becomes soft after days and something struggles from the hairs into the eye, then repeat the medicine on that spot which is becoming soft from the eyelid, just as you did at first.
Deinde cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	 Then care for it until it heals.
Et haec est forma folii myrti.	 And this is the shape of a myrtle leaf.
Et scias, quod oculi hominum diuersificantur in magnitudine, et paruitate.	 And know that human eyes are varied in size and smallness.
Ergo secundum illud sit consideratio tua: et non occultatur uia rectitudinis illi, cui est studium de hac arte.	 Therefore let your consideration be according to that, and may the way of righteousness not be hidden from him who has an interest in this art. 》
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Fistula lachrymali.	 ¶ On the Method of Cauterizing the Lacrimal Duct.
Caput XIX.	 Chapter XIX.
Quando curas Fistulam, cum eo quod diximus in diuisionibus aegritudinum, et non confert curatio tua: tunc, oportet ut cauterizes ipsam secundum hunc modum.	 When you are treating a fistula with what we have said regarding the divisions of diseases and your treatment is not effective, then it is necessary that you cauterize it in this manner.
Praecipe infirmo, ut ponat caput suum in sinu tuo, et teneat caput eius minister inter manus suas taliter, ut non moueatur, neque agitetur cum capite suo.	 Instruct the patient to place their head in your lap, and have an assistant hold their head with both hands so that it does not move or shake.
Deinde pone Cotum infusum in albugine oui, aut in mucilagine psilii super oculum eius: deinde igni Cauterium, cuius forma est haec.	 Then apply a cautery with the shape like this to the eye after placing a poultice of infused cotton in the membrane of an egg or in slippery elm mucilage on it.
Sit concauum, sicut forma cannae pennae uulturis ab extremitate una, cum qua fit Cauterium: et si uis sit penetrans usque ad extremitatem aliam, et si uis sit sursum sic tenta.	 Let it be concave like the shape of a vulture's feather quill from one end, with which the cautery is made; and if you wish for it to penetrate to the other end, or if you wish for it to go upward, do so in this manner.
Verumtamen hoc concauum est melius ad opus tuum.	 However, this concave shape is better suited for your task.
Deinde exprime fistulam, si est aperta, et extrahe ex ea saniem, et exicca ipsam: et si non est aperta, tunc aperi eam, et extrahe pus eius.	 Then squeeze out the pus if it is open, and extract the pus from it, and dry it; and if it is not open, then open it and extract its pus.
Deinde pone tunc super eam Cauterium, quod fit ignitum ualde.	 Then apply a very hot cautery to it.
Et tene cum eo manum tuam parumper apud Cauterium ab oculo, ad partem nasi, ut non erret manus tua, aut inquietetur infirmus: et ponas Cauterium in adipe oculi, et corrumpas ipsum.	 And hold your hand with the cautery near the eye towards the side of the nose so that your hand does not wander or disturb the patient; and place the cautery on the fat of the eye and destroy it.
Si ergo peruenis in principio Cauterii tui usque ad os, erit bene.	 If you reach with your cautery to the bone at its beginning, it will be good.
Et si non: tunc itera Cauterium semel, aut bis, si indiges illo: et dimitte illud tribus diebus.	 And if not, then repeat the cautery once or twice, if you need it; and leave it for three days.
Deinde pone Cotum cum butyro, et cura ipsum cum unguento exiccatiuo, donec sanetur.	 Then apply a cotton poultice with butter, and treat him with drying ointment until he is healed.
Quod si praeterierint ei quadraginta dies, et non sanatur: tunc pone super ipsum medicinam acutam corrosiuam, donec detegatur os: et rade ipsum secundum quod uenit in capitulo suo.	 But if forty days pass and he is not healed, then apply a sharp corrosive medicine to him until the bone is exposed; and scrape it according to its chapter.
Et est modus alius Cauterii fistulae, quem quidam primi dixerunt.	 And there is another method for cauterizing a fistula that some of the first [surgeons] have said. ">
Intende ad locum fistulae, et finde ipsum: deinde pone in ipsam fissuram camahan subtile, id est, Cannulam subtilem, cuius forma haec est.	 Find the location of the fistula and then place a fine cannula into its slit, that is, a fine tube whose shape is like this.
Et funde in ipsum quantitatem drachmae ex plumbo liquefacto, et tene manum tuam cum Canna retentione bona, et non moueatur infirmus omnino, ut non currat, uel perueniat plumbum liquefactum ad oculum eius.	 And pour into it a drachm's quantity of melted lead, and hold your hand with a good grasp on the reed, so that the patient does not move at all, lest the melted lead reach his eye.
Et oportet ut ponas super oculum infirmi cotum infusum in albumine oui, aut in aqua.	 And you should place over the sick person's eye a cloth soaked in egg white or water.
Plumbum enim comburit locum fistulae, et sanat ipsam sanatione mirabili.	 For lead burns away the site of the fistula and heals it with remarkable healing.
Quod si sanatur fistula, cum eo quod diximus ex Cauterio, et curatione, est bonum.	 If the fistula is healed along with what we have said about cautery and treatment, it is good.
Et si non, tunc necesse est administrare foramen nasi, et reducere fistulam ad cursum nasi, secundum quod ueniet in loco suo sibi proprio.	 And if not, then it is necessary to administer the nasal passage and lead the fistula into the course of the nose, so that it will come to its own proper place.

Cum ergo tu curas has fissuras, cum eo quod diximus in diuisione aegritudinum, et non confert curatio, tunc igni cauterium paruum cultellare, secundum hanc formam.	 Therefore, when you are treating these fissures with what we have said about the division of diseases, and the treatment is not effective, then use a small scalpel-shaped cautery with fire, in this manner.
Et sit concauitas eius secundum subtilitatem cultelli.	 And let its cavity be according to the fineness of the scalpel.
Deinde pone ipsum ignitum festinanter in ipsis fissuris, donec perueniat cauterium ad profundum fissurarum.	 Then place the heated cautery quickly on these fissures, until the cautery reaches the depth of the fissures.
Deinde cura ipsum cum caeroto, donec sanetur.	 Then treat it with cerate until it heals.

When an abscess occurs at the root of the gum, or on the palate, or at the roots of the teeth: then it forms pus and bursts; afterwards it heals and the pus flows out and a fistula is formed: then you treat it, and the treatment does not work in it, then you should heat a cautery according to the size that fits into the fistula. 😊
Deinde intromitte ipsum ignitum in foramine fistulae, et tene manum tuam, donec perueniat ferrum ignitum ad profundum eius, et ultimum eius: fac illud semel, aut duabus uicibus.	 Then introduce the glowing iron into the opening of the fistula, and hold your hand until the glowing iron reaches the depth and end of it; do this once or twice.
Deinde cura ipsum post illud, cum eo quod diximus de curatione usquequo curetur.	 Then care for him afterward, with what we have said about caring for him until he is cured.
Si ergo abscinditur sanies, et sanatur, erit bonum.	 If the pus is drained and healing occurs, it will be good.

When the gums are softened due to dampness and the teeth become loose, and you care for them with medicines but it does not help, then place the head of the patient on your lap.
Deinde igni cauterium, cuius forma ueniet post haec, ita ut ponas Cannulam super dentem: et intromitte in ea Cauterium ignitum festinanter: et tene manum tuam parumper, donec sentiat infirmus calorem ignis iam peruenisse ad radicem dentis.	 Then use fire to cauterize with an instrument whose form will be shown below, placing the cannula on the tooth; and introduce the glowing cautery quickly into it; and hold your hand briefly until the patient feels the heat of the fire reaching the root of the tooth. ›
Et eleua manum tuam: deinde itera Cauterium aliquotiens, secundum quod uis.	 And lift up your hand; then repeat the cautery several times according to what you wish. › ›

Cauterium autem eius cum butyro est, ut accipias butyrum uaccinum, et bullias ipsum in cochleari ferreo, aut in uenera.	 "The cautery for it with butter is as follows: take butter from a cow, and boil it in an iron ladle or in bronze.
Deinde accipe cotum, et inuolue ipsum super extremitatem tentae.	 Then take cotton and wrap it around the tip of the probe.
Deinde submerge ipsum in butyro bullito: et pone ipsum super dentem dolorosum festinanter, et tene ipsum donec infrigidet: deinde itera ipsum aliquotiens, donec perueniat uirtus ignis ad radicem dentis.	 Then dip it in the boiled butter; place it quickly on the aching tooth and hold it until it cools down. Repeat this several times until the heat of the fire reaches the root of the tooth.
Et si uis, submerge lanam, aut cotum in butyro frigido, et pone ipsum super dentem dolentem: et pone super ipsum ferrum ignitum, donec perueniat ignis ad profundum concauitatis dentis.	 And if you wish, dip wool or cotton in cold butter and place it on the aching tooth; then put a heated iron on top until the fire reaches the bottom of the tooth cavity.
Cauterizatio autem eius cum igne est, ut intendas ad cannulam aeris, aut cannulam ferri.	 The cautery for it with fire is done using a tube of brass or iron.
Et sit in corpore eius quiddam grossitudinis, ut non perueniat acuitas ignis ad os infirmi.	 And let its body have some thickness so that the sharpness of the fire does not reach the mouth of the patient.
Deinde igni Cauterium, cuius forma ueniet: et pone ipsum super illum dentem: et tene manum tuam, donec infrigidetur Cauterium.	 Then heat the cautery whose shape will come; and place it on that tooth; and hold your hand until the cautery cools down.

It has two open ends so that the smoke can escape from one end while the cautery is heated; and place it once on the swelling, and a second time if necessary, until it reaches the depth of the swelling. ➤ ➤ ➤
Quod si apostema est paruum: tunc pone Cauterium secundum quantitatem apostematis.	 If the abscess is small, then apply a cautery according to the size of the abscess.

Deinde cauteriza cum tribus cauteriis, cauterio sub cochleari pectoris quantitate digiti unius cum cauterio clauili, et duobus cauteriis inferius a duobus lateribus cauterii unius, donec ueniat figura cauteriorum triangulata.	 "Then cauterize with three cauteries: one under the size of a chestnut in the thickness of a finger with a clavicular cautery, and two lower cauteries on each side of the single cautery, until you achieve a triangular shape of the cauteries.

And let the space that is between every cautery be according to the thickness of a finger: and let the cautery be straight according to the length of the body; and do not press your hand much with the cautery." 》
Et sit quantitas eius quod aduritur ex spissitudine cutis, quantitas medietatis eius non additum: et sit infirmus stans super pedes suos.	 And let the amount that is burned be from the thickness of the skin, and let it be half of its amount not added; and let the patient stand on his feet.

When an abscess occurs and you wish to know whether it is in the liver or its covering: then if it is in the liver itself, pain and heaviness come upon the patient without sharpness; but if it is in the covering of the liver, there is a very sharp pain along with it. And you will see that its treatment has exhausted its physicians.
Oportet ergo ut resupinet infirmus super ceruicem suam.	 Therefore, the patient should recline on his back.
Deinde figura locum apostematis cum encaustro: deinde ignias cauterium quod assimilatur radio.	 Then outline the site of the abscess with a caustic; then heat the cautery that resembles a ray.
Et haec est forma eius.	 And this is its form.
Et cauteriza cum eo cauterium unum, donec comburatur cutis tota, et perueniat ad siphac, donec egrediatur sanies tota: deinde cura ipsum curatione exiturarum, donec sanetur.	 And burn with it one cautery until the entire skin is burned and reaches the vein, until all the pus comes out; then treat him with the treatment of abscesses until he is healed.
Et non oportet ut hac cauterii specie utatur, nisi cuius studium in arte medicinae prolongatur: et per cuius manus concurrunt aegritudines istae cum experimento aliquotiens: tunc enim audeat super huiusmodi operationem.	 And it is not fitting that one use this type of cautery unless his study in the medical art is prolonged; and through whose hands these diseases have run their course with experience many times; then he may dare to undertake such an operation.
At uero dimittere ipsam, apud me est melius.	 To dismiss it altogether is better in my opinion.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Pleuresi.	 On the method of cauterizing in pleurisy.
Caput XXXI.	 Chapter 31.
Dixerunt antiqui, cauterium cum radicibus aristolochiae ad Pleuresim frigidam secundum hunc modum.	 The ancients said to use the cautery with the roots of Aristolochia for cold pleurisy in this manner.
Et est, ut recipias ex radicibus aristolochiae siccae longae, radicem unam longiorem, quae ex ea inuenitur, et sit sicut grossitudo digiti.	 And it is that you should take from the dried, long roots of Aristolochia one root longer than any other, and let it be as thick as a finger.
Deinde submerge eam in oleo: et accende ipsam in igne.	 Then immerse it in oil and light it on fire.
Deinde cauteriza cauterio uno in eo quod est inter continuationem furculae cum collo, et duobus cauteriis paruis sub guidezi parum decliuibus ad partem, quae est sub barba.	 Then cauterize with one cautery on the place that is between the continuation of the collarbone and the neck, and with two small cauteries somewhat sloping towards the area under the chin.
Et duobus cauteriis etiam in eo, quod est inter costam quintam et sextam decliuibus ad posteriora parumper: et cauterio alio in medio pectoris, et alio supra stomachum.	 And also with two cauteries on the place that is between the fifth and sixth ribs, sloping somewhat towards the back; and with another cautery in the middle of the chest, and another above the stomach. xspace
Et tribus cauteriis a posterioribus: uno in eo quod est inter duas spatulas: et duobus cauteriis a duobus lateribus pectoris, inferius cauterio quod est inter duas spatulas.	 And with three cauteries from behind: one on the place that is between the two shoulder blades; and two cauteries from both sides of the chest, below the cautery that is between the two shoulder blades.
Et non oportet ut comprimas manum tuam cum cauterio, imo sit in manifesto cutis odorando.	 And it is not necessary to press with your hand while using the cautery, but let it be freely sensed by the skin.
Et iam dixerunt quidam antiqui, quod ex hominibus sunt qui utuntur cauterio ex ferro simili radio: et igniunt, et intus mittunt ipsum in eo quod est inter costas, donec perueniatur cum eo ad ipsum apostema, et egrediatur sanies: sicut diximus in apostemate Epatis.	 And some of the ancients said that there are men who use a cautery made of iron similar to a rod; they ignite it and insert it into the intercostal space until it reaches the abscess, and pus comes out, as we have said in the case of liver abscess. ♡
Sed in hac perforatione cum cauterio est ex timore, quod aut moritur infirmus statim, aut accidit in loco fistula, cui non est sanatio.	 But in this puncture with the cautery there is fear that either the patient dies immediately or a fistula occurs in that place which cannot be healed.
¶ De modo cauterizandi Splenem Caput XXXII.	 On the method of cauterizing the spleen, Chapter 32.
Quando tu curas aegritudinem splenis, cum eo quod diximus ex curatione in diuisione aegritudinum, et non confert curatio tua, tunc cauterium in ea est secundum tres modos, qui omnes sunt recti.	 When you are treating spleen disease, as we have said in the treatment of diseases by division, and your treatment does not help, then there is a need for cautery in it according to three methods, all of which are correct.
Quorum unus est, ut facias tria cauteria, aut quatuor lineando secundum longitudinem splenis secundum figuram cauteriorum Epatis, quorum praecessit figura.	 "One of which is to make three cauteries or four in a straight line following the length of the spleen according to the figure of the liver cauteries, whose image precedes.
Et sit inter omne cauterium quantitas grossitudinis digiti, aut plus parum.	 And let the size of each cautery be approximately that of a finger or somewhat more or less.
Et sit modus cauterii, quem diximus in cauterio epatis aequaliter.	 The method of cauterization should be equal to what we have said regarding the liver.
Et non comprimas manum tuam cum cauterio: et sit infirmus resupinus super dorsum suum.	 Do not press your hand with the cautery, and let the patient lie on their back.
Et modus alius de cauterizatione est: ut ignias cauterium habens duo uerua, quod diximus in capitulo dislocationis humeri: et eleua cutem, quae est in directo splenis, ubi peruenit cubitus infirmi sinister: et sit eleuatio tua qua eleuas cutem secundum latitudinem corporis, ut cadant cauteria secundum longitudinem corporis.	 Another method of cauterization is to use a two-pronged iron, as mentioned in the chapter on dislocation of the shoulder: lift the skin directly over the spleen where the infirm's left elbow reaches. Lift the skin according to the body's width so that the cauteries fall along the body's length.
Deinde intromitte duo uerua ignita ualde, donec cum eis penetres cutem a parte altera: deinde extrahe cauterium: fiunt ergo cauteria quatuor.	 Then insert the two heated prongs until you pierce through to the other side of the skin; then remove the iron. Thus, four cauteries are made.
Et si uis cauteriza cum cauterio alio habente tria uerua.	 If you wish to cauterize with another iron having three prongs.
Deinde cura cauterium postquam dimittis ipsum emittere pus diebus multis: est enim magis conferens quamque reliqua quae praecesserunt ex curatione.	 Then take care of the cautery after you have allowed it to discharge pus for many days, for this is more beneficial than any other previous treatment.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Hydropisi.	 ¶ On the method of cauterizing in hydropsy.
Caput XXXIII.	 Chapter 33.
Cauterium non cadit in Hydropisi, nisi ascliti proprie.	 The cautery does not fall in hydropsy except on the loins properly.
Quando tu curas Hydropicum cum modis curationis, quos diximus in diuisione, et non confert curatio, tunc oportet ut cauterizes ipsum quatuor cauteriis in circumitu umbilici, et cauterio uno super stomachum, et cauterio alio super epar, et cauterio super splenem, et cauteriis duobus post dorsum inter spondiles, et uno in directo pectoris, et alio in directo stomachi: et sit quantitas profunditatis cauterii propinqua spissitudini cutis.	 When you treat a hydrocephalic patient with the methods of treatment that we have mentioned in the division, and if the treatment does not benefit, then it is necessary to cauterize him with four cauteries around the navel, one on the stomach, one on the liver, one on the spleen, two behind the back between the shoulder blades, one directly on the chest, and another directly on the stomach; and let the depth of the cautery be close to the thickness of the skin. ‌
Deinde dimitte cauterium apertum, ut emittat pus tempore longo.	 Then leave the cautery open, so that it may expel pus over time.
Et non euacues infirmum a curatione post cauterium cum eo: quod oportet ut aggregentur ei duae intentiones: et festinabit ad ipsum sanatio cum auxilio Dei.	 And do not remove the patient from treatment after cautery, because two intentions should be added to him: and with God's help, healing will hasten to him.
Forma uero cauterii cum quo cauterizatur uenter, sit clauilis: secundum quod praecessit forma eius: et illius cum quo cauterizatur dorsum, sit oliuaris secundum quod praecessit eius forma.	 The form of the cautery with which the abdomen is cauterized should be key-shaped, as its previous form stated; and that with which the back is cauterized should be almond-shaped, as its previous form stated.
¶ De modo cauterizandi Pedes, et Crura.	 ¶ On the method of cauterizing the feet and legs.
Caput XXXIIII.	 Chapter 40
Quando apostemantur in Hydropico, et replentur aqua citrina: oportet ut cauterizes super dorsum Pedis in nocrati, quae est inter auricularem et anularem: et eleua manum tuam cum cauterio, et non torqueas ipsum: deinde eleua manum tuam: et non iteres ipsum omnino.	 When they become swollen in a hydrocele and are filled with yellow water, it is necessary to cauterize above the sole of the foot, which is between the phalangeal and annular bones; raise your hand with the cautery and do not twist it; then raise your hand and do not press it at all. 
Resudet enim aqua citrina, et sit cauterium secundum hanc formam.	 The yellow water will drain, and the cautery should be in this shape.
Deinde fac super duo crura duo cauteria in omni crure, et fiat cauterium cum extremitate cultellari cauterii: et fiat cauterium secundum longitudinem cruris, unum sub genu, et alterum inferius eo, circiter medium cruris: et super omnem coxam cauteria duo: et dimitte cauterium apertum absque curatione tempore longo: ut resudet ex eo aliquod aquae: deinde cura ipsum cum reliquis quae diximus.	 Then make two cauteries on each leg, one in this way: the cautery should be with the tip of a small knife; and the cautery should be as long as the leg, one below the knee, and the other lower than that, about the middle of the leg. And there should be two cauteries on each hip; and leave the cautery open without treatment for a long time, so that some water may drain from it; then treat it with the rest that we have said.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in solutione Ventris.	 ¶ On the method of cauterizing the abdomen when distended.  
Caput XXXV.	 Chapter 35   
Quando est solutio uentris ex frigore et humiditatibus, donec debilitet uirtutes retentiuam et digestiuam, quae sunt in stomacho et intestinis: et curatur illud cum modis curationis, et non sanatur: et uides infirmum tolerantem cauterium exuberantis uirtutis, tunc cauteriza ipsum cauterio magno super stomachum suum, secundum quod praecessit in cauterizatione stomachi cum cauterio circuli, et quatuor cauteriis in circumitu umbilici subtilibus, cum cauterio clauili subtili: et cauterio super alcatin supra alhosos magno, aut duobus cauteriis.	 When there is distention of the abdomen due to cold and moisture, until it weakens the retentive and digestive powers which are in the stomach and intestines; and this is treated with methods of treatment but does not heal; and you see the patient tolerating the cautery well, then cauterize him with a large cautery on his stomach, as previously stated for the cauterization of the stomach with a circular cautery, and four subtle cauteries around the umbilicus, with a subtle key-shaped cautery; and a large cautery above the anus over the hemorrhoids, or two cauteries.   
Et si uides humiditates exuberantes, et infirmum tolerantem illud, tunc cauteriza ipsum cauterio super pectinem, et cauterio super omne ilium: et fortasse addes duo cauteria parua super stomachum prope magnum.	 And if you see excessive moisture and the patient tolerates it, then cauterize him with a cautery above the pubis, and a cautery above each thigh: and perhaps add two small cauteries near the navel.
Est enim curatio proficiens, cuius iuuamentum non errat.	 For indeed the treatment is effective, whose benefit does not wander.
¶ De modo cauterizandi Hemorroidas.	 ¶ On the method of cauterizing hemorrhoids.
Caput XXXVI.	 Chapter XXXVI.
Quando in ano sunt Hemorroides antiquae multae, aut una, et sunt ex humoribus grossis, frigidis, aut humiditatibus corruptis, et curantur cum eo, quod diximus in diuisione, et non confert curatio: tunc cauteriza tribus cauteriis super inferiorem spondilem dorsi sub almeidati parumper triangulatim, et cauterio sub umbilico quasi duobus digitis.	 When in the anus there are many old hemorrhoids or one, and they are from thick, cold humors, or corrupted moisture, and they are treated with that which we have said in division, but the treatment is not effective: then cauterize with three cauteries on the lower part of the back between the shoulder blades briefly in a triangular shape, and with one cautery under the navel about two fingers' width.
Et si cogitas, quod stomachus eius infrigidatus sit, et cibus eius non digeratur, et faciem eius uides apostemari, tunc cauteriza eum super stomachum cauterio magno, secundum quod praecessit: et cauterio super Epar eius, et alio super Splenem ipsius, cum cauterio clauili: et dimitte cauterium apertum tempore aliquo: deinde cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	 And if you think that his stomach is chilled and his food is not digested, and you see his face swollen, then cauterize him with a large cautery on the stomach, as was mentioned before, and with one on each side of his liver, and another on his spleen, together with a clavicular cautery: and leave an open cautery for some time; then treat him until he is cured.
¶ De modo cauterizandi althelul post abscisionem eorum.	 ¶ On the method of cauterizing a nipple after their excision.
Caput XXXVII.	 Chapter XXXVII. 》
Quando tu abscindis althelul, tunc ignias cauterium quod assimilatur radio.	 When you cut off a nipple, then heat the cautery that resembles a ray.
Deinde intromittite ipsum ignitum in ipsum althelul abscisum: et ultima manum tuam, donec perueniat cauterium ad orificium uenae, ex qua currit sanguis: fac illud semel, aut bis.	 Then introduce the heated one into the cut nipple itself; and with your last hand, until the cautery reaches the opening of the vein from which the blood flows: do this once or twice.
Si ergo althelul fuerint multa, tunc cauteriza unumquodque cauterio secundum quod narrauimus.	 If therefore the nipples are many, then cauterize each one with a cautery as we have said.
Deinde cura ea, cum eo quod confert eis ex unguentis, donec sanentur.	 Then treat them with what is suitable for them from the ointments, until they are cured.
Et si cauterizas eum cauterio magno super alcatin, est magis ultimum in iuuamento.	 And if you cauterize him with a large cautery over the alcatin, it is more effective as a remedy.
¶ De modo cauterizandi Fistulam in ano.	 § The Method of Cauterizing an Anal Fistula
Caput XXXVIII.	 Chapter XXXVIII
Quando non obedit infirmus sectioni et operi quod narrauimus in loco suo, et terretur ab illo, fortasse sanatur cum cauterio.	 When the patient does not respond to incision and the operation we have described in its proper place, and is afraid of it, perhaps he can be cured with a cautery.
Cum ergo accidit alicui Fistula, et antiquatur, currit pus ex ea, et humiditates corruptae.	 When therefore someone has an anal fistula and it is old, foul-smelling pus runs from it, and the place becomes corrupt.
Dignius ergo quod oportet est, ut probes eam cum tenta subtili.	 It is more fitting to do what is necessary: test it with a fine probe.
Deinde cognosce quantitatem profunditatis eius cum tenta.	 Then learn the depth of its extent with the probe.
Deinde ignias cauterium, quod est simile radio.	 Then heat a cautery that is similar to a ray. 😊
Deinde intromit te ipsum ignitum in ipsam Fistulam et quantitatem in qua intrauit clauus.	 Then insert the heated cautery into the fistula itself and also as much of its length as the probe had entered.
Et itera super eam cauterium, donec comburantur illa omnia corpora corrupta, semel, aut bis, aut ter, secundum quantitatem necessitatis tuae.	 And repeat the cautery over it until all the corrupted matter is burned away, once, or twice, or thrice, according to your need.
Et custodi te ab adustione nerui, si est illic, aut uenae magnae: aut si Fistula uadit ad corpus uesicae, aut ad corpus intestini, tunc custodi te ab istis locis omnibus.	 And guard against burning a nerve or large vein if it is there; or if the fistula extends to the body of the bladder or the body of the intestine, then avoid all these places.
Et non facias illud, nisi quando fistula est in loco carnoso: et cogitas, quia non est penetrans.	 And do not do this unless the fistula is in a fleshy place and you consider that it does not penetrate deeply.
Deinde cura locum usquequo sanetur.	 Then care for the place until it heals.
Si autem sigillatur locus, et abscinduntur ab eo materiae, et remanet sic tempore longo: tunc scias, quia iam sanatus est integre.	 But if the place closes and materials are cut off from it and it remains thus for a long time, then you should know that it has been completely healed. 😊
Et si non abscindunt ab eo materiae, tunc scias quia est penetrans, aut in profundo eius est os corruptum, aut quasi illud ex illis: quorum rememoratio ueniet in loco suo.	 And if materials are not cut off from it, then you should know that it is deep-seated or there is a corrupted opening at its depth, or something similar to this, whose description will come in its place.
¶ De modo cauterizandi Renes.	 § The Method of Cauterizing the Kidneys
Caput XXXIX.	 Chapter 39
Quando accidit in Renibus dolor ex frigore, aut ex uentositate grossa, et minuitur propter illud coius infirmi, tunc oportet ut cauterizes ipsum super almethenem super ipsos renes, cauterio super omnem renem cum cauterio clauili, cuius praecessit rememoratio.	 When pain in the kidneys occurs due to cold or heavy flatulence and weakens because of it, then you should cauterize the patient above the kidneys with a wide-mouthed cautery over each kidney, as described previously.
Et fortasse cauterizamus ipsum secundo in ipso almeidatu.	 And perhaps we will cauterize him a second time in the same spot.
Quare uenient tria lineata.	 Why three lines will appear.
Ergo erunt magis ultima in iuuamento.	 Therefore, they will be more beneficial in the end.
¶ De modo cauteritzandi Vesicam.	 About the way of cauterizing the bladder.
Caput XL.	 Chapter 40
Quando accidunt in Vesica debilitas, et mollificatio a frigo re et humiditatibus, donec non retineat infirmus urinam, tunc cauteriza ipsum in inferiori parte suminis super Vesicam, ubi incipiunt pili pectinis, et cauterio a dextra suminis, et alio a sinistra illius: et sit longitudo illius cauterizationis lateris secundum quantitatem nodi pollicis: et cauteriza ipsum cauterio inferiori dorsi, aut duobus cauteriis, si indiges illo: et sit secundum quod praecessit cauterium clauile.	 When weakness and softening of the bladder occur due to cold and moisture, so that the patient cannot hold urine, then you should cauterize him in the lower part of the abdomen over the bladder, where the pubic hair begins, with one cautery from the right side of the abdomen and another from the left side. The length of this cauterization should be according to the width of a thumb's joint. Cauterize him with an inferior spinal cautery, or with two if you need it, as described previously for a wide-mouthed cautery.
¶ De modo cauterizandi Matricem.	 About the way of cauterizing the womb.  Chapter 41
Caput XLI.	 Chapter 41
Quando accidunt in Matrice frigus et humiditates, et prohibetur per illud ab impregnatione, et corrumpuntur menstrua eius, et tardatur prouocatio eorum, et accidit ei apud aduentum eorum dolor, tunc oportet ut cauterizetur tribus cauteriis in circumitu umbilici, sicut diximus in cauterizatione uesicae, et cauterio super alcatim inferius dorso, aut duobus cauteriis: et sit cauterium clauile.	 When the womb suffers from cold and moisture, which prevents pregnancy and corrupts her menses, delaying their onset and causing pain at their arrival, then she should be cauterized with three cauteries around the navel, as we said in the case of bladder cauterization, and with a lower spinal cautery or two. The cautery should be wide-mouthed.
¶ De modo cauterizandi Ancham in dislocatione.	 About the way of cauterizing the throat when it is dislocated. Chapter 42
Caput XLII.	 Chapter 42
Quando effunduntur humiditates mucosae ad pixidem Anchae, et fiunt caussa exitus eius a loco suo: et signum illius est, quod prolongatur crus super alterum, quando comparantur adinuicem: et inuenitur locus dislocationis in eo uacuus.	 When mucous secretions spill into the windpipe and cause it to leave its proper place: the sign of this is that one leg is longer than the other when they are compared, and the site of the displacement is found to be empty.
Oportet ergo ut cauterizes infirmum super pixidem Anchae ipsius cauterio simili circulo: postquam tu signas cum encaustro in circumitu pixidis, sicut reuoluitur: et ut cadat ipsa pixis in medio circuli.	 It is necessary to cauterize the patient over a small box of Anchae wax using a similar cautery circle. After you mark it with the cautery around the edge of the box, as if turning it, and so that the box itself falls into the middle of the circle.
Et sit cauterium cuius forma praecessit in cauterizatione stomachi.	 And let the cautery be one whose form was previously described for the cauterization of the stomach.
Quod si tibi non est praesens hoc cauterium, tunc cauteriza ipsum tribus cauteriis, cum cauterio oliuari magno: et fiat cauterio profunditas secundum quantitatem spissitudinis cutis totius.	 If this cautery is not available to you, then cauterize with three cauteries using a large olive oil cautery, and let the depth of the cautery be according to the thickness of the entire skin.
Deinde cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	 Then care for it until it heals.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Sciatica.	 ¶ On the way to cauterize sciatica.
Caput XLIII.	 Chapter 43
Quando accidit dolor in pixide anchae, et sunt caussa illius frigus et humiditates: et curatur infirmus cum eo, quod diximus in diuisione, et non confert curatio, et antiquatur illud: tunc oportet ut soluas infirmum ab humoribus grossis cum pillulis foetidis, aut cum pillulis artificialibus, et similibus.	 When pain occurs in the small box of Anchae and its cause is cold and moisture; and when the patient is treated with what we have said in the division, and the treatment does not help and grows old; then it is necessary to free the patient from gross humors with fetid pills or with artificial pills and similar ones. ‌
Deinde cauteriza eum.	 Then cauterize him.
Et modus cauterii in ea est secundum duos modos: aut cauterium cum medicinis adurentibus, aut cauterium cum igne.	 And the way of cautery in it is according to two methods: either with a cautery and drying medicines, or with a cautery and fire. ‌ ‌
Cauterium cum igne, est secundum multos modos.	 A cautery with fire is according to many methods.
Quorum unus est, ut cauterizes super pixidem anchae ipsius tribus cauteriis triangulatis, secundum hanc formam.	 One of which is that you cauterize over the small box of Anchae with three triangular cauteries in this form.
Et fac eis profunditatem bonam, uel malam.	 And make their depth either good or bad.
Et sit spacium quod est inter omne cauterium quantitatis grossitudinis digiti: sitque cauterium oliuare.	 And let the space that is between each cautery be as thick as a finger; and let the cautery be an olive oil one. ‌ ‌
Quandoque autem fit cauterium in medio super caput anchae ipsius.	 Sometimes, however, the cautery is made in the middle over the head of the Anchae itself. ‌ ‌
Quare sunt quatuor cauteria.	 Why are there four cauteries? ‌ ‌
Et si uis cauteriza cum circulo, cuius praecessit forma in cauterizatione dislocationis anchae, uno: ut sit circulus continens ancham totam.	 And if you want to cauterize with a circle, whose form was previously described for the cauterization of the displacement of Anchae, let it be one so that the circle contains the entire Anchae.
Et combure spissitudinem cutis totius.	 And burn away the thickness of the skin throughout.
Iste est modus cauterii in Sciatica, quando dolor est adhaerens anchae ipsi, et non extenditur usque ad coxam et crus.	 This is a method for cautery in sciatica when the pain clings to the hip itself and does not extend to the thigh and leg.
Si autem extenditur usque ad coxam et crus, tunc cauteriza ipsum duobus cauteriis super coxam, super locum ad quem innuit illic infirmus, in quo est dolor, et cauterio tuo super cauillam quatuor digitis ad partem syluestrem parumper: et sit cauterium cultellare.	 But if it extends to the thigh and leg, then cauterize with two cauteries on the hip, over the place where the patient indicates the pain is, and your cautery four fingers below the iliac crest towards the flank a little: and let the cautery be of the knife type.
Et sit profunditas cauterii secundum profunditatem spissitudinis cutis.	 And let the depth of the cautery be according to the thickness of the skin.
Quod si infirmus innuit quod dolor extenditur usque prope digitos pedis, tunc cauteriza ipsum illic ubi innuit cum cauterio puncti, tribus, aut quatuor, aut pluribus, si indiget illo.	 But if the patient indicates that the pain extends almost to the toes, then cauterize him there where he indicates with a cautery of a point or three, or four, or more, if he needs it.
Et si innuit dolorem esse sub genu uersus crus, tunc cauteriza ipsum illic cauterio uno cultellari.	 And if he indicates that the pain is under the knee towards the leg, then cauterize him there with one knife-type cautery.
Et caue tibi in omni cauterizatione tua, ut non ultimes cum cauterio ad hoc ut comburas neruum, aut arteriam magnam, et attrahas per illud super infirmum nocumentum malum, aut contractionem.	 And be careful in all your cautery not to go so far with the cautery that you burn a nerve or a large artery and draw upon the patient bad damage or contraction.
Et ego quidem iam uidi unum et alium, ex eis qui cauterizauerunt supra cauillam, et ultimauerunt in cauterizatione, et inflatum est crus, donec tumor consecutus est pedem, et perforatus est totus, et corruptus est totus pes: deinde accidit solutio uentris, et mors post illud.	 And I have indeed seen one and another of those who cauterized above the iliac crest and went too far in cautery, until the leg swelled up so that a tumor reached the foot, and the whole foot was perforated and rotted away; then there followed dissolution of the belly, and death after that.  ()
Quod si dolor est in duabus partibus simul, cauteriza utramque secundum hunc modum.	 If the pain is in both parts at once, cauterize each according to this manner.
Et sapientes quidam dixerunt in cauterizatione anchae, cuius cauterii iste est modus.	 And some wise men have said concerning the cautery of the hip, which this method describes.
Fac simile samio ex ferro, cuius diametrus sit medietas palmi: et sit apud orificium suum secundum grossitudinem nuclei dactyli, aut minus parumper: et intra illud samium sit samium tertium.	 Make a similar needle of iron, whose diameter is half the palm: and let it be at its opening according to the thickness of a nut-sized finger or a little less; and inside that needle, let there be another needle, one third in size.
Et sit spacium quod est inter omne samium per quantitatem nodi pollicis: et sint samia aperta a duabus partibus: et sit altitudo eorum quasi nodus, aut duo nodi: et fac eis manubrium ex ferro decenter aptatum in samiis.	 And let there be a space between each needle the size of a thumb's knuckle; and let the needles be open from both ends; and let their height be like a knuckle, or two knuckles; and make for them a handle from iron, fittingly placed in the needles.
Et haec est forma eius.	 And this is its form.
Deinde igniatur in igne, donec rubeat, et proiiciat scintillas: deinde ponatur super pixidem anchae infirmo accubitato super latus sanum.	 Then let it be heated in the fire until it turns red and throws off sparks; then place it on a jar of anchoise oil on the weak side where the healthy side is.
Cauteriza ergo eum tribus cauteriis rotundis in uice una.	 Cauterize him, therefore, with three circular cauteries in one go.
Deinde dimitte ipsum tribus diebus.	 Then leave him for three days.
Postea emplastra cum butyro: et dimitte uulnus apertum diebus multis.	 After that, apply plasters with butter; and leave the wound open for many days.
Deinde cura ipsum cum unguento, donec sanetur.	 Then care for him with ointment until he is healed.
Inquit Albucasis, hac specie cauterii o filii, parum usi sumus, propter terrorem aspectus eius: et propterea, quod paucos inuenimus qui expectent super ipsum.	 Said Albucasis: "O my son, we have used this kind of cautery little, because of the terror of its appearance; and also, because we have found few who would endure it.
Verumtamen est ex bonis cauteriis ei qui suffert, et inuenit cum eo locum eius.	 Nevertheless, it is one of the good cauteries for those who can bear it and find its place with it.
Cauterium autem cum medicinis adurentibus est, ut tu facias duo samia habentia perforatam armillam, in quam descendit cardo portae eius ex aere, aut ferro, longitudo parietis: quorum in altitudinem eorum sint duo nodi, aut quasi ipsi.	 The cautery with burning medicines is done like this: make two needles with a perforated ring, into which descends the pin of its door made of bronze or iron, the length of the wall; in their height let there be two knuckles, or almost so.
Et sit spacium quod est inter utraque quantitas grossitudinis digiti, et sint aperta inferius et superius: et sit quod contineant se adinuicem, secundum hanc formam.	 And let there be a space between the two needles the size of a finger's thickness; and let them be open below and above; and let what they contain hold together according to this form.
Deinde depone eam super pixidem anchae, infirmo iacente super latus sanum.	 Then place it on a jar of anchoise oil, with the patient lying weakly on the healthy side.
Et comprime manum tuam super pixidem anchae multum.	 And press your hand firmly over the jar of anchoise oil.
Deinde funde inter duos circulos ex aqua calida, quae sit calefacta cum igne parumper, et tene eam quantitate horae temporalis: et toleret infirmus mordicationem eius, et ipsius adustionem, nam ipse inuenit mordicationem sicut ignis, donec quiescat mordicatio.	 Then pour between the two circles hot water, which has been heated a little with fire, and hold it for an hour; and let the patient bear its gnawing and burning, for he finds the gnawing like fire, until the gnawing stops.
Deinde eleua manum tuam cum instrumento, et absterge aquam calidam ab ancha tota cum aqua dulci: deinde dimitte illud tribus diebus.	 Then raise your hand with the instrument and wash away the hot water from the whole wound with sweet water; then leave it for three days.
Et pone super illud butyrum, donec remoueatur nigredo adustionis: et dimitte illud diebus aliquot, et curret ex eo pus.	 And put butter on it until the blackness of the burning is removed; and leave it for some days, and pus will flow from it.
Est enim ultimum in iuuamento.	 For it is the last resort in aid.
Deinde cura illud cum unguentis, donec sanetur.	 Then care for it with ointments until it heals.
Quod si extendatur dolor usque ad coxam, aut crus: fac ei statuam in eo quod continet aquam, secundum quod fecisti in ancha aequaliter.	 If the pain extends as far as the hip or leg: make for him a container that holds water, according to what you did for the wound equally.
Et iste est modus aquae calidae: et ego iam scripsi eam in tractatu rectificationis medicinarum.	 And this is the way of hot water; and I have already written about it in the treatise on the correction of drugs.
Sume alcali, et calcis non extinctae amborum ana partem unam: tere utraque, et pone ea in ollam nouam, cuius inferior pars sit perforata foramine uno paruo, secundum quantitatem quod ingrediatur ipsum radius: et pone sub fundo ollae ollam aliam uitreatam: et proiice super alcali et calcem ex aqua dulci, quod submergat utraque per digitum: post quam tu comprimas ea manu tua compressione bona: et dimite ollam, donec descendat aqua acuta inferiori parte ollae uitreatae.	 Take alkali and unslaked lime, one part of each; grind both and put them in a new pot, the lower part of which has been pierced with a small hole through which the radius can pass. And place beneath the bottom of the pot another glass pot, and pour over the alkali and lime sweet water so that it covers both by one finger's width; after which you press them together with your hand using good pressure; and leave the pot until the sharp water descends to the lower part of the glass pot. )))
Deinde aggrega illam aquam totam, et proiice eam super aliam calcem: et cola, donec renouetur.	 Then gather all that water and pour it over more lime; and boil until it is dissolved again.
Ipsa enim erit tunc fortis acuitatis ualde, quae administratur in multis operationibus medicinae, et in cauterizatione reliquorum membrorum.	 For then it will be very strong in acuity, which is used in many operations of medicine and in the cautery of other members.
Quoniam efficit operationem ignis ipsius.	 Because it produces the effect of fire itself. )))
Et ex medicinis sunt, cum quibus cauterizantur ancha, etiam sicut tesisie, et mel anacardi, et calx cum sapone, ita quod utraque sint permixta. ¶	 And among the medicines with which wounds are also cauterized, as with terebinth, and honey of the pistachio nut, and lime with soap, so that each is mixed together.
Et Galenus quidem narrando retulit, cuiusdam uiri ex antiquis curationem, qua curatus est dolor anchae et uenae sciaticae: et magnificauit esse eius ualde.	 And Galen indeed related the treatment of some ancient man by which his pain in the wound and the sciatic vein was cured; and he said it was very effective.
Et dixit, quia non indiguit alia curatione, et quia sanatus est ex uice una, donec retulit, quia ipse fortasse intrauit balneum delatus, et exiuit ex eo iam sanus.	 He said that no other treatment was needed, and that he was healed in one visit, until he returned and said that perhaps he had entered the bath carried by others, and came out of it already cured.
Et est, ut accipiatur ex seitaragi uiridi: et si non inuenitur uiride, sumatur siccum, recens: et teratur multum cum aliquanto adipe, et ponatur super ancham, ubi est dolor, aut crus, aut in coxa: et ligetur, et dimittatur quantitate trium horarum, aut per quantitatem quod sentiat infirmus sedationem adustionis.	 It should be taken from green seitan: and if it is not found fresh, let it be taken dry, recent; and let it be ground very much with some fat, and placed on the sore, whether it is on the leg or hip; and let it be bound, and left for three hours, or however long the patient feels a relief from the burn.
Deinde intromitte eum in balneum.	 Then put him in the bath.
Cum ergo roridum fit corpus eius, intromitte ipsum in solium.	 Therefore, when his body becomes moist, put him into a chair.
Nam dolor recedit, et sanatur.	 For the pain recedes and he is cured.
Et scias, quia non oportet ut utatur aliquis cauterio cum istis medicinis, nisi post euacuationem corporis.	 And know that no one should use cautery with these medicines except after the evacuation of the body.
Et Dioscorides qui dem dixit, quod stercus caprarum, quando cum eo cauterizatur uena sciatica, confert ei: et fit cauterium secundum hunc modum.	 And Dioscorides said that goat droppings, when used to cauterize the sciatic vein, are beneficial for it; and the cautery is made in this way.
Sumatur lana, et imbibatur oleo antiquo, et ponatur super locum profundum, qui est inter pollicem pedis, et inter focile, et est propinquior focili.	 Take wool and soak it in old oil, and place it on the deep place which is between the big toe and the little finger of the foot, closer to the little finger.
Deinde accipe stercus caprarum siccum, et inflamma ipsum in igne, donec fiat carbo.	 Then take dry goat droppings and burn them in a fire until they become charcoal.
Deinde pone ipsum super lanam, et dimitte ipsum, donec extinguatur.	 Then place the charcoal on the wool, and leave it until it is extinguished.
Deinde itera illud.	 Then repeat that process.
Non cesses ergo facere illud, usquequo perueniat sensus super mediatione usque ad ancham, et quiescat dolor.	 Therefore, do not stop doing this until the pain is relieved all the way to the sore and the pain ceases.
Et iste modus cauterii nominatur cauterium Vaccinum.	 And this method of cautery is called the cow's cautery.
¶ De cauterizatione doloris Dorsi.	 ¶ Concerning the cauterization of back pain.
Caput XLIIII.	 Chapter 44. 😊
Quandoque accidit dolor in Dorso ex caussis multis, aut a casu, aut a percussione, aut euacuatione superflua, et illis similibus, ex infusione materiei frigidae, et humidae: et cauterium quidem non cadit, nisi in hac specie sola, quae fit ex infusione materiei frigidae.	 Sometimes back pain occurs from many causes, either by accident or by a blow, or excessive evacuation, and similar things, due to the influx of cold and wet material; and cautery is only suitable for this kind alone, which comes about through the influx of cold material.
Oportet ergo post euacuationem infirmi cum pillulis foetidis, et eis similibus, ut fiant super Dorsum, ubi est dolor, tres lineae secundum latitudinem almeidati ipsius, postquam signas cum encaustro in omni linea quinque cauteria, aut plura secundum quantitatem quae uenit ex tolerantia infirmi uirtute eius: et fiat cauterizatio cum cauteriopuncti.	 It is necessary after the evacuation of the patient with fetid pills and similar ones, that they be made on the back where there is pain, three lines according to the width of the ruler itself, after you mark with a cautery in every line five burns, or more according to the quantity that comes from the strength of the patient: and let the cauterization be done with a small puncture.
Et si uis, cauteriza tribus cauteriis, aut quatuor, cum cauterio clauili mediali, secundum hanc formam.	 And if you wish, cauterize with three or four cauteries using a medium-sized cautery in this manner.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in incaeptine Gibbositatis.	 Concerning the method of cauterizing an unripe swelling.
Caput XLV.	 Chapter 45
Multotiens accidit haec aegritudo infantibus paruis.	 This illness often happens to small children.
Et signum incaeptionis eius in pueris est: quod accidit super eum strictura in anhelitu apud eleuationem, et motum: et inuenis in ultima spondilium Dorsi et nodorum eius, quod iam incaepit eminere super reliquos spondiles.	 And the sign of its beginning in children is that they experience a constriction in their breath when lifted or moved, and the swelling is found at the end of the spine of the back and it already begins to protrude above the other vertebrae.
Cum ergo uides illud, et uis facere illud, tunc cauteriza ipsum cum cauterio quod sit circulus secundum hanc formam.	 Therefore, when you see this and wish to treat it, then cauterize with a circular cautery in this manner.
Et capiat cauterium super omnem partem spondilis aequaliter: et si uis cauteriza in circumitu spondilis cum cauterio puncti duas lineas, aut tres: et sint puncta propinqua adinuicem.	 And let the cautery be placed over all parts of the vertebrae equally; and if you wish, cauterize around the vertebra with a puncture cautery in two or three lines, and let the points be close to each other. xspace
Deinde cura locum, donec sanetur cum eo quod diximus.	 Then care for the place until it is healed with what we have said.
Et caue, ne administres cauterium in gibbositate, quae fit in spasmo nerui.	 And beware not to administer a cautery on a swelling that occurs from a spasm of the nerve.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Podagra, et doloribus iuncturarum.	 Concerning the method of cauterizing gout and joint pains.
Caput XLVI.	 Chapter 46
Quando dolores iuncturarum sunt ab humiditatibus frigidis, quae effunduntur ad cuiuslibet membra corporis, tunc quando accidunt dolores in pedibus, de consuetudine medicorum est, ut nominent illud Podagram proprie.	 When the pains of the joints are from cold humors that flow to any member of the body, then when these pains occur in the feet, it is customary among doctors to name this specifically gout. xspace
Cum ergo curatur Podagra frigidae caussae cum modis curationis, et non remouentur dolores, tune cauterium remouet eos.	 When, therefore, gout of cold cause is being treated with methods of healing, and the pains are not removed, then cautery will remove them.
Et est, ut cauterizes eum post euacuationem in circumitu iuncturae pedum, cauteriis multis: et sit cauterium Oliuare.	 And it is as if you should cauterize him after evacuation around the joint of the foot with many cauteries, and let the cautery be of olive oil.
Cuius haec est forma.	 Here is its form.
Et si indiges ut punctes super faciem pedis, tunc fac cum cauterio puncti.	 And if you need to prick on the sole of the foot, then do so with a pricking iron.
Quod si ascendunt dolores usque ad genua, aut reliquas iuncturas, et multotiens accidit illud, tunc cauteriza ipsum super omne genu tribus cauteriis, aut quatuor ab omni parte, cum hoc eodem cauterio Clauili.	 If the pains ascend to the knees or other joints, and this often happens, then cauterize him on every knee with three or four cauteries from all sides with the same burning iron.
Si autem necessaria sunt tibi plura hoc cauterio, tunc cauteriza ipsum.	 But if you need more of this cautery, then cauterize him with it.
Et non submergas manum tuam cum cauterio, imo sit circiter spissitudinem cutis tantum.	 And do not dip your hand with the cautery into (the oil), but let it be approximately as thick as the skin.
Si autem ascendunt dolores ad genua, et dorsum: tunc administra quod diximus ex cauterio in capitulo suo.	 But if the pains ascend to the knees and back, then administer what we have said about the cautery in its chapter.  (The "chapter" referred to here is likely the section of Albucasis's textbook that deals with treating these specific ailments.)
Quod si dolores sunt in manibus tantum, tunc puncta in circumitu focilium, sicut reuoluuntur duae lineae.	 But if the pains are only in the hands, then prick around the fingers as two lines wrap around.
Si autem remanet ex doloribus in digitis, tunc puncta eos, super omnem nodum punctum, et super pectinem manus.	 But if any pain remains in the fingers, then prick each one on every joint and on the palm of the hand.
Si autem ascendunt dolores post dies ad cubitos, aut ad humeros, tunc cauteriza utrosque ab omni parte.	 But if the pains ascend after days to the elbows or shoulders, then cauterize both from every side.
Et non euacues infirmum ex regimine bono, ex recaeptione medicinarum.	 And do not evacuate the sick person with a good diet or reception of medicines.
Nam si bonum fiat regimen, et euacuetur phlegma, sanabitur auxilio Dei cum isto cauterio.	 For if the diet is good and the phlegm is evacuated, he will be cured with God's help along with this cautery.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Rupturis.	 ¶ On the way of cauterizing a hernia.
Caput XLVII.	 Chapter XLVII.
Quando accidit Ruptura in inguinibus, et descendit intestinum, aut zirbum ad testiculum, et est illud incipiens propinquum: tunc oportet ut praecipias infirmo dimittere comestionem in die suo.	 When a hernia occurs in the groin, and an intestine or testicle descends to the testicle, and this is the first occurrence, it is necessary that you order the sick person to fast on that day.  (Here, "dimittere comestionem" means "to let go of food," i.e., to fast.)
Et utatur ex lenientibus, quo descendat stercus a uentre suo.	 And let him use laxatives so that his feces may descend from his belly.
Deinde sedeat inter manus tuas super dorsum suum: et praecipe ei, ut teneat anhelitum suum, donec egrediatur, uel appareat zirbum, aut intestinum.	 Then have him sit between your hands on his back; and instruct him to hold his breath until the feces or a piece of intestine comes out.
Deinde reduc ipsum digitis tuis, et signa cum encaustro sub Ruptura super os pectinis, cum signo cuius extremitas sit similis medietati circuli ad superiora corporis.	 Then bring him back with your fingers, and mark with caustic on the rupture above the pubis, with a mark whose end is similar to half of a circle, towards the upper part of the body.
Deinde igni cauterium, cuius haec est forma, donec ueniat album, et proiiciat seintillas.	 Then heat the caustic until it turns white and ejects sparks.
Deinde reduc intestinum, aut zirbum ad concauitatem suam.	 Then return the intestine or feces to its proper place.
Deinde ponat minister manum suam super locum, ut non exeat intestinum: et tu iam aperuisti inter crura infirmi, et posuisti sub eo puluinar, et seruiens alius super crura eius, et alius super pectus eius qui tenet manus.	 Then have the assistant place his hand over the site so that the intestine does not come out; and you have already made an incision between the patient's thighs, and placed a pillow beneath him, and another servant is sitting on his thighs, and another on his chest to hold his hands.  />
Deinde depone cauterium super ipsum signum, manu tua cum cauterio stante recta.	 Then place the caustic over that mark, with your hand holding the caustic upright.
Et tene ipsum, donec cum eo consequaris os: aut itera cum eo uice alia, si non consecutus fueris cum eo in prima usque ad os.	 And hold him until you reach the orifice with it; or repeat the process again if you do not reach the orifice on the first attempt.
Et prudenter obserua ab exitu intestini in hora cauterizationis tuae, ne comburas ipsum, et eueniat per illud super infirmum aut mors, aut malicia magna.	 And carefully observe the exit of the intestine during your use of the caustic, lest you burn it, and cause death or great harm to the patient.
Et scias, quod quando tu non consequeris cum cauterio os, non confert operatio tua.	 And know that when you do not reach the orifice with the caustic, your operation is of no benefit.
Et oportet ut sit cauterium infantium subtile, secundum mensuram eorum.	 And it is necessary for the caustic to be fine and subtle, according to their size.
Deinde cura cum reliquis unguentis, donec sanetur.	 Then care for him with other ointments until he is healed.
Et sit infirmus iacens super dorsum suum quadraginta diebus, donec sigilletur uulnus.	 And let the patient lie on his back for forty days, until the wound closes.
Et oportet, ut ponas nutrimentum eius longitudine temporis curationis eius, quod leniat uentrem eius: ut non exeat intestinum apud conamen et egestionem.	 And it is necessary that you give him food during the time of his treatment, which will soften his belly so that the intestine does not come out during defecation and evacuation.
Deinde quando uult surgere post quadraginta dies, tunc administra ligamentum decenter factum, et teneat ipsum quadraginta diebus aliis.	 Then, when he wants to get up after forty days, administer a well-made bandage, and let him hold it for another forty days.
Et minoretur a labore, et repletione cibi et potus, et uocibus uehementibus.	 And he should be kept from work, and from excessive food and drink, and from loud voices.
Nam quando utitur hoc regimine, ita sanatur sanatione integra.	 For when he uses this treatment plan, he is cured with complete healing.
Et ego dicam curationem Rupturarum cum incisione in capitulo suo.	 And I will say the treatment of ruptures with incision in its own chapter.
Quando autem Rupturae accidunt in reliquo uentre, et sunt incipientes, et uis ut non addantur, tunc cauteriza Rupturam eius cauterio rotundo secundum quantitatem eius: et sit illud quod aduritur ex tunc sicut tertia eius.	 But when ruptures occur in the rest of the belly and are beginning, and you want to prevent them from getting worse, then cauterize the rupture with a round cautery according to its size: and let what is burned be one third of it.
Deinde cura ipsum, cum eo quod diximus: et non addetur.	 Then treat him as we have said: and it will not get worse.
Et iam dixerunt quidam primi: ut cauterizetur Ruptura cum cauterio triangulato, secundum hanc formam.	 And some of the earlier authors said that the rupture should be cauterized with a triangular cautery, according to this shape.
Postquam signatur cum encaustro, et ponitur linea quae est per latitudinem in latere superiori Rupturae, et linea altera ad inferius.	 After it is marked with wax and a line is placed which is the width across the top of the rupture, and another line below it.
Et depone manum tuam in medio cum cauterio clauili.	 And place your hand in the middle with a pointed cautery.
Sed cauterium primum est facilius et melius.	 But the first cautery is easier and better.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in doloribus propter casum, aut percussionem.	 ¶ On the method of cauterizing for pain due to a fall or blow.
Caput XLVIII.	 Chapter 48
Quando accidit in quibusdam membris a casu, aut percussione dolor: et perseuerat ille dolor tempore longo, et non confert in eo curatio cum medicinis: tunc oportet ut cauterizetur cum cauterio Puncti.	 When pain occurs in some members from a fall or blow and that pain persists for a long time and does not improve with medical treatment, then it is necessary to cauterize with a pointed cautery.
Et sit cauterium omnis membri cauterium secundum magnitudinem eius, et ipsius paruitatem, et debilitatem eius, et ipsius uirtutem, et locationem torsionis, et doloris ex eo.	 And the cautery of every member should be according to its size and thinness and weakness and strength and the place where the blow struck and caused pain from it. bey
Si ergo sanatur ex cauterio primo, est bene.	 If he is then cured by the first cautery, that is good.
Si non: tunc itera super ipsum cauterium.	 If not, then repeat the cautery on him. bey
Quoniam de consuetudine horum dolorum est, ut permutentur ex membro ad illud quod appropinquat ei.	 For it is customary for these pains to be transferred from one member to the nearest one.
Quare oportet ut consequaris eos cum cauterio, donec sanetur infirmus.	 Therefore, you must use the cautery on them until the patient heals.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Lepra.	 ¶ On Cauterizing for Leprosy
Caput XLIX.	 Chapter XLIX
Leprosi autem quandoque iuuantur cauterio iuuamento maximo.	 Sometimes, lepers are greatly helped by the aid of the cautery.
Et praecipue species Leprae, quae fit propter putrefactionem phlegmatis et melancholiae: cum ergo uis cauterizare ipsam considera.	 And especially the kind of leprosy that occurs due to the putrefaction of phlegm and black bile; when you wish to cauterize it, take this into consideration.
Si ergo Lepra est ineipiciens, et curasti eam cum eo, quod diximus in diuisione, et non descendit, neque stat: et times super infirmum, quod comprehendat corruptio super totam complexionem eius: tunc cauteriza eum super caput quinque cauteriis: uno in medio capitis noto, et secundo inferius eo uersus frontem apud finem capillorum, et duobus super duo cornua, et uno posterius super nucea ceruicis.	 If the leprosy is at its beginning and you have treated it with what we said in the division, but it does not descend or stay; and you fear for the patient that corruption may spread over his whole constitution, then cauterize him on five points on the head: one in the middle of the forehead, another below it towards the front, at the end of the hairline; two on the two temples; and one at the back of the neck.
Et ultima manum tuam cum cauterio parumper, donec imprimat in os impressionem paruam, et dislocentur ex eo cortices: ut alleuietur expiratio uaporum grossorum ex eo, et cauteriza cauterio etiam super ipsum splenem, secundum quod praecessit.	 And finally, hold the cautery briefly in your hand until it leaves a small impression on the skin, and the scales are loosened from there; so that the exhalation of thick vapors is relieved, and also cauterize the spleen with the cautery, as we mentioned before. 
Sin autem Lepra iam sparsa est super infirmum, et apparet manifeste: tunc oportet ut cauterizes cum istis cauteriis, quae diximus in capite, et cauterio super extremitatem nasi, et duobus cauteriis super duas maxillas, et duobus cauteriis super spondiles colli, et sex super spondiles dorsi, et uno magno super alhahosos apud gran caudae et uno supra ipsum, in ipso almeidati: et duobus super anchas: scilicet super omnem ancham uno, et duobus super genua: uno super omne genu, et duobus super humeros, et duobus super cubitos, et duobus super teneritudines pectoris sui: et cauteriza ipsum super omnem iuncturam, ex iuncturis digitorum manuum suarum, et pedum suorum: et cauteriza super omnem calcaneum pedum suorum, et focilia manuum suarum.	 But if the leprosy is already spread over the patient and clearly appears; then you should cauterize with these cauteries that we mentioned on the head, and one cautery on the tip of the nose, and two on each cheek, and two on each vertebra of the neck, and six on each vertebra of the back, and a large one on the groin at the base of the tail and one above it in the anus; and two on each shoulder blade; that is, one on each entire shoulder blade, and two on each knee; one on each entire knee, and two on each elbow, and two on each wrist, and two on each tender part of his chest. And you should cauterize him on every joint of the fingers of his hands and feet; and cauterize on each heel of his feet and the palms of his hands.
Et caue tibi a neruis qui sunt super postremum calcanei, ut non comburas eos.	 And beware of the nerves that are above the lower part of the heel, so that you do not burn them.
Et quandoque cauterizatur cauterio super os pectinis, et alio super os stomachi, et alio super epar.	 And sometimes it is cauterized with a cautery on the top of the pubic bone, and another on the top of the stomach, and another on the liver.
Et scias, quod quanto plus addis cauterium, est magis iuuamentum, et magis conferens.	 And know that the more you apply the cautery, it is a greater help and more beneficial.
Et scias, quod infirmus non inuenit in cauterio dolorem, sicut inueniunt ipsum sani: propterea, quod corpus eius iam stupefactum est.	 And know that the sick person does not find pain in the cautery as the healthy person finds it: because his body is already numb.
Et oportet ut sint cauteria ex magnitudine, et paruitate secundum membra et iuncturas: secundum quod praecessit ex speciebus ferramentorum.	 And the cauteries should be of appropriate size and shape according to the members and joints: as was previously said concerning the types of instruments.
Deinde cura cauterium ex farina herbi cum melle, et reliqua curatione, donec sanetur.	 Then take care of the cauteries with a paste made from herbs and honey, and continue the treatment until it heals.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Stupore.	 ¶ On the Method of Cauterizing in Coma.
Caput L.	 Chapter L
Quando stupet aliquod membrum, et curatur cum medicinis, et oleis, et emplastris, et non sanatur, tunc cauteriza ipsum membrum stupefactum cauteriis, secundum quod meretur magnitudo membri, aut paruitas eius.	 When any member is in a coma and is treated with medicines, oils, and plasters, but does not heal, then cauterize the comatose member with cauteries, according to the size or shape of the member.
Et sit cauterium tuum intrans in spissitudinem cutis parumper.	 And let your cautery penetrate into the thickness of the skin a little bit.
Deinde cura ipsum cum unguento, donec sanetur.	 Then take care of it with an ointment until it heals.
Et quandoque cauterizatur ad quiddam stuporis, qui accidit manui, et pedi, in spondilibus dorsi apud exitum neruorum, qui mouent illud membrum: et remouetur stupor.	 And sometimes it is cauterized for a certain type of coma that affects the hand or foot, in the joints of the back at the point where the nerves that move that member exit: and the coma will be removed.
Verum non praesumat super illud, nisi qui est sapiens in anatomia membrorum, et egressione neruorum mouentium corpus.	 But do not attempt this unless you are skilled in the anatomy of the members and the exit of the nerves that move the body. ]{
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Albaras.	 ¶ On the Method of Cauterizing in White Leprosy.
Caput LI.	 Chapter LI
Quando antiquatur Albaras, et non confert in eo aliquid ex ingeniis medicinae: tunc cauteriza super ipsam cauterio profundo parumper, secundum quantitatem spissitudinis cutis, donec remoueatur albedo, et mutetur color eius.	 When leprosy is longstanding and nothing helps from the skills of medicine: then cauterize with a deep cautery briefly, according to the thickness of the skin, until the whiteness is removed and its color changes.
Deinde cura ipsum cum farina herbi, et lentis cum oleo rosa, et foliis arnoglossae, et sanguine columbae, et sanguine hyrundinis: de unoquoque sit pars una: misceantur haec omnia, et liniantur super pannum, et adhaereant loco, donec sanetur.	 Then care for it with a herb and lentil flour mixed with rose oil, and arnoglossa leaves, and the blood of a dove, and the blood of a swallow: let there be an equal part of each; all these are to be mixed together and spread on a cloth, and applied to the place, until it heals.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Cancro.	 About the method of cautery for cancer.
Caput LII.	 Chapter 52
Quando Cancer est incipiens, et uis ipsum sistere: tunc cauteriza ipsum cum cauterio circuli in circuitu eius, sicuti reuoluitur.	 When the cancer is beginning and you wish to stop it, then cauterize it with a circular cautery all around it as it is turning.
Sapientes autem dixerunt, ut cauterizetur cauterio ultimo in medio.	 The wise men have said that it should be cauterized in the middle with the last cautery.
Mihi autem non uidetur illud: quoniam timeo quod ulceretur: et ego iam uidi illud aliquotiens.	 But this does not seem right to me, because I fear that it will cause an ulcer; and indeed I have seen this happen many times. ¶ Deinde cauteriza ipsum cum cauterio ultimo in circuitu eius sicuti reuoluitur.
Et rectius est, ut cauterizetur in circumitu eius cum circulo, sicut diximus: aut cauteriis multis.	 And it is better that it be cauterized around its circumference with a circle, as we have said, or with many small cauteries.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Adubelati.	 About the method of cautery for adubelatis (a type of abscess or boil).
Caput LIII.	 Chapter 53
Quando aliquis habet Adubelati, et tardatur in maturatione, aut propter superfluitatem facientem eam, aut propter aetatem infirmi, quando est decrepitus pauci sanguinis, aut propter tempus, et uis festinare in maturatione Adubelati, tunc cauteriza in circumitu eius cum cauteriis paruis multis punctando.	 When someone has an adubelatis and it is delayed in coming to a head, either because of an excess of fluid that causes it, or because the patient is old and weak with little blood, or because of the time and you wish to hasten the maturation of the adubelatis, then cauterize around its circumference with many small punctures.
Deinde dimitte eam.	 Then leave it alone.
Nam ipsa festinabit cum maturatione.	 For it will hasten in its maturation.
Si autem uis perforationem eius cum cauterio, tunc igni cauterium, cuius haec est forma.	 But if you wish to pierce it with a cautery, then heat the cautery, which has this shape:
Et depone ipsum in medio Adubelati, donec penetret cutem: et sit cauterium ab eo quod sequitur infirmus, ut alleuietur cursus puris.	 And place it in the middle of the adubelatis until it penetrates the skin. The cautery should be made by the infirmarius so that he may lighten the course of the pus.
Deinde cura ipsum donec sanetur.	 Then care for it until it heals.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in malo corrodente.	 In the manner of cauterizing in a malignant ulcer.
Caput LIIII.	 Chapter 44.
Corrodens non est nisi corruptio in membro ambulans, et corrodit ipsum: sicut ignis comedit ligna sicca.	 A corrosive ulcer is nothing but a corruption walking through the body, and it eats away at it, just as fire consumes dry wood.
Si ergo uides corrodentem in loco qui toleret cauterium cum igne, tunc igni cauteria multa, clauilia parua et magna, secundum quod conueniet illi loco in quo est corrodens.	 Therefore, if you see a corrosive ulcer in a place that can tolerate cautery with fire, then use much fire cautery, both small and large needles, according to what is suitable for the place where the corrosion is located.
Deinde cauteriza ipsum ab omni parte donec eradices corruptionem totam, et non remaneat ex ea aliquid penitus.	 Then cauterize it on all sides until you have completely eradicated the entire corruption, and nothing remains of it whatsoever. xspace
Deinde dimitte ipsum tribus diebus, et pone super loca cauterizata sulphur tritum cum oleo, donec eradicentur escharae omnes, et omnis corruptio.	 Then leave it alone for three days and place powdered sulfur mixed with oil on the cauterized places until all the scabs are removed, and all corruption is eliminated.
Deinde cura ipsum cum unguentis generantibus carnem.	 Then care for it with flesh-generating ointments.
Si ergo uides, quod post tres dies caro nascitur natiuitate sana, in qua non est corruptio, est bonum.	 If, therefore, you see that after three days healthy flesh is generated, in which there is no corruption, it is good.
Et si non: tunc itera cauterium super illud quod remansit ex locis corruptis.	 And if not: then repeat the cautery on what remains of the corrupted places.
Et corrodens medicatur quandoque cum medicina acuta.	 And the corrosive ulcer is treated sometimes with sharp medicine.
Ipsa namque surgit loco cauterii.	 For it arises in the place of cautery.
Verumtamen cauterium cum igne est uelocioris iuuamenti: et ego quidem iam dixi cauterizationem eius cum medicina acuta in diuisione: accipe ergo eam illic quando ea indiges.	 However, cautery with fire is a faster remedy, and I have already mentioned its cauterization with sharp medicine in the division; take it there when you need it.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Clauis, et Verucis.	 In the manner of cauterizing warts and verrucas.
Caput LV.	 Chapter 50.
Multotiens accidit in inferioribus partibus pedum haec aegritudo: et est res grossa, filtrata, quae laedit pedem.	 Often this disease occurs in the lower parts of the feet; it is a thick, fibrous growth that injures the foot.
Et cauterium quidem in eis est secundum duos modos: cauterium cum igne, et cauterium cum aqua calida.	 And there are two types of cautery for them: cautery with fire and cautery with hot water. xbspace xthe first is performed as follows: take some sulfur and mix it with the oil of violets and make a small needle from it, and apply it to the wart or verruca. xthen light the needle with a flame until it becomes very hot, and then place it on the wart or verruca. xthen continue heating it until it sticks to it like wax, and when you have done this, leave it in place for a while until it cools down.
Quantum autem cum igne est, ut ignias cauterium concauum simile pennae uulturis: quod fiat ex ferro, secundum quantitatem quod contineat clauum ab omni parte: et sit subtilium marginum.	 "As for that which is with fire, burn a hollow cautery like the feather of a vulture: let it be made of iron, according to the size that contains a nail from all sides; and let it have fine edges.
Deinde depone ipsum ignitum super clauum.	 "Then place the burning one on top of the nail.
Deinde reuolue manum cum cauterio in circumitu claui, donec perueniat cauterium ad profunditatem claui: et dimitte ipsum tribus diebus, donec incipiat emittere pus.	 "Then turn the hand with the cautery around the nail until it reaches the depth of the nail; and leave it for three days until it begins to emit pus.
Deinde emplastra ipsum cum maluis syluestribus, contritis cum sale: et dimitte emplastrum super ipsum in nocte.	 "Then apply a plaster on it with wild mallows crushed with salt; and leave the plaster on it at night.
Ipse enim eradicabitur ex radicibus suis.	 "It will indeed be rooted out from its roots.
Deinde cura locum unguento generatiuo carnis, donec sanetur.	 "Then treat the place with a regenerative flesh ointment until it heals.
Quod si sunt non conuersi, et multotiens accidunt in superficie corporis, praecipue in manibus et pedibus: tunc administres in eis cauterium cum aqua calida: et est, ut accipias cannulam ex aere, aut ferro, aut ex penna uulturis: et depone eam super clauum, aut althelul.	 "But if they do not turn, and often happen on the surface of the body, especially in hands and feet; then apply a cautery with hot water to them: and it is done by taking a tube made of bronze, or iron, or from a vulture's feather; and place it on the nail or wart."  />
Deinde proiice in cannulam ex aqua calida quantitatem paucam: retine manum tuam, et tu reuolue eam cum compressione manus tuae parumper, ut imprimatur margo cannulae in radice claui, et inueniat aqua calida uiam ad profundum, ad radicem claui: et expectet infirmus parumper super mordicationem aquae calidae hora una.	 "Then pour a small amount of hot water into the tube; hold your hand, and turn it with the pressure of your hand for a moment, so that the edge of the tube is imprinted on the root of the nail, and let the hot water find a path to the depth, to the root of the nail: and let the patient wait briefly over the stinging of the hot water for one hour.
Deinde dimitte ipsum, nam clauus eradicatur cum radicibus suis.	 "Then leave it alone, for the nail will be rooted out with its roots.
Ita fac cum eis uno post unum, donec uenias super omnes qui ex eis sunt in corpore.	 "Do this one after another until you have treated all that are on the body.
Deinde cura eos postquam eradicantur, cum eo quod generat carnem ex unguentis.	 "Then treat them afterward with whatever ointments regenerate flesh.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Tremore.	 "On the method of cauterizing in tremors.
Caput LVI.	 Chapter 61
Quando accidit alicui Tremor ex frigore in neruo, aut ex febre quartana, aut alio: tunc oportet ut cauterizes ipsum quatuor cauteriis, aut quinque super spondiles dorsi, et inter omnem spondilem cauterio, et in pectore eius cauterio, et super stomachum eius cauterio.	 When someone experiences a tremor due to cold in the nerve, or from tertian fever, or for some other reason, then it is necessary to cauterize them with four or five cauteries on the spinal column of the back, and between every vertebrae one cautery, and one cautery on their chest, and one on their stomach.
Tremor enim quiescit cum cauterio oliuari, et festinat sanitas aegritudinis frigidae.	 For the tremor subsides with cautery of olive oil, and health is hastened from cold sickness.
¶ De modo cauterizandi Albathir.	 About the method of cauterizing by Albucasis.
Caput LVII.	 Chapter 57
Quandoque expelluntur in corpore Albathir foedae, id est, pustulae, quae fiunt a materiis grossis corruptis.	 Sometimes foul things are expelled from the body by Albucasis's method, namely pustules which form from heavy, rotten matter.
Oportet ergo in primis cum apparent, ut cauterizentur super omne caput pustulae cauterio subtili cum ligno myrti, cuius extremitas accensa est cum igne.	 Therefore, as soon as they appear, they should be cauterized over the top of every pustule with a fine cautery using lit myrtle wood whose tip is set on fire.
Aut cum radice aristolochiae longae.	 Or with a long root of birthwort.
Aut cum cauterio lenticulari.	 Or with a lentil-shaped cautery. xspace
Et quandoque cauterizantur ademenul, in principio expulsionis suae secundum hunc modum: et non augentur: et disrumpitur superfluitas faciens eos, et sanatur ex eis.	 And sometimes they are cauterized with a burner at the beginning of their expulsion in this way, and they do not increase; the excess causing them is broken up, and healing comes from them.
Verumtamen oportet ut fiat illud post euacuationem cum phlebotomia.	 However, it should be done after evacuation with bloodletting.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in fluxu sanguins ex arteria in uulnere.	 About the method of cauterizing for bleeding from an artery in a wound.
Caput LVIII.	 Chapter 58
Multotiens accidit fluxus sanguinis ex arteria, quae incisa est apud uulnus, quod accidit extrinsecus, aut apud incisionem apostematis, aut cauterium membri, et similia eis: et fit difficile abscindere eum.	 It often happens that there is bleeding from an artery which has been cut in a wound, whether it occurs externally or at the incision of an aposteme or member's cautery, and similar things; and it is difficult to stop it. ︎ ‌
Cum ergo accidit alicui illud, tunc propera cum manu tua ad orificium arteriae, et pone super ipsum digitum tuum indicem: et stringe eum multum, donec obsessus sit sanguis sub digito tuo, et non egrediatur ex eo aliquid.	 When this happens to someone, then quickly place your hand on the opening of the artery and put your index finger over it; and press hard until the blood is blocked under your finger and nothing comes out from it.
Deinde pone in ignem cauteria oliuaria parua, et magna numero plura: et suffla super ea, donec fiant ignita ualde.	 Then place a small cauterizing instrument made of iron into the fire and several large ones; blow on them until they become very hot.
Deinde accipe ex eis unum, aut paruum, aut magnum, secundum uulnus et locum, in quo disrupta est arteria, et depone cauterium super ipsam uenam, post quam tu remoues digitum tuum festinanter: et tene cauterium, donec abscindatur sanguis.	 Then take one of the instruments, either small or large, according to the wound and the place where the artery has been cut; quickly remove your finger and place the cautery on the vein itself, and hold it there until the blood is cut off.
Quod si expellatur cum eleuas digitum ab orificio arteriae, et extinguis cauterium, tunc accipe cauterium aliud festinanter, ex cauteriis quae in igne sunt praeparata.	 But if it is driven out along with the elevation of your finger from the opening of the artery, and you extinguish the cautery, then quickly take another cautery from those that are prepared in the fire.
Non ergo cesses facere illud cum uno post aliud, donec abscindatur sanguis.	 Do not therefore cease to do this with one after another until the blood is cut off.
Et caue, ne comburas neruum qui est illic, et accidat super infirmum malicia alia.	 And be careful not to burn the nerve that is there, lest something else happen to the patient.
Et scias, quod quando ex arteria fluit sanguis, tunc non est possibile abscindere ipsum: praecipue quaudo arteria est magna, nisi cum uno quatuor modorum.	 And know that when blood flows from the artery, then it is not possible to cut it off; especially when the artery is large, unless with one of four methods.
Aut cum cauterio, sicut diximus.	 Or with a cautery, as we have said.
Aut cum extractione, quando non est extracta.	 Or with extraction, when it has not been extracted.
Nam quando extrahitur, contrahuntur extremitates eius, et abscinditur sanguis.	 For when it is extracted, its ends contract, and the blood is cut off. ↑
Aut ligetur cum filo ligatione forti.	 Or it may be tied with a strong thread of binding.
Aut ponantur super ipsum medicinae de proprietate, quarum est abscindere sanguinem, et stringatur cum puluinari constrictione decenti.	 Or medicines that have the property of cutting off blood may be placed on it and tied tightly with a decent compress.
Qui autem administrat abscisionem eius cum ligamento, et strictura cum panno, aut positione rerum comburentium, et similium, non confert ei penitus, nisi raro.	 However, he who cuts it off with a ligature and constriction with a cloth or with the application of burning substances and such does not help at all, except rarely.
Si autem accidat alicui illud, et non sit ei praesens medicus, neque medicina: tunc incipiat cum positione digiti indicis super orificium uenae ipsius, sicut narrauimus, et constrictione eius ualde, donec obsessus sit sanguis a superiori parte uulneris, et super arteriam.	 But if this happens to someone and there is no physician present or medicine; then let him begin with the position of his index finger on the opening of that vein, as we have described, and with its very tight constriction, until the blood is held back from the upper part of the wound and above the artery. ↑
Et digitus non remoueatur, desuper ipsum cum aqua frigida uehementis frigoris semper, donec congeletur sanguis, et ingrossetur, et abscindatur.	 And the finger should not be moved; pour cold water of intense cold over it until the blood freezes and thickens, and is cut off.
Et interim consideret in eo, quid indiget ex cauterio, aut ex medicina.	 And during that time he should consider whether anything is needed from the cautery or medicine.

¶ De Incisione, Perforatione, et Phlebotomia in uulneribus, et his similibus.	 Concerning the incision, puncturing, and venesection in wounds and similar cases.
Iam Diximus in Capitulo Primo, omnem aegritudinem in qua conueniens est cum igne cauterium et medicina comburente, et occasiones eius, ipsius caussas, et instrumenta eius, et formas cauteriorum.	 As we have said in the first chapter, every illness that is suitable for the use of the cautery and burning medicine, along with its causes, instruments, and types of cautery.
Et posui illic capitula a uertice usque ad pedem.	 And I placed there chapters from the head down to the feet.
Et ego procedam in hoc capitulo illa eadem uia: ut alleuietur super quaerentem quaesitum eius.	 And I will proceed in this chapter along the same path, so that what is sought may be clear to those who seek it.  />
Et antequam incipiam illud, oportet ut addiscatis o filii, quod in hoc capitulo est ex terrore illud quod est in capitulo primo de cauterizatione.	 And before I begin that, it is necessary for you, O sons, to learn what is in this chapter from fear of what is in the first chapter about cautery.
Et propter illud oportet, ut sit cautela in eo uehementior, quoniam in operatione quae est in hoc capitulo, multotiens cadit euacuatio cum sanguine, cum quo stat uita apud apertionem uenae, aut incisionem super apostema, aut apertionem exiturae, aut curationem uulneris, aut extractionem sagittae, aut incisionem super lapidem, et illis similia: ex quibus omnibus associatur tremor, et timor, et cadit in pluribus eorum mors.	 And because of this, greater care is necessary, for in the operation that is in this chapter, there often occurs an evacuation with blood, with which life stands at the opening of a vein, or an incision over an abscess, or the opening of a fistula, or the treatment of a wound, or the extraction of an arrow, or an incision over a stone, and similar things: from all these comes trembling, fear, and in many of them death occurs.  />  />  >
Et ego moneo uos, ne cadat super uos illud in quo est haesitatio, nam quandoque cadunt ad uos in hac arte modi hominum cum modis infirmitatum.	 And I warn you that this hesitation does not fall upon you, for sometimes people with various conditions come to you in this art.
Ex eis enim est qui irascitur cum aegritudine sua, et est leuis apud eum mors: propter uehementiam eius quod inuenit ex infirmitate sua et longitudine eius maliciei.	 For among them is one who becomes angry with his illness, and death is light for him because of the severity he finds from his illness and its long-standing evil.  />  />  >  />
Et cum aegritudine est ex timore quod significat mortem.	 "And with illness from fear which signifies death.
Et ex eis est, qui dat tibicensum suum, et ditat te cum eo, sperans sanitatem, et aegritudo eius est perniciosa.	 "And among them is one who gives his flute to you and enriches you with it, hoping for health, but his illness is deadly.
Non ergo oportet ut consentiatis ei qui uenit ad uos ex eis, cuius modus est talis.	 "Therefore, you should not agree with him who comes to you from among them, whose manner is such.
Et sit cautela uestra uehementior, quam cupiditas et uestra rapacitas.	 "And let your caution be greater than your greed and your rapacity.
Et non praesumatis super aliquid ex illo, nisi post scientiam certam, quae uerificat apud uos illud ad quod peruenit successio laudabilis.	 "And do not assume anything from him unless after certain knowledge, which verifies for you the praiseworthy outcome to which he has arrived.
Et utimini in curatione omnium infirmorum uestrorum, prognosticatione et indicatione de eo ad quod conuenienter sit salus.	 "And use in the treatment of all your sick, prognosis and diagnosis for that to which health is properly suited.
In illo namque est uobis adiutorium super acquisitionem famae et gloriae, et memoriae et laudis.	 "In this indeed you have assistance in the acquisition of fame and glory, and memory and praise.
Inspiret uobis Deus o filii, intellectum suum, et non auferat uobis directionem et inspirationem: quoniam illud est in manu eius.	 "May God inspire you, O sons, with his understanding, and may he not take away your guidance and inspiration, for that is in his hand.
Et ego quidem ordinaui hoc Capitulum distinguendo per capitula, secundum quod praecessit in capitulo Cauterii, a ceruice usque ad pedes: ut alleuietur uobis quaesitum quod uultis ex eo, et quo indigetis.	 "And I myself have arranged this Chapter into sections, following the previous chapter on cautery, from the neck down to the feet, so that it may facilitate for you the search of what you wish and need from it.
¶ De curatione Aquae quae aggregatur in capitibus puerorum.	 "On the treatment of water which collects in the heads of children.
Caput I.	 Chapter I
Scias, quod haec infirmitas multotiens accidit pueris apud partum: aut quando stringit obstetrix caput pueri absque leuitate.	 "Know that this illness often happens to children at birth, or when the midwife presses the child's head without gentleness.
Et quandeque accidit etiam ex caussa occulta quae non scitur.	 "And sometimes it also happens for an unknown cause which is not known.
Et ego quidem non uidi hanc aegritudinem in aliis quam in pueris: et ad omnem quem ex eis uidi properauit mors: propter illud ergo uisum est mihi dimittere operationem in ea.	 "And I myself have not seen this illness in anyone other than children, and for every one of them that I saw death followed quickly; therefore it seemed to me to abandon the treatment of it.
Et ego quidem uidi ex eis puerum, cuius caput impletum erat aqua, et caput magnificabatur in omni die, donec non poterat sedere super seipsum, propter magnitudinem capitis sui: et humiditas augmentata fuit, donec mortuus est.	 "And I myself saw a boy from them whose head was filled with water, and his head increased in size every day until he could no longer sit on his own because of the size of his head; and the fluid accumulated until he died.
Et haec quidem humiditas, aut aggregatur inter cutem et os: aut aggregatur sub osse super sifac.	 And this moisture either gathers between the skin and bone, or it gathers beneath the bone above the sinus.
Et operatio in illo, si est humiditas inter cutem et os, et apostema est paruum, tunc oportet ut findas in medio capitis fissura una in latitudine: et sit longitudo fissurae quasi duo nodi, donec currat humiditas.	 And if the operation is on that [area], and there is moisture between the skin and bone, and an abscess has formed, then it is necessary to cut one incision in the middle of the head, with a width equal to one fingerbreadth; and let the length of the incision be like two finger joints, until the moisture runs out.
Et haec est forma spatumilis.	 And this is the form of a trepan.
Si ergo humiditas est magis augmentata, et apostema est maius, tunc pone eas duas fissuras, secundum formam hanc.	 Therefore, if the moisture has increased more and the abscess is larger, then place those two incisions according to this form.
Et si humiditas est sub osse, et signum eius est, quod uides commissuras capitis apertas ab omni parte: et aqua deprimitur quando comprimis eam manu tua ad interiora, et non occultatur tibi illud: tunc oportet ut findas in medio capitis tribus fissuris, secundum hunc modum.	 And if the moisture is beneath the bone, and its sign is that you see the sutures of the head open on every side; and when you press with your hand towards the inside, water flows out and is not hidden from you; then it is necessary to cut three incisions in the middle of the head according to this manner.
Et post incisionem extrahe humiditatem totam.	 And after making the incision, remove all the moisture.
Deinde stringe fissuras cum pannis et puluillis.	 Then bind the incisions with cloths and wool.
Deinde embroca illud desuper cum uino et oleo usque ad diem quintum.	 Then dress it on top with wine and oil until the fifth day.
Deinde solue ligamentum, et cura uulnus cum tentis, et unguentis.	 Then loosen the bandage, and care for the wound with poultices and ointments.
Et non dimittas stringere caput cum aequalitate.	 And do not neglect to bind the head securely.
Et ciba infirmum omni cibo sicco paucae humiditatis, usquequo confortetur membrum, et sanetur.	 And feed the patient with every dry food of little moisture until the part is strengthened and healed.
Et modus alius incisionis est, ut consideres ubi apparet magnitudo apostematis, et collectio aquae.	 Another method of incision is to consider where the swelling of the abscess and the collection of water appear.
Quoniam quandoque est in occipitio plus, aut in sincipite, aut in dextra, aut in sinistra.	 Because sometimes it is more on the back of the head, or in the front, or on the right side, or on the left side.  />
Ascende ergo cum incisione ubi apparet tibi apostema et impletio aquae: et scinde illud secundum quod tibi possibile est.	 Therefore, ascend with your incision to where you see the abscess and the filling of water; and cut it according to what is possible for you.
Et obserua, ne incidas arteriam, et accidat fluxus sanguinis, et moriatur infirmus ex illo fluxu cum euacuatione humiditatis.	 And be careful not to cut an artery, and cause bleeding, and the patient may die from that bleeding with the evacuation of moisture.
¶ De incisione Arteriarum quae sunt post aures.	 On cutting arteries that are behind the ears.
Caput II.	 Chapter 2
Quando accidunt alicui catarri ad oculos, aut ad pectus, et antiquatur illud, et non confert curatio medicinarum: tunc magis ultima curatio est in illo, incisio harum duarum arteriarum.	 When someone has a cold affecting their eyes or chest, and it persists despite the treatment of medications: then the final cure for them is the cutting of these two arteries.
Oportet ergo quando uis incidere eas, ut radat infirmus caput suum.	 Therefore, when you wish to cut them, the patient must have their head shaved.
Deinde frica locum cum panno aspero, ut appareant arteriae.	 Then rub the area with a rough cloth so that the arteries become visible.
Deinde stringat infirmus collum suum, cum quolibet panno suo.	 Then let the patient tighten their neck with any of their own cloths.
Deinde considera, ubi pulset uena.	 Then observe where the vein pulsates.  /> Deinde incide eam superius in medio.
Et loca utriusque sunt loca quae sunt post aures depressa: et raro occultatur, nisi in quibusdam hominibus.	 And the locations of both are behind the ears and slightly depressed; they are rarely hidden except in some people.
Deinde signa cum encaustro super utraque: et incide utramque cum spatumili utrimque acuro, incisione perueniente ad os: et fiat illud per latitudinem capitis.	 Then mark each with wax and cut both with a sharp scalpel on either side of the opening, and make this incision as wide as the head.
Et si uis, intromitte spatumile sub arteria, et incide eam ad superiora cum incisione.	 And if you wish, insert the scalpel under the artery, and cut it from above with this incision.
Et sit longitudo incisionis quasi duo digiti iuncti.	 And let the length of the incision be about two fingers' width.
Nam quando inciditur uena, egreditur sanguis egressione pulsatili, qui salit ad interiora saltu frequenti.	 For when the vein is cut, blood flows out in a pulsating manner, which jumps to the innermost parts with frequent leaps.
Si autem arteria non apparet sensui, tunc oportet ut mensures ab aure quantitatem spacii trium digitorum.	 But if the artery is not perceptible by touch, then measure from the ear the distance of three fingerbreadths.
Deinde signa cum encaustro, et finde usque ad os.	 Then mark with wax and find it until you reach the opening.
Et illud quod oportet emittere ex sanguine, est VI uncia et fortasse emittis ex eo plus, aut minus.	 And what should be released from the blood is six ounces, and perhaps you will release more or less than that.
Totum illud secundum quantitatem quae apparet tibi ex uirute infirmi et repletione arteriae eius.	 The entire amount according to what appears to you from the strength of the patient and the fullness of his artery.
Deinde considera ad uulnus.	 Then observe at the wound.
Tunc si remanet ad os ex sifac aliquid, tunc incide illud, ut non accidat apostema calidum: tunc stringe uulnus cum liciniis ex panno lini.	 Then if something remains at the opening from the bandage, cut it off so that a hot abscess does not form; then bind the wound with strips of linen cloth.
Deinde cura ipsum cum unguento, donec sanetur.	 Then care for it with an ointment until it heals.
¶ De extractione arteriarum, quae sunt in timporibus.	 On the extraction of temporal arteries.
Caput III.	 Chapter 3.
Quando accidit homini hemicranea antiqua, aut catarri acuti propter humiditates acrimoniales, et caliditate in lacertis timporum, aut soda antiqua, uehemens, et similia illis: et medicatur cum modis curationis medicinae, et non confert illud: tunc experti sumus in his aegritudinibus extractionem arteriarum ex timporibus, aut cauterizationem earum, sicut narrauimus.	 When someone has an old hemicrania or acute catarrh due to sharp humors and heat in the temples, or an old, severe headache similar to these, and is treated with the methods of medical therapy but does not benefit from it; then we have found that in these illnesses extraction of the arteries from the temples, or cauterization of them, as we have narrated, is beneficial.
Et modus operationis in extractione earum, est, ut radat infirmus pilos qui sunt in timporibus, et intendat ad arteriam apparentem in timpore.	 And the method of operation for their extraction is as follows: the patient should shave the hair from his temples and direct [his attention] to the visible artery in the temple.
Ipsa namque ostenditur tibi ex pulsu suo, et raro occultatur nisi in paucis hominibus, aut uehementia frigoris.	 It is indicated to you by its pulse and rarely conceals itself except in a few people or from intense cold.
Quod si occultatur tibi, tunc stringat infirmus caput suum cum quolibet panno suo: deinde frica locum cum panno aspero.	 If it is hidden from you, then the patient should bind his head with any of his cloths; afterwards, rub the place with a rough cloth.
Aut uapora locum cum aqua calida, donec appareat tibi apparitione manifesta.	 Or steam the place with hot water until it appears clearly to you.
Deinde accipe spatumile, quod paulo ante formaui.	 Then take the spatula that I described earlier. ︎
Deinde excoria cum eo cutem cum facilitate, donec peruenias ad arteriam.	 Then use it to easily scrape away the skin until you reach the artery.
Deinde proiice in eam uncinum, et extrahe eam ad superiora, donec extrahas eam ex cute, et facias eam euadere ex tunicis quae sunt sub ea ab omni parte.	 Then insert a hook into it and pull it upwards until you have drawn it out of the skin and made it exit from all the tissues beneath it on every side.
Si autem arteria est subtilis: tunc inuolue eam cum extremitate uncini.	 If, however, the artery is thin, then wrap it around the end of the hook.
Deinde incide ex ea partem secundum quantitatem qua elongentur extremitates eius, et contrahantur, et non accidat fluxus sanguinis.	 Then cut from it a portion according to how much its ends are lengthened and contracted, so that there is no hemorrhage. ︎
Nam si non inciditur, et si non abscinditur, non ascendit sanguis penitus.	 For if it is not cut or separated, the blood does not rise up at all.
Deinde euacua ex sanguine ana VI unci, usque ad .III.	 Then evacuate from blood six ounces, up to three.
Quod si arteria est magna: tunc oportet ut liges eam in duobus locis ex filo duplo, forti, ex serico: aut ex chordis alhohod, ut non properet ad ipsam putrefactio ante consolidationem uulneris, et accidat fluxus sanguinis.	 If the artery is large, then you must tie it in two places with a double, strong thread of silk or catgut, so that putrefaction does not hasten to it before the wound has healed, and blood flow occurs.
Deinde incide superfluitatem, quae est inter duo ligamenta.	 Then cut the excess between the two ligatures.
Fac illud in illa hora, aut post horam aliam.	 Do that at that hour, or after another hour.
Et si uis, cauteriza eam cauterio usque ad os, cum cauterio cultellari: donec incidantur extremitates eius, et stabit loco eiusdem operis.	 And if you wish, cauterize it with a hot iron until the ends are cut off, using a cautery knife, and it will remain in that place for the same operation.
Et est melius opus, nisi si infirmus habet febrem, autest calefactae complexionis.	 And this is a better procedure, unless the patient has a fever or a hot constitution.
Quoniam cauterium est ex eis, quae iuuant ad finiendas humiditates.	 For a cautery is among those things which help to dry up humors.  /// The translator's note: "The text here has 'quorum' instead of 'quoniam', which would change the meaning to 'because of those things...'
Ergo est melius iuuamentum.	 Therefore, it is a better remedy.
Et oportet post extractionem arteriarum, ut impleatur locus cotto antiquo: et ponantur super ipsum puluilli decenter facti.	 And after the removal of the arteries, the place should be filled with old cooked dough and well-prepared poultices placed on top.
Et post solutionem curetur cum medicinis siccis, quae faciunt nasci carnem, et cum liciniis, donec sanetur.	 And after it has dissolved, scrape with dry medicines that promote the growth of flesh, and with ointments, until it heals.
Quod si interim dum operaris accidit fluxus sanguinis ex arteria, tunc propera ad abscindendum eum cum cauterio, aut ut impleas locum cum zegi: et stringe manum tuam, donec abscindatur sanguis.	 If during the operation there is bleeding from the artery, then hurry to cut it off with a hot iron or to fill the place with wax; and hold your hand until the blood is stopped.
Quod si nihil ex illis est tibi praesens, tunc pone super locum digitum tuum, donec congeletur sanguis.	 If none of these things are available to you, then place your finger on the spot until the blood congeals.  /// The translator's note: "The Latin text has 'donec congelentur sanguines', with a plural verb form. I have assumed that this is a scribal error and translated as if it were singular."  /// The translator's note: "In the original Arabic text, this section is numbered as chapter 270."  /// The translator's note: "The translation follows the edited Latin text of Meyerhof and Carra de Vaux (1938), with some modifications based on the reading of the manuscripts.
Et embroca locum cum aqua uehementis frigoris, donec quiescat acuitas, et stringatur secundum quod oportet.	 And pierce the place with cold water until the pain subsides, and then bandage it as needed.
Et ex eo quod est leuius et facilius extractione arteriae, est, ut cauterizes uenam cum hoc cauterio habente duos cultellos: sitque acuitas duorum cultellorum similis almagdatem.	 And to facilitate and ease the extraction of the artery, it is best to cauterize the vein with this double-bladed cautery; let the sharpness of both blades be similar to an almagdatem.
Verumtamen sunt multo minoris acuitatis, quam duo cultelli.	 However, they are much sharper than two knives.
Quoniam si sunt acutae, sicut duo cultelli, properat utrisque frigus: et non incidunt carnem cum uelocitate.	 For if they are as sharp as two knives, cold quickly overtakes both of them; and they do not cut the flesh swiftly.
Cum ergo in eis est aliquantulum grossitudinis, tenetur in eis calor ignis, et abscinditur caro uelociter: cum hoc ergo opus est melius omni opere, et leuius, et facilius.	 Therefore, since there is a little thickness in them, they hold the heat of the fire, and cut the flesh swiftly; with this, therefore, the work is better than any other work, easier, and more convenient.
Et sit spacium quod est inter duos cultellos quantitas grossitudinis digiti, postquam tu signas duo loca cum encaustro: et depone utrosque ignitos ualde, donec perueniant ad os, et incidant uenam in duobus locis: ut elongetur quod est inter extremitates eius.	 And let the space between the two blades be as thick as a finger after you mark two places with the cautery; and put both very hot until they reach the vein, cutting it in two places so that what is between its ends becomes long.
Nam non consolidantur cum hoc cauterio penitus.	 For they do not heal completely with this cautery.
Et haec est forma cauterii.	 And this is the shape of the cautery.
¶ De cura cursus lachrymarum acutarum assiduarum ab oculis.	 ¶ On the treatment of persistent, sharp eye-watering.
Caput IIII.	 Chapter IV
Quando sunt lachrymae assiduae, et est cursus earum ex uenis, quae sunt super craneum capitis exterius: et non confert in eis aliquid curationis medicinae cum medicinis, et uides faciem infirmi iam rubere, et sentit in fronte sua deambulationem, sicut est deambulatio formicarum: et oculi eius sunt extenuati, humidi, ita quod iam corrosi sunt pili eorum cum corrosione: et calefactae sunt palpebrae eius ex acuitate lachrymarum: tunc antiqui indiguerunt in curatione earum hac operatione, et denominauerunt eam curationem, cum Ense.	 When tears are persistent and their flow is from the veins outside on top of the head, and medicines with medical treatment do not help; and you see the face of the patient already turning red, and he feels a crawling sensation on his forehead as if ants were walking there; and his eyes are weakened, moist, so that their hair is now corroded away; and his eyelids are heated from the sharpness of the tears—then the ancients needed this procedure for their treatment and called it "treatment with a sword." ›
Et est, ut praecipias infirmo radere pilos qui sunt in fronte sua.	 And it is necessary that you advise the sick person to shave the hairs on their forehead.
Deinde incide in fronte tres fissuras aequedistantes secundum longitudinem frontis: et sit longitudo fissurae quasi duo digiti, et fissura una sit aequedistans longitudini nasi in medio frontis, et secunda secundum longitudinem parumper a motu lacertorum, et tertia a parte altera: et caue ab incisione arteriarum quae sunt in duobus lateribus: et elonga manum tuam a continuatione duarum mandibularum, et sit spacium omnis incisionis quantitas trium digitorum coniunctorum: et sit tibi frustum spongiae praeparatum, aut panni siccati multi, cum quibus exsicces sanguinem.	 Then make three equally distant incisions along the length of the forehead: and let the length of each incision be like two fingers, and let one incision be in the middle of the forehead, equally distant from the length of the nose; and the second should be a little further from the movement of the shoulders; and the third should be on the other side. And take care not to cut the arteries that are on both sides; and keep your hand away from the continuation of the two jaws, and let the space of all the incisions be like three connected fingers in size: and prepare a piece of sponge for yourself, or many dry cloths, with which you will dry the blood.
Deinde intromitte spatumile duarum acutarum extremitatum, cuius mox sequens est forma.	 Then insert a thread with two pointed ends, whose following form is this:
Ab incisione quae est a parte timporis, usque ad incisionem secundam: et excoria cum eo totam cutem, quae est inter duas incisiones, cum sifac, quod est super os.	 From the incision that is near the temple, to the second incision; and with it peel off all the skin between the two incisions, along with the soft tissue that is on top of it.
Deinde fac illud etiam ab incisione media usque ad incisionem secundam.	 Then do likewise from the middle incision to the second incision.
Deinde extrahe hoc spatumile, et intromitte in incisionem primam iterum instrumentum aliud, quod nominatur cultellare acutum, ab una parte lene, non acutum ab altera parte.	 Then remove that thread, and insert into the first incision again a different instrument called a sharp knife, gently from one side, not sharply from the other side.
Et haec est forma eius.	 And this is its form.
Et pone latus eius acutum uersus carnem annexam cum cute, et latus eius lene uersus os: et impelle ipsum, donec perueniat ad fissuram mediam: et abscinde cum eo omnia uasa, quae descendunt a capite ad oculos: praeter quod continuetur incisio usque ad illud quod apparet de cute.	 And place its sharp edge toward the attached flesh with the skin, and its gentle side toward the bone; and push it until it reaches the middle incision; and cut with it all the vessels that descend from the head to the eyes: except that the incision continues until what is seen of the skin.
Deinde fac illud in fissura media usque ad fissuram aliam.	 Then do this in the middle incision until the other incision.
Et postquam currit ex sanguine quantitas aequalis, exprime loca ex frustis sanguinis coagulati.	 And when an equal amount of blood has flowed out, press on the places with clots of blood to stop the bleeding.
Deinde pone in omnem fissuram licinium ex cotto ueteri, et pone super eos puluillos imbibitos in uino, et oleo, aut aceto.	 Then place a patch of old linen in every slit, and place upon them small balls soaked in wine, oil, or vinegar.
Et uide ut non accidat apostema calidum.	 And see that no hot abscess occurs.
Et in die tertia solue ligamentum, et administra infusionem multam cum aqua tepida.	 And on the third day, loosen the bandage, and administer a large infusion with warm water.
Deinde cura illud ex unguento basilicon, et reliquis quibus curantur uulnera: usquequo sanetur.	 Then treat it with an ointment of balm and other treatments for wounds until it heals.
¶ De cura lachrymarum acutarum et catarrorum ad oculos ex interioribus capitis.	 About the treatment of sharp tears and head colds affecting the eyes from within the head.
Caput V.	 Chapter 5
Quando accidunt alicui catarri acuti, acres, assidui: et uides oculos eius extenuatos, paruos, et iam debilitatus est aspectus eorum: et palpebrae ulceratae, et cadunt pili ex eis, et in profundo capitis est dolor acutus, laedens, et sternutatio consequens: tunc sume ex istis accidentibus, quod illae materiae, et catarri non ueniunt, nisi ex uenis multis.	 When someone has sharp, painful, constant colds, and you see their eyes are thin, small, and their sight is already weakened; and the eyelids are ulcerated, and hairs fall out from them, and there is a sharp pain in the depths of the head that hurts, and sneezing follows: then know that these things come to pass only from many veins.
Et melior curatio in eis est haec.	 And a better treatment for them is this.  />
Et est, ut praecipias infirmo radere frontem suam.	 And it is that you should advise the patient to shave their forehead.
Deinde incide in eam fissuram unam in medio frontis, aut alterius parumper per latitudinem, et incipe cum fissura a timpore sinistro ad timpus dextrum: et sit incisio usque ad os: et elonga manum tuam a lacertis timporum, qui mouentur apud masticationem: donec quando detegitur os: et exsiccabis totum sanguinem cum spongia.	 Then cut one slit in the middle of the forehead, or another somewhat in width, and begin with the slit from the left temple to the right temple; and let the incision reach the mouth; and draw your hand away from the temples that move during chewing until the mouth is exposed; and dry all the blood with a sponge.  />  ·
Tunc separa inter duo labia fissurae cum cotto ueteri, aut cum liciniis ex lino.	 Then separate between the two lips of the slit with old linen cloth, or with linens from flax.
Deinde stringe desuper cum puluillis: et imbibe puluillos cum uino et oleo, ut non accidat apostema calidum.	 Then bind on top with small balls and soak the balls in wine and oil, so that no hot abscess occurs.
Et quando soluis illud, et uides quod apostema calidum iam imminuitur: tunc oportet ut frices os, donec incipiat in eo nasci caro.	 And when you loosen it and see that the hot abscess has lessened: then it is necessary for you to scrub the mouth until flesh begins to form there.  />
Deinde cura ipsum cum regimine exiccatiuo quod facit nasci carnem: sicut si accipias ex farina tritici partes duas, et ex colophonia quatuor partes: et praepares ex eis emplastrum, et administretur ad natiuitatem carnis in istis uulneribus.	 Then take care of him with a drying regimen that causes flesh to form, such as if you take two parts of wheat flour and four parts of resin and prepare a plaster from them, and administer it at the time of flesh formation in these wounds.
¶ De cura eius quod cadit in Aurem.	 § On the care for what falls into the ear.
Caput VI.	 Chapter VI
Omne Quod in Aurem cadit, est una quatuor specierum: aut lapis mineralis, aut simile lapidi, sicut ferrum, et uitrum: aut est ex planta, sicut est cicer, et fabae: aut est res fluxibilis, sicut aqua, et acetum, et eis similia: aut aliquod animal.	 Everything that falls into the ear is one of four kinds: either a mineral stone or something similar to a stone, such as iron and glass; or it is from a plant, such as chickpeas and beans; or it is a liquid substance, such as water, vinegar, and the like; or some kind of animal.
Quando ergo cadit in aurem lapis, aut genus lapidis ex eis quae non adduntur, neque crescunt in aure, expone Aurem soli: si ergo uides lapidem, tunc distilla in Aurem aliquid ex oleo uiolato, aut sisamino.	 When, therefore, a stone or something of the kind from those which do not grow and are not added falls into the ear, expose the ear to sunlight; but if you see the stone, then drip some oil of violets or sesame oil into the ear.
Deinde administra extractionem eius, et fac sternutare cum condisi, et opila nares apud aduentum sternutationis, postquam tu ponis in circumitu auris frusta ex pannis, aut lana, et extendis aurem ad superiora.	 Then administer an extraction and cause sneezing with a condiment; and plug the nostrils at the onset of sneezing, after you have placed around the ear fragments of cloth or wool, and extend the ear upwards.
Multotiens enim egreditur cum hac cura.	 For often it comes out with this treatment.
Si autem non egreditur, tunc administra extractionem eius cum Gesti, id est, Pizigarolis subtilibus: cuius forma est haec.	 But if it does not come out, then administer the extraction with tweezers, that is, fine pincers; and their form is this.  />
Si ergo egreditur cum gesti, est bonum.	 If it comes out with the tweezers, it is good.
Et si non, tunc administra extractionem eius cum uncino caeco subtili paucae duplicationis.	 And if not, then administer the extraction with a fine, small-bladed hook.
Si ergo non egreditur per illud, tunc fac cannulam ex aere, et intromitte extremitatem cannulae in foramen auris multum, et opila quod est in circumitu cannulae cum caera mollificata cum oleo, ut non sit uento uia nisi cannulae: deinde extrahe cum uento tuo attractione forti.	 But if it does not come out through that, then make a tube from metal and insert the end of the tube deeply into the opening of the ear, and plug what is around the tube with softened wax mixed with oil, so that there be no way for air except through the tube; then draw it out with your strong attraction. 
Multotiens enim egreditur cum eo quod narrauimus.	 Often indeed it goes out with what we have narrated.
Si autem non egreditur hoc modo: tunc accipe ex helkalimbat, aut ex uisco, id est, gluten praeparato, cum quo capiuntur aues, rem modicam: et pone ipsum in extremitate radii postquam tu inuoluis super eam cotum decenter positum: deinde intromitte ipsum in foramen auris cum facilitate, postquam tu exiccas aurem ab humiditate.	 But if it does not go out in this manner: then take from helkalimbat or from glue prepared with which birds are caught, a small portion; and put it at the end of the stick after you have wound over it a neatly placed bandage. Then insert it into the ear canal easily, after you have dried the ear from moisture.
Si ergo non egreditur cum omnibus quae narrauimus, tunc propera ad scindendum, antequam accidat apostema calidum, aut spasmus.	 Therefore if it does not go out with all that we have narrated, then hasten to cut open (the ear) before a hot abscess or spasm occurs.
Et modus fissurae est, ut phlebotomes infirmum in primis in cephalica: et extrahe ei ex sanguine secundum mensuram uirtutis eius.	 And the manner of cutting is that the physician should first open a vein on the head; and draw blood from him according to his strength.
Deinde fac sedere infirmum inter manus tuas, et conuerte aurem eius ad superiora, et finde fissuram paruam in radice auris apud adipem eius in loco depresso ipsi: et sit fissura lunaris figurae, donec peruenias ad lapidem: deinde aufer eum cum eo, quod est tibi possibile ex instrumentis.	 Then make the patient sit between your hands, and turn his ear upward; and find a small cut in the root of the ear at its fatty part in a depressed place itself; and let the cut be lunar shaped, until you reach the stone; then remove it with whatever instrument is possible for you. 》
Deinde sue fissuram ab hora tua cum uelocitate, et cura ipsam, donec sanetur.	 Then either make the cut swiftly yourself and take care of it until it heals.
Quod si res cadens in aurem est ex uno granorum, quae crescunt, et inflantur: tunc administra extractionem eius.	 If however the thing that fell into the ear is one of the grains which grow and swell up, then administer an extraction for it.
Si autem non obedit tibi ad exitum, tunc accipe spatumile tenue, subtile, secundum hanc formam.	 But if it does not obey you to go out, then take a thin, subtle spatula according to this shape:
Et administra cum eo abscisionem illius speciei ex granis, quae cadunt in aurem, et non facias illud, quando tu cogitas, quod illud granum iam humectatum est per uaporem auris, donec ponis ipsum frusta multa: deinde extrahe ea cum uncinis, aut cum gesti subtili, aut cum suctione, sicut diximus, nam extractio eius alleuiatur.	 And apply an incision of that kind for the grains which fall into the ear and do not do this when you think that grain is already moistened by the vapor of the ear until you place it in many pieces; then remove them with tweezers, or a fine probe, or suction, as we have said, for its extraction will be eased.
In aqua autem quae ingreditur in aurem, oportet ut utatur infirmus sternutatione cum condisi in primis: et iam impleuit aurem suam cum aliquanto cotto ueteri: et est iacens super illam aurem, in qua est aqua.	 For water which enters the ear, it is fitting for the patient to use sneezing first of all; and now he has filled his ear with some old bandage; and he lies upon that ear in which there is water.
Si ergo egreditur per illud, est bonum.	 If it exits through that part, it is good.
Et si non: tunc accipe lapides multos, secundum longitudinem digiti, tenues, lenes, et calefac eos cum igne parumper, et intromittat infirmus ex eis unum in foramen auris suae: et saliat super pedem suum unum ex illa parte, et percutiat cum lapide alio super lapidem qui est in aure.	 And if not: then take many stones, according to the length of your finger, thin and soft, and heat them slightly with fire; and let the sick person put one of them into his ear hole: and let him jump on one foot on that side, and strike it with another stone on the stone which is in the ear.
Non ergo cesset facere illud cum lapide et lapide, donec egrediatur tota aqua.	 Therefore, do not cease doing this with the stone and the stone until all the water comes out.
Et iam egreditur aqua ita, ut accipias ex parpyro, aut ex iunco unum, et intromittas extremitatem eius unam in aurem: et accendas extremitatem alteram cum igne, donec comburatur plurimum eius.	 And now the water comes out in such a way that you should take one of either rush or reed, and insert its tip into the ear; and set fire to the other end with a flame, until most of it is burnt.
Deinde itera iuncum alium, et fac illud multotiens, donec egrediatur tota aqua: et extrahe ipsam cum cannula secundum quod praemissum est in lapide.	 Then repeat this with another rush, and do it many times until all the water comes out; and remove it with a probe as previously mentioned for the stone.
In extractione autem animalis intrantis in eam, si est parui corporis, ut pulex, et ei simile, cura ipsum sicut dixi in diuisione.	 But if an animal enters it, and its body is small, like a flea, then care for it as I said in the section on division.
Sed si est corporis magni, quod appareat sensui: tunc administra extractionem eius cum gesti, et uncinis: et res eius est facilior omnibus, quae tenentur in aure.	 But if it has a large body, which is perceptible to the senses; then administer its extraction with tweezers and hooks: and this case is easier than all others that are retained in the ear.
In extractione autem uermis generati in aure, quando curas eum cum eo quod diximus in diuisione, et in tractatu distilationum, et non confert curatio tua: tunc oportet ut aspicias aurem in sole.	 But in the extraction of a worm born in the ear, when you care for it with what we said in division and in the treatment of distillations, and your treatment does not help; then you must examine the ear in sunlight. 》
Si ergo apparet illic aliquid ex uermibus, tunc extrahe illud cum gesti, aut cum uncinis subtilibus.	 If something from the worms is visible there, then remove it with tweezers or fine hooks.
Si autem non apparet illic aliquid, tunc accipe cannulam, cuius haec est forma, stricta inferius, ampla superius: et intromitte extremitatem subtilem in aurem secundum quantitatem quod tolerat eam infirmus: deinde suge cum ea suctione forti.	 But if nothing is visible there, then take a probe of this shape, narrow at the bottom and wide at the top; and insert its thin tip into the ear according to how much the patient can tolerate; then draw with it strongly.
Fac illud multotiens, donec egrediantur omnes uermes.	 For this, often, until all the worms come out.
Si autem non obediunt tibi ad exitum, tunc opila circumitum cannulae cum caera, sicut dixi in lapide.	 But if they do not obey you to come out, then fill the circle of the probe with wax, as I said about the stone.
Quod si non egrediuntur cum eo quod diximus: tunc administra distillationes quas iam experti sunt antiqui in interfectione uermium: et inuenies illud in tractatu distillationum.	 If they do not come out with what I said: then administer the distillations that the ancients have already experienced in the killing of worms; and you will find this in the treatise on distillations.
Et sit effusio tua qua effundis olea et medicinas in aurem cum hoc instrumento, cuius forma depicta est hic.	 And let your pouring be that with which you pour oil and medicines into the ear with this instrument, whose form is drawn here.
Sicut uides fac ipsum ex argento, aut aere, inferius strictum, in quo sit foramen paruum, amplum superius.	 As you see, make it from silver or bronze, narrow at the bottom, in which there should be a small hole, wide at the top.
Sit ergo ut impellens quod est in concauitate cannulae, sit ex aere decenter factum.	 Let, therefore, the plunger that is inside the cavity of the probe be made from bronze, well-crafted.
Et si uis, accipe radium, et inuolue in extremitate eius cottum inuolutione decenti: deinde proiice oleum, aut succum, aut quod uis ex istis medicinis in cannulam: et ipsa sit in aure: deinde intromitte radium cum cotto desuper, et exprime ipsum manu tua compressione temperata, donec impellatur oleum in concauitate auditus, et sentiat ipsum infirmus interius: et illud quod infunditur in aurem, sit iam calefactum cum igne parumper: et caue ne sit res quae distillatur in eam frigida ualde: medicinae enim non tolerant illud.	 And if you wish, take a reed and wrap the tip of it neatly with cotton; then pour oil or juice or whatever medicine you want into the probe; and let the probe be in the ear; then insert the reed with the cotton on top and press it gently with your hand until the oil is pushed into the cavity of the ear, and the patient feels it inside; and what is poured into the ear should already be warmed a little by fire; and be careful that it is not very cold, for medicines do not tolerate that.

¶ De cura opilationis accidentis Auri.	 ¶ On the treatment of gold impaction.
Caput VII.	 Chapter 7.
Quandoque egrediuntur quidam infantes ex uentribus matrum suarum non perforati.	 Sometimes some infants come out of their mothers' wombs unperforated.
Et iam accidit etiam quibusdam hominibus opilatio in meatu Auris a uulnere, aut carne nata in ea.	 And it has also happened to some people that an impaction occurs in the ear canal from a wound or flesh born there.
Et haec opilatio quandoque fit in profundo foraminis Auris, quam non consequitur uisus: et quandoque accidit ad exteriora foraminis parum, et consequitur eam uisus.	 And this impaction sometimes occurs deep within the ear canal, which sight cannot follow; and sometimes it happens near the outer part of the canal, and sight follows it.
Illa ergo quae accidit in profundo Auris, et quam non comprehendit aspectus, est in pluribus dispositionibus difficilis sanationis.	 That which occurs in the deep part of the ear and is not seen by the eyesight is difficult to heal in many cases.
Et in illa quam consequitur uisus, oportet ut ponas Aurem infirmi in sole, et aspicias in ea: tunc si uides opilationem apparentem, aperi eam cum spatumili subtili, cuius forma est haec quae sequitur, sit extremitas eius in qua sit quaedam latitudo parua, cuius quaedam pars sit acuta: et reliquum spatumile sit duarum laterum lenium: ut non laedat aurem.	 And in that which follows sight, you should place the ear of the patient in the sun and look at it; then if you see a visible obstruction, open it with a fine probe, the shape of which is as follows: its tip should have a small width, part of which is sharp, and the rest of the probe should be smooth on two sides so that it does not harm the ear.
Si ergo opilatio est a carne nata in meatu auris: tunc tene eam cum uncino subtili, et incide eam cum facilitate uehementi, donec auferatur tota caro.	 If therefore the obstruction is formed of flesh within the ear, then hold it with a fine hook and cut it with great ease until all the flesh is removed.
Quod si opilatio est in profundo auris: tunc accipe radium subtilem, lenem, et calefac ipsum cum igne parumper: deinde mitte ipsum in meatum auris.	 But if the obstruction is deep within the ear, then take a thin, smooth probe and heat it with fire for a short while; then insert it into the opening of the ear.
Si ergo senseris opilationem cum eo, quod inuenit infirmus cum grauitate auditus, conare apertionem eius cum facilitate: et caue, ne uulneres neruos auris.	 If therefore you feel the obstruction along with what the patient finds with a heavy hearing, endeavor to open it with ease; and beware lest you wound the nerves of the ear.  ///
Deinde pone in aurem licinium secundum quantitatem amplitudinis foraminis, quod inuoluisti in unguento aegyptio: fac illud aliquot diebus, donec sis securus de consolidatione uulneris.	 Then place a linen bandage over the ear according to the size of the opening, rolled up in Egyptian ointment; do this for several days until you are sure about the healing of the wound.
Aut accipe licinium, et infunde ipsum in aqua rosata, et pulueriza super ipsum zegi tritum, et utere ipso.	 Or take a linen cloth and soak it in rose water; then sprinkle ground alum over it and use that.
Quod si uides aurem iam apostemari: tunc oportet ut extrahas licinium, et permittas ipsum cum licinio alio, quod inuolues in caeroto quod sit factum cum oleo rosato, donec sedetur apostema calidum: deinde cura ipsum usquequo sanetur.	 But if you see the ear swelling already, then it is necessary to remove the linen cloth and leave it with another linen cloth that you will roll up in a plaster made with rose oil until the hot swelling subsides; then treat it until it heals.
Si autem accidat fluxus sanguinis: tunc submerge spongiam, aut pannos in aqua frigida, et pone super eam aurem: et utere reliqua curatione, quae abscindit fluxum sanguinis praedicta in tractatu distillationum.	 But if bleeding occurs, then submerge a sponge or cloths in cold water and place the ear on it; and use the rest of the treatment which cuts off the aforementioned bleeding in the section on distillations.
¶ De cura Altheli palpebrarum.	 In the care of ptosis of the eyelids.
Caput VIII.	 Chapter Eight.
Isti Althelil qui accidunt in Palpebris oculi, quandoque sunt humidi, et sunt sicci.	 These ptoses that occur in the eyelids of the eye are sometimes moist and sometimes dry.
Oportet ergo ut teneas eos cum tenaliis: aut cum uncino, et incidas eos cum spatumili a radicibus suis.	 Therefore, you should hold them with tweezers or with a hook and cut them from their roots with a scraper.
Deinde pone super loca zegi tritum.	 Then place ground cinnabar on the places.
Si autem ex eis fluat sanguis, tunc cauteriza eos cum cauterio lenticulari subtili.	 But if blood flows from them, then cauterize them with a fine lenticular cautery.
Et cauterizare eos, est melius post incisionem.	 And it is better to cauterize them after the incision.
Multotiens enim redeunt quando remanet ex radicibus suis aliquid.	 For often they return when something remains of their roots.
Et quando cauterizantur cum igne, comburuntur illae radices, et non redeunt.	 And when they are cauterized with fire, those roots are burned and do not return.
¶ De cura Grandinum palpebrarum oculi.	 ¶ On the care of chalazion in the eyelids of the eye.
Caput IX.	 Chapter Nine.
Multotiens accidit in palpebris aliquid quod assimilatur Crandini in fortitudine sua, et sua duricie, et propter illud nominatur Grando: et est aggregatio humiditatis grossae in palpebra superiore, et palpebra inferiore.	 It often happens that something appears in the eyelids similar to a chalazion in its strength and hardness, and because of this it is named 'grain'; it is an accumulation of thick moisture in the upper eyelid and the lower eyelid.
Operatio ergo in eis est, ut consideres tunc, si est Grando procedens in eo, quod apparet de palpebra, et mouentur ad omnem partem, et res eius est facilis.	 Therefore, the operation for them is that you should then consider if there is a 'grain' emerging from what appears on the eyelid and it moves in all directions, and its nature is easy.  ?>
Finde ergo super eam fissura per latitudinem.	 Therefore find above it a slit of suitable width.
Deinde excoria eam ab omni parte cum facilitate, donec euadat.	 Then excise it from all sides easily until it comes out.
Deinde suspende eam cum uncino, et abscinde ipsam.	 Then hang it with a hook and cut it off.
Si autem non praeparatur tibi abscisio eius, nisi postquam tu penetras palpebram cum incisione parumper, tunc nocet infirmo illud in aliquo.	 But if its removal is not prepared for you unless after you penetrate the eyelid with a slight incision, then it may harm the patient somewhat.
Quod si fissura est magna: tunc aggrega ipsam cum sutura: et cura ipsam, donec sanetur.	 If the slit is large, then close it with stitches and treat it until it heals.
Et si est parua, non superueniet tibi malum ex ea.	 And if it is small, no harm will come to you from it.
Vnguentum enim restaurat ipsam, et incarnat eam.	 The ointment restores it and fleshes it out.
Et si grando est decliuis ad interiora auris uersus superficiem intrinsecam, tunc inuersa palpebram, et suspende grandinem cum uncino: praeter quod indigeas incisione, et preme eam ab omni parte.	 And if the gravel has slipped into the interior of the ear towards the inner surface, then turn back the eyelid and hook out the gravel with a hook; besides this you will need to make an incision and press it from all sides.
Quod si elongatur palpebra per incisionem, non nocet illud in aliquo.	 And if the eyelid is stretched by the incision, this does no harm.
Deinde ablue oculum post incisionem grandinis, cum aqua salsa: et cura locum cum eo quod incarnat, donec sanetur infirmus.	 Then after the incision of the gravel, wash the eye with salt water; and treat the place with what makes it fleshy until the patient is healed.
¶ De cura Axirnath palpebrarum.	 ¶ Concerning the treatment for inflammation of the eyelids.
Caput X.	 Chapter 10
Axirnath est adeps qui generatur in tunicis palpebrae superioris: et plurimum quidem accidit illud pueris: et ipsum grauat oculos eorum, et accidunt eis catarri in matutinis, et non possunt intueri lumen solis, propterea, quod lachrymae properant ad eos, et propter illud uides eos discumbere super facies suas semper, et super eas dormiunt, et sunt palpebrae eorum sub superciliis humidae, quas iam cooperuit inflatio: et eminentia quidem Axirnath apparens est oculo, et quando tu premis locum cum digitis tuis, sentis Axirnath inter eos.	 Chapter 10: Concerning the treatment for inflammation of the eyelids. Trachoma is a fat that is generated in the tissues of the upper eyelid; and it occurs most often in children. It weighs down their eyes, and they are afflicted with catarrh in the mornings, and cannot look at the sun because tears rush to them, and on account of this you see them always lying face up, and sleeping that way, and their eyelids are moist under the eyebrows, which are already covered by swelling. And indeed, the prominent Axirnath is visible in the eye, and when you press the place with your fingers, you feel the Axirnath between them.
Et modus operationis eius est, ut ponat infirmus caput suum in sinu tuo.	 And the method of operation is for the patient to place their head in your lap.
Deinde accipe pannum lini, et praepara in eo licinia, et fac ex illo licinio circulum secundum quantitatem quod continet Axirnath ab omni parte.	 Then take a linen cloth and prepare strips from it, and make a circle from those strips according to the size that contains the Axirnath on all sides.
Deinde pone eum super eam, et preme cum digitis tuis ab omni parte, ut aggregetur Axirnath in medio circuli.	 Then place it [the circle] over it [the eyelid], and press with your fingers from all sides, so that the Axirnath gathers in the middle of the circle. ⟩
Deinde finde in medio illius humiditatis cum spatumili incidente fissuras per latitudinem, et non sit fissura maior illa quae fit in phlebotomia in profundo.	 Then find in the middle of that moistness with a small blade making incisions through its width, and let the incision not be deeper than that made for bloodletting. ⟩
Aut oportet ut findas cutem totam, donec peruenias ad Axirnath in pluribus enim dispositionibus procedit Axirnath ex fissura secundum formam frusti pinguedinis albae.	 Or it is necessary to excise the entire skin until you reach the achilles tendon, for in many cases the Achilles tendon protrudes from the opening in the shape of a piece of white fat.
Extrahe ergo eam cum panno, quem infiltrasti inter digitos tuos ad exteriora: et tu reuoluis manum tuam ad dextram et sinistram, donec dispergatur: et caue, ne addas in fissura, ut non peruenias cum spatumili ad oculum, et laedas eum.	 Therefore, extract it with a cloth which you have inserted between your fingers towards the outside: and turn your hand to the right and left until it is dispersed; and be careful not to add [anything] into the opening, so that you do not reach the eye with the spoon and injure it.
Si autem non appareat tibi Axirnath in principio fissurae, tu addas in fissura parum cum facilitate, donec procedat Axirnath.	 However, if the Achilles tendon does not appear to you at the beginning of the opening, you should introduce a little [instrument] into the opening with ease until the Achilles tendon protrudes.
Deinde extrahe eam, sicut diximus.	 Then extract it as we have said.
Deinde submerge pannos in aceto et aqua, et pone eos super locum, et stringe eum cum puluillis.	 Then soak the cloths in vinegar and water, and place them on the wound, and bind it with little pieces of wool.
Et ex hominibus sunt qui terunt salem, et ponunt ipsum in concauitate fissurae, ut liquefiat quod remansit ex illa humiditate.	 And there are some people who grind salt and place it in the cavity of the opening, so that it melts whatever remains of that moisture.
Deinde cura ipsam, donec sanetur.	 Then care for [the wound] until it heals.
Si autem accidat in loco apostema calidum, tune cura ipsum cum emplastris sedatiuis, donec sanetur.	 However, if a hot abscess occurs at the site, then care for [the wound] with soothing plasters until it heals.
¶ De modis Ataxmir oculi, id est, cum palpebra mollificatur oculi, unde fit ut rugetur sicut non debet.	 ¶ Concerning the types of ataxia of the eye, that is, when the eyelid of the eye becomes lax, so that it blinks as it should not.
Caput XI.	 Chapter XI.
Quando nascuntur in palpebris oculi pili additi praeter cursum sub pilis naturalibus, et antiquantur: tunc ipsi nocent oculo, et faciunt accidere modos aegritudinum, sicut lachrymas assiduas, et mollificationem palpebrarum, et albuginem, donec fit illud caussa destructionis oculi.	 When hairs are born in the eyelids of the eye beyond their natural course among the natural hairs and they grow old; then these [hairs] harm the eye and cause various diseases to occur, such as constant tearing, laxity of the eyelids, and opacities, until it leads to the destruction of the eye.
Et Ataxmir quidem oculi curatur secundum quatuor modos.	 And ataxia of the eye is treated according to four methods. ¶ The first method: ¶ Take a needle and dip it in water and sulfur, and pass it along the edge of the eyelid, and burn [the hairs] with fire; and this is done only once. ¶ The second method: ¶ Take a red-hot needle and burn the entire length of the hair from its root to the tip, while it is still attached; but be careful not to touch the skin, so that you do not cause an inflammation or other harm. ¶ The third method: ¶ Take a very fine and sharp lancet, and make two incisions in each eyelid, one on each side of the [hair], while it is still attached; and then pluck out the hair, along with its root; but be careful not to cut into any vessel. ¶ The fourth method: ¶ When a person feels that the hairs are growing or when he sees them with his eyes; then take a needle and dip it in water and sulfur, and pass it along the edge of the eyelid; but be careful not to touch the skin, so that you do not cause an inflammation or other harm.
Aut per cauterium cum igne.	 By cautery with fire.
Aut cum medicina acuta, secundum quod praemissum est in capitulo cauterii.	 With a sharp medicine, as was stated in the chapter on cautery.
Aut curatur Ataxmir per incisionem et suturam.	 Ataxia is cured by incision and suture.
Aut per cannas, secundum quod ego dicam.	 By tubes, as I will explain.
Oportet ut ponas caput infirmi in sinu tuo.	 It is necessary that you place the patient's head on your lap.
Deinde conuerte palpebram oculi manu tua sinistra.	 Then, turn back the eyelid of the eye with your left hand.
Si ergo conuertitur, bonum est.	 If it turns, that is good.
Et si non: intromitte acum in eam, in qua sit filum ab inferiori parte palpebrae, et fac penetrare acum cum filo desuper, et sit illud prope pilos ipsos, id est, prope marginem palpebrae, in quo nascuntur pili: et trahe filum ad superiora cum palpebra, et conuerte eam cum radio.	 If it does not, insert a needle into the eyelid from below, so that the thread runs over the needle and is close to the eyelashes themselves, that is, near the edge of the eyelid where the lashes are born; then draw the thread upwards with the eyelid, and turn it with a stick.
Deinde finde in interiori parte palpebrae sub pilis additis cum spatumili incidente a lachrymali maiore usque ad lachrymale minus.	 Then find within the edge of the eyelid under the lashes, by means of a spatula introduced from the greater lacrimal duct to the lesser.
Deinde extrahe filum, et pone sub palpebra puluillum paruum ex cotto, aut panno: deinde signa super palpebram cum encaustro, quod sit sicut figura folii myrti.	 Then remove the thread and place a small piece of cotton or cloth under the eyelid; then mark on the eyelid with wax in the shape of a myrtle leaf.
Verumtamen oportet, ut fit figura secundum quantitatem et eleuationem palpebrae: quoniam iam diuersificatur illud in hominibus.	 However, it is necessary that the figure be made according to the size and elevation of the eyelid, because this varies greatly among people.
Ex eis enim est, qui indiget ut incidatur ex palpebra quantitas magna, secundum quantitatem quae mollificatur a palpebra.	 Among these is one who needs a large amount of the eyelid to be cut off, according to the size that is softened by the eyelid.
Deinde cum spatumili finde super duas lineas quas signasti, et incipe a lachrymali maiore usque ad lachrymale minus, et sit fissura una prope pilos naturales, sicut est grossitudo radii.	 Then with the spatula find on the two lines that you have marked, and begin from the greater lacrimal duct to the lesser; let there be one slit near the natural lashes, as thick as a stick.
Deinde intromitte uncinum in uno duorum angulorum cutis.	 Then insert a hook into one of the two corners of the skin.  Bible
Deinde excoria ipsam totam.	 Then peel it all off.  Bible
Deinde aggrega cum sutura duo labia, cum acu et filo lana subtili: et absterge sanguinem, et fac adhaerere quod superfluit ex filis super duo supercilia, cum quibusdam rebus inuiscantibus, si uis facere illud: et si non, non cures.	 Then sew together the two lips with a needle and fine wool thread; then clean away the blood, and make the superfluous threads stick together over the two eyebrows with some adhesive substance, if you wish to do that; but if not, it is of no importance.  Bible  Bible
Deinde dimitte suturam et fila usque ad tres dies, aut quatuor: postea cura illud.	 Then leave the stitching and threads for three days, or four; afterwards care for it.
Et si uis, dimitte uulnus absque sutura, et cura ipsum cum eo, quod exsiccat et constringit.	 And if you wish, leave the wound without stitching and treat it with what dries and tightens.
Nam palpebra eleuatur apud sigillationem uulneris et aggregationem eius: sed futura est melior.	 For the eyelid is raised at the sealing of the wound and its healing; but it will be better in the future.
Hunc modum curandi Ataxmir docuerunt antiqui.	 This method of treatment ancient people taught Ataxmir.
Verumtamen in eo est sollicitudo super infirmum, et est ex bona operatione, et non est in eo timor.	 Nevertheless, there is concern for the patient in this [method], and it comes from good practice, and there is no fear [of complications] in it.
Et modus alius est in Ataxmir etiam: et est, ut signes super palpebram figuram, quae sit sicut figura folii myrti, sicut narrauimus.	 And there is another method in Ataxmir as well: and it is to make a mark on the eyelid in the shape of a myrtle leaf, as we have said.
Deinde eleua palpebram cum tribus uncinis separatis, aut aggregatis, secundum formam hanc quae sequitur, deinde incide quod superfluit cum forficibus paruis, secundum hanc formam, cum aequalitate incisionis.	 Then raise the eyelid with three separate hooks or connected together in this following shape, then cut off what is superfluous with small scissors according to this shape, maintaining equality in the cutting.  />
Si autem non est tibi possibile tenere uncinum, et non aequatur illud: tunc accipe acum in qua sit filum, et intromitte ipsum in medio figurae: et intromitte filum aliud prope lachrymale maius, et filum secundum prope lachrymale minus: et aggrega inter digitos tuos fila cum aequalitate.	 If it is not possible for you to hold the hook and make it equal, then take a needle with a thread in it and insert it into the middle of the shape; and insert another thread near the larger lacrimal [point] and a third thread near the smaller lacrimal [point]; and hold the threads together between your fingers with equality.
Deinde eleua manum tuam eleuatione aequali: et eleua cutem super quam est signatum cotum, sicut narrauimus.	 Then lift your hand with equal elevation; and lift the skin over the marked point, as we have said.  />  />  />  />
Deinde aggrega duo labia uulneris cum sutura: et cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	 Then join together the two lips of the wound with stitching; and treat it until it heals.
Si uero accidat apostema apud incisionem tuam, aut fissuram tuam: seda illud apostema cum caeroto, et his similibus, ex unguentis sedantibus.	 If an abscess occurs at your incision or cut; cauterize it with a hot iron and similar [substances] from the soothing ointments.
Et quandoque accidit palpebrae etiam, ut conuertantur pili eius.	 And sometimes it happens that the eyelashes of the eyelid also turn inwards.
Oportet ergo ut utaris in ea quod diximus in incisione: sed sutura utrisque magis est artificialis.	 Therefore, you should use what we have said about the incision [in this case]; but the stitching is more skillful for both [eyelids].
¶ De cura Ataxmir cum cannis.	 "On treating Ataxmîr with dogs.
ET Est, ut conuertas palpebram, et scindas fissuram quae est deintus, secundum quod narraui.	 "And you should turn the eyelid and cut the slit that is inside, as I have told you.
Deinde arte fac duas cannas, aut duo ligna subtilia: quarum longitudo sit secundum longitudinem palpebrae, et latitudo earum sit minor latitudine spatumilis: et tu iam incidisti in extremitatibus utriusque ab utrisque partibus ubi tenes fila.	 "Then skillfully make two reeds or two thin sticks: the length of which should be according to the length of the eyelid, and their width should be less than the width of the spatula; and you have already cut at the ends of each from both sides where you hold the threads.
Deinde aggrega utramque cum subtilitate super illud quod superfluit ex palpebra oculi, et stringe duas cannas ab utrisque partibus strictura forti, et dimitte eam diebus aliquot.	 "Then place each one with delicacy on the excess from the eyelid of the eye, and tie the two reeds from both sides with a strong binding, and leave it for several days.
Cutis enim stricta morietur, et denigrabitur, et putrefiet, donec cadet per se.	 "For the skin that is bound will die, blacken, and rot until it falls off by itself.
Si ergo tardatur, tunc incide eam cum forficibus.	 "If it is delayed, then cut it with scissors.
Deinde cura eam, donec sanetur.	 "Then treat it until it heals.
Cum ergo consolidatur, eleuatur palpebra: et non pungunt pili.	 "When it is healed, the eyelid will rise; and the hairs will not prick.
Et haec est forma duarum cannarum, quas facies secundum hanc figuram, et quantitatem in longitudinem et latitudinem.	 "And this is the shape of the two reeds that you make according to this figure and quantity in length and width.
¶ De eleuatione pilorum pungentium in oculo cum acu.	 "On raising the pricking hairs in the eye with a needle.
Caput XII.	 Chapter XII
Operatio in illo est, ut accipias acum subtilem, et intromittas in eam filum ex serico subtile, lene.	 "The operation in this case is to take a fine needle and insert into it a thread of fine, soft silk." ờ
Deinde aggreges extremitates eius, et nodes utramque nodo subtili ualde: et sit longitudo filorum palmus unus.	 "Then gather the ends together and tie each one with a very fine knot; and let the length of the thread be about four inches.
Deinde compone in Alinxotati filum aliud subtile sub eo in breui, et noda extremitates eius si uis.	 "Then place another fine thread under it briefly, and tie its ends if you wish.
Deinde ponat infirmus caput suum in sinu tuo, et sit prope solem ut declaretur operatio: quoniam est operatio subtilis, uel minuta.	 "Then let the patient place his head in your lap, and let it be near sunlight to illuminate the work; for this is a delicate or fine operation.
Deinde intromitte acum cum alinxotati in radicem palpebrae, et fac eam penetrare in palpebram festinanter, donec extrahas eam desuper pilum naturalem.	 "Then insert the needle with the thread into the root of the eyelid and make it penetrate quickly into the eyelid until you extract it above the natural hair.
Deinde trahe pilum usque supra alinxotati: et intromitte in alinxotati illum pilum: si est unus, aut duo, aut tres, non plures.	 Then pull the thread up over the stitches; and introduce that thread into the stitches, if it is one, or two, or three, no more.
Deinde trahe manum tuam cum eo, donec egrediatur pilus cum alinxotati in palpebra cum pilo naturali.	 Then pull your hand with it, until the thread comes out with the stitches on the eyelid with the natural hair.
Si autem trahatur alinxotati, et non egrediatur pilus cum ea: trahes alinxotati ad inferiora, cum filo quod tu composuisti in ea, donec egrediatur alinxotati ex foramine superiori, et uideas eam uisione oculi: tunc enim trahes alinxotati, et filum: et extrahe utraque, et claude oculum: et dimitte ipsum clausum duobus diebus, aut tribus, donec adhaereat pilus loco suo, et nascatur super ipsum caro.	 But if the stitches are pulled out and the thread does not come out with them, pull the stitches downwards along with the thread that you sewed into them, until the stitches come out of the upper hole, and you see it by the eye's sight; then indeed pull the stitches and the thread, and remove both, and close the eye, and leave it closed for two days or three, until the hair adheres to its place, and flesh grows over it.
Quod si pilus est breuis, tunc aut associa ei pilum longum ex pilis naturalibus, et eleuatur cum eo: aut dimitte ipsum, donec elongetur post spacium, et tunc eleua ipsum.	 But if the hair is short, then either join to it a long hair from the natural hairs and raise it with that; or leave it alone until it lengthens after some time, and then raise it up.
¶ De cura Alxatrati quae accidit in palpebra superiori.	 About the care of the entropion which occurs in the upper eyelid.
Caput XIII.	 Chapter 13.
Quando accidit oculo haec Alxatrati, nominatur Leporina.	 When this entropion happens to the eye, it is called leporine.
Et haec Alxatrati est aut naturalis, aut accidentalis.	 And this entropion is either natural or accidental.
Accidentalis ergo fit ex consolidatione uulneris, aut sectionis, aut cauterii, et similium illis.	 The accidental one occurs from the healing of a wound, or a cut, or a cautery, and similar things.
Et modus operationis in ea est, ut tu findas illam consolidationem, et ut separes labia eius, et ponas in eo quod est inter ea licinium ex lino, et liges eam, donec sanetur.	 And the method of operating on it is that you cut open that healed area and separate its lips, and place between them a wick of linen, and bind it until it heals.
Et non oportet, ut utaris in curatione eius rebus quae exiccant et constringunt: nam si tu facis illud, redit Alxatrati deterior quam fuit: imo utere in ea rebus quae mollificant, sicut foenumgraecum: et embroca cum aqua, in qua cocta sit althea, semen lini: et unguento dyaquilon, quod liquefactum sit cum aliquo ex oleis: et inuolue cum eo licinium, et cura cum eo.	 And you should not use in its cure things that dry and constrict, for if you do this, the entropion returns worse than before. Indeed, use on it things that soften, such as fenugreek; and a poultice with water in which mallow, flax seed, and dyaquilon ointment melted with some of the oils have been cooked; and wrap with it a wick, and treat with it. ›
Et thesaurus curationis tuae est, ut coneris omni ingenio, ut non consolidetur, secundum formam quae fuit in primis.	 And the treasure of your treatment is that you strive with all skill, lest it consolidate according to the form which was in the first place.
Et haec quidem operatio quam diximus, non est nisi quaedam rectificatio Alxatrati, ut non redeat forma loci secundum quod fuit omnino.	 And this operation that I have mentioned is nothing but a correction of the alcatrat, so that the form of the place does not return completely to what it was before.
¶ De cura Alxatrati quae fit in palpebra inferiori, et est rugatio uel contractio sursum ad dextrum et sinistrum.	 About the care for alcatrat that occurs on the lower eyelid, which is a wrinkle or contraction upward to the right and left.
Caput XIIII.	 Chapter XIV
Haec Alxatrati quae fit inferius, est quae uere nominatur Alxatrati.	 This alcatrat that occurs below is what is truly called alcatrat.
Et est naturalis, et est accidentalis.	 And it is natural and it is accidental.
Et accidentalis fit ex uulnere, aut fissura, aut cauterio, et illis similibus.	 And the accidental one occurs from a wound, or tear, or branding, and similar things.
Et uia operationis in ea est, ut accipias acum, in qua sit filum duplum, et tingas eam in carnem, et facias eam penetrare a lachrymali sinistro usque ad lachrymale dextrum, donec perueniat filum in duabus extremitatibus carnis.	 And the way to operate on it is that you take a needle in which there is a double thread, and dip it into the flesh, and make it penetrate from the left tear duct to the right tear duct, until the thread reaches both ends of the flesh.
Deinde extende carnem ad superiora cum acu, et incide eam cum spatumili lato.	 Then stretch the skin upward with a needle and cut it with a broad scalpel.  />
Si ergo redit figura palpebrae secundum quod oportet, est bonum.	 Therefore, if the shape of the eyelid returns as it should, that is good.  />
Et si non, accipe radium, et pone ipsum in fissuram, et conuerte cum eo palpebram: et finde duas fissuras in latere interiore palpebrae, et sint extremitates duarum fissurarum ex duobus angulis incisionis, donec concurrant et fiat ex eis angulus: donec quando aggregantur fiat figura earum haec figura, et est litera lauda graeca.	 And if not, take a thread and place it in the tear, and turn the eyelid with it; and find two tears on the inner side of the eyelid, and let the ends of the two tears be from the two corners of the incision until they meet and form a corner: until when they are gathered together this shape is formed, which is in the form of the Greek letter lambda.
Deinde aufer illam carnem per quantitatem, quod est latus eius acutum inferius, ab eo quod sequitur palpebram.	 Then remove that skin to the extent that its lower sharp side extends from where the eyelid follows.
Deinde aggrega partes separatas: sue eam cum filo lanae.	 Then bring together the separated parts, or sew it with a wool thread.
Deinde cura eas cum eo quod diximus, de medicinis mollificantibus, et liciniis, donec sanentur.	 Then treat them with what we have said about softening ointments and compresses until they heal.
Et si Alxatrati accidat ex fissura, et sutura, aut cauterio: tunc oportet ut findas fissura plana sub pilis palpebrarum, etiam secundum quod praecessit.	 And if it happens to the Xatrati due to a tear or stitching, or cauterization, then you should split the tear smoothly under the eyelashes, just as was mentioned before.
Deinde separa inter duo labia cum licinio, secundum quod diximus.	 Then separate between the two lips with a probe, as we have said.
Et summa sermonis de cura Alxatrati, quando est desuper, aut inferius, est, ut currat in ea operatio, secundum quod praeparatur ex forma Alxatrati.	 And the main point about caring for the Xatrati, whether it is above or below, is that the operation should proceed according to the form of the Xatrati.
Ipsa namque est multarum diuersitatum in forma: et artifex prudens praeparat ingenium cum quocunque modo est possibile ei, donec redire faciat figuram ad formam naturalem, aut prope eam, et ipsemet infirmus, secundum quod conuenit ei ex operatione et instrumentis in plurimis dispositionibus.	 For it is of many different forms: and a skilled craftsman prepares his ingenuity in whatever way is possible for him, until he makes the figure return to its natural form or very close to it, and the patient himself, according to what suits him from the operation and instruments in numerous arrangements.
¶ De adhaerentia palpebrae oculi cum coniunctiua, aut cornea.	 About the adherence of the eyelid to the conjunctiva or cornea.
Caput XV.	 Chapter 15.
Quandoque accidit haec consolidatio multis hominibus, ita ut consolidetur palpebra superior cum albedine oculi, et prohibeat ipsum ab operationibus suis naturalibus.	 It sometimes happens to many people that the upper eyelid adheres to the white of the eye and prevents it from performing its natural functions.
Oportet ergo quod intromittas extremitatem radii sub palpebra, et eleues eam sursum: aut extendas eam cum uncino: deinde incide adhaerentiam cum spatumili subtili, quod non sit cum acuitate incisionis spatumilium, imo sit obtusum parumper: ut non inquietetur infirmus apud operationem, et remoueatur spatumile, et laedat oculum cum acuitate sua: et sit incisio tua quasi tu excories illam adhaerentiam cum facilitate, donec quando redit palpebra secundum formam suam naturalem, et sanetur adhaerentia tota.	 Therefore, you should insert the tip of a probe under the eyelid and lift it up, or extend it with a hook; then cut the adhesion with a fine spatula that is not sharp like other spatulas, but rather blunt slightly, so that the patient is not disturbed during the operation, and the spatula is removed and does not harm the eye with its sharpness. And your incision should be as if you were easily excising that adhesion until, when the eyelid returns to its natural form, the entire adhesion heals.
Funde tunc in oculum aquam salsam, cum aqua ablue ipsum: aut distilla in ipsum ex sief facto, ex ziniar dissoluto cum aqua.	 Then irrigate the eye with salty water and wash it with plain water, or distill into it from a sieve made of crushed juniper berries mixed with water.
Deinde separa inter palpebram et oculum cum licinio lini: et pone super oculum lanam infusam cum albugine oui: et post diem tertium utere sief, et cum solidatiuis, donec sanetur.	 Then separate the eyelid from the eye with a linen probe. And place over the eye a wool compress soaked in egg white. And on the third day use a sieve and patches until it heals.
¶ De incisione ungulae et eminentiae carnis lachrymarum.	 Of the incision of the nail and prominence of the tear-duct flesh.
Caput XVI.	 Chapter XVI.
Scias, quod ungula est secundum duos modos.	 Know that the nail is according to two modes.
Aut est neruosa: et est similis sifac duro, subtili.	 Or it is sinew-like, and it is similar to silica, hard and fine. 》
Aut est non neruosa, similis humiditati congelatae albae: quae quando tangit cam ferrum, aut conaris capere eam cum uncino, abscinditur, et non figitur in ea uncinus.	 Or it is not sinew-like, similar to frozen white moisture; when you touch it with iron or try to grasp it with a hook, it breaks off and the hook does not stick into it.
Et utraeque species non incipiunt, nisi a lachrymali maiore, usquequo uadit paulatim, donec cooperit uisum, et prohibet lumen, et motum oculi.	 And both types do not grow except from the larger tear-duct, until it gradually reaches the eye and covers the sight, blocking light and the movement of the eye.
Et modus operandi in incisione eius est: ut ponat infirmus caput suum in sinu tuo.	 And the way to operate in its incision is that the patient places his head in your bosom. 》 》 》 》 》 》 》 》 》 》 》 》 》
Deinde aperi oculos eius, et eleua palpebram manu tua.	 Then open the patient's eyes and lift the eyelid with your hand.
Deinde collige ungulam cum uncino paucae duplationis, et extende eam ad superiora.	 Then collect the nail with a small hook and extend it upwards.
Deinde accipe acum, et intromitte in eam pilum ex pilis equi, et bouis, aut uaccae: et sit filum forte, et duplica extremitatem acus parumper, et fige eam in medio ungulae: et penetra eam cum acu, et liga cum filo ungulam, et extende eam ad superiora: et excoria cum pilo latus ungulae quod sequitur pupillam, ac si tu serres eam cum pilo usque ad postreimnum eius.	 Then take a needle and insert into it a horsehair, or cow hair, or goat hair; and let the thread be strong and double the end of the needle slightly, and fix it in the middle of the nail. And penetrate with the needle and bind the nail with the thread and extend it upwards; and scrape off with the hair the side of the nail that follows the pupil, as if you were sewing it with the hair to its end. 》 》 》 》 》 》 》 》 》 》 》 》 》
Deinde incide residuum in radice lachrymalis cum spatumili subtili, aut cum forficibus paruis: et dimitte carnem lachrymalis naturalem, ut non accidat ex incisione eius cursus lachrymarum assiduus.	 Then cut the remaining part at the root of the tear-duct with a fine spatula or small scissors; and leave the tear-duct flesh in its natural state so that from cutting it, the flow of tears does not occur continuously.
Et quandoque extenditur ungula cum uncino solo: aut cum filo, sicut diximus.	 And sometimes the nail is extended with only a hook; or with thread, as we have said.
Deinde excoriatur cum spatumili leni, cuius haec est forma.	 Then it is scraped with a soft spathame, like this one.
Et caue, ne tangat spatumile tunicam corneam, et accidat in ea ruptura, et perforetur pupilla.	 And be careful that the spathame does not touch the corneal membrane, lest a tear occurs and the pupil is pierced.
Deinde post incisionem, proice in oculum aliquid salis contriti, aut ex sief facto ex ziniar, et dimitte ipsum usque ad diem alium.	 Then after the incision, cast into the eye some crushed salt or a sieved powder of ziniar, and let it remain until another day.
Deinde cura ipsum cum eo quod oportet, usquequo sanetur.	 Then care for him with what is needed until he is healed.
Quod si ungula est non neruosa, et non potes intromittere in eam acum, neque figitur in ea uncinus, tunc multotiens curatur haec species ungulae cum medicinis, et sanatur sicut narraui in diuisione.	 But if the nail is not fleshy and you cannot insert a needle into it or secure a hook within it, then this type of nail can be treated many times with medicines, and it heals as I have narrated in the section on division.
Quod si uis incidere eam, tunc aperi oculum infirmi, et accipe spatumile subtile, lene, debilis acuitatis, secundum hanc formam.	 But if you wish to cut it, then open the eye of the patient, and take a soft, gentle, weakly sharpened spathame according to this form.  />
Et rade ungulam desuper rasione cum subtilitate.	 And scrape away the nail from above with finesse and delicacy.
Quod si uides quod ipsa rarificatur et confringitur, et imprimit in eam rasio, tunc distilla ex hora tua in oculum ex sief facto ex ziniar, aut ex sief rubeo, aut sale trito: et opila oculum usque ad diem alium.	 But if you see that it is becoming thin and crumbles away and the scraping leaves an impression upon it, then pour into the eye at the hour of sleep a sieved powder of ziniar or a sieved red powder or crushed salt: and fill the eye until another day.
Deinde itera super ipsam operationem, donec remoueatur totum eius.	 Then repeat this procedure upon it, until all of it is removed.
Nisi contrarium sit tibi in oculo apostema calidum: tunc enim dimitte ipsam, et cura apostema, donec sanetur.	 Unless there is a hot abscess in the eye: then leave it alone and treat the abscess until it heals.
Deinde itera operationem super ipsam cum rasione, donec sanetur.	 Then repeat the procedure upon it with finesse until it heals.  />
Eminentia autem carnis lachrymalis, si nocet in oculo nocumento magno, suspendatur cum uncino, et incide ex ea partem eius: et non ultimes incisionem, ut non accidat cursus lachrymarum.	 But if the prominence of the tear gland causes great harm in the eye, it should be hooked and a portion of it cut away with a hook: and do not complete the incision, so that the flow of tears does not stop.
Deinde stilla in lachrymale sief rubeum, aut factum ex ziniari, donec sanetur.	 Then drip into the tear duct a sieved red powder or one made from ziniar, until it heals.
¶ De incisione Alguardenic, et carne nata in oculo.	 In cutting Alguardenic and the flesh that grows on the eye.
Caput XVII.	 Chapter XVII.
Nascitur quandoque in quibusdam oculis hominum caro rubea composita, uel superposita, donec cooperit pupillam, aut appropinquat, aut stringit super palpebras, et fortasse conuertit palpebras ad exteriora: et assimilatur rosae balaustinae.	 Sometimes in the eyes of certain people a red fleshy growth appears, either composed or laid on top, until it covers the pupil or approaches and presses upon the eyelids, and perhaps turns the eyelids outward: and it resembles the stem of a rose.
Et operatio in ea etiam est, ut ponat infirmus caput suum in sinu tuo.	 And the operation on this is also that the patient places his head in your lap.
Deinde aperi oculos eius, et collige illam carnem totam cum uncinis conuenientibus ad illud: et tene illud cum forcipe uno, aut gesti.	 Then open his eyes and collect all that flesh with suitable hooks; and hold it with one forceps or tweezers.
Deinde incide carnem in primis, donec finiatur totum eius cum incisorio.	 Then first cut the flesh until you have completed its entirety with a scalpel.
Et caue ab oculo, ut non laedas ipsum apud operationem: et sit incisio tua qua ipsam incidis, aut cum spatumili, quod narrauimus in incisione ungulae: aut cum forficibus paruis, cum quibus colligitur asebel, secundum quod ueniet forma eius post hoc capitulum.	 And be careful not to harm the eye during the operation; and let your incision by which you cut it be either with a lancet, as we have said in the cutting of the nail, or with small forceps, with which asebel is collected, as will be shown in the following chapter.
Cum ergo completur incisio tua, et remouetur tota alguardenici, tunc imple oculum ex sale contrito: aut distilla in eum puluerem rubeum, et similia illi ex medicinis corrosiuis: et pone super oculum deforis cottum cum albugine oui: ut securetur ab apostemate calido.	 When therefore your incision is completed and all of the Alguardenic is removed, then fill the eye with crushed salt; or pour into it red powder and similar corrosive medicines; and place on top of the eye a poultice made from the white of an egg: so that it may be protected from hot inflammation. ️
Quod si remanet ex alguardenici aliquid, et dominatur tibi sanguis calidus, et times apostema calidum: tunc dimitte oculum, et cura ipsum cum eo quod sedat apostema.	 But if something remains of the Alguardenic and you are dominated by hot blood and fear a hot inflammation, then leave the eye alone, and care for it with that which settles inflammation.
Deinde itera super ipsum cum operatione, donec sanetur.	 Then repeat the procedure on it until it heals.
Et similiter fac cum carne addita quae accidit in oculo ex hac specie.	 And do similarly with additional flesh that happens to appear in the eye of this kind.
Verumtamen oportet, ut alienes curationem omnis oculi debilis ex uia naturali, aut ex uia accidentali, operando cum ferro: et non intromittas manum tuam in aliqua harum operationum, donec uideas, quod illud membrum est tolerans illam operationem.	 However, it is necessary that a stranger should perform the cure of every weakened eye either by natural means or by accidental means, operating with iron; and do not put your hand in any of these operations until you see that this member can bear that operation.
¶ De collectione Sebel ex oculo.	 About collecting seed from the eye.
Caput XVIII.	 Chapter Eighteen.
Sebel sunt uenae rubeae quae texuntur super oculum, et prohibent uisui operationem suam: et debilitant oculum cum longitudine dierum.	 The seed are red veins that cover the eye and prevent it from functioning properly: they weaken the eye over time.
Necesse est ergo tibi in primis, ut consideres, si oculus in quo est Sebel, est fortis, et non est in eo aegritudo aliqua, praeter Sebel: tunc collige Sebel eius.	 Therefore, it is necessary for you first to consider whether the eye with the seed is strong and has no other disease besides the seed: then collect the seed from that eye.
Et est, ut praecipias infirmo, ut ponat caput suum in sinu tuo.	 And instruct the patient to place their head in your lap. ️
Deinde suspende illas uenas cum uncino uno, aut duobus secundum prudentiam tuam: et sit uncinus subtilis duplationis, secundum hanc formam, aut sint duo uncini gradat in corpore uno, secundum hanc formam.	 Then hang those veins with one or two hooks according to your discretion; and let the hook be thin and double-edged, like this shape, or there may be two hooks on a single body, like this shape.
Deinde collige cum forficibus subtilibus illas uenas cum subtilitate, et absterge sanguinem hora post horam, donec uideas illas uenas remoueri ex oculo, et resoluuntur: et caue ne laedas oculum cum extremitatibus spatumilis.	 Then collect those veins with fine scissors carefully, and wipe away the blood hour by hour, until you see those veins removed from the eye and loosened; and be careful not to damage the eye with the tips of the forceps.
Et sit operatio tua in meridie coram sole, et sis firmus in operatione tua ualde: ut non incidas nisi illas uenas.	 And let your procedure be at midday in the sunlight, and be very steady in your work: so that you do not cut anything but those veins.
Et cum tu expleueris, tunc distilla in oculum sief uiride, aut rubeum: ut sua acuitate corrodat quod remansit ex sebel.	 And when you have finished, then drop into the eye a green or red juice: so that its sharpness can corrode what remains of the seed.
Si autem non est tibi possibile colligere illud totum in illa hora, tunc emplastra oculum cum eo, quod sedat dolorem oculi: et dimitte ipsum diebus aliquot, donec sedetur dolor eius: et securetur ab apostemate calido: deinde itera super ipsum secundum modum eundem, donec sanetur.	 But if you are not able to collect all of it in that time, then apply a bandage to the eye with something that will soothe the pain of the eye; and leave him for several days until the pain subsides and is released from the warm swelling: then repeat on him according to the same method until he is healed. ️ ‍
Et haec est forma forficis.	 And this is the shape of the forceps.
¶ De reductione Arissati ad nasum.	 About reducing a broken nose.
Caput XIX.	 Chapter Nineteen.
Nominant medici Arissati Fistulam, quam curas cum cauterio, aut cum medicina acuta comburente, secundum quod praecessit eius narratio.	 Doctors call the broken nose a fistula, which you treat with a cautery or sharp medicine that burns, as its previous account has described.
Et si non sanatur, tunc non est ingenium in ea: nisi ut findas super apostema apud natiuitatem eius, et extrahas totam humiditatem quae est in eo et pus, donec detegatur os.	 And if it does not heal, then there is no cure for it; unless you pierce above the abscess at its birthplace, and draw out all the moisture and pus that is in it until the mouth (of the abscess) is uncovered.
Cum ergo detegitur os, et uides in eo corruptionem, aut nigredinem, tunc rade ipsum cum instrumento, cuius forma est haec.	 When therefore the mouth is uncovered and you see corruption or blackness in it, then scrape it with an instrument of this shape.
Et nominatur Asperi capitis.	 And it is called "Rough Cap.
Fiat ex ferro indo, et sit caput eius rotundum sicut azir, quod sit punctatum punctatione limae, aut punctatione aliskilferi punctatione subtili: et pone ipsum super locum corruptum ossis.	 Let it be made of Indian iron and let its head be round like a needle and have the punctuation of a file or very fine awl puncturation, and place it on the corrupted bone site.
Deinde reuolue ipsum inter digitos tuos, et tu preme manum tuam parumper, donec scias quod illa corruptio iam rasa est: et fac illud aliquotiens.	 Then turn it between your fingers and press with your hand a little while until you know that the corruption is already scraped off; and do this several times.
Deinde restaura locum cum medicinis exiccatiuis stipticis.	 Then restore the site with drying, styptic medicines.
Si ergo consolidatur locus, et nascitur in eo caro, et abscinditur cursus saniei: et remanet quadraginta diebus, et non renouatur, et non apostematur, et non accidit in eo accidens: tunc scias quia iam sanatus est.	 If the site then becomes solid and flesh grows on it, and the flow of pus is cut off; and it remains for forty days without renewing, or forming an abscess, and nothing else happens to it, then know that it has already been healed.
Et si non, tunc non est in eo ingenium, nisi reducere fistulam ad foramen nasi, secundum hanc formam.	 And if not, then there is no cure for it, unless you bring the fistula to the nostril opening, in this way.
Et est, ut detegas ab osse secundo cum ferro, aut cum medicina acuta: et cum detectum est os, tunc accipe terebrum secundum hanc formam, sit extremitas ferrea, triangulata: et lignum eius sit pyramis extenuata usque ad extremitatem, sicut uides.	 And it is, that you uncover the bone with a knife or sharp medicine; and when the mouth is uncovered, then take a borer of this shape, its tip should be iron and triangular; and let its wood be a tapered pyramid up to the tip as you see.  ()
Deinde pone illud super os ipsum: et sit illud prope lachrymale: et elonga manum tuam ab oculo parum.	 Then place it on the mouth itself; and let it be near the lacrimal; and move your hand a little away from the eye.
Deinde reuolue manum tuam cum terebro, donec penetret os, et sentiat illud infirmus: per hoc quod inuenit uentum exire ex eo, quando tenet manum suam super nasum suum.	 Then turn your hand with the borer until it penetrates the mouth and the patient feels it; by this means he finds wind coming out of him when he places his hand on his nose.
Ergo tunc restaura locum cum medicinis stipticis exiccantibus, sicut docui te.	 Therefore, then restore the place with astringent drying medicines, as I have taught you.
Cum ergo nascitur caro, et induratur locus: tunc materia quae effundebatur ad exteriora, redit ad nasum: est ergo leuius illud super infirmum.	 When the flesh is born and the place becomes hardened, then the material that was flowing out to the outside returns to the nose; therefore it is lighter on the sick person.
¶ De reductione eminentiae Oculi.	 ¶ On the Reduction of Protrusion of the Eye.
Caput XX.	 Chapter 20
Quando eminet Oculus cum totalitate sua, et non accidit in uisu nocumentum, neque diminutio: tunc oportet ut soluas infirmum: deinde phlebotomes eum: postea ponas uentosas in ceruice absque scarificatione, sed cum suctione.	 When the eye protrudes completely but there is no damage or decrease in vision, then it is necessary that you release the sick person; afterwards bleed him; then place cupping glasses on his neck without scarification, but with suction.
Deinde pone super Oculum linimentum quod fit ex acacia, et aloe, et olibano, et sarcocolla.	 Then apply to the eye a salve made from acacia, aloe, frankincense, and colophony.
Deinde stringe Oculum desuper super emplastrum cum puluillis multis.	 Then bind the eye on top of the plaster with many little poultices.
Et modus puluillorum est: ut accipias pannos lenes, multos, et duplicetur omnis pannus ex eis super quatuor: fac ex eis multos: deinde pone eos unum super alium, secundum quantitatem qua indiget Oculus: deinde stringe super ipsos cum panno duro strictura forti.	 And the method of making poultices is as follows: take many soft cloths and double each one over four times; make many of them; then place one on top of another according to the amount that the eye needs; then bind them with a hard cloth tightly.
Et itera uentosas cum suctione sine scarificatione.	 And repeat the cupping glasses with suction without scarification.
Deinde aufer uentosas, et dimitte oculum strictum die et nocte.	 Then remove the cupping glasses and leave the eye bound day and night.
Si autem ligamentum iterum mollificatur, tunc oportet ut stringatur multum: deinde aufer ligamentum post diem et noctem, sicut diximus.	 But if the bandage becomes soft again, then it is necessary to bind it tightly; then remove the bandage after a day and a night, as we have said.
Si ergo uides oculum iam redisse uuae tunicae, est bonum: et si non, tunc itera emplastrum, et puluillos, et stricturam, et uentosas, donec sanetur.	 If you see the eye has returned to its normal appearance, that is good; and if not, then repeat the plaster, poultices, bandage, and cupping glasses until it heals.
¶ De incisionie Vuae tunicae.	 ¶ On the Incision of the Eye's Tunic
Caput XXI.	 Chapter 21
Quando accidit disruptio in tunica Vuea, deinde eminet et procedit extra palpebras sicut granum Vuae, et foedatur forma hominis propter illud, et uis incidere illud: tunc operatio in eo est, secundum quod narro: et est, ut intromittas acum in radice Vuae ab inferiori ad superiorem partem.	 When a disruption occurs in the eye's tunic and it protrudes from the eyelids like a grain of the eye, and it disfigures the appearance of the person because of this, and you wish to incise it, then the operation on it is as I will narrate: and it is, that you introduce a needle in the root of the eye from below to above.
Deinde intromitte acum aliam in qua sit filum duplum a parte lachrymalis, et fac eam penetrare: et dimitte acum primam secundum dispositionem suam.	 Then introduce another needle with twice as much thread from the tear duct, and make it penetrate; and leave the first needle in place according to its position.
Deinde incide locum fili dupli, et liga cum eo partem Vuae in circumitu acus: et stringe eam multum.	 Then cut the place of the double thread, and tie it around the edge of the vein in a circle; and tighten it very much.
Deinde extrahe acum, et pone super oculum lanam infusam in albugine oui: et dimitte eum, donec cadat filum cum Vua.	 Then remove the needle, and place on the eye a piece of wool soaked in the white of an egg; and leave it until the thread falls out with the vein.
Deinde cura oculum cum eo, quod confortat ipsum, donec sanetur uulnus.	 Then take care of the eye with what strengthens it, until the wound heals.
Et quandoque stringitur Vua ab omni parte cum circulo ex panno, donec addat oculus eminentiam magnam.	 And sometimes the vein is tightened from all sides with a circle of cloth, until the eye grows very prominent.
Deinde perforetur cum spatumili subtili, quod perueniat ad profundum oculi, et currat humiditas albuginea, et descendat oculus, et ingrediatur statim: deinde stringe eum, donec sanetur.	 Then it is pierced with a fine needle so that it reaches to the depth of the eye, and the white moisture runs out, and the eye descends; then tie it immediately; then tighten it until it heals.
¶ De curatione Alcomnati.	 § On the treatment of trachoma.
Caput XXII.	 Chapter 22
Haec Aegritudo quae nominatur Alcomnati, non, est nisi sanies, quae aggregatur in oculo, similis aquae descendenti, et non est ipsa.	 This disease called trachoma is nothing but pus that gathers in the eye, similar to water dripping down; and it is not itself.
Et modus operandi in ea est, ut facias sedere infirmum super sedem praeparatum, uel directum.	 And the method of working on it is as follows: make the patient sit on a prepared or straight seat. 
Deinde accipe caput eius manibus tuis a partibus duabus, et moue ipsum, donec uideas saniem peruenire ad inferiora oculis tuis.	 Then take his head with both your hands and move it until you see the pus come to the lower parts of your eyes.
Deinde figatur, et non descendat, et absoluatur lumen: et uideat infirmus res sicut uidebat: et si non descendit inferius, scias quia est aqua.	 Then it remains still and does not go down, and the light is released; and the patient sees things as he used to see them; and if it has not gone below, know that it is water.
Si autem non praeparatur descensus saniei cum eo quod diximus, tunc fac sedere infirmum inter manus tuas.	 But if the descent of the pus does not prepare with what we have said, then make the patient sit between your hands.
Deinde accipe spatumile subtile, et finde cum eo supra panniculum corneum parumper apud continuationem coniunctiuae cum tunica cornea in corona, donec egrediatur sanies.	 Then take a fine needle and pierce with it above the small piece of skin for a short time at the junction of the conjunctiva with the corneal membrane, until the pus comes out.
Cum ergo egreditur, tunc distilla in oculum aquam calidam in qua miscuisti mel: aut aquam in qua iam bullisti foenumgraecum et mel: deinde curetur cum reliqua curatione, donec sanetur.	 When he exits, then drip warm water into the eye to which you have added honey; or water in which you have boiled fenugreek and honey; then treat with the rest of the treatment until it is healed.
¶ De cura aquae, quae descendit in oculo, uel cataracta.	 § On the care of water that has descended into the eye, or cataract.
Caput XXIII.	 Chapter 23.
Iam Diximus species aquae in diuisione, et quae conuenit ad perforandum sermone declarante et exponente, tunc accipe illud idem secundum sanitatem.	 We have already mentioned the types of water in the division, and that which is suitable for making an opening, as declared and expounded by speech, then take the same according to health.
Tunc ergo oportet ut facias sedere infirmum inter manus tuas quadratum, oppositum lumini, prope solem: et liga oculum eius sanum, et stringe eum ualde: deinde palpebram oculi eius manu tua dextra, si oculus in quo est aqua, est oculus sinister: aut manu tua sinistra, si oculus est dexter.	 Therefore, it is necessary for you to make the sick person sit between your hands facing the window towards the sun: and bind his healthy eye, and tie it very tightly; then with your right hand, hold the eyelid of his eye if the eye containing water is the left eye; or with your left hand, if the eye is the right one.
Deinde accipe manu tua dextra almagda, si oculus est sinister: aut manu tua sinistra, si oculus est dexter.	 Then take almagda in your right hand if the eye is left; or in your left hand, if the eye is right.
Deinde pone extremitatem almagda prope coronam per grossitudinem radii in ipsa albedine oculi apparente lachrymalis minoris: deinde impelle almagda cum uirtute: et tu reuoluis cum eo manum tuam, donec penetret in albuginem oculi: et sentias, quod almagda iam peruenit ad rem uacuam.	 Then place the end of the almagda near the crown with a thickness equal to that of a ray on the white part of the eye where the tear duct appears; then push the almagda with force; and you turn your hand with it, until it penetrates into the white of the eye: and you feel that the almagda has already reached an empty space. ¶
Et oportet, ut sit mensura itineris almagda ad profundum, mensura spacii quod est a pupilla usque ad finem nigredinis: et est corona oculi.	 And the measure of the journey of the almagda to the depth should be the measure of the space that is from the pupil until the end of the blackness; and this is the crown of the eye.
Uidebis enim ea in ipsa pupilla uisione oculi, propter claritatem tunicae corneae.	 For you will see it in the very pupil of the eye's vision because of the clarity of the corneal membrane.
Deinde pone almagda usque ad locum in quo est aqua.	 Then place the almagda to the point where the water is located.
Deinde preme ipsum inferius uice una post aliam.	 Then press it down with one force after another. ¶
Si ergo descendit aqua statim, tunc infirmus uidet illud super quod aperit uisum suum statim, et almagda in oculo suo.	 If the water descends immediately, then the sick person sees that immediately on which he opens his eyesight, and almagda in his eye.
Deinde quiescas paululum.	 Then rest for a little while.
Si ergo descendat aqua, tunc depone eam secundo, praeter quod egrediatur almagda.	 Therefore, if the water descends, then remove it secondly, except that almagda comes out.
Quando ergo figitur, et non ascendit: tunc extrahe almagda cum facilitate: et tu reuoluis manum tuam paulatim.	 Therefore, when it sticks and does not rise, then remove the almagda easily; and you slowly turn your hand.
Deinde dissolue in aqua aliquid ex sale claro gemmae: et ablue cum eo oculum deintus.	 Then dissolve some clear rock salt in water and wash the eye with it inside.
Deinde pone extra oculum totum stuppam, aut lanam infusam oleo rosato, et albugine oui: et liga cum eo oculum sanum.	 Then place outside the eye the entire flax or wool soaked in rose oil and egg white, and bind it with a healthy eye.
Nos autem, et illi qui sunt nostri temporis, ponimus super eum ciminum tritum cum albumine oui.	 We, however, and those of our time, place on it ground barley with egg white.
Quod si non obedit tibi almagda ad introitum in oculum propter duriciem suam, quoniam ex hominibus est, cuius oculus est durus ualde: tunc oportet ut accipias spatumile, quod nominatur Alberid, cuius haec est forma.	 But if the almagda does not obey you when entering the eye because of its hardness, since it is from a human whose eye is very hard, then you must take an instrument called "spatamile," which looks like this:
Pefora ergo cum eo ipsam coniunctiuam tantum, et non ultimes manum tuam in foramine: et non est nisi ut facias uiam ad almagda locum subtilem.	 Therefore, prick with it only the conjunctiva and do not extend your hand into the opening; and you should make a subtle path to the almagda's place.
Deinde intromitte almagda, secundum quod diximus.	 Then introduce the almagda, as we have said.
Et apud complementum operis tui, praeparetur infirmo dormitorium decenter factum, in quo dormiat super dorsum suum in domo tenebrosa: et prohibeatur ab omnibus motibus, et a tussi: et pone cibum eius illud quo lenitur natura eius: et non moueat caput suum dextra, neque sinistra omnino.	 And at the end of your work, let there be prepared for the sick person a well-made bed, in which he may sleep on his back in a dark house; and he shall be kept from all movements and from coughing; and give him food by which his nature is soothed; and let him not move his head at all to the right or left.
Et sit ligamentum secundum dispositionem suam usque ad diem tertium.	 And let the bandage be according to its arrangement until the third day.
Deinde solue illud in illa domo tenebrosa, et experire uisum eius: et fac eum uidere res.	 Then remove it in that dark house, and test his eyesight; and make him see things. 》
Deinde reduc ligamentum usque ad diem septimum.	 Then bring back the ligament until the seventh day.
Et non oportet ut faciat illud in hora curationis, aut post incisionem statim: imo oportet, ut alienes illud: propterea quod aqua ascendit uelociter per aspectum uehementem.	 And it is not necessary that he do this at the time of the treatment or immediately after the incision; rather, it should be avoided because water rises quickly through a strong gaze.
Si autem accidit apostema calidum: tunc oportet ut soluas oculum ante septimum: et rectifica illud cum eo quod sedat apostema, donec sedatur: tunc absolue ipsius uisum, et pone super faciem eius orale quo regatur uisus eius sub eo diebus aliquot, ipso existente in illa domo tenebrosa.	 But if a hot aposteme occurs, then it is necessary to loosen the eye before the seventh day and correct it with something that will calm the aposteme until it calms down; then absolve the sight of it, and place an orale on its face to regulate the sight under it for several days, while he remains in that dark house.
Deinde egrediatur a domo gradatim, et conuersetur in casis suis.	 Then let him go out from the house gradually, and turn to his usual activities.
Et scias, quod in zaltea non excusatur discipulus a uisione aliquotiens: tunc enim audeat super operationem.	 And know that in salt water, the student is not excused from frequent vision; then he may dare to proceed with the operation.
Et iam quidem peruenit ad nos quidam ex illis qui sunt de Alayrach, qui dixit, quod factum fuit in Alayrach magdan perforatum, quo sugitur aqua.	 And indeed there came to us a certain one of those who are from Aleppo, who said that in Aleppo a magdan was pierced, through which water is sucked out.
Verum ergo non uidi aliquem in terra uostra, qui fecerit illud: neque legi illud in aliquo ex libris antiquorum: et est possibile, ut sit illud nouum.	 But truly I have not seen anyone in your land who has done this; nor have I read of it in any of the ancient books; and it is possible that it is new.
Et istae sunt formae specierum ex magda, ut stet super ea qui ea ignorat.	 And these are the forms of species from the magdan, as if one who does not know them were to stand over it.
Fiant ex aere proprie: et sint extremitates eorum cum hac eadem subtilitate triangulatae, et extremitas acuta.	 They should be made properly of brass; and their ends should have the same subtlety as those that are triangular and pointed.
Formae magda.	 Types of magdan.
¶ De cura Carnis natae in naso.	 ¶ On the care of flesh born in the nose.
Caput XXIIII.	 Chapter XXIV
Quandoque nascuntur in naso Carnes diuersae additae, ex quibus est aliquid quod assimilatur scorpioni multorum pedum: et ex ea est caro cancerosa, lapidea, fusci coloris: et ex ea est quae est caro lenis, non fusci coloris.	 Sometimes various fleshes are born in the nose, among which there is something that resembles a scorpion with many feet; and from this is a cancerous flesh, stone-like, dark in color; and from this is a gentle flesh, not dark in color.
In ea ergo quae ex istis carnibus est lenis, non fraudulenta, neque cancerosa, oportet ut facias sedere infirmum inter manus tuas oppositum soli, et aperi nares eius, et proiice uncinum in illas carnes: deinde trahe eas ad exteriora, et incide quod comprehendisti ex eis cum spatumili subtili acuto a parte una, donec scias quod caro tota iam ablata est.	 In those cases where the flesh is soft, not deceiving, and not cancerous, you should make the patient sit between your hands facing the ground. Open his nose and throw the hook into those fleshes; then draw them out, and cut what you have grasped from them with a fine sharp spoon on one side until you know that all the flesh has been removed.
Quod si remaneret aliquid ex ea cuius abscisio non est possibilis: tunc rade illud cum uno instrumentorum subtilium cum facilitate, donec non remaneat ex eo aliquid.	 If something remains that cannot be cut off, then scrape it with a fine, sharp instrument until nothing remains of it.
Si autem sanguis tibi dominatur, aut accidat apostema calidum: tunc oppone ei per id quod oportet: aut est ex apostematibus malignis, tunc propera cauterizando eum, donec abscindatur sanguis, et auferantur omnes carnes.	 But if the bleeding is severe or a hot abscess occurs, then apply what is necessary: if it is one of the malignant abscesses, hurry to cauterize it until the bleeding stops and all the flesh is removed.
Deinde proiiciatur in nasum post incisionem acetum, et aqua, aut uinum.	 Then throw vinegar, water, or wine into the nose after cutting.
Si autem aperitur nasus, et procedat ex eo humiditas usque ad palatum, tunc scias quia iam sanus est.	 But if the nose is opened and fluid comes out as far as the palate, then know that he is already cured.
Si uero non penetrat humiditas, secundum quod oportet, tunc scias quod intra ipsum est caro nata in superioribus ossibus naris, ad quae non peruenit cum incisione instrumentum.	 But if the fluid does not penetrate as it should, then know that there is flesh formed on the upper bones of the nose, to which the instrument did not reach with the cutting.
Tunc ergo oportet, ut intromittas filum lini cui sit quaedam grossitudo, et noda in eo nodos multos: et pone inter omnem nodum quantitatem digiti, aut minus: et ingeniet infirmus, ut mittat extremitatem unam fili in nasum cum radio, aut cum quo possibile est ei postquam fecerit ipsum simile azer: et trahat odoratum suum, donec perueniat usque ad caassum, et egrediatur super guttur suum.	 Then it is necessary for you to introduce a thread of linen with some thickness and many knots tied in it, and place between each knot the size of a finger or less. The patient should then incline his head so that he can send one end of the thread into the nose with a rod or something similar after making it like a needle: he should draw out his nasal mucosa until it reaches the cavity, and comes out over his throat.
Et multotiens quidem faciunt simile huic Attomi pueri in scholis: et est res facilis ei, qui uult.	 And indeed, similar to this are the tricks that boys do in school: it is an easy thing for someone who wants to do it.
Deinde pone duas extremitates fili, extremitatem unam quae egreditur super nasum, et alteram quae remansit in naso.	 Then place the two ends of the thread: one end that comes out over the nose and the other that remains inside the nose.
Deinde ac ministra serraturam carnis cum nodis qui sunt in filo.	 Then the seamstress sews up the flesh with knots that are on the thread.
Fac illud donec scias quod carnes iam sunt cum nodis fili.	 Do this until you know that the skin is already tied with knots of thread.
Deinde extrahe filum: et pone in nasum post abstersionem sanguinis licinium quod imbibisti in unguento aegyptio: fac illud tribus diebus, aut plus, donec unguentum corrodat totum quod remansit ex carnibus.	 Then remove the thread; and put on the nose after washing away the blood an ointment that you have soaked in Egyptian oil: do this for three days or more, until all the ointment has eaten away what remains of the flesh.
Deinde pone in fine rei in nasum cannulam de plumbo, diebus aliquot, donec sanetur.	 Then at the end of the process, place a lead pipe into the nose for several days until it heals.
Si autem indiget curatione quae exiccet, utere illa.	 If, however, dry treatment is needed, use that.
Ad caputpurgium faciendum, cum quo distillantur olea, et aliae medicinae in nasum, fac illud ex argento, aut aere: quod sit simile lampadi paruae, apertum sicut conchula: et meatus eius similiter.	 For making a head-purifier with which oils and other medicines are distilled into the nose, make it of silver or copper, similar to a small lamp, open like a shell; and its opening likewise.
Et si uis fac cannulam clausam, sicut canna.	 And if you wish, make a closed pipe, like a reed.
Et conchula instrumenti ad caputpurgium faciendum, sit plena, detecta: cui sit manubrium in postremo eius, cum quo teneas ipsam, quando calefacis in ea oleum, aut quod uis ex succis, et rebus fluxibilibus.	 And the opening of the instrument for making a head-purifier should be full and open; it should have a handle at its end with which you hold it when you heat oil or whatever you wish in it from juices and meltable things.
Et haec est forma instrumenti.	 And this is the shape of the instrument.  />
¶ De cura Thelul nasi.	 ¶ On the treatment of a polyp of the nose.
Caput XXV.	 Chapter 25.
Multotiens nascitur in extremitate nasi Thelul, et magnificatur, et augmentatur cum diebus, donec foedus fit aspectus eius.	 Often a polyp arises at the tip of the nose and increases and grows with time until its appearance becomes ugly.  />  />  />
Et propter illud oportet, ut in cidas illud in principio apparitionis eius, et eradices totum eius.	 And because of that it is necessary to cut it off at the beginning of its appearance and root out all of it.
Deinde pone super locum, aut cauterium, aut medicinam comburentem quae stat loco eius.	 Then place on its site either a caustic or a burning medicine that will remain in its place.
Si ergo tardatur incisio eius, donec magnificetur, tunc considera, si est lapideum, durum, fusci coloris, pauci sensus: tunc non tangas ipsum cum ferro: quoniam apostema est cancerosum.	 If therefore its cutting is delayed until it grows larger, then examine whether it is stony, hard, dark in color, with little feeling; then do not touch it with iron because the abscess is malignant.
Multotiens enim uidi, qui incidit hmoni apostema, et accidit ex eo malicia magna super illum qui ipsum habebat.	 I have often seen that when someone gets a boil, a great evil befalls him who has it.
Et si apostema est lenis tactus, non fusci coloris, et uides quod incisio possibilis est in toto eius, tunc euacua infirmum, et incide ipsum sine timore, absque pauore: et cura locum cum eo quod exiccat et constringit, donec sanetur.	 And if the boil is soft to touch, not black in color, and you see that it can be cut entirely, then evacuate the patient and cut it without fear or hesitation: and treat the place with something that dries and contracts until it heals.
¶ De sutura nasi, et labii, et auris.	 ¶ On suturing the nose, lip, and ear.
Caput XXVI.	 Chapter XXVI
Scias Quia quando accidit solutio continuitatis in una harum cartilaginum, parum confert in ea operatio, nisi in quibusdam hominibus.	 Know that when a break occurs in one of these cartilages, operation is of little benefit, except in certain people.
Oportet ergo quando accidit alicui aliquid ex illo, ut consideres, si est uulnus recens cum sanguine suo: et tunc aggrega duolabia uulneris cum sutura: deinde cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	 Therefore, when something like this happens to someone, you should consider if it is a fresh wound with its own blood: then apply dressings to the wound along with the stitching; and then treat it until it heals.
Et si solutionis continuitatis labia iam separata sunt, et facta est unaquaeque pars sana: tunc oportet ut excories omnem partem a cute sua apparente, donec sanguinetur.	 And if the lips of the separation have already been separated and each part is healthy: then you should scrape off all parts from their skin until they bleed.
Deinde aggrega duo labia cum sutura, et stringe ea, et pulueriza super ipsum sanguinem draconis, et olibanum trita: et pone supra pulueres frustum emplastri diafinicon, et alicuius alterius ex emplastris consolidatiuis: et dimitte ipsum ligatum duobus diebus, aut tribus.	 Then join the two lips with stitching and tighten them, and sprinkle over the blood powder of dragon's blood and crushed frankincense; and place on top of the powders a piece of adhesive plaster and some other from the consolidating plasters: and leave it tied for two days or three. 
Deinde solue ipsum, et permuta medicinam: et dimitte ipsum, donec abscindantur fila per se.	 Then release it, and change the medication; and leave it until the threads dissolve by themselves.
Deinde cura ipsum cum unguento, donec sanetur.	 Then treat it with ointment until it heals.
Modus autem suturae est, ut aggreges solutionem continuitatis, aut cum acubus, sicut narrauimus in sutura uentris: aut aggrega solutionem cum filo, sicut feci te scire.	 The method of stitching is to join the separation either with needles, as we have described for stomach stitching; or join the separation with thread, as I have taught you.
¶ De extractione nodorum labiorum.	 ¶ On extracting lip nodes.    
Caput XXVII.	 Chapter XXVII
Multis Quidem hominibus accidunt plaerumque in interioribus labiorum suorum apostemata dura similia granis herbi: et quaedam eorum minora, et maiora.	 "Indeed, many people develop hard growths similar to grains of barley on the inner surfaces of their lips; some are smaller and others larger.
Ergo oportet ut conuertas labium, et findas super omnem nodum eius, et suspendas ipsum cum uncino, et incidas ipsum ab omni parte.	 "Therefore, you should turn the lip inside out, search for all its nodes, and hang it with a hook, then cut it away from every side.
Deinde impleas locum post incisionem zegi trito, donec abscindatur sanguis.	 "Then fill the place after the incision with pounded wheat until the bleeding stops.
Deinde colluatur cum aceto, et curetur locus cum eo, in quo est stipticitas, usquequo sanentur uulnera.	 "Then bind it with vinegar, and scrape the place where the wound is until it heals.
¶ De incisione carnis natae super gingiuam.	 "About the incision of the flesh of the gum over the gums.
Caput XXVIII.	 "Chapter 28
Multotiens nascitur super gingiuam caro addiat, quam antiqui nominant abuluss.	 "A growth often appears on the gum, which the ancients call ablus.
Oportet ergo ut suspendas eam cum uncino: aut teneas eam cum forcipibus, et incidas eam apud radicem suam, et dimittas saniem currere, aut sanguinem.	 "Therefore, you should hang it with a hook or hold it with forceps and cut it at its root, allowing the pus or blood to flow out.
Deinde pone super locum zegi tritum, aut alios pulueres stipticos, exiccatiuos.	 "Then place pounded wheat or other astringent, drying powders on the place.
Quod si redit illa caro post curationem, nam multotiens redit, tunc incide eam secundo, et cauteriza ipsam: ipsa namque non redit post cauterium.	 "But if that flesh returns after treatment—for it often does return—then cut it a second time and cauterize it; for it will not return again after cautery.
¶ De rasione Dentium cum ferro.	 "About filing teeth with iron.
Caput XXIX.	 Chapter 29
Quandoque aggregantur in superficiebus Dentium ab interiori et extetiori parte, et inter gingiuas cortices asperi, turpes, et quandoque denigrantur, et citrini fiunt, et uirides, donec peruenit ex illo corruptio ad gingiuam, et foedi fiunt dentes per illud.	 "Sometimes rough and ugly scabs form on the surfaces of teeth, both inside and out, between the gums, which may blacken, turn yellow or green until corruption reaches the gum, making the teeth foul and unsightly.
Oportet ergo ut facias sedere infirmum inter manus tuas, et caput eius in sinu tuo, et rade molam et dentem, in quo apparent tibi cortices, et res similis arenae: donec non remaneat ex eis aliquid, et similiter fac de nigredine, et uiriditate, et citrinitate, et aliis donec mundentur.	 "Therefore, you should make the patient sit between your hands, with his head on your lap, and file the tooth where you see scabs and something like sand; continue until nothing remains of them. Do the same for blackening, greening, yellowing, and other discolorations until they are cleansed.
Si ergo auferatur quod in eis est a principio rasionis, bonum est: et si non, tunc itera super eos rasionem die alio, secundo, et tertio, donec ad ultimum perueniat studium in eo quod uis.	 If therefore that which is in them is removed from the beginning of the reason, it is good; and if not, then repeat the reasoning over them on another day, second, and third, until at last the study reaches its desired end.
Et scias, quod dens indiget rasoriis diuersarum formarum, multarum figurarum: secundum quod praeparatur operationi tuae: proptera, quod rasorium quo raditur dens ab inferiori parte, est aliud a rasorio quo raditur inter dentes, secundum formas alias.	 And know that the tooth requires razors of diverse shapes and many figures, according to which it is prepared for your operation; therefore, the razor with which one shaves the tooth from below is different from the razor with which one shaves between the teeth, according to other shapes.
Et istae formae rasoriorum sint apud te praeparatae, quas uides.	 And let these forms of razors be prepared for you, as you see them.
¶ De extractione doloris Dentium.	 ¶ On the Extraction of Tooth Pain
Caput XXX.	 Chapter XXX
Oportet ut cures Dentem a dolore suo cum omni ingenio, et tardes in eradicatione eius.	 It is necessary that you cure the tooth from its pain with all skill and be slow in extracting it.
Non est enim quod uicem eius suppleat quando eradicatur: quoniam est substantia sublimis: donec quando non est excusatio de eradicatione eius, tunc oportet quando cogitur infirmus eradicare ipsum, ut firmetur, et certificetur apud te dens dolens.	 For its replacement cannot be supplied when it is extracted, because it is a high substance; therefore, there can be no excuse for extracting it, unless when the patient is forced to extract it in order to strengthen and confirm the aching tooth to you.
Multotiens enim decipit infirmum dolor, et putat quia est in dente saha et eradicat ipsum: deinde non recedit dolor, donec eradicetur dens infirmus.	 For many times the pain deceives the patient and makes him think that it is in the tooth and he extracts it; then the pain does not subside until the sick tooth is extracted.
Nos enim iam uidimus illud ex operatione phlebotomatorum.	 For we have already seen this from the practice of bloodletting.
Cum ergo certificatur apud te dens dolens ipsemet, tunc oportet ut scarifices in circumitu dentis cum spatumili, in quo sit quiddam uirtutis, donec soluatur gingiua ab omni parte: deinde moue ipsum digitis tuis, aut cum forcipibus subtilibus in primis paulatim, donec concutias ipsum.	 When the aching tooth itself is confirmed to you, then it is necessary that you scarify around the tooth with a lancet, on which there is some virtue, until the gum is loosened from all parts; then move it with your fingers or with fine forceps little by little, until you shake it out.  />
Deinde loca tunc in eo forcipes magnos locatione bona, et caput infirmi inter genua tua: quod iam bene tenuisti, ita quod non moueatur: deinde trahe dentem secundum rectitudinem, ut non frangas ipsum.	 Then place large forceps on it in a good position, and hold the patient's head between your knees so that you have already held it well, so that it does not move; then pull the tooth straight, so that you do not break it.
Si ergo non egreditur, tunc accipe aliquod illorum instrumentorum, et intromitte ipsum sub eo ab omni parte cum facilitate, et conare motionem eius, sicut fecisti in primis.	 If it does not come out, then take one of those instruments and insert it under the object from all sides with ease, and attempt to move it as you did initially.
Si autem dens est perforatus, aut corrosus: tunc oportet ut impleas illud foramen panno: et stringas ipsum cum extremitate radii subtilis, ut non frangatur in hora constrictionis tuae super ipsum cum forcipibus.	 However, if the tooth is perforated or decayed, then you should fill that hole with cloth and tie it with a fine thread so that it does not break during your constriction on it with forceps.
Et oportet, ut exquisite agas cum scarificatione in circumitu gingiuae ab omni parte multum.	 And you must carefully make an incision all around the gum from every side very much.
Et custodi fortitudinem tuam, ut non frangas ipsum, et remaneat pars eius, et redeat super infirmum ex ea malicia quae sit maior dolore eius primo.	 And be careful not to break it, and let a part of it remain, so that the worse evil returns upon the patient with greater pain than before.
Et caue, ne facias illud quod ignorantes faciunt phlebotomatores in festinatione sua, et audacia ipsorum super eradicationem eius, praeter quod administrent illud quod narrauimus.	 And beware of doing what ignorant bloodletters do in their haste and audacity when extracting it, beyond what we have described to administer.
Multotiens enim faciunt euenire super homines infirmitates magnas, quarum difficiliores sunt ut frangantur, et remaneant radices eius omnes, aut quaedam earum: aut ut extrahant ipsum cum quibusdam ossibus mandibulae: sicut testificati sumus multotiens illud.	 For often they cause great illnesses to happen to people, which are more difficult to break and all its roots remain, or some of them; or they extract it with some bones of the jaw, as we have often witnessed this.
Deinde colluatur post eradicationem eius cum uino, aut cum aceto et sale.	 Then it should be washed after extraction with wine, or with vinegar and salt.
Quod si accidat fluxus sanguinis ex locis (multotiens enim accidit) tunc tere aliquid ex zegi, et imple cum eo locum: et si non, cauteriza ipsum si non confert tibi zegi.	 If there is bleeding from the site (for this often happens), then grind some zegi and fill the site with it; if not, cauterize it if zegi does not help you.
Formae forcipum subtilium quibus mouetur dens in primis, sint longarum extremitatum, breuis manubrii, grossi, ut non duplicentur quando cum eis premitur super dentem: sint sicut uides grossorum manubriorum, donec quando stringis cum eis, non dent seipsas, neque duplicentur: breuium extremitatum, et sint ex ferro indo, aut ex faled decenter facti, directarum extremitatum: et in eorum extremitatibus sint dentes, quorum quidam ingrediantur in quosdam, et stringant constrictione decenti, forti.	 The form of the fine forceps with which the tooth is initially moved should have long tips and a short handle, and be thick so that they do not bend when pressed on the tooth; as you see in large-handled forceps, until when you tie them, they do not give way or bend; of short tips, and made from Indian steel or well-made from faled steel with straight tips: and at their tips there should be teeth, some of which fit into others and bind firmly.
Et quandoque fiunt extremitates sicut forma oris auis quae nominatur ciconia, et sunt fortis constrictionis.	 And sometimes the extremities resemble the beak of a bird called a stork, and they are very constricted.
¶ De eradicatione Dentium, et extractione ossium mandibularum fractorum.	 About the removal of teeth, and the extraction of broken jawbones.
Caput XXXI.	 Chapter 31
Quando remanet apud eradicationem Dentis qui frangitur aliquid, tunc oportet ut ponas super locum cotum cum butyro die uno, aut duobus diebus, donec mollificetur locus: deinde intromitte ad ipsum algasti, aut forcipes: quorum extremitates assimilantur ori auis quae nominatur ciconia.	 When something remains after the extraction of a broken tooth, then it is necessary to place a poultice on that place with butter for one day, or two days, until the place softens; then introduce into it algasti, or forceps, whose extremities resemble the beak of a bird called a stork.
Forma autem haec est forcipum.	 The shape of these is that of forceps.
Sint extremitates eorum factae sicut lima deintus: aut sicut aliskilfegi.	 Their extremities should be made like a file inside, or like tweezers.
Si ergo non obedit tibi ad exitum cum istis forcipibus, tunc oportet, ut caues super radicem, et detegas carnem totam, et intromittas instrumentum quod nominatur Palanca parua, cuius forma est haec.	 If it does not obey you in leaving with these forceps, then it is necessary that you make a hole in the root, and expose all the flesh, and introduce an instrument called a small lever, whose form is this.
Sit breuis extremitatis, grossae parumper: et non sit imbibitum, ut non frangatur.	 Its extremity should be short, slightly thick; and it should not be made wet, so that it does not break.
Si ergo egreditur radix per illud, est bonum: et si non, iuuare oportet cum istis instrumentis aliis quorum formae sunt istae.	 If the root comes out through this, it is good; and if not, help must be given with these other instruments whose forms are these. ■
Forma primi triangulatae extremitatis, in qua est quaedam grossitudo.	 The form of the first is a triangle, with thickened extremities.
Forma triangulatae extremitatis subtilis.	 The form is that of a subtle triangular extremity. ■
Etiam iuuatur cum hoc instrumento habente duos ramos, cuius haec est forma.	 It can also be helped with this instrument which has two branches, and its form is this. ■ □
Et cum aliis instrumentis et ferramentis quae praecesserunt in rasione dentium.	 And with other instruments and tools that have been mentioned in the section on teeth.
Etiam sit iuuamentum cum hoc instrumento quod assimilatur uncino magno, huius formae, triangulatae extremitatis tortae, in qua est quiddam grossitudinis, ut non frangatur: et sit non imbibitum.	 It can also be helped with this instrument which resembles a large hook, of this form, a triangular twisted extremity, with some thickness so that it does not break; and it should not be made wet.
Et scias, quod instrumenta dentium sunt multa: et similiter reliqua instrumenta non computantur, et artifex prudens, subtilis in arte sua inuenit per se ipsum instrumentum, secundum quod significant ei operatio et aegritudines ipsae.	 And know that there are many instruments of teeth; and likewise the other instruments are not counted, and a skilled craftsman finds for himself an instrument suitable for his work and the diseases themselves. □ ■
Quoniam ex agritudinibus sunt ad quas non dixerunt antiqui instrumentum, propter diuersitatem specierum earum.	 Because there are diseases for which the ancients did not name an instrument due to the diversity of their kinds.
Si autem frangatur os ex mandibula, aut ex aliis ossibus oris, aut putrefit: tunc perscrutare super ipsum in loco suo cum eo quod conuenit ei ex instrumentis et forcipibus quae dixi in extractione radicum, et iuuare cum gesti, cuius forma est haec.	 But if a bone is broken from the jaw, or other bones of the mouth, or putrefies: then search over it with that which suits it among the instruments and forceps that I mentioned for extracting roots, and aid with this probe, whose form is thus.
Sit in eo quiddam grossitudinis paulatim, ut stringatur, uel teneatur cum eo os, et non fugiat et uadat, donec egrediatur os: et restaura locum cum medicinis conuenientibus ad illud.	 Let there be in it something of thickness gradually, so that the bone is caught and held with it, and does not flee and wander, until the bone exits: and restore the place with suitable medicines for that.
Si autem in osse est putredo parua, tunc rade ipsum a putredine sua, et cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	 But if there is a small putrefaction in the bone, then scrape it from its putrefaction and care for it until it heals.
De serratura Dentium eminentium super alios.	 On the Sawing of Prominent Teeth above Others.
Caput XXXII.	 Chapter XXXII
Quando Dentes eminent non secundum cursum suum naturalem, foeda fit per illud forma: et praecipue quando accidit illud in mulieribus, et puellis, scilicet uenalibus.	 When teeth protrude not according to their natural course, an ugly appearance is made by that; and especially when this happens to women and girls, that is, those who have been sold (i.e., married off).
Oportet ergo ut consideres.	 Therefore, you must consider.
Nam si dens est natus post dentem alium, et non locatur, uel est possibilis eius serratura, neque limatura ipsius: tunc eradica ipsum: et si est annexus cum dente alio, tunc incide ipsum cum isto instrumento, cuius haec est forma.	 For if a tooth is born after another tooth and does not fit, or its sawing and filing are possible: then extract it; but if it is attached to another tooth, then cut it with this instrument, whose form is thus.
Est simile rostro paruo, et fit ex ferro indo, acutae extremitatis ualde.	 It is similar to a small beak, and is made of Indian steel, very sharp at the end.
Et sit incisio tua qua ipsum incidis in diebus multis, et propter duriciem dentis, et ut non commoueatur alius ex dentibus.	 And let your cutting, by which you cut it, be done over many days, because of the hardness of the tooth and so that another tooth is not moved.
Si autem est eminens expositus limaturae suae: tunc lima ipsum cum lima ex indo, cuius forma est haec.	 But if it is prominent and suitable for filing, then file it with a file from India, whose form is thus.
Sit totum ex indo, et manubrium eius minutorum punctorum ualdae, sicut lima cum qua fiunt acus: cum quo limetur dens paulatim in diebus multis cum facilitate, ut non commoueatur dens, et cadat: deinde leni ipsum, in fine rade ipsum cum quibusdam rasoriis.	 It is entirely from India and its handle is of very small points, like the file with which needles are made: by which the tooth is filed little by little over many days easily, so that the tooth does not move, and falls; then smooth it, in the end scrape it with certain rasps.
Quod si est dens, ex quo frangatur pars, et laedit linguam: tunc oportet ut limes eum etiam, donec auferatur asperitas illius fractionis, et aequetur: et applanetur, et non laedat linguam, neque corrumpat sermonem.	 If it is a tooth, from which a piece breaks off and injures the tongue, then one must smooth it also, until the roughness of that break is removed, and made even, and smoothed, so that it does not injure the tongue nor corrupt speech.
¶ De retatione Dentium cum filis auri.	 About pulling teeth with gold wire.
Caput XXXIII.	 Chapter XXXIII.
Quando accidit Dentibus anterioribus concussio et commotio a percussione, aut casu: et non potest infirmus stringere super illud quod comedit ut non cadat: et curasti eos cum medicinis stipticis, et non ualuit curatio: tunc ingenium in eis est, ut stringantur cum filo auri: quoniam argentum fit uiride, et putrefit post dies: sed aurum nunquam mutatur.	 When a shock and blow happens to the front teeth from a strike or accident, and the patient cannot hold together what they eat so that it does not fall out, and you have treated them with astringent medicines, but the cure has not been effective, then there is skill in this: to tie them with gold wire. For silver turns green and putrefies after days, but gold never changes.
Et sit filum medium in subtilitate et grossicie secundum quantitatem quod capiat inter Dentes.	 And let the wire be medium in fineness and thickness according to what fits between the teeth.
Et forma quidem retationis est, ut accipias filum, et intromittas duplum eius inter duos dentes sanos: deinde texeas cum duabus extremitatibus fili inter dentes motos, siue unus sit, aut plures, donec peruenias cum tela usque ad dentem sanum alterius partis.	 And the form of the pulling is thus: take a wire and insert its double between two sound teeth; then weave with the two ends of the wire between the loose teeth, whether one or more, until you come with the thread to the sound tooth on the other side.
Deinde itera texturam usque ad partem a qua incaepisti: et stringe manum tuam cum subtilitate et sapientia, donec non remoueatur prorsus: et sit constrictio tua qua stringis filum, apud radices dentium, ut non euadat.	 Then repeat the weaving back to the part where you began; and hold your hand with fineness and wisdom, until it is not at all removed; and let your constriction by which you tie the wire be at the roots of the teeth, so that it does not escape.
Deinde incide extremitates fili superfluentes cum forficibus: et aggrega utrumque, et conuerte eas cum gesti: et occulta ipsas inter dentem sanum et dentem motum, ut non laedat linguam: deinde dimittatur ita strictum dum remanet.	 Then cut the superfluous ends of the wire with scissors; and gather together both [ends] and turn them with a pincer; and hide them between the sound tooth and the loose tooth, so that they do not injure the tongue; then let it be left thus tied as long as it remains.
Si autem soluitur, aut inciditur, stringe eos cum filo alio, et stabit cum eo taliter tempore toto.	 But if it loosens or is cut, tie them with another wire, and they will remain thus for the entire time.
Et haec est forma Dentium, et figura retationis duorum dentium sanorum, et duorum dentium motorum, sicut uides.	 And this is the form of the teeth, and the figure of the pulling of two sound teeth and two loose teeth, as you see.
Et quandoque fit, ut redeat dens unus, aut duo post casum urriusque in locis suis, et retentur sicut narrauimus, et remaneant: et non facit illud nisi artifex, prudens, et expertus.	 And sometimes it happens that one or two teeth return to their places after the incident and remain there as we have said; only a skilled and experienced craftsman can accomplish this.
Et quandoque aptatur aliquod ex ossibus uaccinis: et fit ex eo sicut forma dentis, et ponitur in loco, ex quo munitur dens et stringitur, sicut diximus: et remanet, et seruitur cum eo tempore longo.	 And sometimes a piece of cattle bone is prepared: it is shaped like a tooth and placed in the socket, where it is secured and fastened as we said: and it remains and serves for a long time.
¶ De incisione ligamenti quod accidit sub lingua, et prohibet loquelam.	 About the cutting of the ligament under the tongue which prevents speech.
Caput XXXIIII.	 Chapter XXXIV.
Quandoque ligamentum hoc quod accidit sub lingua, est aut naturale, cum quo nascitur homo, aut accidentale, a uulnere quod iam consolidatum est.	 Sometimes this ligament that occurs under the tongue is either congenital, with which a person is born, or acquired, from an old healed wound.
Et operatio in eo est, ut aperias os infirmi in capite eius in sinu tuo, et eleua linguam eius: deinde incide illud ligamentum neruosum per latitudinem, donec soluatur lingua a retentione sua.	 And the operation on it is this: open the mouth of the patient, placing his head in your lap and raise his tongue; then cut through that nerve-like ligament across its width until the tongue is released from its constriction.
Quod si in eo fuerit quiddam duriciei et nodationis, et fuerit illud ex consolidatione uulneris: tunc proiice in illud uncinum, et finde illud per latitudinem, donec incidas ligamentum, et soluatur nodatio.	 But if there is some hardness and knotting due to the healed wound, then thrust a hook into it and search through its width until you cut the ligament and free the knot.
Et caue, ne sit fissura in profundo carnis, et incidas arteriam illic, et accidat fluxus sanguinis.	 And be careful not to make a deep flesh cut and sever an artery there, causing blood flow.
Deinde colluatur in uestigio incisionis cum aqua rosata, aut cum aceto, aut aqua frigida.	 Then wash the site of the incision with rose water or vinegar or cold water. 
Deinde pone sub lingua licinium ex lino, quod teneat infirmus in omni nocte: ut non consolidetur secundo.	 Then place a linen cloth under the tongue which the patient must hold every night: so that it does not heal again.
Si autem accidat fluxus sanguinis, tunc pone super locum zegi tritum.	 But if there is bleeding, then put ground alum on the site.
Si uero uincit te sanguis, tunc cauteriza locum cum cauterio lentiginoso, quod conuenit ad illud: deinde cura ipsum cum reliqua curatione, donec sanetur.	 But if the bleeding overcomes you, then cauterize the site with a suitable cautery; then treat him with the rest of the treatment until he is cured.
¶ De extractione Ranulae quae fit sub lingua.	 About the removal of the ranula which occurs under the tongue.
Caput XXXV.	 Chapter 35
Quandoque accidit sub lingua apostema quod assimilatur Ranae paruae, prohibens linguam ab operatione sua naturali: et fortasse magnificatur adeo, donec implet os.	 Sometimes an abscess occurs under the tongue, resembling a small frog, preventing the tongue from performing its natural function; and perhaps it grows so much that it fills the mouth.
Et operatio in eo est, ut aperias os infirmi coram sole: et considera apostema.	 And the procedure for this is to open the mouth of the patient facing the sun and observe the abscess.
Si ergo uides ipsum fusci coloris, aut nigri, durum, cui non inuenit infirmus sensum: tunc non tangas ipsum, quoniam est cancer.	 If therefore you see it to be a dark or black color, hard, and the patient feels no pain from it; then do not touch it, because it is a cancer.
Et si est decliue ad albedinem, in quo est humiditas, tunc proiice in ipsum uncinum, et incide ipsum cum spatumili subtili, et libera ipsum ab omni parte.	 And if it is inclined towards whiteness and has moisture; then insert a hook into it and cut it with a fine scalpel, freeing it from all parts.
Quod si uincit te sanguis in hora tuae operationis, tunc pone super ipsum zegi tritum, donec abscindatur sanguis: deinde redi ad operationem tuam, donec extrahas ipsum cum complemento eius.	 But if blood overcomes you during your procedure, then place ground cumin on it until the bleeding stops; then return to your procedure until you extract it with its entirety.
Deinde colluatur cum aceto et sale: et cura ipsum reliqua curatione conueniente ad illud, donec sanetur.	 Then let it be rinsed with vinegar and salt; and care for the remainder of the appropriate treatment until it heals.
¶ De curatione apostematis duarum Amigdalarum.	 ¶ On the treatment of abscesses in the two tonsils.
Caput XXXVI.	 Chapter 36
Quandoque accidunt inter guttur godad, id est, glandulae, quae similantur algodad, quae accidunt deforis: et nominantur duae Amigdalae: quas quando curas cum eo quod diximus in diuisione, et non sanantur, tunc considera.	 Sometimes abscesses occur between the throat and tonsils, which resemble cotton balls that appear externally; these are called two tonsils. When you treat them with what we have said about incision and they do not heal, then observe.
Si ergo est apostema durum, fusci coloris, pauci sensus: tunc non tangas ipsum cum ferro.	 If therefore the abscess is hard, dark in color, and causes little pain; then do not touch it with an iron (scalpel).
Et si est rubei coloris, et radix eius est grossa: tunc non tangas ipsum etiam cum ferro, timens fluxum sanguinis, imo dimitte ipsum, donec maturetur.	 And if it is red in color and its root is thick; then do not touch it even with an iron, fearing excessive bleeding. Rather, leave it until it matures. 》
Et tunc aut perforabis ipsum: aut rumpetur per se.	 And then either you will pierce it or it will burst by itself.
Et si est albi coloris, rotundum, et est radix eius subtilis: tunc oportet ipsum incidi.	 And if it is white in color, round, and its root is fine; then you should cut into it.
Et operatio in ipso est, ut consideres ante operationem suam, si quieuit apostema eius calidum quiete completum, aut imminuitur quadam diminutione: tunc ergo fac sedere infirmum coram sole, et caput eius sit in sinu tuo: et aperi os eius, et accipiat seruiens inter manus suas, et premat linguam eius inferius cum instrumento, cuius haec est forma.	 And the procedure is as follows: consider before the operation whether the abscess has become hot and filled with quietness, or if it has diminished somewhat. Then have the patient sit in front of the sun, and his head should be in your lap. Open his mouth, and let the servant take him between his hands, and press his tongue downward with this instrument.
Fiat ex argento, aut aere, quod sit subtile sicut cultellus.	 Let it be made of silver or bronze, which should be as thin as a knife.
Cum ergo premis cum eo linguam, et ostenditur tibi apostema, et cadit super ipsum uisus tuus: tunc accipe uncinum, et fige ipsum in amigdalam, et extrahe eam ad exteriora quantum potes, praeter quod trahas cum ea aliquid ex tunicis.	 So when you press it against the tongue, and the abscess is revealed to you, and your sight falls upon it: then take a hook, and insert it into the tonsil, and draw it out as far as possible to the exterior, except that you pull some of the membranes with it.  />
Deinde incide eam cum instrumento, cuius haec est forma quae sequitur.	 Then cut it with an instrument of this form which follows.
Assimilatur forficibus: uerumtamen extremitates eius sint curuatae, ita quod orificium cuiusque earum est in directo alterius acute: unde cura ut sit ex ferro indo, aut alfuled imbibitum.	 It resembles scissors; however, its extremities should be curved so that the opening of each one is directly at the tip of the other. Therefore, ensure that it is made of Indian steel or steel that has been quenched in oil.
Si autem non est praesens hoc instrumentum, tunc incide ipsum cum spatumili, cuius haec est forma.	 But if this instrument is not available, then cut it with a spatula of this form.
Sit acutum a parte una, non acutum a parte altera.	 Let one end be sharp, the other not.
Et postquam incidis amigdalam unam, incide alteram secundum hanc eandem speciem incisionis.	 And after you have cut one tonsil, cut the other in a similar manner.
Deinde post incisionem gargarizet infirmus cum aqua frigida, aut cum aceto et aqua.	 Then, after the cutting, let the patient gargle with cold water or with vinegar and water.  />  />  />  />  />  />  />
Si autem accidat ei fluxus sanguinis, gargarizet cum aqua in qua bulliti sunt cortices granatorum: aut folia myrti, et similia illis ex stipticis, donec abscindatur fluxus sanguinis: deinde cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	 But if bleeding occurs, let him gargle with water in which pomegranate rinds have been boiled, or myrtle leaves and other hemostatics similar to them, until the flow of blood is stopped; then care for him until he heals.
Et quandoque nascuntur in gutture apostemata alia, praeter amigdalas duas.	 And sometimes abscesses arise in the throat besides the two tonsils.
Incide ergo ea secundum quod dixi in incisione duarum amigdalarum aequaliter.	 Cut them therefore as I said for the incision of the two tonsils equally.
Et ego quidem iam medicatus fui mulierem ex apostemate, quod natum erat inter guttur eius, quod trahebat ad fuscedinem, pauci sensus, quod iam fere clauserat guttur: et mulier respirabat a meatu stricto, et iam prohibuerat ei comestionem, et potum aquae: et iam peruenerat ad mortem, si remansisset uno die, aut duobus diebus.	 And I myself have treated a woman from an abscess that had developed in her throat, which was pulling it to darkness, with little sensation and had almost closed her throat; and the woman was breathing through narrowed breath, and it had already prevented her from eating food or drinking water; and she would have reached death if it had remained for one day or two days.
Et apostema tantum ascenderat, quod emiserat duos ramos, donec exierant super duo foramina nasi.	 And the abscess had risen so much that it had sent out two branches until they emerged at the two nostrils.
Properaui ergo festinanter, et fixi in unum eorum uncinum.	 I hastened quickly, therefore, and fixed a hook into one of them.
Deinde traxi ipsum, et tracta ex eo est portio magna.	 Then I pulled it, and a large piece was drawn out from it.
Deinde abscidi eam, ubi comprehendi ex foramine nasi.	 Then I cut it off where it was caught in the nostril. ️
Deinde feci illud ei quod processit ex foramine nasi altero.	 Then I did to her what had emerged from the other nostril's opening.
Deinde aperui os eius, et pressi linguam eius: et postea fixi uncinum in ipsum apostema: deinde abscidi ex eo partem eius, et non cucurrit ex eo nisi sanguis paucus: absolutum est ergo guttur mulieris, et incepit statim bibere aquam, deinde accepit ex cibo.	 Then I opened her mouth and pressed her tongue; and afterwards I fixed a hook into the abscess itself; then I cut off part of it, and only a little blood ran out from it; thus the woman's throat was healed, and she immediately began to drink water, then she took some food.
Non ergo cessaui incidere ex illo apostemate multotiens tempore longo: et apostema succedebat loco eius quod incidebam, donec prolongatum est nimis et cum ea illud.	 I did not stop cutting from that abscess many times over a long period; and the abscess followed in the place where I had cut, until it was greatly elongated with her.
Ingeniaui ergo, et cauterizaui apostema inter guttur.	 Therefore, I cauterized the abscess in the throat.
Stetit ergo ab additione: deinde ambulaui a parte, et non sciui quid fecit Deus cum ea post me.	 It stopped growing further; then I left her and did not know what God did with her after me.
¶ De incisione apostematis uuulae.	 ¶ On the incision of the abscess on the uvula.
Caput XXXVII.	 Chapter 37.
Quando descendit catarrus ad uuulam, et apostematur, et est long: tunc ipsa nominatur perpendicularis: et si est in inferiori parte grossa, rotunda, tunc ipsa nominatur uua.	 When the cold (catarrh) descends to the uvula and becomes abscessed and is long; then it is called "perpendicular". And if it is thick and round at its lower part, then it is called "grape".
Quando curatur cum eo quod diximus in diuisione, et non confert curatio: et uides quod apostema calidum quieuit ab ea, et est subtilis: tunc oportet ut incidas eam.	 When it is treated with what we mentioned during the division, and the treatment does not help: and you see that the hot tumor has subsided from it, and is thin: then you must cut into it.
Et quae ex ea est aggregata rotunda, et non est ei longitudo, et est sanguinea, aut fusci coloris, aut nigri, et non est ei sensus: tunc oportet ut deuites incisionem eius.	 And if something round has grown from it, and it has no length, and is red or dark in color, and there is no sensation in it: then you should avoid cutting into it.
In ea enim est timor super infirmum.	 For there is fear regarding the patient.
Oportet ergo quando uides eam secundum modum quem dixi ex albedine, et longitudine sua, ut facias sedere infirmum coram sole: et premas linguam eius cum instrumento, cuius praecessit narratio: deinde fige uncinum in uuam, et trahe eam inferius: et incide eam cum uno duorum instrumentorum quae dixi in incisione duarum amigdalarum.	 Therefore, when you see it according to the way I said, from its whiteness and length, make the patient sit before the sun; then press his tongue with the instrument that preceded in the narrative; afterwards, insert a hook into the vein and pull it downwards; and cut it with one of the two instruments that I mentioned in the cutting of the two tonsils.
Et oportet ut non incidas ex ea, nisi illud quod additur super naturalem terminum sine additione.	 And you should not cut from it except what is added beyond the natural limit without adding to it.
Nam si tu incidis ex ea plus, laedes uocem et sermonem.	 For if you cut more than this, you will harm the voice and speech.
Deinde post incisionem utere eo quod narrauimus in incisione duarum amigdalarum: et cura eam, donec sanetur.	 Then after the cutting, use that which we have mentioned in the cutting of the two tonsils; and care for it until it heals.
Si autem terretur infirmus ab incisione: tunc oportet ut utaris ingenio in cauterizatione eius absque timore et pauore.	 But if the patient is frightened by the cutting, then you should use skill in cauterizing it without fear and dread.
Et modus cauterii in ea non est, nisi cum aqua acuta: et est, ut ponas caput infirmi in sinu tuo.	 And the method of cautery for it is not except with sharp water; and it is that you place the patient's head on your lap.
Deinde preme linguam eius cum instrumento quod diximus.	 Then press his tongue with the instrument that we mentioned.
Deinde accipe ex aqua quam dixi tibi in capitulo cauterizandi, et confice cum ea calcem non extinctam, et pone eam non spissam, neque subtilem, et imple ex ea concauitatem huius instrumenti, cuius haec est forma.	 Then take from the water that I mentioned to you in the chapter on cauterizing, and make a cup of it that is not extinguished, and place it not thick nor thin, and fill with it the hollow of this instrument, whose form is this.
Sit extremitati eius in qua ponitur medicina concauitas, sicut concauitas cochlearis radii.	 Let its end where the medicine is placed have a concavity like the concavity of a spoon.
Et pone instrumentum cum medicina super uuulam ipsam: et infirmus sit iacens super latus suum, ut currat saliua ex ore eius ex intrinseca medicina, ut non descendat ex ea ad guttur ipsius aliquid, et laedat ipsum.	 And place the instrument with medicine on the wound itself; and let the patient lie on their side, so that saliva may flow from their mouth due to the internal medicine, lest anything should descend into the throat and harm them.
Deinde tene manum tuam cum medicina.	 Then hold your hand with the medicine.
Et tu ex primas eam super uuulam quantitate medietatis horae, donec uideas eam iam denigratam, et sedatam mordicationem medicinae.	 And you should place it on the wound for half an hour, until you see that it has turned black and the grinding of the medicine is calmed.
Et si uis ut accipias cotum, et inuoluas ipsum super extremitatem radii, et infundas cotum cum medicina, et intromittas radium cum coto in cannulam desuper, donec adhaereat cotum super uuulam.	 And if you wish to use cotton, roll it around the tip of a finger and soak it with medicine. Then insert the finger along with the cotton into a small tube, until the cotton adheres to the wound.
Fac illud multotiens, donec consequaris quod uis de cauterizatione uuae.	 Do this many times, until you achieve what you want from cauterizing the wound.
Deinde dimitte eam: ipsa namque arescit et cadit post tres dies, aut quatuor.	 Then leave it; for it dries up and falls off after three or four days.
Quod si indiges ut iteres medicinam, itera ipsam: et post cauterizationem absterge in circumitu uuae cum coto imbibito in butyro, et mundifica cum eo quod est in circumitu eius ex medicina: et colluatur cum aqua frigida.	 If you need to renew the medicine, renew it; and after cauterizing, clean around the wound with cotton soaked in butter, and cleanse it with what remains of the medicine around it, and rinse with cold water.
Et curetur extrinsecus cum embrocis, et deintus cum gargarismis, donec sanetur.	 And let it be scraped externally with ointments, and internally with gargles, until it heals.
Haec ergo species curationis est salubrior incisione et longinquior a timore.	 This method of treatment is therefore healthier for the cut and further from danger.
Et quandoque curatur uuula etiam cum eo quod est subtilius quam cauterium et incisio: curatur enim cum suffumigatione, secundum hunc modum.	 And sometimes the wound is also treated with something even more delicate than cautery and incision; it is treated with fumigation in this manner.
Sume calamentum, et hyssopum, et origanum, et rutam, et sseah, et chamomillam, et abrotanum, et similia eis ex herbis: et aggrega ea omnia, aut quaedam eorum in olla, et submergantur cum aceto, et bulliant: et olla sit lutata cum luto decenter: et sit in medio ollae foramen, super quod componatur instrumentum concauum secundum hunc modum.	 Take calamint, hyssop, oregano, rue, marjoram, chamomile, southernwood, and similar herbs; gather them all, or some of them, in a pot, and let them be submerged in vinegar and boil; and let the pot be well sealed with clay; and let there be a hole in the middle of the pot, over which place a concave instrument in this manner.
Fiat ex argento, aut aere: et intromittatur extremitas, in qua est granatum, in os infirmi, donec ascendat uapor ad uuulam super cannulam, donec obscuretur uuula multum.	 "Make from silver or copper and insert the end with the pellet into the patient's mouth until steam rises to the lips above the tube until the lips are much darkened.
Deinde itera super ipsam multotiens, donec arescat.	 Then repeat over it many times until it dries out.
Et caue, ne facias hanc curationem in principio aduentus apostematis.	 And beware not to perform this treatment at the beginning of the abscess's arrival.
Plaerumque enim addit in apostemate: et non oportet ut facias illud nisi apud declinationem apostematis eius calidi.	 For it often adds to the swelling, and it is not fitting that you do this except at the decline of its heat.
Si autem non est praesens tibi hoc instrumentum, tunc accipe cannam, et compone in extremitate eius corticem oui: ut non comburatur os infirmi: quoniam cortex oui prohibet uaporem comburere os: et haec est ex bona curatione cum salute.	 But if this instrument is not present to you, then take a tube and place on its end the shell of an egg so that the patient's mouth does not burn, for the eggshell prevents the steam from burning the mouth, and this is a good treatment with safety.
¶ De extractione spinarum, et ossium de gula.	 § On the Extraction of Thorns and Bones from the Throat
Caput XXXVIII.	 Chapter 38
Multotiens adhaeret in gutture os, aut spina piscis, aut aliud.	 Many times a bone or a fishbone sticks in the throat, or something else.
Oportet ergo ut extrahas quod ex eis est apparens super quod cadit uisus, postquam premis linguam cum instrumento apud solem, et declaratur tibi quod est in gutture.	 Therefore, you must extract whatever is apparent from these things after pressing the tongue with the instrument toward the light, and it will be revealed to you what is in the throat.
Et quod non apparet tibi et occultatur in gutture, oportet ut facias uomere infirmum antequam digeratur cibus in stomacho.	 And whatever does not appear to you and is hidden in the throat, it is necessary that you make the patient vomit before the food settles in the stomach.  />
Fortasse enim egredietur res annexa per uomitum.	 For perhaps the stuck object will come out with the vomit.
Aut deglutiat infirmus frustum napi, aut radicem lactucae, aut deglutiat buccellam panis sicci: aut accipiat frustum spongiae marinae siccae lenis: et liga ipsum in filo, deinde deglutiat ipsum.	 Or the patient may swallow a piece of bread, or a lettuce root, or a dry crumb of bread; or he may take a gentle piece of dry sea sponge and tie it on a thread, then swallow it.  />  />
Cum ergo peruenit ad locum ubi sunt spinae, aut os, et extrahitur, tunc egreditur.	 When it reaches the place where the thorns or bone are and they are drawn out, then it comes out.  />  />
Si ergo non egreditur cum eo quod diximus: tunc utere instrumento ex plumbo secundum hanc formam.	 If it does not come out with what we have said, then use an instrument of lead in this shape.  />  /> 
Sit grossius quam Radius parumper, et in extremitate eius sit curuitas, quam intromittat in guttur suum cum facilitate: et ipse habeat caput suum eleuatum sursum.	 "The ulcer is larger than the radius for a short time, and at its end there is curvature, which it enters into its throat with ease; and he should have his head raised up.
Et caueat a tactu suae epiglotis, ut non accidat ei tussis, et impellat cum eo os, aut spinam, aut intromittat ipsum medicus manu sua.	 "And he should beware of the touch of his epiglottis, lest coughing happen to him; and he should expel with it a bone or a thorn, or the physician should insert it with his own hand.
Verum quod infirmus intromittat, hoc est melius: propter scientiam suam de loco rei annexae: et impellat inferius, aut trahat manum suam cum instrumento sursum, totum illud secundum quantitatem quae praeparatur ei, donec egrediatur.	 "But what the sick person inserts is better: because of his knowledge of the place where the thing is attached; and he should expel it downwards, or draw up his hand with the instrument, all of it according to its quantity which has been prepared for him, until it comes out.
¶ De extractione Sanguisugae.	 "About the Extraction of a Leech
Caput XXXIX.	 Chapter 39
Quando medicatur sanguisuga cum eo quod dixi in diuisione ex curatione cum medicinis, et non confert, tunc considera in gutture infirmi coram sole, siue apud solem postquam premis linguam eius cum instrumento quod narraui tibi.	 "When a leech is treated with what I said in the division of treatment with medicines, and it does not help, then look in the patient's throat in the presence of sunlight or in sunlight after you press his tongue with the instrument that I have told you about.
Si ergo cadit uisus tuus super sanguisugam, extrahe eam cum uncino paruo, aut cum gesti subtilibus decenter.	 "If therefore your sight falls upon the leech, extract it with a small hook or with fine tweezers.
Quod si non est possibile cum eis: tunc accipe cannulam concauam, et intromitte eam in guttur infirmi usque prope guttur: deinde intromitte in concauitatem cannulae ferrum ignitum cum igne.	 "But if it is not possible with them, then take a hollow reed and insert it into the patient's throat until it reaches the leech; then insert into the hollow of the reed a heated iron with fire.
Fac illud multotiens: et abstineat infirmus ab aqua tota die.	 "Do this many times, and let the patient abstain from water all day.
Deinde accipiat uitreatam plenam aqua frigida, et aperiat os eius in ea: et colluat os suum cum ea, et non deglutiat ex ea aliquid: et moueat aquam una hora post aliam cum manu sua.	 "Then let the patient take a drink of cold water and open his mouth wide over it; and let him rinse his mouth with it, but not swallow any of it; and move the water in one hour after another with his hand." ・
Sanguisuga enim ilico cum sentit aquam cadit.	 "For a leech immediately falls when it feels water.
Si autem non egreditur cum eo quod narrauimus, tunc suffumiga infirmum cum cimicibus, aut cum asa cum instrumento quod narraui in suffumigatione uuulae.	 "But if it does not come out with what I have told you, then fumigate the patient with bedbugs or with anise using the instrument that I described for fumigating the throat.
Fac illud multotiens, quoniam ipsa cadet.	 This is often the case, since it will fall itself.
Et modus operationis in suffumigatione est, ut accipias ollam, in qua sint prunae uiuae cum igne: et olla sit cooperta cum coopertorio, in cuius medio sit foramen: et componatur in illo foramine extremitas instrumenti.	 And the method of operation in fumigation is as follows: take a pot in which there are live coals with fire, and let the pot be covered with a cover, in whose middle there is an opening; and arrange in that opening the end of the instrument.
Deinde proiice suffumigationem, et ponat infirmus os suum in extremitate cannulae, et claudat os suum, ut non egrediatur suffumigatio, donec scias quod suffumigatio iam peruenit ad sanguisugam.	 Then pour the fumigation and let the patient put his mouth on the end of the tube and close his mouth so that the fumigation does not escape until you know that the fumigation has already reached the leech.
Nam sanguisuga statim cadet.	 For the leech will immediately fall.
Quod si non cadit, tunc itera suffumigationem multotiens.	 And if it does not fall, then repeat the fumigation many times.
Et toleret infirmus sitim, et comedat salsa, et allia, et non bibat aquam.	 And let the patient endure thirst and eat salted and garlic foods, and not drink water.
Necesse est ergo ut egrediatur cum hoc regimine.	 It is therefore necessary that it will exit with this diet.
Et haec est forma instrumenti cum quo extrahitur sanguisuga ex gutture, quando cadit super ipsam uisus.	 And this is the form of the instrument with which the leech is drawn from the throat when it falls upon the very sight.
Est simile forcipibus, sicut uides: nisi quia est ei haee curuitas quae intromittitur ad guttur.	 It is similar to tongs, as you see: except that it has this curve which is inserted into the throat.
Et extremitas eius similis ori auis quae nominatur ciconia, in quo est asperitas limae: quando comprehendit aliquid, non dimittit ipsum omnino.	 And its end is similar to the beak of a bird which is called a stork, on which there is the roughness of a file; when it grasps something, it does not let it go at all.
¶ De apertione Apostematum, et eorum sectione, et cura in genere.	 § On the opening and sectioning of apostemes, and their general care.
Caput XL.	 Chapter 40.
Apostematum species sunt multae, multorum modorum, secundum quod uenit rememoratio eorum, scilicet unius, et unius in hoc libro: et sunt diuersae in perforatione eorum, et sectione ipsorum ex duobus modis.	 There are many kinds of apostemes, of various types, as will be recalled in this book; and there are two ways to open them and cut them out.
Quorum unus est ex specie apostematis in seipso, et eo quod comprehendit ex humiditatibus.	 One is from the nature of the aposteme itself, and from that which it contains of humors. ️
Et modus secundus est propter loca, in quibus accidit ex corpore.	 And the second method is because of the places in the body where they occur.
Quoniam apostema accidens in capite, est aliud ab apostemate accidente in ano: et apostema accidens in loco carnoso, est aliud ab apostemate accidente in iuncturis: et unicuique eorum est iudicium suum ex operatione.	 Because an aposteme occurring in the head is different from one occurring in the anus; and an aposteme occurring in a fleshy place is different from one occurring in joints; and each of them has its own judgment based on their location.
Et ex apostematibus sunt quae non oportet ut perforentur, nisi post maturationem saniei in eis, et complementum eius: et ex eis sunt, quae oportet ut perforentur, dum sunt cruda, et non maturantur secundum complementum.	 And of aposteme (abscess) there are those which should not be pierced unless after the maturation of pus in them and its completion; and there are those which should be pierced while they are fresh and do not mature according to their due course.
Sicut apostemata quae sunt propinqua iuncturis.	 Like apostemes (abscesses) that are close to joints.
Quoniam apostema quando accidit prope iuncturam, et prolongatur esse eius, donec putrefit quod est in circumitu eius fortasse corrumpuntur ligamenta, aut nerui illius iuncturae: quare est caussa propior contractionis illius membri.	 For an apostema (abscess) that occurs near a joint and its duration is prolonged until it putrefies, which is in its circumference, perhaps the ligaments or nerves of that joint are corrupted; therefore, it is the cause of the contraction of that limb.
Aut est apostema apud membrum principale: quoniam si tu tardas perforationem eius, donec maturetur, nocebit uel illi, uel per illud membro principali.	 Or it is an aposteme (abscess) in the main limb; for if you delay its perforation until it matures, it will harm either that or the main limb itself.
Aut est prope anum, perfora ergo ipsum immaturum: et non oportet, ut perfores, apostema crudum, non completae digestionis, nisi quod est prope anum, ut non putrefiat profundum, et longetur ad interiora ani, et fiat fistula, aut fiat in termino eius quod non sanatur.	 Or it is near the anus; therefore, perforate it while it is immature and not fully digested, except for a raw aposteme (abscess), unless it is near the anus so that it does not putrefy deep and reach the interior of the anus and become a fistula, or end in something that does not heal. 》
Oportet ut scias horam perforationis apostematis, quod maturatum est secundum complementum: et est apud sedationem doloris, recessionem febris, et diminutionem rubedinis, et pulsationis, et acuitatem capitis apostematis: et reliqua signa.	 You should know the hour of perforating an aposteme (abscess) that has matured according to its course; and it is at the remission of pain, the subsiding of fever, and the diminishing of redness, pulsation, and the sharpness of the head of the abscess, and other signs. 》 》
Et oportet, ut facias eandem perforationem in inferiori loco apostematis, et uehementioris eminentiae: et sit perforatio uadens in longitudine corporis, si apostemata sunt in partibus manuum et pedum, et locis lacertorum, et chordarum, et neruorum, et arteriarum, et ad ultimum in omnibus locis aequalibus, quibus non est reflexio.	 And you should make the same perforation in the lower part of the aposteme (abscess) and in the more prominent swelling; and the perforation should go along the length of the body if the abscesses are in the parts of the hands and feet, and places of the upper arms, tendons, nerves, arteries, and finally in all equal places where there is no reflection.
In illis autem quae reflectuntur, uade cum perforatione secundum illud membrum.	 In those that are reflected, proceed with a perforation along that membrane.
Quando uero apostema est in locis carnosis: tunc melius est ut dimittas perforationem eius, donec confirmetur eius digestio, sicut diximus secundum complementum.	 When, however, the abscess is in fleshy parts: then it is better to leave its perforation until its digestion is confirmed, as we have said at the end.
Quoniam si tu perforas ipsum ante illud, prolongatur cursus uirus ex eo, et est multae sordis et sordiciei, et fortasse indurantur labia eius, et profunditas eius.	 For if you perforate it beforehand, the course of the discharge from it is prolonged, and there is much filth and filthiness, and perhaps its edges become hardened, and its depth.
Et quaedam apostemata perforantur secundum latitudinem corporis apud necessitatem: aut secundum illud quo indiget membrum.	 And some abscesses are perforated according to the width of the body as needed, or according to what that part requires.
Et oportet, ut administres in apostematibus paruis perforationem paruam, et in apostematibus magnis perforationem amplam: aut sectiones multas per similitudinem magnitudinis apostematis.	 And you should administer a small perforation for small abscesses and a large perforation or multiple cuts similar to the size of the abscess for large ones.
Et sunt ex apostematibus, in quibus oportet ut concauetur cutis: et incidatur quando iam facta est sicut pannus, et facta est in termino, quod iam mortua est: sicut illud quod accidit in multis, ut dubelet, et bubonibus.	 And there are abscesses for which the skin must be hollowed out and cut when it has already been made like a cloth and its end has died, as often happens with doublets and buboes.
Et ex eis sunt quae secantur sectione habente tres angulos.	 And among them are those that are cut with a three-angled incision.
Et ex eis est, ex quo inciditur sicut figura folii myrti.	 And among them is the one that is cut like the shape of a myrtle leaf.
Sicut apostema inguinum.	 Like an inguinal abscess.
Et ex eis sunt in quibus administratur sectio rotunda, et sectio lunaris: et similes eis ex sectionibus.	 And among them are those in which a round incision and a crescent-shaped incision, and similar ones from other incisions, are administered.  />
Illud uero cui non est caput, sicut sunt apostemata lenia superficialia, oportet ut perfores ipsum perforatione superficiali, uel plana tantum.	 However, that which has no head, like the soft and superficial abscesses, should be perforated with a superficial or flat perforation only.
Et oportet, quando apostema est grossum, et iam collegit saniem multam, et perforas ipsum, ut non properes et extrahas pus totum in illa hora: imo extrahe ex ipso partem eius.	 And when the abscess is thick and has already collected much pus, and you perforate it, do not hurry and extract all the pus at that time; rather, extract a part of it from it.
Deinde opila apostema usque ad diem alium.	 Then pack the abscess until another day.
Deinde extrahe quiddam ex pus iterum.	 Then extract something from the pus again.
Fac illud multotiens secundum gradationem, donec egrediatur: praecipue si infirmus est debilis uirtutis, aut mulier praegnans, aut puer paruus, aur senex decrepitus: spiritus enim animalis ab animali multotiens resoluitur cum egressione saniei: et fortasse moritur infirmus, et tu non percipis.	 Do this many times according to the degree, until it comes out; especially if the patient is weak in strength, or a pregnant woman, or a small child, or an old decrepit person: for the vital spirit of the animal is often resolved from the animal with the coming out of the pus; and perhaps the patient will die, and you do not perceive it.
Caue ergo hoc capitulum cautela magna.	 Therefore, beware this chapter with great caution.
Et post perforationem tuam, qua ista perforas apostemata, oportet ut abstergas uulnus: et considera.	 And after your perforation, by which you perforate these boils, it is necessary that you clean the wound; and be careful.
Si ergo est uulnus apostematis paruum, aut est sectio plana, tunc administra licinia ex lino, aut coto antiquo.	 If therefore the boil is small, or if it is a flat section, then apply dressings of linen, or old cotton.
Et si est apostema magnum, et fissurae perforationis multae sunt, oportet tunc ut intromittas in omnem fissuram licinium, donec perueniant adinuicem.	 And if the boil is large, and there are many fissures from the perforations, it is necessary then to insert a dressing into each fissure, until they come together.
Et si in apostemate abscidisti partem cutis, aut in circumitu concauasti eam: tunc oportet ut impleas eam coto ueteri, aut sicut quando texitur pannus, aut raditur lanugine lini absque humiditate: et stringe ipsum usque ad tertium diem.	 And if in the boil you have cut off a part of the skin, or concaved it around; then it is necessary that you fill it with old cotton, or as when a cloth is woven, or shorn of linen wool without moisture: and bind it until the third day.
Deinde proiice ipsum, et cura illud cum eo quod oportet ex unguento, donec sanetur.	 Then discard it, and treat it with that which is necessary from an ointment, until it heals.
Si autem accidat fluxus sanguinis in hora tuae operationis, tunc administra aquam frigidam, et acetum, postquam imbibitur in eis pannus: et ponis ipsum super locum fluxus sanguinis multotiens.	 But if bleeding occurs during your operation, then apply cold water and vinegar, after the cloth has soaked in them: and place it on the site of the bleeding many times.
Si autem perseuerat fluxus sanguinis, tunc oportet ut administres regimen, et curationem, et pulueres, quae narraui in locis multis huius nostri libri, et ex diuisione.	 But if the bleeding persists, then it is necessary that you administer a regimen and care and powders, which I have described in many places of this book of ours, and in the section on division.
Si autem est in tempore hyemis, et locus apostematis est multorum neruorum: tunc oportet ut infundas puluillos cum uino, et oleo calidis: et ponas eos super loca.	 But if it is during the winter and the site of the boil is of many nerves; then it is necessary that you pour hot powders with wine and oil on them: and place them on the sites.
Et si fuerit in aestate, et loca sunt carnosa: tunc oportet ut ponas puluillos imbibitos in aqua, et oleo, aut eum uino et oleo, et totum illud frigidum.	 And if it is summer and the places are fleshy: then you should place small cloths soaked in water and oil, or with wine and oil, and all of that cold.
Donec quando erit dies tertius, sicut diximus, tunc oportet ut soluas apostema, et abstergas ipsum, et administres in curatione eius quod ei conuenit, donec sanetur.	 Until the third day, as we said, then you should release the abscess and cleanse it, and administer to its care what is suitable for it, until it heals.
Hoc est ergo quod necessarium est ex cognitione curationis apostematum uniuersaliter.	 Therefore, this is what is necessary for the universal knowledge of the treatment of abscesses.
Secundum semitam uero distinctionis, iam dixi de omni apostemate, qualiter est uia ad curationem eius capitulatim singulariter.	 According to the second half of the division, I have already spoken about every abscess, how there is a way to its cure individually and in chapters.
¶ De sectione apostematum quae accidunt in cute capitis.	 ¶ About the incision of abscesses that occur on the skin of the head.
Caput XLI.	 Chapter 41.
Accidunt in cute capitis apostemata parua, et sunt ex speciebus Nodorum, quos continent tunicae, quae sunt eis sacci: quasi ipsa sint hausolati gallinae.	 Abscesses occur on the skin of the head and are small in size; they are of the type called nodules, enclosed by tunics which are bags for them, as if they were eggs of a hen.
Et ipsorum species sunt multae.	 And their types are many.
Ex eis sunt pingues: et ex eis sunt quae continent humiditatem similem limo: et ex eis quae continent humiditatem similem frisatis et pultibus: et eis similibus, et ex eis sunt, quae sunt lapidea dura.	 Among them are fatty ones; and among them are those that contain a moisture like clay; and among them are those that contain a moisture like crushed grains or poultices, and similar substances; and among them are hard stony ones.
Et in sectione omnium, et ipsorum extractione non est timor, dum apud ipsorum sectionem non facit contrarietatem arteria.	 And in the incision of all of these and their removal there is no danger, as long as during their incision a vein does not cause a contrary action.
Et operatio in sectione eorum est, ut experiaris ea cum instrumento, cuius forma uenit post haec, quod nominatur Intromissum, donec scias quid contineat.	 And the operation in their incision is as follows: you should test them with an instrument, whose form will be shown afterwards, which is called a probe, until you know what it contains.
Nam si est illud quod continet humiditas, tunc seca ipsum sectione secundum longitudinem sectione superficiali: secundum hanc formam.	 For if that which it contains is moisture, then cut it with a lengthwise incision with a shallow incision in this manner.
Et incipe cum sectione ex linea b. ad lineam, g. Cum ergo euacuatur humiditas, tunc excoria kistin quae continet illam humiditatem, et non dimittas ex ea aliquid penitus.	 And begin with the incision from line b to line g. When therefore the moisture has been evacuated, then remove the bag that contains that moisture, and do not leave anything of it at all.
Multotiens enim redit, si remanet ex ea aliquid.	 Indeed, it often returns if something of it remains.
Deinde submerge cotum in unguento aegyptio, si est praesens: et si non, in aqua et sale: et imple cum eo uulnus, et dimitte ipsum usque ad diem alium.	 Then submerge the cotton in Egyptian ointment, if it is present; and if not, in water and salt; and fill the wound with it, and leave it until the next day.
Ipsum enim corrodet quod remansit ex kisti.	 For it will eat away what remains of the tumor.
Deinde itera super ipsum cotum cum aegyptio secundo, et tertio, et si indiges illo, donec confidas quia non remanserit ex kisti aliquid, tunc enim cura uulnus cum unguento, donec sanetur.	 Then repeat the application of Egyptian ointment on the cotton a second and third time, and if necessary, continue doing so until you are confident that nothing remains of the tumor; then treat the wound with the ointment until it heals.
Quod si apostema continet nodum pinguem: tunc seca ipsum secundum hanc formam, sectione habente formam crucis: et proiice uncinos inter duolabia sectionis, et excoria ipsum ab omni parte: et conare uirtutem tuam in extractione tunicae quae continet ipsum.	 If the tumor contains a fatty lump, then cut it in the following manner, making a cross-shaped incision; and throw away the hooks between the edges of the incision, and excise it from all sides; and strive with your skill to extract the membrane that contains it.
Si autem contrarietatem facit tibi arteria, tunc fac illud quod narrabo tibi post.	 But if a blood vessel opposes you, then do what I will tell you afterwards.
Et similiter fac in apostemate, si est lapideum, ex sectione, et curatione eadem, secundum quod diximus.	 And do likewise with a stone-like tumor, through incision and the same treatment, as we have said.
Et sectio super apostema lapideum est facilior: quoniam est pauci sanguinis et humiditatis.	 The incision on a stone-like tumor is easier, for it has little blood and moisture.
Et quandoque sunt quaedam horum apostematum quae sunt in capite in quibusdam hominibus, cum quibus penitus non est humiditas.	 And sometimes there are certain of these tumors which are on the head in some people, and with which there is no moisture at all.
Quod est: quia ego secui super apostema in capite mulieris uetulae, et inueni apostema sicut lapis solidus et durus, asper, albus, qui non poterat frangi: et si percuteretur cum eo aliquis proiiciendo, uulnerat ipsum.	 Which is to say: for I incised a tumor on the head of an old woman, and found the tumor like a solid, hard, rough, white stone that could not be broken; and if anyone struck it by throwing something at it, they would wound themselves.
In aliis uero apostematibus accidentibus in capite, praeter haec scilicet apostemata quae accidunt in capitibus puerorum, et apud radices aurium, sectio eorum omnium sit sectio superficialis.	 But in other tumors occurring on the head, besides these particular tumors which occur on children's heads and at the roots of the ears, the incision for all of them should be a superficial one.
Vel pone perforationem eorum semper ab inferiori parte eorum, ut alleuietur cursus saniei ad inferiora.	 Place the perforation of them always from their lower part, so that the course of the pus is relieved to the lower part.
Deinde cura ea cum eo quod conuenit eis ex curatione.	 Then treat it with what suits them from the treatment.
¶ De sectione Strophularum in collo.	 § On the incision of abscesses in the neck.
Caput XLII.	 Chapter 42.
Multotiens acccidunt ista apostemata in collo, et sub assellis, et inguinibus: et quandoque accidunt in reliquo corpore.	 Often these abscesses occur in the neck and under the armpits and in the groins; and sometimes they occur in other parts of the body.
Et super illa quae ex eis accidunt in collo, sunt unum, et multa: et generantur ab inuicem: et omnis Strophula ex eis est intra tunicam propriam ei, sicut est in nodis et apostematibus capitis, sicut narrauimus.	 And among those that occur in the neck are one and many; and they generate from each other; and every abscess among them is within its own proper tunic, just as in the nodes and abscesses of the head, as we have said. 》
Et species harum Strophularum sunt multae.	 And there are many types of these abscesses.
Et ex eis enim sunt lapideae: et ex eis sunt quae continent humiditates: et ex eis sunt malignae, quae non obediunt curationi.	 Among them are stony ones, and among them are those that contain liquids, and among them are malignant ones, which do not obey treatment.
In illa ergo quam ex eis uides bonae dispositionis in tactu, cuius manifestum est propinquum colori cutis, et mouetur ad omnem partem, et non est annexa cum neruis colli, neque cum guidegi, neque cum arteria, neque est profunda: oportet ut seces eam sectione superficiali a superiori parte ad inferiorem partem corporis ex linea, b. ad lineam, g. et excoria eam ab omni parte: et extende duo labia cutis cum uncino, aut cum uncinis multis, si indiges illo, sicut diximus in apostematibus capitis, et extrahe eam paulatim.	 Therefore, when you see one among them that is of good disposition by touch, whose appearance is close to the color of the skin and moves toward every part, and which is not attached to the nerves of the neck nor to the windpipe nor to the artery, and is not deep; it is necessary that you incise it with a superficial incision from the upper part to the lower part of the body along line b. to line g., and excoriate it from all sides; and spread the two lips of the skin with hooks or with many hooks if you need them, as we have said regarding the abscesses of the head, and extract it little by little.
Et est super cautelam, ut non incidatur uena, aut neruus.	 And it is cautious to ensure that no vein or nerve is cut.
Et sit spatumile non acutum ualde: ut non addat tibi manum tuam cum incisione, aut inquietet infirmum, et incidas quod non est necesse.	 And let the knife not be very sharp, so that it does not make your hand slip during the incision or trouble the patient, and you do not cut what is not necessary.
Si autem incidis uenam, aut arteriam, aut prohibet te ab operatione, tunc pone in uulnus zegi tritum, aut quosdam pulueres qui abscindunt sanguinem, et stringe uulnus, et dimitte ipsum, donec quiescat acuitas apostematis, et mollificetur uulnus: uel incipit et uult putrefieri.	 But if you cut a vein or artery and it prevents you from operating, then place ground-up gum or certain powders that curdle the blood in the wound, and bind the wound, and leave it alone until the sharpness of the abscess subsides and the wound softens; or it begins to want to putrefy. 》 》 》
Nam sanguis abscinditur tuncia Redi ergo ad operationem tuam, donec compleas.	 And the blood is cut off by the tunica. Return then to your operation until you complete it.
Deinde inquire digito tuo indice, si remansit aliquid ex Strophulis aliis paruis: ergo incide eas, et munda eas.	 Then explore with your index finger if there is any remnant of other small strophulae: cut them and clean them out.
Quod si est in radice Strophulae uena magna: tunc oportet ut non incidas illam Strophulam ex radice sua: imo oportet ut liges eam cum filo duplato forti, et dimittas eam donec cadat per se absque nocumento.	 If the strophula is rooted in a large vein, you should not cut it from its root. Instead, bind it with a strong double thread and leave it until it falls off by itself without harm.
Deinde imple uulnus coto ueteri, quod iam submersisti in unguento aegyptio.	 Then fill the wound with old cotton that you have already soaked in Egyptian ointment.
Deinde cura ipsum.	 Then care for him (the patient).
Si inciditur Strophula tota, tunc oportet ut aggreges labia duo uulneris: et suas ipsum statim, postquam uides quia prorsus non remansit superfluitas.	 If the entire strophula is cut off, you should gather together the two lips of the wound and suture it immediately, after seeing that there is no longer any excess fluid.
Si autem uides quod remansit superfluitas propter magnitudinem Strophulae, tunc oportet ut intendas ad incidendam radicem eius, et extrahendam eam: et administra suturam quam diximus.	 However, if you see that there is still excess fluid due to the size of the strophula, you should then aim to cut its root and remove it; and apply the suture as we have said.
Et quae ex Strophulis continet humiditates, perfora illam perforatione superficiali: ut appareat tibi locus maturitatis eius: et pone perforationem ab eo quod sequitur inferius corporis, sicut diximus.	 And those strophulae which contain humors should be perforated with a superficial perforation, so that the place of their maturity may appear to you; and make the perforation towards what is below in the body, as we have said.
Deinde administra post perforationem licinia cum unguento, et similia eis, ut corrodat quod remansit ex corruptione, donec quando uides uulnus iam mundatum esse: tunc cura ipsum cum unguento generatiuo carnis, donec sanetur.	 Then after perforation, apply linen with ointment and similar things so that it may consume what remains of the corruption; and when you see that the wound is already clean, then care for him with a flesh-generating ointment until he heals.
¶ De sectione Epiglotis ab apostemate intra guttur accidente.	 About the incision of the epiglottis due to an abscess happening within the throat.
Caput XLIII.	 Chapter 43.
Dixerunt antiqui hanc sectionem in Epigloti, et non uidi aliquem in terra nostra, qui eam fecerit: et haec est scriptura sermonis eorum.	 The ancients spoke of this incision of the epiglottis, and I have not seen anyone in our land who has performed it; and this is their written account. 》
In habentibus autem synanchiam, oportet ut deuitetur sectio Epiglotis: cum non fiat iuuamentum per illud: propterea, quod omnes uenae et pulmo sunt infirmi.	 In those who have a hernia, the incision of the epiglottis should be avoided, as it will not be helpful; because all the veins and lungs are weak.
In illis uero qui habent apostema calidum in ore, aut gutture, aut duabus amigdalis, quando non est aegritudo in cannali, oportet uti sectione Epiglotis, ad fugiendum ex perditione quae fit ex praefocatione.	 In those who have a hot abscess in the mouth or throat or on both tonsils, when there is no pain in the throat, it is necessary to use the incision of the epiglottis to avoid death from suffocation.
Oportet ergo quando uolumus illud, ut secemus Epiglotim sub tribus circulis Epiglotis, aut quatuor, sectione parua per latitudinem, in eo quod est inter duos circulos per quantitatem, quod sit sectio in sifac, non in cartilagine: et iste quidem locus est conueniens sectioni, quoniam est priuatus carne, et uasa sanguinis ab eo sunt longinqua.	 Therefore, when we wish to do this, we should cut the epiglottis under three or four circular ridges of the epiglottis with a small incision in width between two ridges so that the incision is in cartilage, not in bone: and this place is suitable for incision because it is free from flesh, and the blood vessels are far from it.
Quod si medicator est timidus, tunc oportet ut extendat cutem gutturis cum uncino.	 If the physician is timid, then he should stretch the skin of the throat with a hook.
Deinde findat cutem, donec quando peruenit ad cannalem: deuitet uas sanguinis, si uidet ex eis aliquid.	 Then let him prick the skin until he reaches the throat; avoid the blood vessels if he sees any of them.
Deinde secet sifac quod narrauimus: et significatur super sectionem cannalis ex phlegmate quod egreditur ex ea, cum eo quod disrumpitur, et abscisione uocis.	 Then let him cut the cartilage as we have described; and it is indicated over the incision of the throat from the mucus that comes out of it, with what is broken, and loss of voice.
Et dimitte uulnus apertum tempore aliquo.	 And leave the wound open for some time.
Cum ergo remouetur hora in qua timetur praefocatio, aggrega duo labia uulneris cutis, et sue ipsam solam absque cartilagine.	 Therefore, when the hour approaches in which one fears suffocation, join the two lips of the skin wound, or just the skin alone without the cartilage.
Deinde administra medicinas quae faciunt nasci carnem, usquequo sanetur.	 Then administer medicines that promote tissue growth until it heals.
Inquit Albucasis.	 Said Al-Zahrawi.
Summa huius sermonis quem narrauimus, expositio non est, nisi quando uident, quod aliquod horum apostematum iam opilauit guttur infirmi: et sublimatus est infirmus super mortem, et uult intersecari anhelitus eius: uadunt ad secandum Epiglotim, ut respiret infirmus super locum uulneris quadam respiratione, et saluetur a morte: et propter hoc praeceperunt dimittere uulnus apertum, donec consumatur malicia aegritudinis, et est malicia eius tribus diebus, et quasi ipsa: tunc ergo praecaeperunt suere uulnus, et curare ipsum, donec sanetur.	 The summary of the discussion we have presented is this: its explanation is only when they see that any one of these abscesses has filled the throat of the sick person and lifted him up to death, and he wishes to cut off his breath, they go to cut the epiglottis so that the sick person breathes over the place of the wound with a certain breath and is saved from death. And for this reason they commanded that the wound be left open until the wickedness of the illness is consumed, and its wickedness lasts three days or thereabouts; then they commanded to close the wound and heal it until it heals. ">
Et illud quod uidi per me ipsum est, quod una ancilla accaepit cultellum, et misit cum in guttur suum, et incidit cum eo partem cannalis pulmonis.	 And that which I saw with my own eyes is that a maidservant took a knife and thrust it into her throat, and cut with it a part of the lung's passageway.
Et uocatus sum ad curationem eius, et inueni eam mugire, sicut est mugitus mortui.	 And I was called to treat her, and I found her moaning as if she were dying.
Detexi ergo a uulnere, et inueni sanguinem qui egressus fuerat ex uulnere paruum.	 Therefore, I untied from the wound, and I found blood that had come out of the small wound.
Confisus ergo sum, quod ipsa non absciderat uenam, neque guidegi: et uentus egrediebatur ex uulnere.	 So I became certain that she herself had not cut a vein or artery; and air was coming out of the wound.  \\
Properaui ergo, et sui uulnus, et curaui ipsum, donec sanum est: et non accidit ancillae aliquid, nisi raucedo in uoce: et rediit post dies ad meliorem dispositionum suarum.	 So I hastened and sutured the wound and treated it until it was healed; and nothing else happened to the maidservant except for hoarseness of voice, and after a few days she returned to her usual state.
Hinc ergo dico: quod in sectione Epiglotis non est timor.	 Therefore I say that in cutting the epiglottis there is no danger.
¶ De sectione Herniae gutturis.	 ¶ On the incision of a neck hernia.
Caput XLIIII.	 Chapter 44
Hoc Apostema nominatum Hernia gutturis, est apostema magnum, secundum colorem corporis: et est in mulieribus multum.	 This swelling called a neck hernia is a large swelling the color of flesh, and it occurs frequently in women.
Et est secundum duos modos: aut enim est naturale: aut est accidentale.	 And there are two types: either it is natural or it is acquired.
In naturali certe non est ingenium.	 In the natural type, certainly there is no intelligence.
Accidentale uero est secundum duos modos: quorum unus est similis nodis pinguibus.	 The acquired type, however, occurs in two ways; one of which is similar to fatty knots.  ///
Et modus alter, est similis apostemati quod fit ex nodatione arteriae.	 And the other type is similar to the swelling that results from the knotting of an artery.  ///
Et in ipso est timor, et non oportet ut praesumptio fiat ad ipsum cum ferro, nisi in eo quod est paruum: et tu proba ipsum, et inuestiga ipsum cum Intromisso.	 And there is danger in it, and one should not presume to cut into it with an iron except when it is small; and you should test it and examine it with a probe.
Si ergo inuenis ipsum simile nodo pingui, et non est suspensum cum aliqua uenarum: tunc seca ipsum, sicut secantur nodi: et extrahe ipsum cum eo quod continet ex kisti, si est in kisti: et si non, tunc perscrutare totum eius.	 If you find it similar to a fatty knot and not attached to any veins, then cut into it as one cuts a knot; and extract it with what it contains from the sac, if it is in a sac; and if not, then examine its entirety.
Deinde cura locum cum eo quod oportet ex curatione, donec sanetur.	 Then care for the place with what is necessary from the treatment until it heals.
¶ De sectione super species Nodorum.	 Of the section on swollen lumps.
Caput XLV.	 Chapter 45.
Nodorum multae sunt species, et ego iam dixi omnes species eorum in diuisione: et oportet ut narrem hic differentiam inter Nodum, et Exituram: cum sit dubitationem faciens.	 There are many kinds of swollen lumps, and I have already mentioned all their types in the division; and it is necessary that I describe here the difference between a swollen lump and an abscess, since there is doubt about it.
Dico ergo, quod cum Exitura est caliditas, et febris, et dolores uehementes, donec sedatur ebullitio superfluitatis, et completur putrefactio: tunc enim quiescunt febris et calor.	 I say therefore that when it is an abscess, there is heat, fever, and severe pain until the bubbling of the superfluity settles down and the putrefaction is completed; then indeed the fever and heat subside.
Cum Nodo uero non est caliditas, neque febris, neque dolores, et continet eos kistis sifachin, qui est eis saccus proprius, et est secundum colorem corporis: et est incaeptio eorum sicut cicer, et fit sicut batecha, et maior et minor.	 But when it is a swollen lump, there is no heat, nor fever, nor pain, and a kistis called sifachin contains them, which is their proper sac, and it is according to the color of the body; and its beginning is like a chickpea, and it becomes like a watermelon, larger or smaller. ︎
Et sunt secundum duas species: aut pingues: aut continent humiditatem.	 And they are of two types: either fatty, or containing moisture.
Et colores humiditatis sunt multi, secundum quod dixi in diuisione.	 The colors of the moisture are many, as I said in the division.
Oportet ergo, quando peruenis ad curationem Nodi, ut experiaris eum, et inquiras ipsum in primis cum instrumento quod nominatur Intromissum, secundum quod ueniet forma eius in capitulo quod est post hoc.	 Therefore, when you come to the treatment of a swollen lump, you should examine it and investigate it first with an instrument called Intromissum, according to its form which will be shown in the chapter that follows this one.
Et modus inquisitionis apostematum, et Nodorum omnium est, ut accipias hoc instrumentum, et intromittas ipsum in humidiorem locum, quem inuenis in apostemate: et tu reuolue digitos tuos cum eo paulatim, donec scias quod instrumentum iam penetrauit cutem.	 And the way of investigating all swollen lumps and tumors is to take this instrument and insert it into the moistest part that you find in the swelling; and you should turn your fingers with it little by little, until you know that the instrument has already penetrated the skin.
Deinde ultima manum tuam secundum mensuram magnitudinis apostematis.	 Then you should place your hand according to the size of the swelling.
Deinde extrahe Intromissum, et considera illud quod egrediur in uestigio eius.	 Then remove the Intromissum and examine what comes out in its wake.
Si ergo egreditur humiditas currens, quicunque color sit: tunc seca ipsum sectione superficiali, secundum quod dixi in reliquis apostematibus.	 If therefore a running moisture comes out, whatever its color may be, then cut it with a superficial incision, as I said in other swellings. ︎ ︎
Et si non egreditur humiditas in uestigio Intromissi, tunc scias quia est pinguis: seca ergo super ipsum sectione habente formam crucis, secundum formam hanc, sicut docui te: et suspende ipsum cum uncinis, et excoria cutem ab omni parte cum facilitate: et custodi kistin si potes super illud, ut extrahas ipsam sanam cum Nodo.	 And if the moisture does not exit the wound after the insertion, then you should know that it is fatty: therefore, cut above it with a cross-shaped incision as I have taught you; and suspend it with hooks, and strip away the skin from all sides easily; and preserve kistin over it, if you can, so that you may extract it healthy with a knot.
Si autem disrumpitur kistis apud operationem, et non est possibile extrahere ipsam sanam, multotiens enim accidit illud, tunc extrahe ipsam frustatim, donec non remaneat ex ea aliquid.	 But if the kist [cyst] bursts during the operation and it is not possible to extract it whole, for this often happens, then remove it piece by piece until nothing remains of it.
Nam si remanet ex ea aliquid parum, aut multum, redit Nodus secundum plurimum.	 For if any part of it, whether small or large, remains, the swelling will return to a great extent.
Quod si uincit te, et remanet ex eo parum: tunc imple uulnus apud completionem tuam, quibusdam pulueribus corrosiuis acutis: et stringe uulnus, et pone supra ipsum quod sedet apostema calidum, et cura ipsum cum reliqua curatione, donec sanetur.	 But if you are overcome and some part of it remains; then fill the wound at its conclusion with certain sharp corrosive powders; and bind the wound, and place a hot poultice over it, and treat it with the rest of the treatment until it heals.
Si ergo est Nodus magnus, tunc sue duo labia eius, et cura ipsum cum eo quod incarnat.	 Therefore, if it is a large swelling, then either separate its two lips, and treat it with what makes it heal.
Si autem est tibi contraria uena pulsatilis, aut non pulsatilis: tunc propera, et imple locum zegi trito, et dimitte ipsum strictum duobus diebus, aut tribus, donec putrefiat uulnus, et quiescat ebullitio sanguinis: deinde redi ad incidendum illud quod remansit ex Nodo.	 But if the vein is contrary to you, either pulsating or non-pulsating; then hurry and fill the place with ground zegh [a type of plant], and leave it bound for two days, or three, until the wound putrefies and the ebullition of the blood ceases; then return to cutting what remains of the swelling.
¶ De foris instrumentorum pro sectione et perforatione.	 ¶ On external instruments for cutting and piercing.
Caput XLVI.	 Chapter 46.
EX Eis sunt formae Intromissorum, et sunt trium specierum.	 From these are the forms of Intromission, and they are of three types.
Ex eis enim est magnum, et ex eis est medium, et ex eis est paruum.	 Of these there is a large one, and of these there is a medium one, and of these there is a small one.
Fiant ex ferro alfulud quadratarum extremitatum decenter, ut festinent introitum in apostemate.	 They should be made from square-ended iron files, so that they may hasten entry into the cyst.
Et istae sunt formae Experientium, et no, id est, perforantia: et unum eorum nominatur beris, idest, peforans: et sunt trium specierum.	 And these are the forms of Surgeries, that is, incisions; and one of them is called beriś, that is, incision; and there are three types.
Ex eis enim est magnum, et medium, et paruum.	 For among them there is the large, the middle, and the small.
Conueniunt, ut inuestigentur per ea apostemata, et exiturae, et fistulae, et bubones ab eo quod inter ea est ex ossibus.	 They are suitable for investigating through them boils, excretions, fistulas, and abscesses that are between the bones.
Et aliis fiunt rotunda, tersa, lenia, sicut acus magnae quibus subsellia suuntur, ex citrino scilicet, aut ex aere, aut ferro, aut argento.	 And others are made round, smooth, and gentle, like large needles with which upholstery is sewn, that is, from brass or iron or silver.
Et meliora eorum sunt quae fiunt ex citrino.	 And the best of them are those made of brass.
Et fiunt Experientia etiam de plumbo nigro, quae conueniunt ut per ea experiantur fistulae, quarum concauitate sunt reflexiones, ut reflectantur cum lenitate sua cum illis reflexionibus.	 And surgeries are also made of black lead, which are suitable for examining through them fistulas that have hollows, so that they may be examined with their gentleness and those hollows. 》
Et sunt iterum trium specierum.	 And again, there are three types.
Quoniam ex eis sunt longa, ex eis media, et ex eis breuia, secundum quantitatem amplitudinis fistulae et stricturae eius.	 For from them there are long ones, medium ones, and short ones, according to the width of the fistula and its narrowness.
Forma Vncinorum, et sunt multarum specierum.	 The form of incisions, and they are of many types.
Quoniam ex eis sunt simplices, scilicet quibus est curuitas una: et sunt trium specierum sicut uides, Magni, Medii, et Parui.	 For from them there are simple ones, that is, those which have one curve; and they are of three types as you see: large, medium, and small.
Et ex eis sunt Vncini caeci: et sunt trium specierum.	 And from them are blind incisions, and they are of three types.
Et ex eis sunt uncini habentes duas curuaturas, et sunt trium specierum: et ex eis sunt uncini habentes tres curuaturas, et sunt trium specierum: et omnes isti sunt necessarii in loco suo.	 And from them are incisions having two curves, and they are of three types; and from them are incisions having three curves, and they are of three types; and all these are necessary in their place.
Et istae sunt formae Scalpellorum, quibus secantur et excoriantur Nodi, et apostemata: et sunt trium specierum: quoniam ex eis est magnum, medium, et paruum.	 And these are the forms of scalpels with which nodes and boils are cut and scraped; and they are of three types, for from them there is a large one, a medium one, and a small one.
Eorum extremitates quibus fit sectio sunt acutae, extremitates aliae sunt non acutae: et non ponuntur taliter, nisi ut cum eis fiat iuuamentum in excoriatione Nodorum apud timorem incisionis uenae, aut nerui: et ut sanetur per ea infirmus, et inueniat tranquillitatem parumper ex adustione quam inuenit apud excoriationem apostematis.	 Their ends with which the section is made are sharp; their other ends are not sharp. And they are not placed thus except so that through them help may be given in the scraping of nodes because of the fear of cutting a vein or nerve, and so that the sick person may be healed through them, and may find temporary relief from the burning which is found in the scraping of the boil. 》 》
Istae sunt Magda, et sunt specierum trium.	 These are Madder, and they are of three kinds.
Fiunt ex aere, et sunt similia Radio, cum quo fit alcohol: et in extremitate lata est puncta Spatumilis occultata: et in ea currit ad interiora, et ad exteriora quando uis, sicut uides.	 They are made of air and resemble a ray with which alcohol is made. At the end of its broad tip there are hidden punctual points; through these it runs to the inside or the outside as you wish, just as you see.
Forma Spatumilium quae absconduntur inter digitos apud perforationem apostematum: et non percipiunt ea infirmi: et sunt trium specierum, magnum, medium, et paruum.	 The form of the hidden Spatumilium between the fingers in the perforation of the aposteme, and the weak do not perceive them; they are of three kinds: large, medium, and small.
Fomae Ventosarum cum quibus abscinditur fluxus sanguinis: et sunt trium specierum, magnae, mediae, et paruae.	 The shapes of the Ventosarum with which the flow of blood is cut off; they are of three kinds: large, medium, and small.
Fiant ex aere, aut citrino, rotundae, ad longitudinem parumper, sicut uides: et sint ad subtilitatem.	 They are made of air or citron wood, round and somewhat long, as you see, and should be very fine.
Et oportet ut sint istae species Ventosarum apud te magnae, et paruae: ut abscindas per eas sanguinem cum uelocitate apud necessitatem, et tunc quando non est tibi praesens medicina.	 And it is necessary for you to have these large and small shapes of the Ventosarum, so that you may quickly cut off blood through them in an emergency when there is no medicine present.
Verumtamen non utaris eis in abscisione sanguinis in omni loco corporis, et non utaris nisi in locis carnosis: sicut lacertis cruris, et coxae, et lacertis brachiorum, et mammillarum, et uentris, et inguinum, et similibus eis, ex lacertis carnosis, humidis.	 However, do not use them to cut off blood in every part of the body, but only in fleshy places, such as the thighs of the leg and hip, the upper arms, breasts, abdomen, groin, and similar fleshy parts that are moist.
Et quandoque fiunt ex eis instrumenta parua alia similia corticibus fisticorum, secundum suam formam: quibus abscinditur sanguis quando fluit ex loco phlebotomiae, aut apud incisionem uenae, aut arteriae: et quandoque fiunt ex eis rotundae secundum hanc formam.	 And sometimes from them are made other small instruments similar to the rinds of figs, according to their shape; with these blood is cut off when it flows from a place of venesection or from an incision of a vein or artery; and sometimes they are made round in this form.
¶ De cura Mammillarum hominum quae mammillis mulierum assimilantur.	 ¶ On the treatment of the breasts of humans which resemble the breasts of women.
Caput XLVII.	 Chapter 47.
Quandoque inflantur Mammillae quorundam hominum apud complementum somni (id est, cum incipiunt pollui in somno) donec similantur mammillis mulierum: et remanent apostemosae foede.	 Sometimes the breasts of certain people swell at the end of sleep (that is, when they begin to be polluted during sleep), until they resemble the breasts of women; and they remain hideously inflamed.  />
Qui ergo abhorret illud, oportet ut secet super mammillas sectione lunari, secundum hanc formam ex linea, b. ad lineam, g. Deinde excoria pinguedinem totam.	 He who dislikes it should cut above the breasts with a crescent-shaped incision according to this diagram from line b to line g. Then remove all the fat.
Postea imple uulnus ex medicamine incarnatiuo.	 Afterwards, fill the wound with an incarnative medicine.
Deinde aggrega duo labia uulneris cum sutura, et cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	 Then join the two lips of the wound together with a stitch and care for it until it heals.
Si autem declinat mammilla ad inferiora, et mollificatur propter magnitudinem suam, sicut accidit mulieribus: tunc oportet ut findatur in duobus lateribus suis superioribus duabus sectionibus similibus figurae lunari, quarum unaquaeque continetur cum altera apud fines utriusque, donec sit linea maior continens minorem, secundum hanc formam ex linea, b. ad lineam, g. Postea excoria cutem quae est inter duo labia, et aufer pinguedinem, et administra quod diximus de sutura et pulueribus, quod est necessarium ex curatione, donec sanetur.	 But if the breast descends lower and softens due to its size, as happens with women: then one should make two crescent-shaped incisions on both of its upper sides, each joined with the other at both ends until a larger line encloses a smaller one, according to this diagram from line b to line g. Then remove the skin that is between the two lips, and take away the fat, and do as we said about the stitching and powders, which are necessary for healing, until it heals.
Si autem non comples incisionem eius quod oportet te incidere, propter inquietudinem infirmi, aut propter fluxum sanguinis: tunc oportet ut impleas uulnus coto submerso unguento corrosiuo, et dimitte ipsum, donec corrodat illud quod remansit ex pinguedine.	 But if you do not complete the incision as you should due to the patient's restlessness or heavy bleeding: then you should fill the wound with cotton wool soaked in a corrosive ointment, and leave it until it has dissolved whatever fat remains.
Deinde cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	 Then care for him until he heals.
¶ De perforatione apostematis, quod accidit sub Titillico.	 ¶ On the piercing of an abscess that occurs under the nipple.
Caput XLVIII.	 Chapter XLVIII.
Ista apostemata quae accidunt sub Titillico, sunt ex speciebus Strophularum dura, quae continet kistis, et ex eis sunt quae continent humiditates.	 These abscesses that occur under the nipple are of the hard species of strophulae, which contain a bladder, and there are those among them which contain liquids.
Quae ergo sunt ex eis quae continent humiditates, oportet ut secentur sectione lunari, secundum hanc formam, ex linea b. ad lineam, g. cum ergo euacuatur totum quod est in apostemate ex sanie, tunc imple ipsum coto ueteri, et dimitte ipsum usque ad diem alium.	 Therefore, those which contain liquids should be cut with a crescent-shaped incision according to this form, from line b to line g. And when all that is in the abscess has been evacuated through pus, then fill it with old cotton wool and leave it until another day.
Deinde auferatur cotum, et curetur cum unguento conueniente ad illud, donec sanetur.	 Then remove the bandage and clean with a suitable ointment until it heals.
Quod si apostema fuerit ex specie nodorum Strophularum, tunc scinde super ipsum, sicut diximus in sectione super Strophulas aequaliter.	 If the abscess is of the kind called strophular nodes, then cut it open as we said in the section on equal cuts for strophular nodes.
Si autem extenditur uulnus in hoc ut emittat pus, tunc administra in eo cauterium, secundum quod diximus in eo quod praemissum est.	 If, however, the wound extends so that it discharges pus, then apply a cautery to it, as we said in what was mentioned before.
¶ De sectione apostematis quod accidit propter Arteriam et Venam.	 ¶ About the incision of an abscess which occurs because of an artery and a vein.
Caput XLIX.	 Chapter XLIX.
Quando disrumpitur Arteria, et consolidatur cutis quae est supra eam, tuno multotiens accidit inde apostema: et similiter accidit Venae etiam, ut accidat in ea apostema et inflatio.	 When an artery is ruptured and the skin above it heals, then frequently an abscess occurs from there; and similarly this happens with a vein, so that an abscess and swelling occur in it.
Et signa quibus cognoscitur, quod apostema et inflatio sint propter Arteriam et Venam, sunt: quoniam, quando apostema est propter arteriam, est longum, aggregatum in profundo corporis: et quando impellis apostema digits tuis, sentis quasi sit ei stridor.	 And the signs by which it is recognized that an abscess and swelling are because of an artery and a vein are: because, when the abscess is because of an artery, it is long and deep in the body; and when you press the abscess with your fingers, you feel as if there is a sound.  />
Et illud quod est propter Venam, est rotundum in manifesto corporis.	 And that which is because of a vein is round and evident on the body.
Et sectio super hoc apostema est error, et praecipue quod est sub ascellis, et inguinibus, et collo, et in locis multis corporis: et est magnum ualde.	 And an incision over this abscess is dangerous, especially if it is under the armpits, groins, neck, and in many places of the body; and it is very great.
Oportet ergo ut deuitetur eius cura cum ferro, et quod ex eis etiam est in extremitatibus, aut in capite, oportet ut deuitetur.	 Therefore, its treatment with a knife should be avoided, and those that are also in the limbs or head, their treatment should be avoided as well.
Super illud ergo quod ex eis est ex inflatione orificii Arteriae, finde in cute sectione in longitudine.	 Therefore, for those caused by swelling of an artery opening, seek the cut along the length of the skin.
Deinde aperi sectionem cum uncinis, postea Arteriam: et libera eam ex tunicis, donec detegatur.	 Then open the cut with forceps, then the artery; and free it from its coatings until it is exposed.  />  />  />
Deinde intromitte sub ea acum, et fac eam penetrare usque ad latus aliud, et stringe Arteriam cum filo duplo in duobus locis, secundum quod docui te in extractione duarum Arteriarum quae sunt in timporibus.	 Then insert a needle under it and make it pass to the other side; and bind the artery with double thread in two places, as I taught you in the removal of the two temporal arteries.  />  />
Deinde punge locum, qui est inter duo ligamenta cum spatumili, donec egrediatur sanguis qui est in eo totus, et soluatur apostema.	 Then pierce the place that is between the two ligaments with a lancet, until all the blood comes out of it and the abscess is dissolved.
Deinde administra curationem quae generat pus, donec cadant ligamenta: postea cura illud cum unguentis conuenientibus ad illud, donec sanetur.	 Then apply a treatment that produces pus until the ligaments fall off; afterwards, treat it with suitable ointments until it heals.
Quod si fuerit apostema propter sectionem Venae, tunc oportet ut teneas manu tua quod tibi possibile est ex apostemate cum cute.	 If the abscess is due to a cut vein, then it is necessary that you hold with your hand as much of the abscess with the skin as possible.
Deinde intromitte acum sub loco quem tenuisti manu tua, et fac eam penetrare: et sit in ea filum duplum, donec extrahas ipsum ex latere altero.	 Then insert a needle under the place you held with your hand and make it penetrate; and let there be a double thread in it until you extract it from the other side.
Deinde liga cum ipso apostema ligamento bono: secundum quod dixi tibi in ligamento uuae, a duabus partibus cum duabus extremitatibus fili.	 Then bind the abscess with a good ligature, as I have told you for the ligature of the grape, on both sides with the two ends of the thread.
Si autem times quod extrahatur filum, tunc intromitte acum aliam cum filo alio sub apostemate toto apud incisionem acus: preme, et stringe fila tua in quatuor locis.	 But if you fear that the thread might be pulled out, then insert another needle with another thread under the entire abscess near the first needle's incision; press and bind your threads in four places.
Deinde seca apostema in medio sui, donec quando egreditur quod in eo est: tunc incide superfluitatem cutis, et dimitte quod ligatum est ex ea.	 Then cut the abscess in half until what is inside comes out; then cut away the excess skin and leave whatever has been bound from it.
Deinde pone super ipsum puluillum quem submersisti in uino, et oleo.	 Then place upon it a little piece of wool that you have soaked in wine and oil.
Deinde administra curationem, quae fit cum liciniis et unguentis, donec sanetur.	 Then apply treatment with poultices and ointments until it heals.
¶ De apostemate quod accidit ex torsione Neruorum.	 ¶ About the abscess that occurs from a twisting of the nerves.
Caput L.	 Chapter L.
Sicut accidit apostema in Arteria et Vena, similiter accidit apostema in Neruis: quod accidit in eis percussio, aut accidit a labore superfluo, et similibus: et fit plurimum illis in locis adiutoriorum, aut calcanei, et in omni loco in quo mouentur iuncturae: et est apostema graue.	 Just as an abscess occurs in the artery and vein, so too does an abscess occur in the nerves; this happens to them from blows or from excessive labor and similar things, and it occurs most often in the joints of the fingers or toes, and in any place where there is movement of the joints. And this is a grave abscess.
Similatur color eius reliquo corpori, et est in pluribus dispositionibus absque dolore: et quando stringitur cum uehementia, sentit in eo infirmus simile stupori.	 Its color is similar to the rest of the body, and it is in many states without pain; but when squeezed firmly, the patient feels a sensation like numbness in it.
Et non est apostema aggregatum in profundo corporis, imo est sub cute, et ipsum mouetur ad omnem partem, et non uadit ad anteriora, uel ante, neque retro ad posteriora.	 And there is no abscess deep within the body, but rather it is under the skin, and the entire thing can be moved in any direction; it does not go to the front or back towards the anterior or posterior parts.
Quod ergo ex eis est in iuncturis, non oportet ut inuadatur cum ferro.	 Therefore, if something of this kind is in a joint, it should not be approached with iron.
Fortasse enim accidet contractio.	 For perhaps contraction might occur.
In illo autem quod ex eis est in capite, aut in fronte, finde cutem cum spatumili.	 As for what is of this kind in the head or forehead, incise the skin with a scalpel.
Si ergo est apostema paruum, tunc tene ipsum cum forficibus, et abscinde ipsum a radice.	 If therefore it is a small abscess, then hold it with forceps and cut it off at the root.
Et si est magnum, tunc suspende ipsum eum uncino, et excoria ipsum: deinde aufer ipsum, et aggrega uulnus cum sutura: et cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	 If it is large, then hang it with a hook and scrape it; then remove it, and close the wound with stitches: and treat it until it heals.
¶ De sectione apostematis, quod accidit in uentre.	 ¶ On the incision of an abscess that occurs in the belly.
Caput LI.	 Chapter LII.
Accidunt quibusdam hominibus multotiens in uentribus eorum, et in reliquis corporibus ipsorum, thelil, quae nominantur Fungalia, per similitudinem ipsorum cum fungis.	 There are certain people who often have lumps in their bellies and in other parts of their bodies, which are called fungalia due to their similarity to mushrooms. ‌ ‌
Quorum radix est subtilis, et ipsorum caput est grossum, et conuersa sunt labia eorum.	 Whose roots are fine, and whose heads are thick, and their lips are inverted.
Et est ex eis paruum: et est ex eis quod magnificatur ualde.	 Some of them are small; others become very large.
Et ego quidem iam uidi uirum, et in uentre eius erant duo thelil, quae erant magis quam rebus aliis similia fungis: non erat differentia inter ea, alba, minutae radicis, et inuersabantur labia eorum, et findebantur, et humiditas currebat ex eis semper.	 I myself have seen a man who had two such lumps in his belly, which were more like mushrooms than anything else; there was no difference between them, they were white and with fine roots, their lips were inverted, and pus always flowed from them. ‌
Incidi ergo ea, et inueni in pondere unius quasi X et VIII uncia et in altero quasi VI uncia Et operatio in incisione eorum est, ut consideres tunc, si infirmus est humidus, et color thelil est albus, humidum, subtilis radicis: tunc incide ipsum cum spatumili lato, et sint in praesentia tua cauteria in igne.	 I cut them open and found that one weighed about eight and a half ounces, the other about six ounces. And the operation for cutting into them is this: If the patient is humid and the color of the lump is white, watery, with fine roots, then cut it with a broad scalpel, and let cauteries be at hand in the fire.
Multotiens enim expellitur apud sectionem eius sanguis multus: propera ergo si te uincit sanguis, tunc cauteriza ipsum.	 Often much blood is expelled during its incision; therefore hasten if you are overcome by the blood and then cauterize it.
Quod si uides infirmum pauidum et timidum ab incisione cum ferro, tunc accipe filum ex plumbo decenter factum, et stringe cum eo athelul: cuius modus est quem diximus, et dimitte ipsum duobus diebus.	 And if you see the patient weak, fearful and timid of the incision with iron, then take a thread well-made from lead, and string it through the athelul; its method is as we have said, and leave it for two days.
Deinde adde in strictura plumbi.	 Then add to the constriction of the lead.
Non ergo cesses stringere plumbum, quotiens imprimit in thelil, donec abscindatur, et cadat per se absque labore.	 Do not therefore cease tying the lead whenever it is impressed upon the thelil, until it is cut off and falls by itself without effort.
Si autem thelil grossae fuerit radicis, tunc in incisione eius est quiddam timoris et pauoris: praecipue quod est in uentre.	 But if the thelil is of a thick root, then there is something fearful and terrifying in its incision, especially what is in the abdomen.
Verumtamen possibile est, ut incidas medietatem eius.	 However, it is possible that you may incise half of it.
Deinde cauteriza ipsum, ut non redeat.	 Then cauterize it, so that it does not return.
Deinde cura ipsum, donec sanetur uulnus.	 Then take care of it until the wound heals.
Et caue ne praesumas incidere thelil quod est fusci coloris, pauci sensus, foedi aspectus: ipsum enim est apostema cancerosum: et ego ueniam cum rememoratione Cancri post hoc.	 And beware of presuming to incise a thelil that is of a dark color, insensitive, and foul in appearance; for it is a cancerous abscess. And I will deal with the topic of Cancer after this.
¶ De cura eminentiae Vmbilici.	 ¶ On treating a protruding umbilicus.
Caput LII.	 Chapter LII.
Fit eminentia Vmbilici ex caussis multis.	 An umbilical hernia can occur for many reasons.
Aut ex fissuris sifac, quod super uentrem est: et exit ex eo althub, aut intestinum, secundum quod accidit in reliquis rupturis.	 Or from a tearing of the diaphragm above the abdomen; and either an altub or intestine comes out of it, as happens in other cases of rupture. ➤
Aut ex sanguine qui fluit ex Vena, aut ex Arteria, secundum quod praemissum est.	 Or from blood flowing from a vein or an artery, as was previously stated.
Aut ex uentositate coartata in eo.	 Or from constipation constrained within it.
Si autem est propter fissuram sifac, et exitum thirbi: tunc est color apostematis similis colori corporis: et est lene, absque dolore: et apparet diuersi situs.	 If however it is due to a tearing of the diaphragm and the exiting of intestines; then its color is similar to that of the body; and it is soft, without pain; and it appears in various places. ➤ ➤
Et si est propter egressionem intestini, tunc est situs eius, cum eo quod narrauimus, uehementioris diuersitatis.	 And if it is due to the prolapse of the intestine, then its condition, as we have narrated, is of a more intense variety.
Cum ergo tu premis ipsum digitis tuis, occultatur: deinde redit, et fortasse est cum eo sonitus: et magnificatur multum apud introitum balnei, et laborem uehaementum.	 So when you press it with your fingers, it is hidden; then it returns, and perhaps there is a sound with it; and it is greatly magnified at the entrance to the bath, and it is very troublesome.
Si uero est propter humiditatem, est lene, tunc non occultatur quando premis ipsum manu tua, neque constringium, neque additur.	 But if it is due to moisture, it is gentle; then when you press it with your hand, it does not become hidden, nor constrained, nor increased.
Quod si est propter sanguinem, tunc cum istis signis apparet apostema ad nigredinem de cliue.	 But if it is due to blood, then with these signs an abscess appears, turning black at the clavicle.
Si autem est propter carnem natam: tunc est apostema graue, grossum, durum, et figitur secundum quantitatem unam.	 But if it is due to dead flesh, then the abscess is heavy, thick, hard, and it settles into one location.
Si uero est propter uentositatem, tunc tactus eius est lenis.	 But if it is due to flatulence, then its touch is gentle.
Et operatio in illo est, ut consideres tunc, si eminentia umbilici est propter sanguinem Arteriae, aut Venae, aut uentositatem: tunc oportet ut prohibearis a curatione eius.	 And the operation in it is such that you should then consider whether the swelling of the navel is due to blood from an artery or vein, or flatulence; then you must abstain from its treatment.
Nam in illo est timor et pauor, sicut docui te in capitulo, in quo dixi apostemata propter arteriam et uenam.	 For there is fear and danger in it, as I taught you in the chapter where I spoke about abscesses due to an artery or vein.
Quod si eminentia umbilici est propter intestinum, aut zirbum: tunc oportet ut praecipias infirmo, quatenus teneat anhelitum suum, et stet stans extensus.	 But if the swelling of the navel is due to the intestine or bladder, then you must advise the patient to hold his breath and stand upright and extended.
Deinde signa cum encaustro in circumitu umbilici totius.	 Then mark with cautery the entire area around the navel.
Postea praecipe ei, ut resupinetur inter manus tuas super dorsum suum.	 After that, instruct him to lie on his back between your hands.
Deinde circunda cum spatumili lato in circumitu umbilici super locum quem signasti cum encaustro.	 Then surround the area around the navel with a wide bandage over the place that you marked with cautery.
Postea extende medium apostematis ad superiora, cum uncino magno.	 After that, extend the middle of the abscess upward with a large hook.  \\
Deinde liga eum in circumitu forti cum filo, aut cum chorda de serico ligamento firmo: et sit nodus ligamenti alenxotati.	 Then bind it tightly around its circumference with thread or strong silk cord, and let the knot be an Alexandrian knot.
Deinde aperi medium apostematis extensum supra ligamentum.	 Then open the middle of the swelling extended above the ligament.
Si ergo inueneris ipsum iam captum a ligamento: tunc extrahe alenxotati, et intromitte in ipsum digitum indicem, et impelle intestinum ad interiora uentris: et si inueneris zirbum, tunc accipe ipsum cum uncino, et incide superfluitatem eius.	 If therefore you find that the intestine has already been caught by the ligament, then extract the hernia, and introduce your index finger into it, and push the intestine back towards the interior of the abdomen; and if you find the cecum, then take hold of it with a hook, and cut off its excess.
Si autem contraria est tibi arteria, aut uena: tunc circunda ipsum multum.	 But if it is the opposite for you, that is, if it is an artery or vein, then encircle it much [with thread].
Deinde redi ad operationem tuam.	 Then return to your work.
Et accipe duas acus, et intromitte in eis duo fila fortia: et intromitte duas acus in circumitu quem fecisti circa apostema in modum crucis, quas facis penetrare.	 And take two needles and insert into them two strong threads; and insert the two needles into the circle which you have made around the swelling in the manner of a cross, causing them to penetrate.
Deinde stringe apostema in quatuor locis super acus: et si uis, aufer acus, et dimitte locum, donec putrefiat caro extensa: et cadat per se: aut incide ipsam quando subtiliatur et putrefit.	 Then tie the swelling in four places above the needles; and if you wish, remove the needles and leave the place until the extended flesh has rotted and falls away by itself; or cut it when it becomes thin and rotten.
Deinde cura ipsum cum eo quod oportet ex unguentis, donec sanetur.	 Then treat him with the necessary ointments until he is healed.
Quod si eminentia umbilici est ex carne nara in eo, aut ex humiditate: tunc oportet ut concaues apostema, sicut diximus.	 But if the swelling of the navel is from soft flesh or from moisture, then you should hollow out the swelling as we have said.
Et extrahas sanguinem, aut humiditatem, quam inuenis in eo.	 And extract the blood, or the moisture, which you find in it.
Deinde cura ipsum cum eo quod solidat locum.	 Then treat him with that which will consolidate the place.
¶ De cura CANCRI.	 About the treatment of Cancers.
Caput LIII.	 Chapter Fifty-Three
Iam diximus in diuisione species Cancri, et qualiter est uia ad curationem eius cum medicinis: et cauendum ab eo cum curatione eius cum ferro, ut non ulceretur: et diximus Cancrum generatum in matrice, et cautelam a curatione eius.	 We have already spoken in the division of the kinds of Cancer, and how is the way to its treatment with medicines; and one must guard against its ulcerating with the iron during its treatment: and we have said that if a Cancer has been generated in the womb, one must take care in treating it.
Et dixerunt antiqui, quod quandoque Cancer est in loco, ubi possibilis est eius eradicatio: sicut Cancer qui est in mammillis, aut in coxa, et eis similibus, ex membris locatis ad extrahendum totum eius: praecipue quando est incipiens paruus.	 And the ancients said that sometimes a Cancer is in a place where it is possible for it to be eradicated; such as a Cancer which is in the breasts or in the thigh, and similar places on the body, especially when it is small and just beginning.
Quando uero antiquatur, et est magnus, non oportet ut appropinques ei.	 When it is old and large, you should not approach it.
Ego enim non potui sanare ex eo aliquem: neque uidi alium ante me qui peruenerit ad illud.	 For I have not been able to heal anyone with it; nor did I see anyone before me who reached that point.
Et operatio in eo, quando est locatus sicut diximus, est, ut praecedas, et soluas infirmum ex cholera nigra aliquotiens.	 And the operation on it, when it is located as we have said, is such that you should precede and dissolve the patient from black bile often.
Deinde phlebotoma ipsum si inuenis cum repletione manifesta.	 Then perform a phlebotomy on him if you find clear evidence of fullness.
Deinde praepara infirmum praeparatione, in qua locetur cum operatione.	 Then prepare the patient with the preparation that is appropriate for the operation.
Deinde proiice in Cancrum uncinos qui conueniunt ei.	 Then cast into the Cancer the curved hooks that are suitable for it.
Postea concaua ipsum ab omni parte cum cute, secundum perscrutationem, donec non remaneat aliquid ex radicibus eius: et dimitte sanguinem currere, et non abscindas ipsum uelociter, imo exprime loca, et absterge sanguinem grossum totum manu tua, aut cum quo possibile est ibi ex instrumentis.	 Then hollow it out completely with the skin from every side, according to your examination, until nothing remains of its roots; and let the blood flow, and do not cut it off quickly, but press on the places, and wipe away all the thick blood with your hand or whatever possible instrument is there.
Si autem contrarietatem facit tibi fluxus sanguinis grossi ex incisione arteriae, aut uenae: tunc cauteriza uenam, donec abscindatur sanguis.	 But if the flow of thick blood from the cutting of an artery or vein causes you difficulty, then cauterize the vein until the blood is cut off.  /> And it should not be done on a young person except for necessity.  /> And this is what we have written about it.
Deinde cura ipsum cum reliqua curatione, donec sanetur.	 Then care for him with the rest of the treatment until he is healed.
¶ De cura Hydropisis.	 § On the Treatment of Dropsy.
Caput LIIII.	 Chapter LIV.
Iam narrauimus in diuisione species Hydropisis, et qualiter fit aggregatio aquae: et signa omnis speciei, et curationem eius cum medicinis.	 We have already explained in the division of the kinds of dropsy and how water accumulates; and the signs of every kind, and its treatment with medicines.
Et illa quae curatur cum ferro, non est nisi species asclitis sola: et non approximatur cum ferro speciei timpanitis: neque speciei hyposarcae penitus: nam illud mortale est.	 And that which is treated with iron is only the kind of ascites alone; and it does not approach the kind of tympanites with iron, nor the kind of hypoascites at all; for that is fatal.
Quando tu iam medicatus es hanc speciem Hydropisis timpanitis cum medicinis, et non contulit medicatio tua: tunc considera.	 When you have already treated this kind of dropsy tympanites with medicines, and your treatment did not help; then consider.
Nam si infirmo iam consecuta est debilitas, aut est cum eo infirmitas alia praeter Hydropisim: sicut si sit cum eo tussis, aut uentris solutio, et similia illis: tunc caue ne mediceris ei cum ferro: quoniam est timor illud.	 For if the patient has already become weakened or there is another illness with him besides the dropsy, such as if he has a cough or loose bowels and similar to those; then beware lest you treat him with iron; for there is danger in that.
Si autem uides infirmum exuberantis uirtutis, neque est cum eo aegritudo praeter Hydropisim solam: et non est puer, neque senex: tunc modus operationis in eo est, ut tu eleues infirmum stantem inter manus tuas, et minister post ipsum exprimat uentrem eius manu sua impellendo aquam ad inferiorem partem pectinis.	 If however you see the patient with an abundance of vigor, and besides hydropsy alone there is no other illness with him, and he is neither a child nor an old man: then the manner of operating on him is for you to lift the patient standing between your hands, and an assistant behind him should press his belly with his hand, forcing water down to the lower part of the chest.
Deinde accipe spatumile spinosum, secundum hanc formam.	 Then take a thorny sponge, in this shape.
Sit duarum partium acutarum, longum, acutae extremitatis sicut Spatumile.	 Let it be of two sharp ends, long, with a sharp tip like a thorny sponge.
Verumtamen in eo sit quiddam breuitatis paulatim, ut non pertranseas cum eo apud operationem usque ad intestinum, et laedas ipsum.	 However, there should be something of shortness to it gradually, so that you do not penetrate with it during the operation all the way to the intestine, and damage it.
Deinde considera.	 Then pay attention.
Nam si est generatio Hydropisis ex parte intestinorum, tunc oportet ut elongeris cum sectione ab umbilico quantitate trium digitorum, ad inferiora in directo eius supra pectinem.	 For if the hydropsy is generated from the intestines, then it is necessary that you extend with a cut from the navel by three fingers, to the lower part of it directly above the chest.
Si uero generatio Hydropisis est propter aegritudinem epatis: tunc sit sectio tua sinistra ab umbilico tribus digitis.	 However if the hydropsy is generated because of an illness of the liver, then your cut should be on the left from the navel by three fingers.
Et si generatio eius est propter splenem, tunc sit sectio in latere dextro: et non oportet etiam ut sit sectio in latere super quod uult iacere infirmus, ut non currant superfluitates ad illum locum debilem.	 And if its generation is because of the spleen, then let there be a cut on the right side: and it is not necessary that there also be a cut on the side where the patient wishes to lie, so that the superfluities do not run to that weak place.
Deinde perfora cum instrumento cutem totam.	 Then pierce the whole skin with the instrument.
Deinde intromitte in illam sectionem, et eleua manum tuam cum Spatumili inter cutem, et sifac, quasi tu excories ipsum: et sit quantitas quae excoriatur quantitas unguis, aut circiter ilud.	 Then introduce into that cut, and lift your hand with the thorny sponge under the skin, as if you were scraping it off: and let the amount that is scraped be the size of a nail or about that.
Deinde perfora sifac, donec perueniat Spatumile ad locum uacuum: et est locus aquae.	 Then pierce with the sifac, until the thorny sponge reaches the empty place: and it is a place of water.
Deinde extrahe ipsum, et intromitte in foramen instrumentum, cuius haec est forma.	 Then extract it, and introduce into the opening an instrument, the shape of which is this.
Et est simile cannulae: fit ex argento, aut aere, aut aurichalco, lene, tersum: cui in inferiori parte sui est foramen paruum, et in lateribus eius sunt tria foramina, duo ab una parte, et unum a parte altera: et facia est extremitas eius incisa, secundum modum incisionis calami, sicut uides: in extremitate eius superiore est armilla.	 And it is similar to a reed: it is made of silver, or bronze, or brass, smooth and clean; at its lower part there is a small hole, and on its sides are three holes, two on one side and one on the other side; and its tip is cut according to the manner of cutting a reed, as you see; at its upper end is a ring.
Nam quando instrumentum peruenit ad aquam, tunc ipsa descendit statim super instrumentum, ergo euacua ex aqua in hora quantitatem mediam.	 For when the instrument reaches the water, then it immediately sinks onto the instrument; therefore evacuate half the amount of water in an hour.
Quoniam si tu euacuas ex ea plus quam oportet, in hora fortasse moritur infirmus per resolutionem spiritus sui animalis: aut accidit ei syncopis quae appropinquat morti.	 Because if you evacuate more than is necessary from it, then perhaps the patient will die within the hour due to the loss of his vital spirit; or a fainting spell will occur which approaches death.
Verum euacua ex ea secundum quantitatem uirtutis eius, et secundum quod significant tibi dispositiones infirmi ex uirtute pulsus eius, et ex bonitate eius.	 But evacuate from it according to the measure of its power, and according to what the condition of the patient indicates to you by the strength of his pulse, and by his good state.
Deinde extrahe instrumentum, et retine aquam.	 Then remove the instrument, and keep the water.
Quod est, quia retinetur statim propter cutem quae retinet foramen quod est super sifac: de quo narraui, ut perfores ipsum secundum illum modum.	 This is because it is immediately retained due to the skin which holds closed the hole that is above the syphon; concerning which I have said that you should pierce it in this manner.
Deinde itera instrumentum die altero, si uides infirmum tolerare illud: et extrahe etiam ex aqua quantitatem paruam.	 Then repeat the use of the instrument on the following day, if you see that the patient is able to tolerate it; and also evacuate a small amount of water.
Fac illud diebus aliquot sine timore, et custodi te ab errore: donec non remaneat ex aqua nisi parum.	 Do this for several days without fear, and guard yourself from error; until there remains only a little water.
Si autem times super infirmum, et dimittis ex aqua rem multam: tunc cura ipsum cum sepultura in harena calida, et sudore multo in balneo et sole, et expectet super sitim: et cura ipsum cum medicinis exiccatiuis, donec sanetur: et cauteriza super stomachum, et epar, et splenem, post extractionem aquae: secundum quod narraui in eo quod praecessit.	 But if you are afraid for the patient and let out a large amount of water, then care for him with burial in hot sand, and much sweat in the bath and sun, and wait for him to be thirsty: and care for him with drying medicines until he is cured; and cauterize over the stomach, liver, and spleen after the evacuation of water, as I have said in what preceded.
¶ De cura infantium qui nascuntur locis urinae eorum non perforatis.	 ¶ On the care of infants who are born with their bladder not being pierced.
Caput LV.	 **Chapter 55**
Quando egreditur aliquis infantium ex uentre matris suae, et caput mutonis eius est non perforatum, aut est foramen strictum, aut in non suo loco.	 When a child exits its mother's womb, and the fontanelle of its head is not open, or it is too narrow, or it is not in its proper place.
Oportet ergo succurrere cum perforatione eius statim cum nascitur cum Spatumili subtili ualde, secundum hanc formam.	 Therefore, one must immediately help with a fine, very small curette upon its birth, in this manner:
Deinde pone in foramine clauum subtilem ex plumbo, et liga ipsum: et tene ipsum tribus diebus, aut quatuor.	 Then place a thin lead plug into the opening and bind it: and keep it there for three days or four.
Quando ergo uult urinam emittere, remoueatur, et mingat.	 When the child wants to pass urine, remove it and let it urinate.  ?>
Deinde reduc ipsum.	 Then put it back in place.
Et si tu non ponis plumbum, iam possibile est, ut urina quae incedit super locum, non permittat ipsum claudi.	 And if you do not use lead, it is possible that the urine which flows over the area will prevent it from closing up.
Ille autem cuius foramen est strictum, medicatur cum plumbo, sicut diximus, diebus multis, donec amplificetur.	 As for the one whose fontanelle is too narrow, he should be treated with lead as we said, over many days, until it widens.
Illi autem in quibus est foramen in non suo loco, laeduntur.	 But those in whom the fontanelle is not in its proper place are harmed.
Quod est, quia ex eis qui nascitur, foramen est apud finem capitis uirgae: quare non potest mingere ad anteriora, donec eleuat uirgam manu sua ad superiora.	 This is because in those who are born, the fontanelle is at the end of the head's neck: therefore they cannot urinate towards the front until they raise their neck with their hand to a higher position.
Neque est ei generatio, propterea, quod sperma non potest peruenire ad matricem secundum rectitudinem: et est aegritudo foeda ualde.	 And there is no offspring for him, because the semen cannot reach the womb in a straight path: and this is a very foul disease.  > 1062485736
Et modus operationis in illo est, ut resupinetur infirmus super dorsum suum.	 And the method of treatment for him is that the sick person be placed on his back.
Deinde extende caput uirgae eius manu tua sinistra extensione uehementi, et incide caput capitis uirgae ex loco priapi, cum acumine, aut spatumili acuto: sicut est incisio calami, aut sicut tu radis aliquid, ut medium eius ueniat simile capiti uirgae: et ut cadat foramen in medio secundum quod oportet.	 Then extend the neck of his head with your left hand using strong traction. And cut the top of the neck from the area of the penis, with a needle or a sharp curette, like you would incise a reed, or as if you were cutting something until the middle comes out similar to the top of the neck: and let the opening fall in the middle as is appropriate.  > 1062485736
Et caue tibi apud operationem tuam a fluxu sanguinis.	 And beware of bleeding during your procedure.
Multotiens enim accidit illud.	 For it often happens thus.
Oppone ergo ei cum eo quod abscindit sanguinem, et cura uulnus, donec sanetur.	 Therefore apply to it that which restrains the blood and care for the wound until it heals.
¶ De Albather quae accidunt in praeputio et capite uigae, et corruptione, nigredine, et adhaerentia.	 ¶ Concerning abscesses that occur on the prepuce and the glans, and their corruption, blackness, and adherence.
Caput LVI.	 Chapter 61.
Multotiens accidunt istae Albather in uirga, et est eminentia carnis foedae.	 Often these abscesses occur on the penis, and it has an ugly protuberance of flesh.  />
Et ex ea alia est maligna, et alia non maligna.	 And from this [type], one is malignant and another is not malignant.
Non malignam ergo oportet ut suspendas cum uncino subtili, et abscindas eam, donec mundes eam totam.	 Therefore you should suspend the non-malignant one with a fine hook and cut it off until you cleanse it completely.
Deinde pone super eam cotum submersum in unguento aegyptio.	 Then place a soaked bandage in Egyptian ointment on top of it.
Deinde cura ipsum post illud cum unguento dyafinicon, donec sanetur.	 Then care for the same [place] after that with diacathym-ointment until it heals.
Quod si Albather est maligna, foedi coloris, tunc oportet ut administres in ea cauterium post incisionem eius et ipsius rasionem.	 If the abscess is malignant and of an ugly color, then you should apply a cautery to it after its incision and its removal.  />   
Si autem Albather est in praeputio captiui, non circumcisi, et est pars Albather inter praeputium, et pars eius extra: tunc oportet ut auferas Albather, quae est intus in primis, donec quando consolidatur, tunc cura ipsum exterius: quoniam quando tu curas eam simul, non securatur praeputium quin preforetur.	 But if the abscess is on the prepuce of an uncircumcised man and there is a part of the abscess between the prepuce and outside it: then you should first remove the internal part of the abscess until it heals, and then care for the external [part], because when you care for both at once, the prepuce will not be preserved but will be cut off.   
Et iam accidunt etiam in testiculis, et praeputio nigredo et corruptio.	 And now they also occur in the testicles and the prepuce with blackness and corruption.
Oportet ergo, ut tu concaues totum quod iam denigratum est, et quod uult corrumpi, aut iam corruptum est.	 Therefore, you should cut out everything that is already turning black and wants to become corrupted, or has already become corrupted.     
Deinde line super ipsum post illud cum melle quod iam concussum est cum farina corticum granatorum, et herbi tritorum cribellatorum.	 Then bandage the same [place] after that with honey that has already been stirred with sieved grain flour and finely ground herbs.       
Deinde cura illud cum reliqua curatione, donec sanetur.	 Then care for it with the rest of the treatment until it heals.
Si autem accidat fluxus sanguinis, tunc administra cauterium cum cauterio lunari, secundum hanc formam.	 But if there is bleeding, then administer a cautery using a lunar cautery, in this manner.
Cauterium enim est iuuatiuum ad duas dispositiones simul, scilicet ad fluxum sanguinis, et uulnus quando corrumpitur.	 For the cautery is beneficial for two conditions at once: namely, for bleeding and when a wound becomes corrupt.
Quod si corroditur caput uirgae, et destruitur totum in hora: tunc oportet ut intromittas in meatum priapi cannulam ex plumbo, ut mingat infirmus super eam.	 If the head of the virga is corroded and completely destroyed within an hour, then it is necessary to insert a lead pipe into the meatus of the priapus so that the patient urinates on it.
In adhaerentia uero praeputii cum capite uirgae, et haec quidem adhaerentia non accidit, nisi in eo cuius praeputium est sanum, et non exigitur super ipsum circumcisio: et quandoque accidit adhaerentia propter uulnus, aut apostema: oportet ergo ut excories eam cum Spatumili obtuso, donec soluatur ligamentum, et liberetur caput uirgae ab omni parte.	 However, if the foreskin adheres to the head of the virga and this adhesion does not occur except in one whose foreskin is healthy and circumcision is not required for him, sometimes it happens due to a wound or an aposteme; therefore, it is necessary that you scrape it off with a blunt spatula until the ligament dissolves and the head of the virga is freed from every part.  />
Quod si est difficile discernere ea exquisite, tunc oportet ut excories aliquid ex capite uirgae, et ex praeputio.	 If it is difficult to distinguish these things precisely, then it is necessary to scrape off some of the head of the virga and the foreskin.
Quod est, quia praeputium quando est subtile, fortasse perforatur propter subtilitatem suam uelociter.	 Which is because a thin foreskin may perhaps be perforated quickly due to its own thinness.
Deinde separa inter praeputium, et caput uirgae cum panno lini subtili, qui iam madefactus est in aqua frigida, ut non adhereant iterum.	 Then separate the foreskin from the head of the virga with a thin cloth that has already been soaked in cold water, so that they do not adhere again.
Deinde curetur cum uino stiptico, donec consolidetur.	 Then it should be cared for with stiptic wine until it heals.
¶ De mundificatione infantium, et curatione ex errore eis accidente.	 ¶ Concerning the cleansing of infants and the treatment of their mistaken conditions.
Caput LVII.	 Chapter 57
Circumcisio non est solutio continuitatis, sicut reliqua uulnera: uerumtamen cum sit ex operatione nostra, uoluntate nostra, et usus eius sit in pueris proprie, est necesse ut signemus in ea operationem meliorem, et uiam leuiorem perducentem ad salutem.	 Circumcision is not a dissolution of continuity, like other wounds; nevertheless, since it is our operation, by our will, and its use is proper for boys, it is necessary that we mark this operation with something better, and find an easier way leading to health.
Dico ergo, quod antiqui non dixerunt circumcisionem in aliquo suorum librorum: quoniam non utuntur in legibus suis, et non est nisi quod acquisiuimus per experimentum.	 I therefore say that the ancients did not mention circumcision in any of their books because they do not use it in their laws, and we have only learned about it through experience.
Quod est, quia ego inueni maiorem partem artificum, et phlebotomatorum uti mundificatione, circumcidendo cum nouacula, et cum forficibus: et utuntur alfecati, et ligaudo cum filo, et incisione cum ungula.	 And this is because I have found that the majority of craftsmen and bloodletters use cleansing by cutting with a razor and with scissors; and they use cautery and ligation with thread, and incision with a nail.
Et ego quidem iam probaui omnes istos modos, et non inueni meliorem mundificatione cum forficibus, et ligamento cum filo.	 And indeed I have already tested all these methods, and I have not found a better cleansing than with scissors and ligation with thread.
Quoniam in mundificatione cum nouacula, multotiens effugit cutis.	 Because in cleansing with a razor, the skin often escapes (i.e., is cut too deeply).
Quoniam cutis praeputii duas habet tunicas: ergo forsitan inciditur cutis superior, et temanet tunica inferior: cogitur ergo ad incisionem ad incidendum alteram, et dolorem futurum.	 Because the skin of the foreskin has two layers; therefore it may happen that the upper layer is cut and the lower layer remains intact; thus an incision is necessary to cut the other, which will cause pain.
Et cum mundificatione quae fit per alfecati, id est, digitalis, quo utuntur sutores, non securatur incisio extremitatis uirilis membri: quoniam fortasse ingreditur in foramen eius.	 And with cleansing that is done by cautery, which is what shoemakers use, the incision of the tip of the male member is not secured because perhaps it may enter its opening.
In mundificatione autem cum ungula, fortasse euadit ferrum, et corrumpit operationem tuam: et cutis quidem pueri est breuis natura, et multotiens nascuntur taliter, quod non indigent mundificatione: et iam uidi illud.	 But in cleansing with a nail, perhaps the iron may slip and spoil your work; and indeed the child's skin is naturally short, and often they are born such that they do not need cleansing; and I have already seen this.
Mundificationis autem cum forficibus, et ligamento cum filo, bonum experimentum detexit mihi: quoniam forfices sunt proportionalis incisionis: propterea, quod acuitas quae est superius, est sicut acuitas quae est inferius.	 But cleansing with scissors and ligation with thread has shown me to be a good experiment because the scissors are of an appropriate size for the incision; therefore, the sharpness that is above is like the sharpness that is below. ️
Cum ergo premis manum tuam, proportionantur duae acuitates, et incidunt secundum operationem unam in tempore uno: et fit compressio simili figura, continens cutem uirgae ab omni parte, cum qua non cadit error omnino.	 Therefore when you press with your hand, the two sharpnesses are proportioned and they cut at the same time according to one operation; and a similar-shaped compression is made, containing the skin of the penis from all sides, with which no error occurs at all.
Et modus operationis propriae est, ut facias extimare, puerum praecipue, si est ex eis qui intelligunt parumper, quod tu non facis, nisi quod ligas filum in uirga sua tantum: et dimittas ipsum usque ad diem alium.	 And the method of operation is to cause the child, especially if he understands a little, to think that you are not doing anything except tying a string on his stick; and let him go until another day.
Deinde fac eum gaudere et laetari omnimodo quo possibile est tibi illud, ex eo quod recipit intelligentia sua.	 Then make him rejoice and be merry in every way possible for you to do so, according to his understanding.
Deinde fac eum stare inter manus tuas praeparatae staturae, et non sit sedens: et occulta forfices in manica tua, aut sub pede tuo, ne uideat eos puer omnino, neque aliquid ex instrumentis.	 Then make him stand between your prepared hands, not sitting; and hide the scissors in your sleeve or under your foot, so that the child does not see them at all, nor anything of the instruments.
Deinde intromitte manum tuam ad uirgam eius, et suffla in cutem, et trahe eam sursum, donec egrediatur caput uirgae.	 Then insert your hand towards his stick and blow on the skin, and pull it up until the head of the stick comes out.
Deinde mundifica ipsam ex eo quod aggregatur in ea sordicie.	 Then cleanse it because filth accumulates in it.
Deinde liga locum signatum cum filo duplo.	 Then bind the marked place with double thread.
Postea liga inferius eo parumper ligamentum secundum.	 Afterwards, bind a little lower the second ligature.
Deinde tene cum indice tuo, et pollice locum ligamenti inferioris retentione bona, et incide inter duo ligamenta.	 Then hold with your index finger and thumb the place of the lower ligature firmly, and cut between the two ligatures.
Deinde eleua cutem sursum uelociter, et extrahe caput uirgae.	 Then quickly lift the skin upwards and remove the head of the stick.
Deinde dimitte sanguinem currere paulatim (est enim melius) et pone puluerem desuper: et super puluerem pannum in quo expansus est uitellus oui decocti in aqua rosata, concussum cum oleo ros recenti bono: et dimitte eum super ipsum usque ad diem alium: et cura ipsum reliqua curatione, donec sanetur.	 Then allow the blood to flow slowly (for it is better) and place powder on top; and on the powder a cloth in which a cooked egg yolk has been spread with fresh good rose oil, shaken together; and leave it on him until another day; and take care of him with the rest of the treatment until he is healed.
Forma autem forficis ad mundificationem haec est.	 The form of the scissors for cleansing is as follows:
Sint hebetes duae extremitates, et sint incidentes: ne egrediatur in eis ramus claui: et sit longitudo duarum acuitatum, sicut longitudo duorum manubriorum aequaliter.	 The two ends should be blunt and should not be sharp; so that the nail-pin does not protrude from them; and let the length of the two sharpened parts be equal to the length of the two handles.
Error uero cadens in mundificatione est: quoniam fortasse effugit cutis intrinseca tota, aut pars eius apud incisionem.	 The mistake that occurs in cleansing is if perhaps the entire inner skin or a part of it escapes during the incision.
Ergo oportet, ut extendas eam ex hora tua cum ungue tuo ante apostemationem loci: et incidas eam secundum aequalitatem.	 "Therefore, you should stretch it with your nail from the hour when the tumor appears and cut it according to its size.
Quod si non potes tenere eam cum ungue tuo, tunc extrahe eam cum uncino, et incide eam.	 "If you cannot hold it with your nail, then remove it with a hook and cut it.
Si autem praeterierint ei tres dies, et remanet quod est sub uirga inflatum, apostematum: tunc dimitte illud, donec sedetur apostema calidum, et excoria illud cum facilitate, et incide illud secundum quod praeparatur tibi: et caue tibi a capite uirgae.	 "But if three days have passed and the swelling remains under the rod inflated as an abscess, then leave it until the abscess becomes hot and incised with ease. Then cut it according to how you are prepared, and be careful of the head of the rod.
Non enim nocebit ei illud.	 "For this will not harm it.
Cura ergo illud cum eo quod consolidat uulnus ex pulueribus, quos narrauimus in tractatu de pulueribus: et si inciditur ex cute supra mensuram, et euadit ad superiora, non nocet ei illud etiam.	 "So take care of it with the powder that consolidates the wound from the powders which we have mentioned in the section on powders; and if the cut extends beyond the skin and reaches the higher parts, this will not harm him either.
Cura ergo illud cum eo quod diximus, donec sanetur.	 "So take care of it with what we have said until it heals.
¶ De extractione Vrinae retentae in uesica.	 "Concerning the removal of retained urine from the bladder.
Caput LVIII.	 Chapter 58
Urinae retentio in uesica, fit ab opilatione facta ex lapide, aut sanguine congelato, aut pus, aut carne nata, et similibus illis ex eis quae diximus ex modis curationis in diuisione.	 "Retention of urine in the bladder occurs due to a stone formed from a pebble or congealed blood, pus, flesh growths, and similar substances which we have mentioned earlier among the methods of treatment in the section on division.
Et si non soluitur Vrina, et uides retentionem eius esse propter Lapidem, qui iam est in collo uesicae: tunc oportet ut sit infirmus super genua sua curuatus.	 "And if the urine does not dissolve and you see that its retention is due to a stone which is already in the neck of the bladder, then it should be made to sit with its knees bent.
Deinde componantur pedes eius super dorsum eius, et extendat uentrem suum ex superiori parte dorsi eius, et stringat infirmus anhelitum suum quantum possibile est ei.	 "Then let his feet be placed on his back and let him stretch out his stomach over the upper part of his back, and let the patient hold his breath as much as he can.
Cogitur ergo cum collo uesicae ad expulsionem Lapidis ad posteriora: quare absoluitur Vrina.	 "And so the stone in the bladder neck is forced to expel towards the rear, thus the urine is released.
Quod si non soluitur cum eo quod diximus, et uehemens sit res super infirmum: tunc oportet ut administres extractionem eius cum instrumento, quod nominatur siringa, cuius haec est forma Sit ex argento, et sit subtile, lene, concauum sicut cannula pennae auis in subtilitate radii, longum in similitudine palmi unius et medii: cui sit cannula subtilis in capite eius.	 "But if it does not dissolve with what we have said and the case is severe for the patient, then you must administer its removal with an instrument called a syringe, which has this shape. It should be made of silver and be fine, smooth, and hollow like the quill of a bird's feather in delicacy, as long as one and a half palms. At its tip it should have a fine tube.
Et modus exitus Vrinae per ipsum est, ut accipias filum duplicatum, et liges in extremitate eius lanam, aut cotum, ligatura bona: et intromittas extremitatem fili in inferiori parte Siringae: et incide cum forficibus si superfluit aliquid ex lana, uerum intromitte in cannulam cum uehementia, sicut alzer.	 And the method of exit of urine through it is to take a doubled thread, and tie a wool or cotton wick at its end with a good ligature: and insert the end of the thread into the lower part of the syringe: and cut off any excess from the wool with scissors, but insert it into the tube forcefully, as with alzer.
Deinde inunge siringam cum oleo, aut cum butyro, et albugine oui: et fac sedere infirmum super sedem, et embroca uesicam, et ipsius uirgam cum oleis humidis, et oleo oliuae, et aqua tepida.	 Then anoint the syringe with oil or butter and egg white: and have the patient sit on a seat, and pierce the bladder, and its tube with wet oils and olive oil and warm water.
Deinde intromitte siringam in uirgam cum facilitate, donec perueniat ad radicem uirgae.	 Then insert the syringe into the tube easily until it reaches the base of the tube.
Deinde dupla ipsam superius a parte umbilici.	 Then double it above the navel.
Deinde impelle siringam intra ipsam, donec perueniat ad Vesicam, et sentiat eam infirmus iam peruenisse ad rem uacuam: et non fit hoc secundum hunc ordinem, nisi quoniam meatus, in quo uadit, est in quo est tortuositas.	 Then press the syringe into it until it reaches the bladder, and the patient feels that it has already reached an empty space: and this is not done in this order, except because the passage through which it passes is one with a twist.
Deinde extende filum cum lana paulatim.	 Then gradually extend the thread with the wool.
Vrina enim sequetur lanam.	 For urine will follow the wool.
Deinde extrahe eam, et fac currere Vrinam per uiam urinae: et itera siringam, et non cesses facere illud, donec euacuetur uesica, et inueniat infirmus alleuiationem.	 Then draw it out and let the urine flow through its natural pathway: and repeat with the syringe, and do not cease to do this until the bladder is emptied and the patient finds relief.
¶ De qualitate clisterizationis uesicae cum Clepshydra.	 ¶ On the Method of Enema for the Bladder using a Clepsydra.
Caput LIX.	 Chapter LIX.
Quando accidit in uesica ulcus, aut sanguis in ea congelatur, aut coartatur in ea pus, et uis distillare in eam aquas et medicinas: tunc fiat cum instrumento quod nominatur Clepshydra, et haec est forma eius.	 When there occurs an ulcer in the bladder, or blood clots in it, or pus thickens in it, and it is necessary to instill waters and medicines into it: then it should be done with an instrument called a Clepsydra, and this is its form.
Est enim surda, id est, clausa.	 For it is deaf, that is, closed.
Et in eo sunt tria foramina, duo ex parte una, et unum ex parte altera, sicut uides.	 And in it are three openings, two on one side and one on the other, as you see.  /> ¶ De forma Clepshydrae.
Et locus concauus, in quo est illud quod impellit, sit secundum quantitatem quod opilet ipsum sine additione, donec quando trahitur cum eo aliquid, ex humiditatibus attrahatur: et quando impellitur, cum eo expellatur ad longinquum: secundum quod facit clepshydra, qua proiicitur naphta, id est, ignis graecus in praeliis martis.	 And the hollow place, which contains that which propels, should be according to its size without addition, until when it is drawn with something, water is drawn; and when it is propelled, it expels with it to a distance, just as the clepsydra does, by which naphtha, that is, Greek fire, is projected in the battles of Mars.
Cum ergo uis proiicere humiditates in uesicam, intromitte extremitatem clepshydrae in humiditatem, et trahe cum eo quod impellit ad superiora, humiditas enim trahitur in concauitatem clepshydrae.	 Therefore, when you wish to throw the liquids into a bladder, introduce the end of the clepsydra into the liquid and draw with it that which propels upward, for then the liquid is drawn into the hollow of the clepsydra.
Deinde intromitte extremitatem eius in uirgam, secundum quod narrauimus in siringa.	 Then introduce its end into a tube, as we have described with the syringe.
Deinde impelle humiditatem cum eo quod impellit illa namque humiditas peruenit ad uesicam statim, ita quod sentit eam infirmus.	 Then propel the liquid with that which propels, for then the liquid immediately reaches the bladder so that the patient feels it.
Forma clisteris subtilis quo clisterizatur uesica.	 The form of a fine enema to irrigate the bladder.
Fiat ex argento, aut auricalco: cuius caput altius sit simile alcama paruo, et sub eo sinus inter quem cadat ligamentum.	 It should be made of silver or copper: whose head is similar to a small alchemist's still and beneath it there is a pouch into which the string falls.  (Or: ... whose head is shaped like a small alembic, and below it there is a pouch into which the string descends.)
Deinde accipe uesicam arietis, et pone in ea humiditatem, qua uis clisterizare uesicam.	 Then take the bladder of a ram and place it in that liquid with which you wish to irrigate the bladder.
Deinde liga eam inter duos sinus ligatura forti cum filo duplo: et calefac illam humiditatem parumper super ignem.	 Then tie it strongly between two pouches with a double thread, and heat that liquid slightly over the fire.  (Or: ... between two bags with a strong double thread, and heat that liquid for a little while on the fire.)
Deinde intromitte extremitatem clisteris in uirgam, postea stringe manum tuam super uesicam cum humiditate strictura decenti, donec sentiat infirmus, quod illa humiditas iam peruenit ad uesicam.	 Then introduce the end of the enema into a tube; afterward, place your hand on the bladder with the liquid until you feel it tight enough, so that the patient feels that this liquid has now reached the bladder.
Si autem non est tibi praesens uesica, tunc accipe frustum pergameni, et fac ex eo circulum, et perfora ipsum ab omni rotunditate sua.	 If however you do not have a bladder at hand, then take a piece of parchment and make a circle out of it and pierce it from all its circumference.
Deinde intromitte filum forte in illis foraminibus, sicut reuoluuntur.	 Then introduce a thread fortunately in those openings, as they roll around.
Deinde aggrega circulum, sicut aggregatur alsofratu: postquam tu ponis in eo illud quod uis ex humiditatibus, et oleis, et aquis.	 Then make a circle like an embroiderer does: after you have placed upon it what you wish from the moist substances, and oils, and waters.
Deinde liga ipsum in instrumento: et fac cum eo sicut fecisti cum uesica ex expressione cum manu tua, donec perueniat humiditas ad uesicam.	 Then tie it onto the instrument, and do with it as you did with the bladder for emptying with your hand, until the moisture reaches the bladder.
¶ De extractione Lapidis.	 § About extracting a stone.
Caput LX.	 Chapter 60
Iam diximus in diuisione species Lapidis, et curationem eius cum medicinis: et dixi differentiam inter Lapidem generatum in renibus, et uesica, et signa illius totius: et dixi Lapidem in quo cadit operatio cum manu et sectio: et est Lapis generatus in uesica proprie: et ille qui figitur in uirga: et ego sum narrans illud cum expositione manifesta et abbreuiatione.	 I have already spoken in the division of the types of stone, and its treatment with medicines; and I stated the difference between a stone generated in the kidneys and the bladder, and all the signs of that; and I spoke about the stone on which manual operation and incision are effective: it is properly a stone generated in the bladder, and one that becomes fixed in the shaft; and I am explaining this with clear exposition and abbreviation.
Dico ergo, quod Lapis generatus in uesica, plurimum accidit pueris.	 I say therefore, that a stone generated in the bladder occurs most often in boys.
Et ex signis eius est, quod urina egreditur ex uesica similis aquae in subtilitate sua: et apparet in ea harena alba, et fricat infirmus uirgam suam, et laborat cum ea, et multotiens pendet.	 And its signs are that the urine exits from the bladder like water in its fineness; and there appears white sand in it; and the patient rubs his shaft, and struggles with it, and often it hangs down.
Deinde erigitur, et egreditur cum eo anus in multis eorum.	 Then he erects [his penis], and exits with it the anus in many of them.
Et est facilis sanatio puerorum, ex eo usquequo consequuntur quatuordecim annos.	 And treatment for boys is easy, until they reach fourteen years [of age].
Et est difficilis in senibus.	 And it is difficult in the elderly.
In iuuenibus autem est media, in eo quod est inter illud: et eius cuius Lapis est maior, curatio facilior: et si paruus, est econuerso illius cura.	 But in young men it is moderate, in that it is between [those two]: and for someone whose stone is larger, the treatment is easier; but if small, then its care is the opposite. ›
Cum ergo peruenimus ad curationem, oportet in primis, ut mundificemus infirmum cum clisteri, quod extrahat totum stercus quod est in intestinis suis: ipsum enim quandoque prohibet inuentionem Lapidis apud inquisitionem.	 Therefore, when we have come to treatment, it is first necessary to purify the patient with an enema, which removes all the excrement that is in his intestines; for this itself sometimes prevents the discovery of the stone upon investigation.
Deinde accipiatur infirmus cum pedibus suis, et concutiatur, et moueatur ad inferiora: ut descendat Lapis ad profundum uesicae, aut saliat de loco alto aliquotiens.	 Then let the patient be taken with his feet, and shaken, and moved towards the lower part: so that the stone may descend to the depth of the bladder, or jump from a high place several times.
Deinde fac eum sedere inter manus tuas praeparatum, et manus eius sint sub coxis ipsius, ut fiat uesica tota decliuis ad inferiora.	 Then make him sit between your hands prepared, and let his hands be under his knees, so that the entire bladder may become sloping downwards towards the lower part.
Deinde perquire eum, et tange eum extrinsecus.	 Then examine him, and touch him from the outside.
Si ergo sentis Lapidem in spacio, tunc propera statim cum sectione super ipsum.	 If therefore you feel a stone in a space, then hurry immediately with an incision upon it.
Quod si non cadat sub tactu tuo omnino, tunc oportet ut abstergas digitum indicem cum oleo manus sinistrae, si infirmus est puer: aut digitum medium si est iuuenis completus: et intromittas ipsum in anum suum, et perquire de Lapide, donec stat sub digito tuo: et conuerte eum paulatim ad collum uesicae.	 But if it does not fall under your touch at all, then you must clean the index finger with oil of the left hand, if the patient is a boy; or the middle finger, if he is a grown man; and insert it into his anus, and search for the stone, until it stands firm under your finger: and gradually turn him towards the neck of the bladder.
Deinde preme super ipsum cum digito tuo, et impelle ipsum ad exteriora aduersus locus, cuius sectionem uis: et praecipe ministro, ut premat uesicam manu sua, et praecipe alii ministro, ut extendat testiculos manu sua dextra ad superiora: et alia manu sua, ut remoueat cutem, quae est sub testiculis in parte a loco in quo est sectio.	 Then press upon it with your finger, and push it towards the exterior against the place where you wish to make an incision; and command one assistant to press the bladder with his hand, and command another assistant to extend the testicles with his right hand above: and with his other hand, to remove the skin which is under the testicles from the place in which is the incision.
Deinde intromitte Spatumile incidens, cuius forma haec est.	 Then insert a cutting spatula, whose form is this.
Et finde in eo quod est inter anum et testiculos, et non in medio, ad latus natis sinistrae: et sit sectio super ipsum lapidem, et digitus tuus sit in ano: et fiat sectio transuersa, ut sit sectio exterius ampla, et interius stricta, secundum quantitatem quod sit possibile egressio Lapidis ex ea non maior.	 And find it between the anus and testicles, not in the middle but to the left of the natis; and let the incision be upon the stone itself, and your finger be in the anus: and let the incision be transverse, so that the external part of the incision may be wide, and the internal part narrow, according to the size which permits the egression of the stone from it not greater.  />
Fortasse enim comprimit digitus, qui est in ano Lapidem apud sectionem, et egreditur absque difficultate.	 For perhaps the finger that is in the anus presses upon the stone at the incision, and it comes out without difficulty.
Et scias, quod ex Lapide est cui sunt anguli et margines, quare fit difficilis exitus eius propter illud.	 And know that from the Stone is which has angles and edges, why its exit is difficult because of it.
Et ex eo est lenis, similis glandulae, et rotundus: et fit facilis egressus eius.	 And it is smooth, like a hazelnut, and round; and its exit becomes easy.
Ei ergo cui sunt anguli, et margines, adde in fissura.	 Therefore, to the one which has angles and edges, add into the cleft.
Quod si non egreditur ita, tunc oportet ut ingenies super ipsum: aut stringas super eum cum gesti decenter, cuius extremitas sit sicut Luna, quae stringat super Lapidem, et non euadat ab ea: aut ut intromittas sub eo instrumentum subtile, curuatae extremitatis.	 If it does not exit thus, then you must contrive a device on top of it; or tie a silk thread neatly around it, whose end is like the moon, which ties above the stone and does not escape from it; or that you insert underneath a fine instrument with a curved tip.
Si autem non potes super cum, tunc amplifica foramen parumper.	 But if you cannot do so on top of it, then slightly enlarge the opening.
Quod si uincit te aliquid ex sanguine, abscinde ipsum cum zegi.	 If something overcomes you from the blood, cut it with a thread.
Si uero lapis est plus quam unus, tunc impelle in primis magnum ad os uesicae.	 But if there is more than one stone, then first drive the largest to the mouth of the bladder.
Deinde incide super ipsum.	 Then cut into it.
Postea impelle paruum post illud: et similiter fac si sunt plures duobus.	 After that, drive the smaller one after it; and do likewise if there are more than two.
Quod si magnus est ualde, tunc ignorantia est ut seces super ipsum sectione magna.	 If it is very large, it is a mistake to cut into it with a large incision.
Quoniam accidit infirmo una duarum rerum, aut ut moriatur, aut accidit ei distillatio urinae assidua: proptera, quia non consolidatur locus omnino.	 Because two things happen to the patient: either he dies, or a continuous dribble of urine happens; therefore, because the place does not heal at all.
Verum administra expulsionem eius, donec egrediatur: aut ingenia in fractura eius cum forficibus, donec extrahas eum frustatim.	 Truly administer its expulsion until it exits; or contrive devices in its fragmentation with forceps until you draw it out piece by piece.
Cum ergo compleueris operationem tuam, tunc imple uulnus thure, et aloe, et sanguine draconis: et stringe ipsum, et pone super ipsum pannum infusum oleo et uino, aut oleo rosato, et aqua frigida: ut sedetur apostema calidum.	 When therefore you have completed your operation, then fill the wound with frankincense and aloe and dragon's blood; and bind it up, and place on top of it a cloth soaked in oil and wine or rose oil and cold water, so that a hot abscess may subside.
Deinde resupina infirmum super collum suum, et non soluas ligamentum, usque ad diem tertium.	 Then make the patient lie on their back with their head elevated, and do not remove the bandage until the third day.
Cum ergo solueris ipsum, embroca locum cum aqua, et oleo multo.	 When you have loosened it, drench the place with water and much oil.
Deinde cura ipsum cum unguento dyafinicon, et unguento basilicon, donec sanetur.	 Then treat him with dyafinicon ointment and basilicon ointment until he is cured.
Si autem accidit in uulnere apostema calidum additum, et corrosi, et illi similia: sicut si congeletur sanguis in uesica, et prohibeatur ex eo urina: et cognoscitur illud ex egressione sanguinis cum urina.	 However, if an inflamed abscess with burn-like symptoms occurs, such as when blood coagulates in the bladder and blocks the flow of urine, it is recognized by the presence of blood in the urine.
Intromitte ergo digitum tuum in uulnus, et extrahe illum sanguinem.	 Therefore, insert your finger into the wound and extract that blood.
Nam si remanet, prouocat ad corruptionem uesicae, et putrefactionem eius.	 For if it remains, it provokes the corruption of the bladder and its putrefaction.
Deinde ablue uulnus cum aceto, et aqua, et sale: et oppone omni speciei cum eo quod conuenit ex curatione, usquequo sanetur.	 Then wash the wound with vinegar, water, and salt, and apply all suitable treatments for its healing until it is cured.
Et oportet in horis curationis totius, ut liges duas coxas, et aggreges, caussa medicinarum quae ponuntur super locum.	 And during the entire course of treatment, it is necessary to bind together both thighs and buttocks so that the medicines placed on the area remain in place.
Quod si lapis est paruus, et sit in meatu uirgae, et figitur in eo, et prohibetur urinae exitus: tunc cura ipsum cum eo quod narro antequam peruenias ad sectionem.	 If the stone is small and lodged in the meat of the penis and blocks the flow of urine, then treat him with that which I have mentioned before you reach the point of incision.
Multotiens enim a sectione excusaris per hanc curationem, iam enim probaui illud.	 For often you will be spared from incision by this treatment, for I have already tested it.
Et est, ut accipias Perforatorium ex ferro alferico, cuius haec est forma, triangulatae extremitatis, acutum, fixum in ligno.	 And it is necessary to take a perforator made of steel, the shape of which is as follows: triangular tip, sharp, and fixed in wood.
Deinde accipe filum, et liga cum eo uirgam sub lapide ut non redeat ad uesicam.	 Then take a thread and tie it to the penis below the stone so that it does not return to the bladder.
Deinde intromitte ferrum perforans in uirgam cum facilitate, donec perueniat Perforatorium ad ipsum lapidem: et reuolue Perforatorium manu tua in ipso lapide paulatim: et coneris perforationem eius, donec facias ipsum penetrare a parte altera.	 Then insert the perforating iron into the penis with ease until the perforator reaches the stone itself; and gradually turn the perforator by hand in the stone, attempting to pierce it through until you make it penetrate from the other side.
Urina namque absoluitur statim.	 For immediately the urine is released.
Deinde preme manum tuam super illud quod remansit ex lapide ab exteriori parte uirgae.	 Then press your hand on what remains of the stone from the outer part of the rod.
Ipse enim frangitur, et egreditur cum urina, et sanatur infirmus.	 For it is broken and exits with the urine, and the patient is healed.
Si autem non praeparatur tibi haec curatio, propter aliquid quod prohibet ab illo: tunc liga filum sub lapide, et filum aliud supra lapidem.	 If this treatment is not prepared for you because of something that prevents it, then tie a thread below the stone and another thread above the stone.
Deinde seca super lapidem in ipsa uirga inter duas ligaturas.	 Then cut above the stone on the rod itself between the two ties.
Deinde extrahe ipsum.	 Then extract it.
Postea solue ligamentum, et mundifica sanguinem congelatum, qui fit in uulnere.	 After that, loosen the tie and cleanse the clotted blood that forms at the wound.
Et non est necessarium ligamentum fili sub lapide, nisi ut non redeat ad uesicam: et ligamentum aliud desuper, nisi ut quando soluitur filum post egressionem lapidis, redeat cutis ad locum suum, et cooperiat uulnus: et propter illud necesse est tibi illud quando ligas filum superius, ut eleues cutem ad superiora, ut redeat apud complementum tuum, et cooperiat uulnus, sicut diximus.	 And it is not necessary to tie the thread below the stone except so that it does not return to the bladder; and another tie above except that when the thread is loosened after the exit of the stone, the skin may return to its place and cover the wound. And for this reason it is necessary for you, when you tie the thread above, to lift the skin upward so that it may return at your completion and cover the wound as we have said.
¶ De extractione Lapidis mulierum.	 ¶ On the Extraction of a Woman's Stone.
Caput LXI.	 Chapter 61
Parum generatur Lapis in mulieribus.	 A stone is rarely formed in women.
Si autem accidat alicui earum lapis, tunc difficilis est curatio, et prohibetur propter modos multos.	 But if it happens to one of them that a stone is formed, then the treatment is difficult and is hindered by many ways.
Vnus eorum est: quod mulier fortasse est uirgo.	 One of these ways is that the woman may be a virgin. ›
Et secundus est, quia tu non inuenis mulierem quae detegat seipsam medico, quando est casta, aut ex habentibus maritos.	 And the second way is that you will not find a woman who exposes herself to a physician when she is chaste or has a husband.
Tertius est, quia tu non inuenis mulierem bene scientem hanc artem, praecipue operationem cum manu.	 The third way is that you will not find a woman well-skilled in this art, especially the operation with the hand.
Et quartus est longinquitas a loco lapidis: quare indiget sectione profunda, et in illo est timor.	 And the fourth way is the distance from the stone, for which a deep cut is needed, and there is fear involved in that.
Quod si necessitas prouocat ad illud, tunc oportet ut accipias mulierem medicam, bene scientem: et parum inuenitur.	 But if necessity compels you to do this, then it is necessary for you to take a woman physician who knows well; and one who can be found is rarely. ›
Si uero priuaris ea, tunc quaere medicum castum, subtilem, et praesenta mulierem obstetricem bene doctam in re mulierum, aut mulierem quae in hac arte innuit partem artis: fac ergo eam praesentem, et praecipue ei, ut faciat totum quod praecipis ei ex inquisitione super lapidem.	 If indeed you lack these things, then seek a chaste and skillful physician, as well as a present midwife who is well-learned in the matters of women, or a woman who has been instructed in this art: make her present, and especially command her to do everything that you instruct her based on your examination regarding the stone.
In primis quod est, ut aspiciat si mulier est uirgo: tunc oportet ut intromittat digitum in anum eius, et quaerat lapidem.	 Firstly, it is necessary to look at whether the woman is a virgin. Then, she should insert her finger into her anus and search for the stone.
Si ergo inuenit ipsum, coartet eum sub digito suo, et tunc praecipe obstetrici, ut intromittat digitum suum in uuluam infirmae, et inquirat super lapidem, postquam ponit manum suam sinistram super uesicam, et comprimit eam compressione bona.	 Therefore, if she finds it, she should press it under her finger and then order the midwife to insert her finger into the sick woman’s vagina and search for the stone after placing her left hand over the bladder and pressing it with a good pressure.
Si ergo inuenit lapidem, tunc oportet ut gradatim moueat eum ab orificio uesicae ad inferiora cum summa uirtutis suae, donec perueniat cum eo ad radicem coxae.	 Therefore, if she finds the stone, then it is necessary that she gradually move it from the bladder’s opening downward with all her strength until it reaches the hip joint.
Deinde secet super eum apud oppositionem medietatis uuluae apud radicem coxae, ex quacunque parte praeparatur ei, et sentit lapidem in illa parte: et digitus eius non remoueatur a lapide, coartans sub eo: et sit sectio parua in primis.	 Then make an incision over it at the midpoint of the vagina near the hip joint on whatever side she prepares for it and feels the stone there; let her finger not be removed from the stone as she presses under it, and let the initial cut be small.  />
Deinde intromittat radium super illam sectionem.	 Then she should insert a reed over that incision.
Si ergo sentit lapidem, tunc addat in sectionem secundum quantitatem proportionatam quod lapis egreditur ab ea.	 If she feels the stone, then she should increase the size of the incision according to what is proportionate so that the stone can come out from it.
Et scias, quod species lapidis sunt multae.	 And know that there are many types of stones.
Ex his enim est paruus, et magnus, lenis et asper, longus, et rotundus habens ramos.	 From these, some are small and others large; soft or hard; long or round with branches.
Scias ergo species eius, ut significetur tibi per hoc super illud quod uis.	 Therefore, know its type so that you may be informed about it for what you wish.
Si ergo uincit te sanguis, tunc adde in loco zegi tritum, et tene ipsum hora una, donec abscindatur sanguis.	 Therefore, if blood overcomes you, then add ground hematite to the place and hold it for one hour until the bleeding stops.  />  • Si ergo uincunt te ossa, et tene ipsum hora una, donec abscindatur sanguis.  •
Deinde redi ad operationem tuam, donec egrediatur lapis: et fac, ut praepares tecum ex instrumentis, quae dixi in extractione lapidis in uiris, ut adiuueris per ea in operatione tua.	 Then return to your operation until the stone comes out. And make sure you have with you from the instruments that I mentioned for extracting stones in men, so that you may assist yourself in your operation.
Quod si uincit te fluxus sanguinis, et scis quod expulsio sanguinis est ex arteria quae incisa est: tunc pone puluerem super locum, et stringe eum cum puluillis strictura decenti: et non mutes illud: et dimitte lapidem, et non extrahas ipsum.	 If you are overcome by a flow of blood and know that the bleeding is from the cut artery, then place powder on the site and bind it tightly with decent ligatures, and do not remove them. Leave the stone and do not extract it.
Fortasse enim morietur mulier infirma.	 Perhaps the weak woman will die.
Deinde cura uulnus.	 Then care for the wound.
Cum ergo sedatur acuitas sanguinis post dies, et putrefit locus, tune redi ad operationem tuam, donec egrediatur lapis.	 After the sharpness of the blood has subsided after several days and the place has become foul, then return to your operation until the stone comes out.
¶ De sectione suiper Herniam aquosam.	 ¶ On incision for a hernia containing fluid.
Caput LXII.	 Chapter Sixty-Two.
Ramex aquosa non est, nisi aggregatio humiditatis in sifac albo, quod est sub cute testiculi continente ouum: et nominatur sifac.	 A watery hernia is nothing but a collection of moisture in the white sac that lies under the skin and contains the testicle, which is called the scrotum.
Et quandoque est in panniculo proprio sibi, quem praeparauit ei natura in parte oui, donec putetur: quod est ouum aliud, et est cutis testiculi inter sifac album, quod diximus: et non fit illud nisi raro.	 And sometimes it occurs in the proper pouch that nature has prepared for it within the testicle, which is another sac and lies between the white scrotum that we mentioned and the skin of the testicle; this happens only rarely.  If you wish to operate on a watery hernia, do not cut near the skin or the place where the two sacs meet, but rather in the center of the lower part of the scrotum, cutting it completely through.
Et generatio quidem huius ramicis, est ex debilitate quae accidit testiculis: quare effunditur ad eos haec materia.	 The cause of this hernia is indeed the weakness that affects the testicles, which is why this material flows into them.
Et quandoque accidit ex percussione super testiculos.	 And sometimes it happens from a blow to the testicles.
Et haec humiditas est habens colores multos.	 And this moisture has many colors.
Aut enim est color eius decliuis ad citrinitatem, aut est sanguineus rubeus, aut faeculentus, niger, aut est aquosus albus, et est illud quod est plus.	 For its color is either inclined towards yellowish, or it is a reddish blood-color, or dark and feculent, or watery white; the last of these is the most common.  The operation for this kind of hernia is the same as that which we have described for the removal of stones in men.
Et signa quibus scitur ubi sit aggregatio aquae, sunt ista.	 And the signs by which one knows where the collection of water is located are these:
Nam si est in sifac albo quod diximus, tunc apostema est rotundum ad longitudinem parumper sicut figura oui: et non apparet testiculus, quoniam humiditas continet eum ab omni parte.	 "For if it is in the white scrotum that we have mentioned, then the abscess is round in length, a little like the shape of an egg; and the testicle does not appear, because the moisture contains it on all sides.
Et si est humiditas in panniculo proprio sibi, tunc apostema est rotundum cum parte oui, et propter hoc extimat homo quia est ouum aliud.	 "And if there is moisture in its own covering, then the abscess is round like part of an egg, and because of this, a person might think it is another egg.
Et si humiditas est inter cutem testiculorum et sifac album, tunc cadit sub sensu.	 "And if there is moisture between the skin of the testicles and the white scrotum, then it falls under sensation.
Quando ergo uis cognitionem coloris humiditatis, tunc experire colorem humiditatis in apostemate cum Intromisso quadrato, cuius forma praecessit.	 "When you wish to know the color of the moisture, then test the color of the moisture in the abscess with the previously mentioned square instrument.
Secundum illud ergo quod egreditur in uestigio Intromissi, iudica de illo quod est inter ipsum.	 "According to what emerges as a trace of that which was inserted, judge that which is between them.
Cum ergo uenimus ad curationem cum ferro, tunc oportet ut praecipias infirmo, ut phlebotometur si possibile est ei illud, et uides corpus eius plenum.	 "Therefore, when we come to the cure with iron, it is necessary for you to instruct the patient that they should be bled if possible, and see his body full.
Deinde resupinetur super dorsum suum super rem altam parum, et pone sub eo pannos multos.	 "Then let him lie on his back over something a little high, and place many cloths under him.
Deinde sede tu super sinistram eius, et praecipe ministro, ut sedeat a dextra eius, qui extendat uirgam eius ad unum duorum laterum cutis testiculorum, et ad partem mirach uentris.	 "Then sit on his left side, and instruct the attendant to sit on his right side, who will extend his rod to one of the two sides of the skin of the testicles, and to the pubic region of the abdomen.
Deinde accipe spatumile latum, et seca cutem testiculorum ex medio per longitudinem, usque prope pectinem: et fiat sectio secundum rectitudinem aequedistantis lineae quae diuidit cutem testiculorum, donec perueniat ad sifac album comprehendens: et excoria ipsum et obserua, uel caue ex hoc, ut seces ipsum: et sit excoriatio tua qua ipsum excorias, ex parte quae suspenditur cum ouo plus: et subtiliter scrutare cum excoriatione secundum quantitatem quod tibi possibile est.	 "Then take a broad spoon and cut the skin of the testicles lengthwise in the middle, almost to the pubic hair; and let the incision be straight along the equidistant line that divides the skin of the testicles, until it reaches the white scrotum containing it; and remove it and observe, or be careful not to cut it: and let your excision by which you remove it, be from the side where it hangs more with the egg. And examine it carefully with the excision according to what is possible for you.
Deinde perfora sifac plenum aqua perforatione ampla, et extrahe totam aquam.	 Then perforate the sponge full of water with a wide perforation, and remove all the water.
Deinde separa inter duo labia sectionis cum uncinis, et extende sifac ad superiora, et non tangas cutem testiculorum comprehendentem: et incide sifac qualitercunque est possibile tibi incidere ipsum, aut cum totalitate sua, aut frustatim, praecipue latus eius subtile.	 Then separate between the two lips of the section with hooks, and extend the sponge to above, and do not touch the skin enclosing the testicles: and cut the sponge however it is possible for you to cut it, either all at once or in pieces, especially its thin side.
Nam si tu non exquisite perscrutaris, in incisione eius non fit securitas, quin aqua redeat.	 For if you do not carefully examine, there will be no certainty that the water does not return upon cutting it.
Si autem procedit ouum exterius a cute sua in hora operationis tuae: tunc quando compleueris sectionem sifac, reduc ipsum.	 But if the egg comes out of its shell during your operation: then, after you have filled the sponge section, put it back.
Deinde aggrega duo labia cutis testiculorum cum sutura.	 Then gather together the two lips of the skin of the testicles with a stitch.
Deinde cura ipsum sicut reliqua uulnera, donec sanetur.	 Then care for it as you would for other wounds, until it heals.
Quod si inuenis ouum corruptum ex nigredine alia, tunc oportet ut liges uasa, quae sunt suspensorium, timens fluxum sanguinis.	 But if you find the egg rotten because of another blackness, then it is necessary for you to tie the vessels that are the suspension, fearing a flow of blood.  />
Deinde abscinde testiculum cum suspensorio, et extrahe ouum: postea cura illud cum eo quod diximus.	 Then cut off the testicle with its suspension and remove the egg; afterwards care for it as we have said.
Si uero aqua est aggregata in duabus partibus, tunc scias quia sunt duae ramices: seca ergo partem aliam secundum quod fecisti in altera aequaliter.	 But if the water is collected in two parts, then know that there are two branches; cut off the other part just as you did to the first one equally.
Et si aequatur tibi, ut sit operatio una, tunc fac: deinde absterge sanguinem.	 And if it seems good to you that the operation is one, then do so; afterwards clean off the blood.
Et intromitte in sectiones lanam submersam in oleo, aut in oleo rosato: et pone deforis lanam aliam quam submersisti in uino et oleo, et expande eam super duos testiculos, et mirach uentris: et pone desuper pannos duplicatos, et sunt puluilli: et liga eos desuper cum ligamento, quod est habens sex secundum hanc formam.	 And introduce into the sections wool soaked in oil or in rose-colored oil; and place on top another piece of wool that you have soaked in wine and oil, and spread it over the two testicles and the navel: and put on top double cloths, which are pads; and tie them on top with a ligature, which has six [parts] according to this shape.
Deinde sumantur duo panni, et suantur, et impleantur la na carminata, secundum hanc similitudinem: et fiant extremitates quibus premitur ex coto, aut lana humida: et aggregentur cum strictura in lumbari bracharum: et una extremitatum accipiat super anum usque ad dorsum, et secunda accipiat ad partem pectinis: et duae extremitates super duas coxas inferius, et duae extremitates aliae super duo inguina, et aggregetur strictura tota in lumbari bracharum.	 Then let two cloths be taken and soaked, and filled with wool, according to this likeness; and their ends which are pressed from a bag or wet wool; and they are gathered together with a bandage in the loins of the thighs: and one end reaches over the buttocks up to the back, and the second reaches to the pubic region; and the two other ends go over the two hips below, and the other two ends over the two groins; and all is gathered together with a bandage in the loins of the thighs.  />
Et, quandoque artificialiter medicatur haec ramex cum cauterio loco sectionis cum ferro: et est, ut accipias cauterium cultellare subtile, et seces cum eo cutem testiculorum: et est ignitum, secundum quod narrauimus: donec quando detegitur sifac album continens aquam: tunc accipe cauterium, secundum hanc formam.	 And sometimes this root is treated artificially with a cautery in place of cutting with iron: and it is done by taking a subtle knife-like cautery, and cutting the skin of the testicles with it; and it is ignited, as we have narrated; until when the white sac containing water is exposed, then take a cautery of this form.
Assimilatur literae graecae.	 It resembles the Greek letter.
Deinde perfora cum eo illud sifac, et est ignitum, donec egrediatur humiditas tota.	 Then pierce that sac with it, and ignite it, until all moisture has exited.
Deinde extende sifac cum uncinis, et excoria cum cauterio subtili ignito, et incide ipsum secundum quod possibile est tibi, donec eradices totum eius.	 Then extend the sac with hooks, and scrape it with a thin ignited cautery, and cut it as much as you can until you have removed all of it.
Et caue ex ouo, ne tangat ipsum ignis.	 And be careful from the egg, lest the fire touch it.
Et scias, quod haec operatio est saluior, et longinquior a fluxu sanguinis, et melior quam operatio cum sectione.	 And know that this operation is safer, and more distant from bleeding, and better than the operation with cutting.
Si uero contrarietatem tibi facit in hora sectionis, aut in hora cauterii apostema calidum, aut fluxus sanguinis, aut aliquid aliud: tunc oportet ut cures quod contrarietatem tibi facit ex illo cum curatione quae conuenit ei, secundum quod praemissum est.	 But if in the hour of cutting or the hour of cautery a hot abscess arises, or bleeding, or anything else: then it is necessary to cure what opposes you with the appropriate treatment for that, as has been said before.
Si autem infirmus est timidus, et non expectat super hanc operationem, propter horribilitatem suam: tunc administra perforationem secundum quod ego narro illud: et est.	 But if the patient is fearful and does not tolerate this operation because of its horror, then perform a puncture as I have described it. And it is.
Quando certificatur tibi apud te per illud quod diximus de significationibus, quod ramex est aquosa: tunc oportet quod facias sedere infirmum super sedem eleuatam.	 When it is confirmed to you by the signs we have mentioned that the root is watery: then you must make the patient sit on an elevated seat.
Deinde perfora apostema in inferiori parte sui cum spatumili lato: et pone perforationem secundum longitudinem corporis, et sit apertio ampla, donec currat aqua tota.	 Then pierce the abscess at its lower part with a wide spatula: and make the puncture along the length of the body, and let the opening be wide until all water has run out.  \\
Deinde pone super locum cotum, et liga ipsum, et dimitte ipsum ut currat residuum aquae: deinde cura ipsum, donec sanetur uulnus.	 Then place a cloth over the wound and bind it; let the remaining water flow out. Then care for the patient until the wound heals.
Si autem contrarietas sit egressioni aquae in hora qua perforas ipsam: et non sit illud nisi propterea, quia panniculus albus contrarietatem facit in orificio uulneris, et prohibet exitum aquae: tunc oportet ut intromittas pennam in uulnus, aut instrumentum cum quo extrahitur aqua hydropicorum, cuius forma praecessit: aut adde in operatione uulneris parumper.	 If, however, there is resistance to the passage of water at the time you perforate it, and this is only because the white membrane causes obstruction in the opening of the wound and prevents the exit of water, then you should insert a feather into the wound, or an instrument with which water from hydrocephalic patients is extracted, whose form has been mentioned before; or add something to the operation of the wound for a short while.
Et scias, quod aqua redit, et aggregatur post sex menses, aut circiter eos.	 And know that water returns and accumulates after six months, or thereabouts.
Cum ergo aggregatur, tunc pertoretur secundum eundem modum, et pertransibit infirmus dies suos.	 When it accumulates again, then it should be pierced in the same manner, and the patient will pass his days.
¶ De cura Ramicis carnosae.	 ¶ On the treatment of fleshy warts.
Caput LXIII.	 Chapter 63.
Scias, quod in sectione super hanc Ramicem, est ex timore perducente ad perniciem in pluribus dispositionibus.	 Know that in the incision of this wart, there is a danger leading to destruction in many situations.
Quapropter uidetur mihi eius dimissio saluari ex ea.	 Therefore, it seems to me that its removal can be saved from this.
Et ego sum rememorans operationem in ea, et species apostematis.	 And I am reminded of the operation on it and the appearance of the wart.
Dico ergo, quod accidunt apostemata multa in corporibus, ex quibus componuntur testiculi: et fit illud ex caussis multis, scilicet.	 Therefore, I say that many warts appear on the body, from which testicles are formed: and this happens for many reasons, namely.
Aut ex superfluitate acuta, uel acri, quae effunditur ad testiculos.	 Or from an acute or sharp excess that is poured out to the testicles.
Aut ex percussione.	 Or from a blow.
Et est color apostematis secundum colorem corporis, et non inuenitur ei dolor: et est apostema graue.	 And the color of the wart is according to the color of the body, and no pain is found for it; and the wart is heavy.  />
Et fortasse est apostema lapideum, cuius color est fuscus, et non est sensus ei.	 And perhaps it is a stone-like wart, whose color is dark, and there is no sensation of it.
Et quandoque fit ex nodatione arteriarum, et inflatione earum: sicut iam praecessit eius rememoratio: aut ex inflatione uenarum.	 And sometimes it happens from the swelling of the arteries and their distension, as has already been mentioned before; or from the distension of veins.
Quod ergo est ex eis ex inflatione arteriarum, cognoscitur per dispositionem apostematis, quando comprimis ipsum digitis tuis.	 Therefore, what is caused by this from the distension of the arteries is recognized by the arrangement of the wart when you press it with your fingers.
Et non oportet ut tangas ipsum prorsus.	 And it is not necessary that you touch it at all.
Illud uero quod fit ex inflatione uenarum, non dispergitur ex eo aliquid apud compressionem cum digitis.	 But what results from the inflation of veins, nothing disperses from it upon pressing with the fingers.
Et iam possibile est, quod super hanc speciem fiat sectio, et super reliquas carnes: et est, ut seces cutem testiculorum.	 And now it is possible that a section be made over this kind and over other flesh: which is to say, cutting the skin of the testicles.
Deinde extende ouum ad sursum, et extrahe ipsum cum sifach albo: et libera suspensorium ex uasis, et liga uasa: et incide suspensorium postquam tu liberas ipsum ab omni parte ex partibus oui.	 Then stretch the egg upwards and extract it with a white siphon: free the suspending ligaments from the vessels and tie off the vessels; cut the suspending ligament after you have freed it entirely from all parts of the egg.
Si ergo ouum consolidatum est cum illis carnibus natis, tunc oportet ut attrahas ouum, et incidas ipsum.	 If therefore the egg is attached to those fleshy parts, then it is necessary that you draw out the egg and cut it.
Et si adhaerentia est inter aliquid ex siphaket, aut in eo quod est inter uasa: tunc oportet ut liberes totam illam adhaerentiam, et incidas eam incisione rotunda.	 And if there is an attachment between anything of the siphon or within it among the vessels: then it is necessary that you free all that attachment and cut it with a round incision.
Si autem est natiuitas carnis in loco adhaerentiae quae est retro: tunc oportet ut incidas totum eius, et extrahas ouum, sicut diximus.	 But if there is a growth of flesh in the place of attachment which is behind, then it is necessary that you cut all of it and extract the egg, as we have said.
Cum ergo completur operatio tua, tnnc imple uulnus in lana infusa in oleo rosato, et uino: deinde cura ipsum cum reliqua curatione, donec sanetur.	 When your operation is therefore completed, then fill the wound with wool soaked in rose oil and wine; then treat it with the other treatments until it heals.
¶ De cura Ramicis, quae est cum Vite.	 About the treatment for hemorrhoids that occur with varicose veins.
Caput LXIIII.	 Chapter 64.
Uitis est apostema inuolutum quadam inuolutione, simile botro, cum mollificatione testiculorum: et fit difficilis super infirmum motus et exercitium, et deambulatio.	 Varicose veins are a swollen tumor wrapped in some kind of wrapping, similar to a bunch of grapes, with softening of the testicles; and it makes difficult movement, exercise, and walking for the infirm.
Et in curatione huius aegritudinis est ex timore, propter illud cuius praecessit rememoratio.	 And in the treatment of this illness there is fear, because of that which preceded it in memory.
Verum oportet, ut dicamus operationem in ea secundum quod fecerunt primi.	 Truly, we must say how to perform the operation on it, just as the first did.  ?>
Dico ergo, quod oportet ut facias sedere infirmum super sedem eleuatam.	 Therefore I say that you must have the sick person sit on a raised seat.
Deinde impelle suspensorium testiculorum ad inferiora.	 Then push the scrotum downwards.
Deinde tene cutem testiculorum cum digitis tuis, cum uasis quae sunt propinqua uirgae: et teneat ea minister alius, et extendat ea extensione uehementi.	 Then take hold of the skin of the scrotum with your fingers, along with the vessels that are near the penis; and let another assistant hold this, and stretch it out strongly.
Deinde incide cum spatumili lato acuto sectione transuersa in directo uasorum, donec detegantur uasa.	 Then cut with a sharp, broad scalpel across the vessels until they are laid bare.
Deinde excoria ab omni parte, sicut diximus tibi in extractione Arteriarum quae sunt in timporibus.	 Then peel it from all sides, as we have told you in the removal of temporal arteries.
Postea fige in eis acum in qua sit filum duplum, et liga ipsum in primo locorum quibus accidunt Vites: et liga ipsum iterum in ultimo eorum.	 Then place an awl with a double thread in it, and tie the thread at the first places where the vessels are found; and tie it again at the last of these places.
Deinde seca ea in media sectione recta secundum longitudinem corporis, et extrahe quod aggregatur ex humiditatibus faeculentis corruptis.	 Then cut them with a straight cut lengthwise through the body, and remove whatever has accumulated from fetid, corrupt moisture.
Deinde cura uulnus cum curatione reliquorum uulnerum, in quibus uis generari saniem, ut cadant uasa quae nutriunt unum testiculorum.	 Then treat the wound like other wounds, where there is power to generate pus, so that the vessels which nourish the one testicle may fall away.
Non est enim malum per illud.	 For it is not bad through this.
Si autem accidat Vitis omnibus uasis, tunc oportet ut extrahantur propter hoc testiculi cum uasis: ut non priuetur ouum nutrimento, propter incisionem, et tabescat, uel arescat, et non sit iuuamentum cum eis.	 But if the vessel should happen to all the vessels, then it is necessary that the testicles be removed along with the vessels; so that the egg may not be deprived of its nourishment through the incision and rot or dry up and be no use.
¶ De cura Ramicis intestinalis.	 ¶ On treating a hernia of the small intestine.
Caput LXV.	 Chapter 65.
Euentus huius Ramicis est ex sectione, quae accidit in sifach extenso super uentrem in parte inguinum ex mirach uentris.	 The result of this hernia is the scrotum's splitting, which happens when the intestine becomes extended over the stomach in the groin area from the navel. ‌
Quare descendunt intestina ex illa Ruptura ad unum testiculorum.	 Why do the intestines descend through that rupture to one of the testicles? ‌ ‌
Et haec Ruptura est aut ex sifach, aut extensione eius.	 And this rupture is either from the scrotum or its stretching.
Et accidunt istae duae species ex caussis multis: aut ex percussione, aut saltu, aut clamore, aut eleuatione rei grauis, et similibus.	 And these two types happen for many reasons: either from a blow, or a jump, or a shout, or lifting a heavy object, and similar things. ‌
Et signum, quando est ex extensione sifach.	 And a sign is when it is from stretching.
Est quod accidit paulatim in tempore longo, et non accidit subito: et est apostema aequale uersus profundum: propterea, quod sifach comprimit intestinum.	 It is what happens gradually over a long time, and does not happen suddenly; and it is an abscess equal in depth: because the swelling compresses the intestine.
Et signum eius quando est ex sectione sifach, quia facit accidere ex principio sui dolorem uehementem subito: et est apostema diuersum, apparens sub cute propinque: et illud est propter exitum intestini, et cursus eius ad exteriora sifach.	 And a sign of it is when it is from the cutting of the swelling, because it causes severe pain suddenly at its beginning; and it is an abscess appearing under the skin nearby: and this is due to the exit of the intestine, and its path towards the exterior part of the swelling.
Et quandoque egreditur cum intestino zirbum: et nominatur haec Ramex intestinalis, et zirbia: et quandoque fit cum uentositate.	 And sometimes it exits with the intestine and a faecal mass; and this is called "intestinal fistula" or "faecal fistula"; and sometimes it occurs with flatulence.
Et quandoque currit in intestinum stercus, et retinetur illic: et est cum eo pernicies infirmi: quoniam facit accidere dolorem prauum, et praecipue quando premitur.	 And sometimes faeces flow into the intestine and are retained there; and it brings death to the sick person; because it causes severe pain, especially when pressed upon.
Et in curatione specierum aegritudinis huius cum ferro est timor: quare oportet ut caueatur casus in ea.	 And in the treatment of this disease with iron, there is danger; therefore it is necessary to be cautious in its use.
Et modus operationis est, ut praecipias infirmo, ut reducat intestinum manu sua ad interiora concauitatis suae, si obedit reditui.	 And the method of treatment is to instruct the patient to return the intestine by hand into the depths of their own cavity, if it submits to being returned.
Deinde resupinetur super collum suum inter manus tuas: et eleua crura eius.	 Then he should be placed on his back with his head between your hands; and raise his legs.
Deinde extende cutem quae sequitur cutem ad superiora, et seca cutem testiculorum totam per longitudinem.	 Then extend the skin that follows the skin upwards, and cut all of the scrotal skin along its length.
Deinde fige in duobus labiis sectionis uncinos, secundum quod indiges ad aperiendum sectionem cum eis: et sectio sit secundum quantitatem, quod sit possibile, ut egrediatur ex ea ouum.	 Then place hooks in the two lips of the incision according to what you need to open the incision with them; and let the incision be such that it is possible for an egg to pass through it.
Deinde excoria siphak, et quae sunt sub cute testiculorum, donec quando detegitur sifach album, durum ab omni parte: tunc intromitte digitum tuum indicem in eo quod sequitur testiculum, in eo quod est inter siphach album, quod est sub cute oui, et inter sifach secundum, et absolue cum eo adhaerentiam quae est in posteriori parte oui.	 Then scrape the swelling and what is beneath the scrotal skin until the white swelling is exposed, hard on all sides; then insert your index finger between the testicle and the white swelling that is beneath the scrotum and between the second swelling, and separate it from its attachment in the posterior part of the egg.
Deinde moue cum manu dextra ad interiora cutem testiculorum: et cum hoc extende sifach album ad sursum, cum manu sinistra: et eleua ouum cum sifach ad partem sectionis: et praecipe ministro, ut extendat ouum ad sursum: et tu solue adhaerentiam, quae est retro solutione completa.	 Then move with the right hand to the interior skin of the testicles, and with this extend the white thread upwards with the left hand; lift the egg with the thread towards the section; instruct the assistant to extend the egg upwards; and you release the adhesion that is behind after the solution is completed.
Et quaere digitis tuis, ut non sit aliquid illic ex intestino inuoluto in sifach albo duro.	 And check with your fingers to ensure there is nothing of the entrails wrapped in the hard white thread.
Si autem inuenis ex eo aliquid: tunc impelle ipsum ad uentrem inferius.	 But if you find anything from it, then push it down towards the abdomen.
Deinde accipe acum, in qua sit filum grossum, factum licinium ex decem filis: et intromitte ipsam apud postremum sifach, id est, tunicae, quod est sub cute testiculorum quae sequitur sectionem: deinde incide extremitates quae eminent ex filo, donec sint quatuor fila.	 Then take a needle with a thick thread, made from ten threads; and insert it through the end of the thread, that is, the tunic, which is under the skin of the testicles following the section; then cut off the ends protruding from the thread until there are four threads left.
Deinde compone quaedam eorum super quaedam cum figura quae sit in modo crucis: et liga cum eis alsifach, de quo diximus, quia est sub cute testiculorum ligamento uehementi, donec non possit aliquod ex uasis, quae nutriunt eos mittere ad eos aliquid: ut non accidat inde apostema calidum.	 Then arrange some of them over others in the shape of a cross; and tie with them the thread which we have mentioned, because it is under the skin of the testicles, with a strong ligature, so that nothing from the vessels that nourish them can reach them: so that a hot abscess does not arise from there.
Et pone iterum ligamentum secundum extra ligamentum primum, longinquum ab eo minus duobus digitis.	 And place another ligature outside the first ligature, distant by two finger widths.
Et post ista duo ligamenta dimitte ex sifach, quod est sub cute testiculorum, quantitatem magnitudinis digiti: et incide reliquum totum secundum rotunditatem, et aufer ex eo ouum.	 And after these two ligatures leave from the thread that is under the skin of the testicles a length equal to the size of a finger; and cut off the rest completely according to its roundness, and remove the egg from it.
Deinde seca in inferiori parte cutis testiculorum sectione, ex qua currit sanguis, et sanies: sicut narrauimus in eo quod praemissum est.	 Then cut in the lower part of the skin of the testicles at the place from which blood and pus flow, as we have narrated in what has been described before.
Deinde administra lanam submersam in oleo, et pone in uulnus: et administra ligamentum quod narrauimus.	 Then apply wool soaked in oil to the wound; and apply the ligature that we have mentioned.
Et quandoque cauterizatur sifach album quod diximus, post incisionem eius timendo de fluxu sanguinis.	 And sometimes the white thread which we have mentioned is cauterized after its incision, fearing the flow of blood.
Multotiens enim accidit illud.	 It often happens.
Et dimitte ligamentum, donec cadat per se.	 And let the suture drop on its own.
Si autem tardatur casus eius, tunc embrocetur cum aqua calida: et pone super ipsum illud quod diximus, donec cadat.	 If, however, its fall is delayed, then it should be soaked in warm water and place on it what we have said until it falls.
Deinde cura uulnus cum reliqua curatione uulnerum, donec curetur.	 Then treat the wound with the rest of the wound treatment until it is healed.
¶ De Ramice uentosa.	 ¶ On a swollen nose.
Caput LXVI.	 Chapter 66
IN Hac Ramice non uidi aliquem qui ausus fuerit super curationem eius cum ferro.	 In this condition, I have not seen anyone who dared to treat it with iron.
Et primi quidem dixerunt, quod fit sicut narrauimus in Ramice quae est cum Vite.	 And indeed the first said that it occurs as we have narrated in a swelling of the nose which is with a vein.
Quod est, ut liges uasa post sectionem super ea cum facilitate inferius: deinde seca in medio, et cura postremo cum eo quod aperit ipsum, donec cadant uasa: et cura uulnus, secundum quod diximus, donec sanetur.	 That is, after tying the vessels tightly after cutting them, treat them below with ease; then cut in the middle, and finally treat it until the vessels fall out with what opens it up; and treat the wound as we have said until it heals. ︎
¶ De disruptione quae fit in inguinibus.	 ¶ On a rupture that occurs in the groin.
Caput LXVII.	 Chapter 67
Quando accidit Ruptura in inguinibus, sicut diximus, et eminet locus, et non descendit ad testiculos aliquid ex intestinis: et si descendit, est illud parum, et redit in omnibus horis: uerum si prolongatur cum ea tempus, additur fissura in sifach, donec descendunt intestina in sifach.	 When a rupture occurs in the groin as we have said, and the area protrudes, but nothing comes out of the intestines to the testicles; and if something does come out, it is not much and returns every hour. But if that time is prolonged, a fissure is added in the scrotum until the intestines descend into the scrotum. ︎ ︎
Et accidit illud ex extensione sifach, quod est in inguinibus, sicut diximus.	 And this occurs from the extension of the scrotum which is in the groin, as we have said. ︎ ︎ ︎
Quod est, quia extenditur sifach: deinde mollificatur, et apostematur locus, et eminet.	 That is, because the scrotum stretches; then it softens and the area swells up.
Et cura eius est cum cauterio, sicut praecessit eius narratio.	 And its treatment is with a caustic, as the preceding narrative has shown.
Et quandoque curatur cum ferro, secundum hunc modum: et est, ut iaceat infirmus super dorsum suum inter manus tuas.	 And sometimes it is treated with iron in this manner; and that is to have the patient lie on his back between your hands. ︎ ︎ ︎
Deinde seca locum Rupturae apostematum et eminentem, sectione per latitudinem, secundum quantitatem trium digitorum.	 Then cut the area of the swollen and protruding rupture with a transverse incision, the width of three fingers.
Deinde stringe alsifak et, quae sunt sub cute, donec quando detegitur sifach album, quod est sub cute quae sequitur ipsum.	 Then tie off the al-saifaq and the parts under the skin until the white al-saifaq, which follows it, is exposed.
Tunc accipe radium, et pone ipsum super locum eminentem ex sifach, et preme ipsum ad profundum uentris.	 Then take a reed and place it on the protruding part of the intestine, and press it down into the abdomen.
Deinde sue duo loca eminentia super extremitatem radii ex sifach, et annecte cum sutura unum eorum cum altero: deinde extrahe extremitatem radii.	 Then if there are two protruding parts on the end of the reed coming out of the intestine, join one to the other with a stitch; then pull out the end of the reed.
Et non incidas alsifach omnino, neque tendas ouum, neque aliud, sicut feci te scire in curatione ramicis intestinalis.	 And do not cut through the al-saifaq at all, nor push an egg or anything else into it, as I have taught you in the treatment of intestinal adhesions.
Deinde cura illud curatione uulnerum.	 Then treat it with wound care.
Cum ergo incidis fila, mundifica illud, et restaura uulnus, donec consolidetur.	 So when you cut the strings, cleanse it and close the wound until it heals.
Sisach enim contrahitur, et non additur eminentia Rupturae.	 For the intestine contracts, and no protrusion of rupture occurs.
Et cauterium est melius in hoc loco: quoniam est propinquius ad salutem.	 And cautery is better in this place because it is closer to healing.
¶ De mollificatione cutis testiculorum.	 ¶ About softening the skin of the testicles.
Caput LXVIII.	 Chapter 68.
Multotiens mollificatur cutis testiculorum in quibusdam hominibus, propter quod mollificantur carnes quae sunt inter ea, et foedatur aspectus eius.	 Often the skin of the testicles is softened in some men, because of which the meat between them is also softened and its appearance becomes ugly.
Ergo necesse est ei qui rogatur in curatione eius, ut faciat iacere infirmum super dorsum suum, et incidat totam cutem quae mollificata est super cutem naturalem.	 Therefore it is necessary for the one who is asked to treat it that he make the sick man lie on his back and cut off all of the softened skin above the natural skin.  />
Deinde aggreget duo labia cum sutura: et si uis, sue in primis superfluitatem cutis mollificatae tribus suturis, aut quatuor, et firma suturam.	 Then gather the two lips together with a stitch; and if you wish, first remove the excess softened skin with three or four stitches, and secure the stitch firmly.
Deinde incide inter sututuras.	 Then cut between the stitches.
Deinde cura curatione reliquorum uulnerum, usquequo sanetur, et cadant fila.	 Then treat it with the care of other wounds until it heals and the strings fall out.  />
¶ De Castratione.	 ¶ About castration.
Caput LXIX.	 Chapter 69.  />  />
Scias, quod Castratio in lege nostra excommunicata est: et propter illud liceret mihi, ut non rememorarer eius in libro meo isto: et non est necessaria rememoratio eius, nisi propter duos modos.	 You should know that castration is excommunicated according to our law: and because of this it would be permitted for me not to mention it in my book; and there is no need to mention it except for two reasons.
Quorum unus est, ut sit illud in scientia medici quando interrogatur de ea: et ut sciat curationem eius cui accidit.	 One of these is so that it may be known by the physician when he is asked about it, and so that he may know how to treat the one on whom it has occurred.
Et modus alter est, quod nos multotiens indigemus castratione quorundam animalium, propter iuuamenta nostra per illud, sicut arietum, hyrcorum, et gattorum, et similium ex animalibus.	 And the other reason is that we often need the castration of certain animals for our benefit through it, such as rams, asses, cats, and similar creatures.
Dico ergo, quod Castratio fit secundum duos modos.	 I say therefore, that castration is done in two ways.
Aut per attritionem.	 Either by attrition.
Aut per fissuram, et sectionem.	 Or by incision and cutting.
In illa autem quae fit per attritionem, uia operationis est: quod nos faciamus sedere animal in aqua calida, donec mollificentur testiculi eius, et leniantur, et pendeant: deinde attere eos manu tua, donec resoluantur et non appareant sub tactu.	 In that which is done by attrition, the way of the operation is this: we make the animal sit in hot water until its testicles become softened and relaxed and hang down; then you grind them with your hand until they dissolve and do not appear to touch.
In castratione autem per fissuram et sectionem, oportet ut teneas animal, et premas cutem testiculorum eius cum manu sinistra.	 But in the castration by incision and cutting, it is necessary for you to hold the animal and press its testicular skin with your left hand.
Deinde liga suspensorium, et seca super omne ouum sectione una, donec quando procedunt duo oua: tunc incide ea postquam excoriaueris utrumque, et non dimittas super ea ex sifaket aliquid praeter sifac subtile, quod est super uasa.	 Then bind the suspensory ligament, and cut above both testicles with a single incision until two testicles protrude; then cut them after you have removed the skin from each, and do not leave anything on them except for a thin layer of tissue that is over the vessels.
Et iste modus castrationis est melior eo qui fit per attritonem: quoniam attritio fortasse relinquit aliquid ex testiculis, quare desiderat animal coitum.	 And this method of castration is better than that done by attrition, because attrition perhaps leaves something of the testicles, and so the animal desires copulation. 
Deinde cura uulnus, donec sanetur.	 Then care for the wound until it heals.
¶ De cura Hermafroditae duorum modorum.	 ¶ On the treatment of a hermaphrodite in two ways. ¶
Caput LXX.	 Chapter 70
Hermafrodita ex uiris est secundum duos modos.	 A hermaphrodite is from men in two ways.
Vnus eorum est, quia apparet in eo quod sequitur spacium, aut in cute testiculorum, in eo quod est inter duos testiculos, figura quasi uulua mulieris, in qua sunt pili: et quandoque currit urina ex eo quod est in cute testiculorum.	 "One of them is that it appears as a gap or in the skin of the testicles, between two testicles, in the form of a woman's mouth with hair on it; and sometimes urine flows from it.
In mulieribus autem est species una, et est uulua mulieris super pectinem sicut testiculi uiri parui omnino, eminentes ad exteriora: quorum unus est sicut priapus uiri, et duo sicut duo testiculi.	 "However, in women there is one form, and it is like a woman's mouth above the pubis, similar to a man's small testicles protruding outward; of which one is like a man's penis and two like two testicles.
Et curatio trium specierum, duarum ex uiris, et speciei unius ex mulieribus, est: quia oportet ut incidas carnes additas, donec effugiat impressio earum.	 "And the treatment for these three forms, two from men and one from women, is that you should cut away the added flesh until the impression of them disappears.
Deinde cura eas curatione reliquorum uulnerum.	 "Then treat them with the same care as other wounds.
In specie autem secunda uirorum, ex qua egreditur urina, quae est in cute testiculorum, non est operatio, neque est eius curatio omnino.	 "In the second form of men, from which urine flows and is located in the skin of the testicles, there is no treatment or cure whatsoever.
¶ De incisione Tentiginis, et carnis eminentis in uuluis mulierum.	 "About cutting the labia minora and protruding flesh in women's genitals.
Caput LXXI.	 "Chapter 71.
Tentigo fortasse additur super rem naturalem, donec foedatur et turpis fit aspectus eius: et quandoque magnificatur in quibusdam mulieribus adeo, donec expanditur sicut in uiris, et peruenit usque ad coitum.	 "The labia minora may grow excessively over the natural state until it becomes unsightly and disfigured; sometimes it increases so much in certain women that it swells like in men and reaches the point of intercourse.
Oportet ergo ut teneas superfluitatem Tentiginis manu, aut cum uncino, et incidas: et non ultimes in incisione, praecipue in profundo radicis: ut non accidat fluxus sanguinis.	 "Therefore, you should hold the excess of the labia minora with your hand or with a hook and cut it; do not finish cutting deeply, especially at the root, so that bleeding does not occur.
Deinde cura ipsam curatione uulnerum, donec sanetur.	 "Then treat it as you would any other wound until it heals.
Caro autem orta, est caro quae nascitur in orificio matricis, donec impleat ipsum: et fortasse egreditur ad exteriora secundum similitudinem caudae: et propter illud quidam primi nominant aegritudinem caudatam.	 "The flesh that grows is the flesh that develops at the opening of the womb until it fills it, and sometimes it protrudes outside like a tail; and because of this some call this disease 'tail-like'.
Oportet ergo ut incidamus eam sicut incidimus Tentiginem, et curemus eam, donec sanetur.	 "Therefore, we should cut it as we would the labia minora and treat it until it heals.
¶ De cura Alratica, quae est uulua mulieris non perforata.	 The care of Alratica, which is a woman's ulcer that has not perforated.
Caput LXXII.	 Chapter 72.
Alratica est, ut sit uulua mulieris non perforata, aut sit foramen paruum.	 Alratica is, as it were, a woman's ulcer that has not perforated, or there may be a small hole.
Et est aut naturalis, aut accidentalis.	 And it is either natural or acquired.
Accidentalis est ex aegritudine quae praecessit: et ipsa quidem fit aut ex carne nata addita, aut sifach subtili, aut spisso: et fit aut in profundo matricis, aut in lateribus eius, aut in superiore ipsius, aut inferiori eius: et prohibet a coitu et impregnatione, et partu, et fortasse prohibet menstrua.	 Acquired is from the preceding illness, and it itself occurs either from flesh born of an addition or sifach subtilis or thick: and it occurs either in the depths of the womb, or in its sides, or in its upper part, or its lower part: and it prevents intercourse and pregnancy, and childbirth, and perhaps it prevents menstruation.
Et cognitio illius fit per aspectum obstetricis, si opilatio est apparens propinqua.	 And the recognition of it is by the inspection of the midwife, if there is an apparent protrusion nearby.
Si autem non est apparens, tunc quaere eam digitis tuis, aut cum radio.	 But if it is not apparent, then seek it with your fingers or with a stick.
Si autem opilatio est ex sifach subtili, et est propinqua duobus labiis: tunc propera, et disrumpe ipsam.	 If the protrusion is from sifach subtilis and is near the two lips, then hasten and cut it off.
Et est, ut ponas super duo labia puluillos.	 And it is, as if you place on the two lips a small amount of powder.
Deinde pone indices tuos duarum manuum simul, et mulier sit super dorsum suum expansis cruribus suis.	 Then place your indicators of both hands together and let the woman be on her back with her legs spread. 》 》
Deinde extende duo labia cum fortitudine, donec disrumpatur sifach subtile, et aperiatur opilatio.	 Then stretch the two lips firmly until the sifach subtilis is broken open and the protrusion is exposed.
Deinde accipe lanam, et imbibe eam in oleo, et pone ipsam super locum: et coeat mulier omni die, ut non consolidetur locus uice alia.	 Then take some wool and soak it in oil and place it on the spot; and let the woman keep doing this every day, so that the place does not become hardened in another way.
Si autem sifach est grossum, spissum: tunc oportet ut seces ipsum cum spatumili lato simili folio myrti.	 But if the sifach is thick and dense, then it is necessary to cut it off with a broad scalpel similar to a myrtle leaf. 》 》 》 》
Si autem opilatio est ex carne nata, tunc suspende eam cum uncinis, et incide eam: et sint tecum medicinae quae fluxum sedant sanguinis absque mordicatione, sicut acacia, et sanguis draconis, et thus aggregatum cum albugine oui.	 If the protrusion is from flesh born of an addition, then hang it with hooks and cut it off; and let there be with you medicines that settle bleeding without irritation, such as acacia and dragon's blood and powdered eggshell.
Deinde administra cannulam ex plumbo amplam, ut non consolidetur uulnus uelociter, teneat eam diebus aliquot: et administra licinium ex lino sicco, deinde curetur reliqua curatione, donec sanetur.	 Then administer a wide lead tube so that the wound does not heal quickly; hold it for some days. And administer dry linen bandage, then proceed with the rest of the treatment until it heals.
Et quandoque nasciur in matrice natiuitas carnium aliarum: oportet ergo ut incidantur secundum hunc modum: dum non est apostema cancerosum apostemati enim canceroso quod est in matrice, non fiat contrarietas cum ferro omnino.	 Sometimes a mass of other flesh forms in the womb; it is necessary to cut it according to this method: as long as it is not a malignant tumor, for a malignant tumor in the womb cannot be treated with iron at all.
¶ De cura hemorroidarum, Athehelil, et Bothor rubeae in uuluis mulierum.	 On the treatment of hemorrhoids, Athena, and red pustules in women's wounds.
Caput LXXIII.	 Chapter 73.
Hemorroides quidem sunt apertio orificiorum uenarum, donec currit ex eis sanguis multus assidue.	 Hemorrhoids are the opening of the vein passages until much blood runs out of them constantly.
Cum ergo antiquantur hemorroides, fiunt thelil: et iam dixi in diuisione species earum, et signa ipsarum: et dicam hic quae ex eis recipiunt curationem, et quae non.	 When hemorrhoids become inflamed, they become pustules; and I have already mentioned their divisions, characteristics, and signs in the previous section. Here, I will explain which ones can be treated and which cannot. )))
Dico ergo, quod hemorroides quae sunt in orificio matricis, et non apparent sensui: tunc non est ei curatio cum ferro.	 Therefore, I say that hemorrhoids located at the opening of the womb and not felt by touch cannot be treated with iron.
Quae autem ex eis sunt in orificio matricis super quas cadit sensus, sunt quae curantur.	 But those that are located at the opening of the womb and can be felt by touch can be treated.
Oportet ergo ut intromittas mulierem in domum frigidam.	 Therefore, it is necessary to introduce the woman into a cold house.
Deinde extende athehelil cum forficibus, aut cum panno aspero, et incide eas ex radicibus suis.	 Then stretch Athena with scissors or with rough cloth and cut them from their roots.
Deinde pulueriza super eas apud fluxum sanguinis ex uno puluerum incisiuorum absque mordificatione: sicut acacia, et sanguis draconis, et thus, et similia eis.	 Then sprinkle powder on them at the time of bleeding from one of the cut-off powders without moldiness, such as acacia, dragon's blood, thyme, and similar ones. ))) ))) ))))
Deinde impellat pedes eius ad parietem hora una.	 Then let her press her feet against the wall for one hour.
Postea depone eam in aquam frigidam.	 Afterwards, place her in cold water. ))) ))) )))) )))
Quod si perseuerat fluxus sanguinis: tunc fac eam sedere in decoctione sumach, et corticum granatorum, et gallarum, et similium.	 But if the bleeding persists, then have her sit in a decoction of sumac, pomegranate rinds, gallnuts, and similar things.
Deinde accipe farinam hordei, et confice eam cum melle et aceto, et fac emplastrum cum eo super dorsum eius.	 Then take barley flour, and mix it with honey and vinegar, and make a poultice with it on his back.
Si ergo abscinditur sanguis cum eo, bonum est: et si non, fac adhaerere dorso uentosas, et mammillis, absque scarificatione.	 If the blood is cut with it, that is good; and if not, make adhesive plasters stick to his back and nipples without puncturing.
Deinde accipe lanam, et submerge in succo tarathit, aut succo arnoglossae, aut succo ramorum alaulat, id est, aglanter, uino pontico, et fac adhaerere loeo.	 Then take wool and soak it in the juice of taractyllum, or the juice of arnoglosse, or the juice of the branches of alaual, that is, aglanthus, with Pontic wine, and make it stick to the place.
Cum ergo quiescit apostema, tunc cura locum cum unguentis, donec sanetur.	 When the abscess rests, then care for the place with ointments until it heals.
Albarth uero rubeum est simile capitibus alhaasse, et est asperi aspectus.	 However, the red albarth resembles the heads of garlic and is rough to look at.
Oportet ergo ut incidas quod apparet ex eo, secundum quod dixi in thelil aequaliter: et cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	 Therefore you should cut what appears from it, as I said about the thelili, and care for it until it heals.
¶ De perforatione Exiturae quae accidit in matrice.	 § On Perforations of the Birth Canal that Occur in the Uterus.
Caput LXXIIII.	 Chapter 74.
Accidunt in matrice species multae apostematum, sicut cancer, et apostema lapideum, et ulcera, et adubelati, et alekilati, id est, herpes, aestiomemus, et fistulae, et hemorroides, et ragadiae, et thelil, et apostema calidum.	 Many types of abscesses occur in the uterus, such as cancer, stone abscess, ulcers, adubelati, alekilati, that is, herpes, aestiomemus, fistulas, hemorrhoids, ragadiae, thelili, and hot abscess.  />
Et ego quidem iam dixi omnes has aegritudines et species earum, et signa ipsarum, et earum curationes in diuisione: necesse est ut dicam in hoc tractatu apostema calidum quod accidit in matrice, quando est ex apostematibus quae colligunt saniem, et uis scire qualiter fit eius apertio cum ferro.	 And I have already spoken about all these illnesses and their types, and the signs of them, and their treatments in the division; it is necessary for me to speak about hot abscess that occurs in the uterus, when it is one of the abscesses that collect pus, and you want to know how its opening with iron is made.  /> 
Oportet ergo ut consideres.	 You should therefore consider:
Tunc si dolor apostematis in incaeptione sua est acutus cum percussione sua, et flamma, et febre: et uides ipsum rubere: si cadit super ipsum sensus, tunc non properes cum perforatione eius: et cura ipsum cum eo eo quod iuuat super maturationem, donec quando quiescat acuitas accidentium.	 If the pain of the abscess in its beginning is sharp with pulsation and heat and fever, and you see it redden; if a sense of loss occurs over it, then do not hasten to perforate it: care for it until it reaches maturation, until the acuteness of the incident subsides.  />  
Tunc oportet ut facias sedere mulierem super sedem quae labeat duo sedilia, et reclinetur, uel appodietur super dorsum suum, et aggreget pedes suos ad partem inferiorem uentris: et sint coxae eius expansae, et ponat brachia sua sub genibus suis, et liget utraque ligamento conueniente ad illud.	 Then you should have the woman sit on a seat with two openings, and let her lean back or be placed on her back, and bring her feet to the lower part of her abdomen: and let her hips be spread apart, and let her place her arms under her knees, and tie each one with a suitable ligament.
Deinde sedeat obstetrix a latere dextro, et administra instrumentum quo aperitur orificium matricis.	 Then the midwife should sit on the right side, and administer the instrument by which the opening of the womb is opened.
Cuius forma uenit in eis quae sunt post.	 The shape of which comes in those that follow.
Et oportet quando uis administrare hoc instrumentum, ut figas cum Radio profundum matricis mulieris: ut non sit illud quod ingreditur ex instrumento plus, quam profundum matricis, et laedat infirmam.	 And when you wish to administer this instrument, it is necessary that you measure with a rod the depth of the womb of the woman: so that what enters from the instrument is not more than the depth of the womb, and it harms the patient.
Si autem fuerit instrumentum magis quam profundum, tunc oportet ut ponas puluillos super tecturam profundi matricis: ut prohibeatur introitus instrumenti totius in profundum matricis: et oportet ut ponat uertiginem, quae currit in instrumento, ex latere superiore: et ut teneat instrumentum, et ut reuoluat minister uertiginem, donec aperiatur profundum matricis.	 But if the instrument is more than the depth of the womb, then it is necessary that you place cotton over the depth of the womb: so that the entrance of the entire instrument into the depth of the womb may be prevented: and it is necessary that you place the handle, which runs in the instrument, on the upper side: and let the assistant hold the instrument and let him roll the handle until the depth of the womb is opened.
Cum ergo apparet Exitura, et tangitur manu, et est lenis et mollis: tunc oportet ut seces ipsam apud caput suum cum spatumili lato.	 Therefore, when the opening appears and is touched by hand and is soft and gentle: then it is necessary that you cut it off at its head with a wide spatula.
Cum ergo euacuatur sanies, tunc oportet ut ponas in uulnus licinium submersum in oleo rosaceo: aut oleo uiridi, in quo sit quaedam stipticitas: et pone licinium, et extrahe sectionem in profundo matricis.	 Therefore, when the blood is evacuated, then it is necessary that you place a cloth soaked in rose oil or green oil with some astringent quality into the wound: and place the cloth, and pull out the cut from the depth of the womb.
Et pone exterius super matricem, et super pectinem lanam mundam submersam in aqua, in qua bullitae sunt maluae.	 And place externally over the womb and over the pubic bone clean wool soaked in water in which mallow has been boiled.
Deinde curetur post duos dies cum unguento quod conuenit ad illud, donec sanetur.	 Then after two days it should be cleaned with a suitable ointment until it heals.
Et quandoque abluitur matrix et uulnus, ita quod clisterizatur cum aqua et melle: deinde cum aqua in qua bullita est radix lilii, aut aristolochia longa: deinde redeat ad unguentum.	 And sometimes the abdomen and wound are washed such that they are given an enema with water and honey; then with water in which lily root or long aristolochia has been boiled; then return to the ointment.
Quod si uulnus absconditum fuerit interius in matrice, tunc oportet ut prohibearis ex curatione eius cum ferro, imo cura ipsum cum eo quod diximus in diuisione.	 If the wound has been hidden inside the abdomen, then you must be prevented from treating it with iron; instead, treat it with what we have said in the division.
¶ Doctrinae Obstetricum, qualiter medicentur embriones uiui, secundum figuram non naturalem egressi.	 ¶ Instructions for Midwives, on how to heal living embryos that have exited in a non-natural form.
Caput Lxxu.	 Chapter 70.
Necesse est Obstetrici, ut cognoscat in primis figuram partus naturalis.	 It is necessary for the midwife to know first the natural form of childbirth.
Ex signis ergo eius est, quod quando uides mulierem comprimi ad inferiora, et desiderat odorare aerem, et alleuiatur super eam quod super ipsam est de partu, et festinat exitus embrionis: tunc scias quod iste partus est secundum figuram naturalem, et est exitus eius super caput suum, et secundina cum eo: aut suspensa, uel pendens ex umbilico.	 From its signs, you will know that when you see a woman pressed down to her lower parts and she desires to smell the air, and what is above her concerning childbirth is relieved, and the embryo hastily exits; then know that this birth is in the natural form, and its exit is over its head, and the afterbirth with it: either suspended or hanging from the navel.
Cum ergo uides haec signa, tunc oportet ut comprimatur uenter eius, ut descendat embrio uelociter.	 When you see these signs, then it is necessary to press on her abdomen so that the embryo may descend quickly.
Nam quando descendit super caput suum, descendit secundina cum eo, et mundatur ex illis superfluitatibus mundificatione bona.	 For when it descends over its head, the afterbirth descends with it, and it is cleaned of those excesses by a good cleaning.
Qui autem est praeter hunc partum, est innaturalis, illaudabilis.	 But that which is other than this birth is unnatural, inpraiseworthy.
Quoniam quandoque egreditur foetus super pedes suos, et egreditur corpus eius ante caput ipsius, et pedes eius, et manus eius una, aut pes eius unus: aut egreditur caput eius et manus eius: aut egreditur uentrinus: et fortasse conuertitur super collum suum, et similia ex figuris illaudabilibus.	 Because sometimes the fetus exits over its feet, and its body comes out before its head and its feet and one hand or one of its feet; or it exits headfirst with its hands; or its intestines come out; and perhaps it turns over its neck, and similar forms from the inpraiseworthy ones. />
Necesse est ergo Obstetrici, ut sit prudens, subtilis in istis rebus omnibus, et caueat sibi ab errore et decaeptione: et ego sum ostendens omnem figuram ex eis, et qualiter est ingenium in ea, et significetur per illud, et stetur super ipsum.	 Therefore, it is necessary for the midwife to be prudent and subtle in all these things, and to guard herself from error and deception; and I will show every form of them, and what the nature is in each one, and how it can be recognized and dealt with.
Quando egreditur foetus super caput suum egressione sua naturali, et uehemens fit illud super mulierem, et difficilis fit ei partus, et uides uirtutem eius iam debilitatam: tunc fac eam sedere super sedem, aut mulieres teneant eam: et uapora uuluam eius cum foenugraeco decocto, et cum oleis humidis.	 When the fetus comes out headfirst by its natural exit and becomes strong against the woman, and childbirth becomes difficult for her, and you see that her strength is already weakened: then make her sit on a seat, or let women hold her; and steam her face with fenugreek decoction and with moist oils.
Deinde intromittat Obstetrix inter digitos suos Spatumile paruum, et findat cum eo secundinam, et secet eam ungue suo, donec currat quod est in ea ex humiditate: et preme uentrem mulieris, donec descendat foetus.	 Then let the midwife insert a small spatula between her fingers and explore with it the secondine, and cut it with her nail until what is in it from moisture runs out; and press the woman's womb, until the fetus descends.
Si autem non descendit, tunc oportet ut clisterizetur mulier ex mucillagine foenugraeci, cum oleo sisamino.	 But if it does not descend, then it is necessary to give the woman an enema of fenugreek mucilage with sesame oil.
Deinde praecipe ei post clistere, ut comprimatur: et fac eam sternutare cum condisi, et tene os eius et nasum ipsius hora una.	 Then command her, after the enema, to be pressed; and make her sneeze with cumin, and hold her mouth and nose for one hour.
Foetus enim egredietur statim.	 For immediately the fetus will come out.
Quod si egrediantur duae manus foetus in primis, iunc oportet ut reducas eas cum facilitate paulatim.	 If two hands of the fetus emerge first, then you should carefully return them gradually with ease.
Si autem non obedit in introitu, tunc pone mulierem super sedem, et eleua pedes eius sursum: deinde concute sedem super terram: et mulier teneatur, ut non cadat apud concussionem.	 But if it does not obey upon entry, then place the woman on a seat and lift her feet up; then shake the seat on the ground, and let the woman be held so that she does not fall during the shaking.
Si ergo non egrediuntur manus, et moritur foetus: tunc incide eas, et extrahe residuum foetus: et liga manum eius cum panno, et extrahe ipsum cum aequalitate: nam ipse egredietur.	 If therefore the hands do not emerge and the fetus dies, then cut them off, and extract the remainder of the fetus; and bind its hand with a cloth, and extract it gently, for it will come out.
¶ Exitus embrionis super pedes suo.	 The exit of the embryo over its feet.
Quando egreditur foetus super pedes suos, tunc oportet ut impellat eos sursum: deinde conuertat foetum paulatim: postea aequet ipsum.	 When the fetus emerges over its feet, then it is necessary to push them up; then gradually turn the fetus; afterwards equalize it.
Deinde accipiat unum pedum eius, et extendat eum paulatim.	 Then take one of its feet and extend it gradually.
Cum ergo egrediuntur usque ad coxas, tunc praecipe ei, ut comprimatur, et fac eam sternutare cum condisi: egredietur enim, si Deus uoluerit.	 Therefore, when they come out to the hips, then command her to be pressed, and make her sneeze with cumin; for it will emerge if God wills it. 
Et si non egreditur cum eo quod narrauimus, tunc reduc foetum paulatim, donec ponas eum secundum figuram naturalem.	 And if it does not come out with what we have described, then gradually bring back the fetus until you place it in its natural shape.
Nam ipse egredietur tunc egressu facili.	 For he will then come out easily.
Quod si prohibeatur cum eo toto quod narrauimus: tunc accipe ex mucillagine alteae, et oleo sisamino, et gummi soluto: et percute totum in mortario percussione bona: deinde line cum eo uuluam mulieris, et inferius uentris eius.	 And if it is hindered with all that we have described, then take from the mucilage of flaxseed, and oil of sesame, and dissolved gum; and strike all together in a mortar with good pounding. Then anoint the woman's vulva and lower belly with it.
Deinde fac eam sedere in aqua tepida, donec consequatur hypocundria.	 Then make her sit in warm water until she reaches orgasm.
Cum ergo uides quod iam calefacta sunt inferiora eius, tunc fac ei sief de myrrha: et suppone ipsum.	 And when you see that the lower parts are now warmed, then make her a pessary of myrrh and insert it.
Quando ergo tenet sief hora una, tunc fac eam sedere super sedem.	 When the pessary has been in place for one hour, then have her sit on the stool.
Deinde fac eam sternutare: et stringe ipsius os et nasum: et preme inferiorem partem uentris compressione facili.	 Then make her sneeze, and pinch her mouth and nose, and gently press her lower abdomen.
Nam foeus egredietur statim.	 For the fetus will come out immediately.
¶ Exitus foetus super genua et manus.	 The exit of the fetus is through the knees and hands.
Quando egreditur secundum hanc formam, tunc ingeniet in intromittendo manus suas paulatim.	 When it exits in this way, then she should insert her hands gradually.  />
Deinde resupinetur mulier super collum suum, et pendeant pedes eius ad inferiora: et ipsa sit iacens super lectum, et complicet manus suas.	 Then let the woman be turned onto her back with her feet hanging down, and she should lie on a bed, wrapping her hands around herself.
Deinde preme supra uentrem eius paulatim.	 Then gradually press above her abdomen.  />  />
Deinde extrahe quod est sub pedibus eius ex puluinaribus, donec sit praeparata in inferiori parte.	 Then remove what is under her feet from the pillows until she is ready below.  />  />  />  />  />  />  />  />
Quod si non egreditur foetus, tunc accipe pedes eius, et moue eos motu uehementi.	 If the fetus does not come out, then take her feet and move them vigorously.
Deinde preme quod est supra hypocundria paulatim, donec ascendat foetus ad superiora.	 Then gradually press above the pubis until the fetus rises upwards.
Deinde intromittat manus suas, et aequet foetum paulatim: et praecipe mulieri, ut comprimatur, donec egrediatur foetus.	 Then she should insert her hands and gradually bring the fetus down; and instruct the woman to bear down until the fetus comes out.  />
¶ Exitus foetus latitudinaliter pendens ex manibus.	 The exit of a laterally hanging fetus from the hands.
Ingenietur in reductione manus eius.	 His hand is to be restored to its position.
Si autem non potest reducere eam, tunc eleua mulierem, et fac eam ambulare.	 But if it cannot be reduced, then raise the woman and make her walk.
Si uero ambulare non potest, tunc fac eam iacere super lectum: et concute crura eius concussione uehementi.	 If she is unable to walk, then lay her on a bed; and shake her legs with great force.
Deinde administra linimentum quod praeparasti ex mucillaginibus.	 Then apply the ointment which you have prepared from adhesives.
Quod si accipit eam partus, tunc fac eam sedere super sedem.	 But if she receives it in labor, then make her sit on a seat.
Deinde stude in reductione manus, et aequa foetum secundum figuram naturalem: et fac sternutare mulierem, et praecipe ei, ut comprimat se, donec egrediatur.	 Then strive to restore the hand and make the fetus equal according to its natural shape; and make the woman sneeze, and command her to compress herself until it comes out.
¶ Exitus foetus super collum suum, expansis manibus, et est facies eius ad dorsum matris suae.	 The exit of the fetus on its back with its hands extended, and its face is towards its mother's back.
Oportet ut teneat Obstetrix manum foetus, deinde reuoluat eum paulatim, et aequet eum cum facilitate.	 The midwife should hold the fetus' hand, then gradually roll it and equalize it with ease.
Cum ergo aequatur, tunc pone super uuluam eius quod narrauimus ex oleo et mucillaginibus.	 When it is equalized, then place on its nostrils what we have mentioned made from oil and adhesives.
Deinde praecipe ei, ut moueatur paulatim.	 Then command her to move slowly.
Cum ergo feceris illud, tunc fac eam sedere super sedem, et praecipe ei ut inclinetur ad latus dextrum.	 When you have done that, then make her sit on a seat and command her to lean towards the right side.
Deinde praecipe ei, ut comprimatur: et fac eam sternutare cum condisi.	 Then command her to compress herself; and make her sneeze with the help of the midwife.
¶ Exitus foetus praeparati super latus.	 The exit of a prepared fetus on its side.                    
Quando descendit ad orificium matricis secundum hunc modum cum secundina, tunc scinde secundinam cum ungue tuo, donec euacuetur ex humiditate.	 When it descends to the mouth of the womb in this way with the caul, then cut the caul with your nail until it is evacuated by its moisture.
Si ergo suspenditur super faciem foetus, et collum eius, tunc incide eam ex umbilico: ut non retineatur, et moriatur.	 If it hangs over the face and neck of the fetus, then cut her from the navel; so that it is not retained, and dies.                    
Deinde impelle foetum ad interiora, donec ponas eam secundum quod oportet: et praecipe mulieri, ut comprimat se aliquotiens: ipse enim egredietur exitu leui.	 Then push the fetus into the womb until you place her as needed: and instruct the woman to compress herself several times; for he will come out through the easy exit.
¶ Exitus Geminorum, aut foetuum multorum.	 Exit of twins or many fetuses.
Scias, quod Gemini multotiens nascuntur: et quandoque nascuntur tres, et quatuor.	 Know that twins are often born, and sometimes three, and four are born.
Verumtamen illud extraneum est, et raro contingit.	 Nevertheless, this is strange and rarely happens.
Quinque uero est res extra naturam, et non uiuunt penitus: et continet eos, quamuis multiplicentur, secundina una: et separantur per sifach, distinguens inter eos ligatum in umbilico cuiusque eorum.	 Five, however, is a thing beyond nature, and they do not live at all; and the secondine contains them, although they are many, with one. And they are separated by the sifach, distinguishing between each of them the ligament in their respective navels.
Et quandoque egrediuntur sicut egreditur foetus unus exitu naturali, facili: et egrediuntur exitu illaudabili, sicut narrauimus.	 And sometimes they come out as if a single fetus comes out through the natural and easy exit; and they come out through a praiseworthy exit, as we have told.
Quod si difficiles fuerint quidam eorum apud partum, et perueniunt ad illud quod diximus ex figuris innaturalibus, tunc cura eos sicut narrauimus: et sit ob stetrix subtilis, et faciat quod facit cum facilitate et tarditate, et ingenietur secundum omnem figuram cum eo quod praeparatur ei ex ingenio ducente ad salutem.	 But if some of them are difficult at birth and come to the unnatural figures we have mentioned, then care for them as we have said; and let the midwife be skillful, and do what she does with ease and delay, and arrange according to every figure with that which is prepared for her by the ingenuity leading to health. 》
¶ Rememoratio eius quod formatur in matrice ex embrionibus, et abortiuntur.	 Remembering what forms in the womb from embryos and miscarries.
Quandoque formatur in matrice unus, et duo, et tres, et quatuor, et quinque, et sex, et septem, et plures decem: et iam uerificatum est apud me, quod mulier abortiendo emisit septem, et alia quindecim, omnes formatos.	 Sometimes one forms in the womb, and two, and three, and four, and five, and six, and seven, and more than ten: and it has been verified with me that a woman miscarrying expelled seven, and another fifteen, all formed. 》 》 ⟩
Quod factum est mensuratione gloriosi sapientis.	 This was done by the measurement of the glorious wise man.

¶ De extractione foetus mortui.	 About the extraction of a dead fetus.
Caput LXXVI.	 Chapter 76
Quando curas foetum mortuum cum eo quod dixi in diuisione ex medicatione, et non egreditur, et cogeris uti operatione cum manu, tunc oportet ut consideres.	 When you cure a dead fetus with the medicine I mentioned in the division, and it does not come out, and you are forced to use surgery, then you must consider.
Si ergo mulier est sanae uirtutis, et non est cum aliquo ex accidentibus, ex quibus timetur super eam perditio: tunc oportet ut resupinetur mulier super lectum, super dorsum suum, et sit caput eius inclinatum inferius, et crura eius eleuata: et ministra teneat eam a duabus partibus, aut ligetur ad lectum, ut non extrahatur corpus eius apud extractionem foetus.	 If therefore the woman is of sound constitution and not affected by any condition that poses a risk to her life: then it is necessary for the woman to be turned onto her back on the bed, on her back, and let her head be lowered, and her legs raised: and let an assistant hold her from both sides, or she may be tied to the bed, so that her body does not move during the extraction of the fetus.
Deinde humecta os matricis ex oleis humidis cum mucillagine alteae, et foenugraeci, et seminis lini.	 Then moisten the mouth of the womb with moist oils mixed with mallow mucilage, and fenugreek, and flaxseed.
Deinde inungat Obstetrix manum suam cum istis oleis et mucillaginibus: deinde intromittat eam in matricem cum facilitate.	 Then the midwife should anoint her hand with these oils and mucilages; then she should gently insert it into the womb.
Deinde quaerat cum ea locum in quo figat uncinos ex foetu, et loca conuenientia ad illud.	 Then she should seek with it the place where she may insert the hooks into the fetus and the appropriate places for that.
Considera ergo tunc, si foetus est praeparatus ut descendat super caput suum: tunc fige uncinos in oculos eius, aut in collo eius, aut in ore eius, aut in palato ipsius, aut sub barba eius, aut in furcula ipsius, aut in locis propinquis costis, et sub hypocundriis.	 Therefore consider, if the fetus is prepared to descend head first: then insert the hooks into its eyes, or its neck, or its mouth, or its palate, or under its chin, or its breastbone, or in places near the ribs and under the armpits.
Si autem descensus est super pedes eius, tunc in pectine, et costis eius mediis.	 But if the descent is foot first, then in its pubic bone and midribs.
Et oportet, ut teneat uncinum cum manu dextra: et ponat curuitatem eius in eo quod est inter digitos sinistrae manus: et intromittat cum manu cum facilitate, et figat uncinum in aliquo illorum locorum quae diximus, donec perueniat ad rem uacuam.	 And it is necessary that she hold the hook with her right hand and place its curvature between the fingers of her left hand and insert it gently with her hand until she fixes the hook in one of those places we mentioned, until it reaches an empty space.
Deinde figat in oppositione eius uncinum alium, aut tertium, si indiges: ut sit contractio aequalis, et non declinet ad partem.	 Then she should fix another hook or a third one if necessary on the opposite side, so that there is an equal tension and it does not deviate to one side.
Deinde extendatur extensione aequali, et non sit extensio secundum rectitudinem tantum, imo moueatur ad omnem partem, ut alleuietur exitus eius: sicut fit cum dente apud eradicationem eius.	 Then let it be stretched equally and not only straight but also moved in every direction to ease its removal, as is done with a tooth during extraction.
Et oportet in eo quod est inter illud, ut mollificetur extensio.	 And it should be so that what is between them softens the extension.
Quod si retineatur ex eo pars, tunc oportet ut inungat Obstetrix quosdam digitos cum oleo, et intromittat eos ex parte, ut reuoluat cum eis quod retinetur.	 If a part is retained from it, then the midwife should anoint some fingers with oil and insert them into that part to rotate and remove what is retained.
Si ergo egreditur pars foetus, tunc permutentur uncini ad locum alium qui sit altior: fac hoc donec egrediatur foetus totus.	 If a part of the fetus comes out, then move the hooks to another place that is higher; do this until the entire fetus comes out.
Si ergo egreditur manus ante alia, et non est possibile reducere eam, propter coartationem eius: tunc oportet, ut inuoluatur super eam pannus.	 If a hand comes out before the others and it is not possible to return it because of its swelling; then a cloth should be wrapped around it.
Deinde extrahe eam donec quando egreditur tota, incide eam aut in iunctura plantae, aut in cubito: et ita oportet ut facias in manu altera, et in duobus pedibus.	 Then pull it out until the entire hand comes out; cut it either at the joint of the foot or at the elbow; and thus you should do for the other hand and both feet.
Si autem caput foetus est magnum, aut accidit ei coartatio in exitu, aut est in capite eius aqua aggregata: tunc oportet ut intromittat inter digitos Spatumile spinosum, et findat cum eo caput, et extrahat aquam: aut disrumpat ipsum cum instrumento quod nominatur Almisdac: cuius forma uenit cum formis reliquorum instrumentorum in capitulo quod est post hoc.	 If however the fetus' head is large or becomes swollen at birth, or if there is water gathered on its head; then a thorny spatula should be inserted between the fingers and used to pierce the head and remove the water; or it should be ruptured with an instrument called Almisdac. The shape of which will come with the shapes of the other instruments in the following chapter.
Similiter faciat si foetus est magni capitis natura, tunc oportet ut seces algengematu: aut extrahas ipsum cum misdach, sicut diximus.	 Similarly, if the fetus is by nature of large head, then one should cut with a trepan and extract it with the instrument called misdach, as we have said.
Deinde attrahas ossa cum forcipibus.	 Then draw out the bones with forceps.
Quod si egrediatur caput, et coartetur apud furculam: tunc findatur, donec effundatur humiditas quae est in pectore.	 If the head comes out and becomes swollen at the collarbone; then pierce it until the fluid from the chest is released.
Si autem non complicatur, neque obedit ad exitum: tunc incide caput frustatim, secundum quod possibile est tibi.	 But if it does not become complicated nor submit to birth; then cut the head piece by piece as is possible for you.
Quod si inferius uentris est apostematum, aut est in eo hydropisis: tunc oportet ut perfores ipsum, donec currat humiditas ex eo.	 If the swelling is in the lower abdomen and it is accompanied by dropsy, you should pierce it until the moisture runs out.
Si uero foetus est super pedes suos, tunc attractio eius est facilis, et directio eius ad os matricis est leuis.	 If however the fetus is on its feet, then its delivery is easy and its direction toward the mouth of the womb is gentle.
Si autem coartatur apud uentrem, aut pectus: tunc oportet ut extrahas ipsum cum panno quem inuoluisti super manum tuam: et findat uentrem, aut pectus, donec currat quod est in eis.	 But if it is constricted in the abdomen or chest, then you should extract it with a cloth wrapped around your hand and open the abdomen or chest until what is inside flows out.
Si autem auferuntur reliqua membra, et redit caput: tunc intromittat Obstetrix manum sinistram.	 But if the other limbs have been delivered and only the head remains, then the midwife should insert her left hand.
Si ergo os matricis est apertum, tunc intromittat manum in profundum matricis, et quaerat cum ea caput, et attrahat ipsum cum digitis usque ad os matricis: deinde intromittat in eo uncinum unum, aut uncinos duos, et attrahat ipsum cum eo.	 Therefore, if the mouth of the womb is open, let her insert her hand deep into the womb and search for the head with it, and draw it to the mouth of the womb with her fingers; then let her insert into it one hook or two hooks, and draw it out with them.
Quod si os matricis coartatur, propter apostema calidum quod accidit ei: tunc non oportet ut laboretur super ipsum, imo oportet tunc administrare effusionem rerum humidarum, pinguium: et administra emplastra: et sedeat in aquis quae mollificant et humectant.	 But if the mouth of the womb is constricted because of a hot swelling that has befallen her, then it is not fitting to labor over it; rather, it is fitting at that time to apply emollients and fatty substances, and administer poultices, and sit in waters that soften and moisten.
Quod si foetus est super latus suum, tunc possibile est ut aequetur: tunc administretur quod diximus in foetu uiuo.	 But if the fetus is on its side, it may turn; then let what we said be administered for a living fetus be given.
Quod si non est possibile illud, tunc incidatur frustatim, et extrahatur.	 If that is not possible, then cut it piece by piece and extract it.
Et oportet ut non dimittas aliquid ex secundina intus omnino.	 And you must not leave anything of the afterbirth inside at all.
Cum ergo compleueris operationem tuam, tunc administra quod diximus in apostematibus calidis quae accidunt in matricibus.	 Therefore, when you have completed your work, then administer what we said for hot swellings that occur in the womb.
Quod si accidat fluxus sanguinis, tunc descendat in aquis stipticis, et administra reliquam curationem.	 But if there is a flow of blood, then let her sit in styptic waters and administer the rest of the treatment.
Et ego quidem iam uidi mulierem, in cuius uentre mortuus erat foetus: deinde impregnata est super ipsum uice alia, postea mortuus est foetus alius etiam.	 And indeed I have seen a woman whose womb contained a dead fetus; then she became pregnant with another, and afterward that fetus also died.
Accidit ergo ei post tempus longum apostema in umbilico suo, et inflatum est, donec apertum est: et coepit emittere pus.	 And so after a long time an abscess occurred on her navel, and it swelled until it burst; and she began to discharge pus.
Vocatus sum ergo ad curationem eius, et medicatus sum ei tempore longo: et non consolidatum est uulnus.	 Therefore I was called for her treatment, and I treated her for a long time; yet the wound did not heal.
Posui ergo super ipsum ex quibusdam emplastris fortis attractionis: et exiuit ex loco os.	 And so I placed on it certain strong drawing plasters; and a mouth came out of that place.
Deinde praeterierunt ei dies aliquot, et exiuit os aliud.	 Then after several days another mouth emerged from there.
Miratus sum ergo inde, cum in uentre non sit os.	 Therefore I was amazed by this, since there is no mouth in the womb.
Cogitaui ergo, quia erant ex ossibus foetus mortui.	 And so I thought that they were from the bones of the dead fetus.  \\
Inquisiui ergo uulnus, et extraxi ossa multa, muliere existente in melioribus dispositionibus suis: et iam uixit taliter tempore longo, et mittit ex loco pus parum.	 And so I examined the wound and extracted many bones while the woman was in good health; and now she has lived in this way for a long time, and she emits little pus from that place.
Et ego non firmaui hic hoc extraneum, nisi quoniam in eo est scientia, et adiutorium ad illud, quod administrat medicus artifex cum manu ex curatione.	 And I would not have noted this strange occurrence here unless there is knowledge and help in it for what a skilled doctor does with his hand in treatment.
¶ De formis Instrumentorum necessariorum in extractione foetus.	 ¶ On the Forms of Necessary Instruments for Fetal Extraction.
Caput LXXVII.	 Chapter LXXVII.
Hic inferius est forma Strictorii, quo aequantur libri, cui aequaliter sunt duae uertigines in duabus extremitatibus duorum lignorum.	 Here is the form of the instrument called the stricture, which is used to equalize the lips; it has two rollers equally placed at the ends of two wooden pieces.
Verumtamen haec Vertigo oportet ut sit subtilior strictorio: et ut fiat, aut ex ebano, aut ex ligno bussi.	 However, this roller must be finer than the stricture; and it is made either from ebony or boxwood.  />   \\
Et sit latitudo omnis ligni quasi duo digiti: et margo cuiusque amborum est quasi digitus unus, et longitudo cuiusque eorum est palmus et medietas: et in medio duorum lignorum sunt duo additamenta ex genere eiusdem ligni, quae iam firmata sunt in utrisque, quorum longitudo est medietas palmi et plus parum: et latitudo utriusque est quasi duo digiti, aut plus parum.	 And let the width of each piece of wood be about two fingers; and the edge of each is about one finger, and the length of each is a palm and a half; and in the middle of the two pieces of wood there are two attachments made from the same type of wood, which have already been firmly attached to both, whose length is more than a half-palm; and the width of each is about two fingers, or slightly more.
Et ista duo additamenta intromittuntur in os matricis, ut aperiatur cum eis quando tu reuoluis duas Vertigines.	 And these two instruments are inserted into the womb's mouth so that it may be opened when you turn two loops.
Forma Vertiginis qua aperitur matrix.	 The shape of the loop by which the womb is opened.
Forma alia ad simile illius, subtilior, et leuior.	 Another form similar to that one, but finer and lighter.
Fiat ex ligno ebani, aut bussi, secundum similitudinem forcipum.	 It is made of ebony or boxwood, according to the shape of forceps.
Verumtamen in extremitate eius sint duo additamenta, sicut uides hic supra: et longitudo omnis additamenti ex eis est quasi palmus: et latitudo utriusque est, duo digiti.	 However, at its end there should be two instruments, as you see here above: and the length of each instrument is like a palm: and the width of each is two fingers.
Cum ergo uis aperire matricem cum eo, tunc fac sedere mulierem super lectum, pendentibus pedibus eius, aperto quod est inter crura eius.	 Therefore, when you wish to open the womb with it, make the woman sit on a bed with her feet hanging down and her legs spread apart.
Deinde intromitte ista duo additamenta coniuncta in matricem: et tu es tenens extremitatem instrumenti inferius inter coxas eius.	 Then insert these two connected instruments into the womb, and you are holding the end of the instrument between her thighs.
Deinde aperi manum tuam cum instrumento, sicut facis cum forficibus, aequaliter secundum quantitatem quam uis ex apertione oris matricis, donec faciat Obstetrix quod uult.	 Then open your hand with the instrument as you do with forceps, equally according to the amount that you wish for the opening of the womb's mouth until it does what the midwife wants.
Forma Vertiginis alterius quam dixerunt antiqui Forma Impellentis quo impellitur foetus.	 The shape of another loop, which the ancients called the shape of the pusher, by which the fetus is pushed out.
Forma Almisdac, qua conteritur caput magnum: et assimilatur forcipi, cui sunt dentes in extremitate, sicut uides.	 The shape of Almisdagh, by which a large head is crushed, and it resembles forceps with teeth at the end, as you see. xspace
Et quandoque fit oblungum, sicut forcipes secundum hanc formam, sicut uides, cui sunt dentes sicut dentes serrae, quo inciditur et conteritur.	 And sometimes it is made elongated, like forceps according to this shape, as you see, with teeth like a saw, by which it cuts and crushes.
Forma Almisdac quo conteritur caput paruum.	 The shape of Almisdagh, by which a small head is crushed.
Forma Vncini habentis spinam unam.	 The shape of the one-spined hook. xspace xspace
Forma Vncini habentis spinas duas.	 The shape of the two-spined hook.
Forma forcipis cui sunt dentes serrae, cum quo conteritur caput foetus.	 The shape of forceps with saw teeth, by which the fetal head is crushed. SPACE  SPACE
Forma Spatumilis habentis duas extremitates ad abscindendum caput.	 Form with two ends for cutting off the head.
Forma duorum Spatumilium etiam latorum.	 Form of two broad spatulas.
Ista instrumenta omnia exercentur, et quanto plus multiplicantur species eorum, et praeparata sunt apud artificem, est uelocior ad operationem suam, et altior apud homines, propter quantitatem suam.	 All these instruments are used, and the more their kinds are multiplied and prepared by the craftsman, the swifter he is at his task, and the greater he stands among men because of his skill.
Non ergo despicies ex eis instrumentum, quin sit apud te praeparatum.	 Therefore, do not disdain any of these instruments so that it may be prepared by you.
Inexcusabilis est enim necessitas eorum.	 Their necessity is inexcusable.
¶ De extractione Secundinae.	 ¶ On the Extraction of Secundina.
Caput LXXVIII.	 Chapter LXXVIII.
Quando retinetur Secundina apud partum, tunc oportet ut praecipias infirmae, ut retineat anhelitum suum.	 When the Secundina is retained during childbirth, then it is necessary that you instruct the patient to hold her breath.
Deinde fac eam sternutare cum condisi: et stringe manum tuam super os eius, et nares ipsius.	 Then make her sneeze with you: and press your hand on her mouth and nose.
Si ergo egreditur per hoc, bonum est.	 If it therefore comes out through this [method], that is good.
Si non: tunc accipe ollam, et perfora in coopertorio foramen: et pone in ea herbas aperientes os matricis, sicut calamentum, rutam, et anetum, et camomillam, et sseham, et cassiam ligneam, et centauream: accipe omnes istas herbas, aut quasdam earum, et submerge eas cum aqua, et pone eas super ignem.	 If not: then take a pot and pierce a hole in the lid; and put in it opening herbs of the womb, such as calamentum, rue, dill, chamomile, saffron, cassia wood, and centaury; take all these herbs or some of them, and steep them with water and place [them] on the fire.
Deinde pone embulam arundinis super foramen coopertorii ollae, et extremitatem aliam in os matricis: et teneat eam donec perueniat uapor ad concauitatem matricis.	 Then place a reed funnel on the hole of the pot lid, and its other end in the womb; and let her hold it until the vapor reaches the cavity of the womb.
Deinde fac eam sternutare, sicut diximus.	 Then make her sneeze, as we said. 
Secundina enim egredietur cum facilitate.	 For indeed the Secundina will come out easily.
Si autem remaneat post hanc curationem, et non egrediatur: tunc praecipe Obstetrici, ut submergat manum suam in oleo sisamino, aut mucillagine alteae.	 But if it remains after this treatment and does not come out, then instruct the midwife to submerge her hand in sesame oil or in thickened althea [mallow].
Deinde intromittat in uuluam, et quaerat cum ea Secundinam.	 Then let her insert [her hand] into the vulva and seek with it the Secundina.
Cum ergo inuenerit eam, tunc accipiat eam, et extendat ipsam paulatim.	 "When he finds it, then let him take it and slowly extend it.
Si autem fuerit annexa in profundo matricis, tunc intromittat manum, secundum quod narrauimus, donec quando inuenerit Secundinam, et extrahat eam paulatim secundum rectitudinem, ut non cadat matrix apud attractionem uehementem: imo oportet, ut permutetur cum facilitate ad latera dextra et sinistra: deinde addatur in quantitatem attractionis.	 "If however it is attached deep within the womb, then he should insert his hand as we have described until he finds the placenta and gradually extracts it straight away so that the womb does not collapse due to excessive force. Rather, it should be turned gently to the right and left, and then pulled according to the amount of traction needed.
Ipsa enim obedit tunc, et seruatur, et euadit ab adhaerentia.	 "For at that point, she will comply, be saved, and escape from the obstruction.
Quod si os matricis est coartatum, sicut nos iam narrauimus: cura eam cum sternutatione, et ex medicatione ollae cum herbis.	 "But if the mouth of the womb is constricted, as we have already described, care for her with sneezing and with a decoction made from herbs.
Si autem non egreditur cum omnibus quae narrauimus, tunc caue ne fatigeris super eam in iteratione extractionis.	 "But if it does not come out with all that we have described, then be careful not to tire yourself too much during the process of extraction.
Verum oportet, ut quod egreditur ad os matricis ex ea, liges ad coxam mulieris.	 "Truly, whatever comes out at the mouth of the womb from her, you should tie to the woman's thigh.
Deinde clisteriza eam cum unguento tetrapharmacon.	 "Then enema her with the four-ingredient ointment.
Ipsum enim putrefaciet eam post dies, et dissoluetur, et egredietur.	 "For that will cause it to putrefy after a few days and it will dissolve and come out.
Verumtamen quando putrefit, eleuatur ex ea odor malus ad stomachum et caput, et laedit illud infirmam.	 "However, when it putrefies, an evil smell rises to the stomach and head, harming the sick person.
Oportet ergo ut administrentur suffumigationes conuenientes ad illud.	 "Therefore, it is necessary that suitable fumigations be administered for that.
Quidam autem antiquorum iam experti sunt suffumigationem nasturtii, et ficuum siccarum.	 "Some of the ancients have already experienced the usefulness of fumigation with cress and dried figs." 
Forma instrumenti quo suffumigatur mulier apud retentionem Secundinae et menstruorum.	 "Description of the instrument used to fumigate a woman during retained placenta or menses.
Fiat ex uitro simile alcama, aut ex zere: et ponatur extremitas ampla super ignem: et suffumigatio sit posita super prunas: teneat eam, donec consumatur illa suffumigatio: et itera aliam.	 "Let it be made from a glass similar to an alcama, or from wax. The wide end should be placed over the fire, and the fumigation should be placed on coals. Let her hold it until that fumigation is consumed, and then repeat with another.
¶ De curatione Ani non perforati.	 On the treatment of an unperforated anus.
Caput LXXIX.	 Chapter 79.
Nascuntur multi puerorum, et Ani eorum sunt non perforati, quos iam opilauit sifac subtile.	 Many boys are born with unperforated anuses, which have already been blocked by a thin film.
Oportet ergo, ut obstetrix perforet illud sifac digito suo: et si non, perforet ipsum cum Spatumili acuto: et caueat lacertum, ne tangat eum.	 Therefore, the midwife should pierce that thin film with her finger; and if she cannot, she should pierce it with a sharp spatula, taking care not to touch the scrotum.
Deinde pone super ipsum lanam infusam in uino et oleo.	 Then place wool soaked in wine and oil on top of it.
Deinde cura ipsum cum ungentis, donec sanetur.	 Then care for him with ointments until he is healed.
Si autem times quod opiletur, tunc pone in foramine cannulam de plumbo diebus multis, et auferatur quando puer uult egerere.	 But if you fear that it will become blocked again, then place a lead tube in the opening for many days, and remove it when the boy wants to defecate.
Et iam accidit opilatio Ani etiam ex consolidatione uulneris, aut apostematis.	 And now an obstruction of the anus can also occur due to the healing of a wound or an abscess. 》
Oportet ergo ut secetur illa consolidatio, deinde curetur cum eo quod diximus ex curatione et plumbo.	 Therefore, that healing should be cut away, and then it should be treated with what we have said about treatment and lead.
¶ De curatione Fistularum quae accidunt in inferiori parte.	 ¶ On the treatment of fistulas that occur in the lower part.
Caput LXXX.	 Chapter 80.
Fistulae quae accidunt in inferiori, sunt Nodatio, et Grossitudo quae accidunt prope anum deforis: aut in spacio unius partium: et est Fistula una, aut plures.	 Fistulas that occur in the lower part are knots and swellings that happen near the anus outside or in the space of one fingerbreadth; and there is one fistula or more.
Cum ergo antiquatur illa Nodatio, aperitur, et currit ex ea humiditas aquosa alba, aut pus subtile.	 Therefore, when that knot is cut open, it opens and from it flows a watery white fluid or thin pus.
Et quandoque sunt ex istis Fistulis penetrantes.	 And sometimes there are fistulas that penetrate from these.
Ergo penetrantes cognoscuntur per illud quod egreditur ex egestione, et uentositate, quando utitur infirmus egestione: et fortasse egreditur ex eis uermis.	 Therefore, the penetrating ones are recognized by what comes out during defecation and flatulence when the sick person uses defecation; and perhaps a worm comes out of them. 》 》 》
Et sunt ex eis Fistulae quando sunt in spacio penetrantes usque ad uesicam, et usque ad meatum uirgae.	 And there are fistulas among these when they penetrate in the space as far as the bladder and as far as the opening of the penis. 》 》 》 》 》 》
Et sunt ex eis penetrantes usque ad iuncturam coxae, et usque ad nodum caudae.	 And there are some that penetrate as far as the hip joint and as far as the tailbone. 》 》 》 》 》 》 》 》 》
Ex eo autem quo cognoscitur Fistula penetrans usque ad anum, etiam a non penetrante, est, ut intromittas digitum tuum indicem in anum: et intromittas tentam subtilem in Fistulam ex aere, aut ferro: quando non est tortuositas.	 When it is recognized that the fistula reaches to the anus, whether penetrating or not, do this: insert your index finger into the anus and insert a thin probe of iron or steel into the fistula if there is no twisting.
Quod si in ea est tortuositas, tunc intromitte in eam tentam ex plumbo subtilem, aut pilum ex pilis equarum, donec sentias tentam, aut pilum in digito tuo.	 If there is a twisting, then insert into it a thin probe of lead or a horsehair until you feel the probe or hair with your finger.
Quod si non sentis ipsam penitus, neque procedit ex foramine aliquid ex egestione, neque uentositas, neque uermis sicut dixi: tunc scias, quia est non penetrans: propera ergo ad curationem.	 If you do not feel it completely and nothing comes out of the opening, neither wind nor worm as I said, then know that it is not penetrating; hasten to treatment.
Et quando Fistula est penetrans usque ad uesicam, aut ad meatum urinae: tunc significatio eius est exitus urinae ex ea, et prohibitio eius ab hoc ut consolidetur locus cum medicinis.	 And when the fistula is penetrating to the bladder or the opening of the urine, then its sign is the issuing of urine from it and its prevention so that the place may be consolidated with medicines.
Si uero est penetrans usque ad iuncturam coxae, aut ad os coxae: tunc signum eius est, quod perueniat tenta usque illuc, si non est in ea tortuositas usque ad os: et inuentio doloris in circumitu partis, et quod egreditur pus ex ea semper: et quod non ualeat in ea medicatio, neque consolidatur cum unguento.	 However, if it is penetrating to the joint of the thigh or the hip socket, then its sign is that a probe reaches there if there is no twisting up to the opening; and the discovery of pain around the part, and that pus always comes out of it; and that treatment in it does not avail nor does it consolidate with ointment.
Et in istis Fistulis omnibus penetrantibus non est curatio omnino: et curatio earum est labor et uanitas ei, ex stultis medicis, super quem formatur.	 And in all these penetrating fistulas there is no cure at all; and their treatment is labor and vanity for him who wastes his time on them.
In illa autem quae non est penetrans, et non antiqua, speratur sanatio cum serro: secundum quod ego narro tibi, et ego iam probaui: et est, ut iaceat infirmus inter manus tuas super dorsum suum: et eleua crura eius usque supra coxas ipsius, et coxae eius sint inclinatae ad uentrem ipsius.	 But in that which is not penetrating and not old, a cure is hoped for with a saw as I narrate to you and have already proved: and it is that the patient lies between your hands on his back; and raise his legs above his hips and his hips be bent toward his belly.
Deinde intromittetentam plumbi, aut aeris, si est in Fistula tortuositas, donec scias ubi peruenit tenta.	 Then insert a probe of lead or iron if there is twisting in the fistula until you know where the probe has reached.
Si autem sentit eam infirmus circa anum, tunc oportet ut intromittas digitum tuum indicem in anum.	 If however the patient feels it around the anus, then you should insert your index finger into the anus.
Si ergo sentis in digito tuo tentam iam penetrasse per seipsam detectam, praeter quod sentias inter digitum tuum, et inter ipsum sifac, aut carnem: tunc ergo scias certe, quia est penetrans: non ergo labores in ea, quoniam non est eius sanatio, sicut diximus.	 Therefore, if you feel on your finger the probe has passed through itself, apart from what you feel between your finger and the probe or flesh: then you should certainly know that it is penetrating. So do not struggle with it, for there is no cure for it, as we have said.
Dixerunt tamen, quia sanatur in quibusdam hominibus caro, et ex medicatione qua ei speratur iuuamentum, est, ut ignias cauterium subtile secundum amplitudinem Fistulae, sicut praecessit, et intromittas ipsum ignitum in Fistulam, donec perueniat circa anum.	 They have said, however, that some people are cured when the flesh is cauterized and the medication by which they hope for improvement is to ignite a fine cautery according to the width of the fistula, as was previously described, and insert it burning into the fistula until it reaches the anus.
Deinde itera illud bis, aut ter, donec scias, quia iam adustae sunt omnes illae carnes additae filtratae, quae sunt similes cannulae pennae auis.	 Then repeat this two or three times until you know that all those added fleshy bits have been burned away, similar to a bird's feather quill.
Deinde cura illud cum liciniis inuolutis in butyro, donec egrediantur illae carnes, quae adustae sunt: deinde cura illud cum unguentis generantibus carnem et consolidantibus.	 Then treat it with lint wrapped in butter until the burned flesh comes out; then treat it with ointments that promote flesh growth and consolidation.
Si ergo sanatur, bonum est.	 If it is healed, good.
Et si non, tunc non sanatur cum alia curatione unquam.	 And if not, then it will never be cured by any other treatment.
Et si egreditur tenta, et non peruenerit usque ad digitum tuum, qui est in ano, et est inter ipsum et tentam uelamen spissum ex carne, aut sifac: et uides Fistulam in eo quod sequitur superficiem cutis, tunc seca cutem ab initio Fistulae, et tu uadis secando cum tenta quod est in fistula, donec perueniat secatio ubi peruenit tentae extremitas, et liberatur tenta et cadit.	 And if the probe comes out and does not reach your finger which is in the anus, and there is a thick layer of flesh or probe between them, and you see that the fistula follows the surface of the skin: then cut the skin from the beginning of the fistula, and go cutting with the probe that is in the fistula until the cutting reaches where the end of the probe is, and the probe is freed and falls out.
Deinde mundifica illas carnes filtratas, quae assimilantur cannulae pennae auis, ut non remaneat ex eis aliquid.	 Then clean away those fleshy bits that are similar to a bird's feather quill, so that nothing of them remains.
Si autem uincit te sanguis, et soluit inter te et inter operationem tuam ut seces illas carnes: tunc melius quod fit, et uelocioris iuuamenti, cauterizare eam cum igne, aut cum medicina acuta.	 But if the bleeding overcomes you and loosens between you and your work so that you can cut those fleshy bits: then it is better what happens, and more rapid healing, to cauterize with fire or sharp medication.
Quoniam cauterium cum igne aggregat habitudines bonas, adustionem illarum carnium additarum, et abscisionem sanguinis, et exiccationem humiditatum.	 Because the cautery, combined with fire, possesses beneficial properties, it adds to the burning of those tissues and the cutting off of blood, as well as the drying out of moisture.
Deinde cura illud cum liciniis inuolutis in butyro, aut caulibus tritis, donec locus emittat pus, et egrediantur illae carnes adustae in pus.	 Then treat it with linen cloths wrapped in butter or pounded cabbage leaves until the place discharges pus and the burned flesh comes out with the pus.
Deinde cura tunc uulnus cum unguentis consolidatiuis, generantibus carnem duram: et sunt medicinae in quibus sunt stipticitas et exiccatio.	 Then treat the wound with healing ointments that produce hard flesh; and these are medications that contain astringents and drying agents.
Nam quando restaurantur, tunc iam sanatur: et non times iterationem.	 For when they are restored, then it is healed; and do not fear recurrence.
Si autem Fistula iam peruenit usque ad profundum ani, et elongatur a superfluitate corporis: tunc intromitte digitum tuum in anum, et inquire cum eo.	 But if the fistula has already reached the depth of the rectum and extends from an excess of bodily fluid, then insert your finger into the rectum and examine with it.
Si ergo sentis tentam, et inter te, et inter eam est uelamen ex sifac, aut carne, et est propinqua penetrationi: tunc non est operatio in illo, nisi secundum uiam fiduciae et spei.	 Therefore, if you feel a band or membrane of silk or flesh between yourself and it, and it is close to perforation, then there is no operation on it except by the way of trust and hope.
Quod est, quia administratur in eo unus trium modorum: aut ut cauterizes ipsam, sicut diximus: aut seces eam, donec consequaris concauitatem eius, ut sit possibile tibi intromittere licinia, et curationem ex proximo.	 This is because one of three methods is applied to it: either you cauterize it as we said, or you cut it out until you reach its cavity so that it is possible for you to insert linen cloths and nearby treatment.
Et non procedas multum cum sectione, ut non incidas lacertum continentem anum, et accidat super infirmum exitus egestionis absque uoluntate.	 And do not proceed too much with the cutting so that you do not cut the ligament that holds the rectum and cause the unfortunate outcome of incontinence without intention. 
Deinde cura illud cum eo quod diximus.	 Then treat it as we have said.
Fortasse enim sanabitur: aut elonges ipsum uelamen, et mundes ipsum postquam secas ipsum usque prope anum, sicut diximus, aut cum tenta, aut cum instrumento alio acutae extremitatis.	 For perhaps it will heal; or you may lengthen the membrane itself and cleanse it after cutting it nearly to the rectum as we said, either with a probe or with another sharp-pointed instrument.
Deinde mundifica illas carnes filtratas quae sunt in sectione, usque ubi potes cum perscrutatione.	 Then cleanse those pieces of flesh that are in the incision as far as you can with probing.
Deinde conare restaurationem uulneris totius cum sectione, et orificio superiore ubi consolidatur: et remanet Fistula aperta in interiore parte anus, et erit leuius super infirmum.	 Then strive to restore the entire wound with the incision and the upper orifice where it is healed; and let the fistula remain open in the interior part of the rectum, and it will be less harmful to the patient.
Et quandoque suitur Fistula secundum hunc modum: et est, quando intromittis tentam in Fistulam: et est in latere ani circa superficiem corporis cum cute et margine ani: tunc accipe tentam perforatae extremitatis, quae est sicut acus aleskef, id est, praeparantium coria, secundum hanc formam.	 And sometimes the fistula is treated in this manner: and it is when you insert a probe into the fistula, and it is on the side of the anus around the surface of the body with skin and edge of the anus; then take a probe with a perforated tip, which is like a needle for embroidering, that is, preparing hides, in this manner.
Et intromitte in eam filum inuolutum ex quinque filis, et circiter ea.	 And insert into it a thread wound from five threads, and about that length.
Deinde intromitte tentam cum filo in Fistulam, donec consequatur concauitatem eius.	 Then insert the probe with the thread into the fistula until it reaches its depth.
Si ergo est penetrans in margine ani interius prope, tunc extrahe filum ex illo foramine: ita ut intromittas digitum tuum in anum, et extrahas extremitatem fili, et aggreges duas extremitates simul: et stringe utramque, et dimitte illud die uno, aut duobus diebus: et quanto plus incidit filum in carne, stringe ipsum bene, donec incidantur illae carnes quae sunt inter duas extremitates fili, et cadant: deinde cura uulnus, donec consolidetur, et sanetur.	 But if it is penetrating the edge of the anus from within near to it, then withdraw the thread from that opening; in such a way that you insert your finger into the anus and draw out the end of the thread, and bring together both ends at once; and tie each one, and leave it for one day or two days. And however much the thread cuts into the flesh, tie it well, until the flesh between the two ends of the thread is cut and falls away; then treat the wound until it heals and cures.
Si autem orificium Fistulae non est penetrans: tunc fac ipsum penetrare quocunque modo praeparatur tibi, nisi sit in profundo multum.	 But if the opening of the fistula is not penetrating, then make it penetrate by whatever means you prepare for yourself, unless it is very deep.
Non enim inest tibi, ut facias illud propter lacertum, ut non incidas ipsum.	 For you do not have the ability to do this for the sake of the fleshy part, so that you do not cut into it.
Deinde fac cum ea sicut diximus, donec sanetur.	 Then treat it as we have said until it heals.
Forma Spatumilis spinosi quo finditur Fistula, cuius curuitas est acuta ualde, et pars altera est non acuta, ut non incidat illud quod non est necesse, sicut uides.	 The form of a spiky spatula by which the fistula is probed, whose curvature is very sharp, and the other part is not sharp, so that it does not cut what is not necessary, as you see.
¶ De sutura Hemorroidarum, ex quibus currit sanguis ex incisione earum: et cura fissurarum.	 ¶ On the suture of hemorrhoids from which blood flows after their incision, and on the treatment of fissures.
Caput LXXXI.	 Chapter 81
Sunt Hemorroides secundum duos modos.	 There are two types of hemorrhoids.
Aut enim sunt intra anum, similes uesicis carbonum, uel prunarum: aut quasi ipsae sint grana uuae.	 Or indeed, they are within the anus, similar to bladders of coal or plums; or as if they were themselves the seeds of grapes.
Et ex eis sunt paruae, et magnae: et sanguis currit ex eis semper, et est una, et sunt multae.	 And from them are small ones and large ones, and blood always flows from them, and it is one, and they are many.
Et sunt extra anum, et in extremitatibus eius.	 And they are outside the anus and at its ends.
Verumtamen istae quae sunt extra anum, sunt secundum plurimum paucae humiditatis, ex quibus currit aqua citrina, aut parum sanguinis cursu assiduo: et sunt secundum colorem corporis.	 Nevertheless, those which are outside the anus are for the most part of little moisture, from which runs yellow water or a small amount of blood with persistent flow, and they correspond in color to the body.
Et curatio eius quae est intra anum, est, ut praecipias infirmo ut assellet: et exprimatur, donec egrediatur anus, et appareant athelil tibi.	 And its treatment which is within the anus is to advise the sick person to take a seat and to squeeze until the anus comes out and reveals the hemorrhoids to you.
Propterea ergo et suspende cum uncinis: aut tene eos cum ungue tuo.	 Therefore, hang them with hooks or hold them with your fingernail.
Deinde incide eos apud radices suas.	 Then cut them at their roots.
Si autem non retinentur in eis uncini, propter humiditatem eorum et ipsorum mollificationem: tunc cape eos cum panno aspero, aut cum coto ex diploide lanea, et extrahe eos cum digitis tuis.	 But if hooks do not hold them due to their moisture and softness, then take them with a rough cloth or a piece of coarse woolen cloth and draw them out with your fingers.
Deinde incide eos, et pulueriza super eos post incisionem quosdam pulueres calidos, ut stent eis loco cauterii.	 Then cut them, and after the incision sprinkle on them some warm powders so that they serve as a caustic.
Aut cauteriza eos secundum quod praecessit in capitulo cauterizandi.	 Or cauterize them according to what preceded in the chapter on cauterization.
Deinde cura eos cum reliqua curatione, donec sanentur.	 Then treat them with the rest of the treatment until they heal.
Quod si non obedit anus egressioni, tunc clisteriza infirmum clisteri in quo sit mordicatio parua, ut lauetur cum eo quod est in ano, et obediat egressioni uelociter, quando exprimit se infirmus.	 But if the anus does not comply with coming out, then give the sick person a clyster in which there is a small amount of biting (irritant), so that it washes away what is in the anus and quickly complies with coming out when the patient squeezes.
Si autem athelil sunt extrinseci ab ano, tunc res eorum est leuis, facilis: et est ut capias eos cum ungue tuo, aut capias eos cum uncino, et incidas eos.	 But if the hemorrhoids are outside the anus, then their treatment is light and easy; and it is as if you take them with your fingernail or take them with a hook and cut them.
Deinde cura eos cum eo quod diximus, donec sanentur.	 Then care for them with what we have said until they heal.
Et qui abhorret incisionem cum ferro, tunc oportet ut administres suturam eorum secundum hunc modum.	 And he who abhors the cutting with iron, then it is necessary for you to apply their stitches in this manner.
Accipe filum inuolutum, et intromitte ipsum in acum.	 Take thread wound around and push it through a needle.
Deinde extrahe athelil ad superiora, et fac ipsum penetrare cum acu in radice eius ex parte altera: et inuolue duas extremitates fili, in inferiori parte acus, et sint latitudinaliter: et stringe athelil strictura forti.	 Then draw out the thread to the top and make it penetrate with the needle into its base from the other side; and wind the two ends of the thread beneath the point of the needle, so that they are lateral; and tighten the thread tightly.
Deinde noda filum, et extrahe acum.	 Then tie off the thread and withdraw the needle.
Fac illud cum omnibus athelil, et dimitte ex eis unum: nec suas ipsum, ut currat ex eo superfluitas sanguinis.	 Do this with all the threads, but leave one out; nor draw it tight, so that excess blood may run from it.
Deinde pone super anum pannum infusum in oleo rosato, aut caeroto, et pone ipsum super anum: et praecipe infirmo, ut quiescat.	 Then place over the anus a cloth soaked in rose oil or cedar oil, and place it over the anus; and instruct the patient to rest.
Deinde dimitte ipsum, donec cadat.	 Then leave him until he passes it.
Cum ergo cadunt athelil, cura eos cum unguentis, et reliqua curatione, donec sanentur.	 When the threads fall out, care for them with ointments and other treatment until they heal.
¶ De cura Fissurarum.	 ¶ On the Treatment of Fissures.
Multotiens enim accidunt ex exiccatione stercoris, et constrictione naturae.	 For often they happen from the drying out of feces and constriction of nature. ›
Cum ergo antiquantur, et non ualet in eis medicina: tunc oportet ut radas cum puncta Spatumilis, aut cum ungue tuo, donec fiant humidae, et auferatur ab eis cortex superior qui prohibet eas a consolidatione.	 When they become chronic and the medicine is ineffective, then it is necessary for you to scrape them with the point of a spatula or with your nail until they are moistened and the top layer which prevents them from healing is removed.
Deinde cura eas, donec consolidentur secundum quod oportet.	 Then care for them until they heal as is necessary.
Si autem non consolidantur: tunc itera eas cum rasione uehementiori quam prima, donec sanguinentur multum, et excorientur deinde cura eas, donec sanentur.	 But if they do not heal, then repeat the scraping with greater force than before until they bleed much; then care for them until they heal. › ‹
¶ De curatione Almirmar inuersorum, et non inuersorum: et Athelil siccorum, et Formicae.	 ¶ On the Treatment of Inverted and Uninverted Hemorrhoids; Dry Threads and Carbuncles.
Caput LXXXII.	 Chapter 82
Scias quod Almirmar non est nisi nodus rotundus secundum colorem corporis, similis capiti claui: et fit in toto corpore, praecipue in inferioribus partibus pedum, et digitis: et accidit ex eis dolor apud ambulationem.	 You should know that Almirmar is nothing but a round knot according to the color of the body, similar to the head of a nail: and it occurs throughout the body, especially in the lower parts of the feet and toes; and from this comes pain during walking.
Oportet ergo ut secetur quod est in circumitu claui, et teneatur cum forficibus, aut cum uncino, et eradicetur ex radice sua.	 Therefore, it must be cut around the head of the nail and held with forceps or a hook, and it should be pulled out from its root.
Deinde cura illud: et si uis cauteriza illud secundum quod praecessit in capitulo suo.	 Then care for it: and if you wish, cauterize it according to what has been said previously in its chapter.
Ex athelil autem siccis unus est eminentia parua, aspera, filtrata, rotunda supra superficiem corporis.	 From athalil, however, there is one small rough, crusty, round lump above the surface of the body.
Et multotiens accidunt in manibus puerorum.	 And they often occur in children's hands.
Et curatio eius est, ut extendas athelil, et incidas ipsum: aut stringas ipsum cum filo de serico: aut cum pilo, donec cadat.	 And its treatment is that you stretch the athalil and cut it off: or tie it with a silk thread: or with hair, until it falls off.
Et si uis, cauteriza ipsum secundum quod praemissum est cum igne, aut cum medicina acuta: et iam eradicantur athelil inuersi, et non inuersi cum instrumento quod ego dicam.	 And if you wish, cauterize it with fire or sharp medicine as previously mentioned: and thus the inverted athalils, and not the uninverted ones, are removed with an instrument that I will mention.
Formica autem est etiam eminentia parua filtrata, grossa, super superficiem corporis, uadens in profundum ualde: et quando inuenit eam frigus, sentitur in ea simile mordicationi formicae, et fit in corpore toto: et plurimum eius fit in manibus.	 However, a formica is also a small rough lump on the surface of the body, going very deep: and when it encounters cold, it feels like an ant bite, and it occurs throughout the body: and it mostly happens in hands.
Et curatio eius est, ut accipias cannulam ex penna anseris, aut penna uulturis forti: et pone illam cannulam super Formicam, donec contineat circulus cannulae ex partibus eius.	 And its treatment is that you take a quill from a goose feather or a strong vulture feather: and place this quill over the formica, until the circle of the quill contains its parts.
Deinde reuolue manum tuam cum cannula, donec seces quod est in circumitu Formicae: et ponas eam in profundo carnis, et eradices Formicam ex radice eius.	 Then turn your hand with the quill until you cut what is around the formica: and place it deep into the flesh, and pull out the formica from its root.
Et si uis, fac illud cum cannula aeris, aut ferri, secundum hanc formam.	 And if you wish, do this with a quill of brass or iron, in this shape.
Sit superius cannulae ad sublimitatem trahens surdum inuolutum, ut alleuietur super digitum apprehensio eius et ipsius reuolutio.	 "Let the upper end of the syringe draw the plugged catheter, so that its grasp on the finger is alleviated and its rolling back.
Et si uis cauteriza Formicam secundum quod praemissum est in cauterizatione Athelil in capitulo de cauterio.	 "And if you wish to cauterize with an ant, as was mentioned in the section on cautery in the chapter on cautery.
¶ De formis Instrumentorum quae administrantur ad Clisteria in aegritudinibus Ani, et solutionis uentris, et colicae.	 "Concerning the shapes of instruments that are used for enemas in cases of illnesses of the anus and to relieve the intestines and colic.
Caput LXXXIII.	 Chapter 83
Quandoque Clistere fit ex argento, aut ex aurichalco, aut ex aere fuso, aut malleato.	 "Sometimes an enema is made of silver, or copper, or cast bronze, or hammered.
Et quandoque fit ex istis Instrumentis paruum, et magnum, secundum illos in quibus administrantur.	 "And sometimes these instruments are made small and large according to those into whom they are administered.
Illud ergo quod administratur in curatione puerorum paruorum, sit paruum: et quorum ani sunt debiles, aut dolorosi, sic et clisteria eorum.	 "Therefore, that which is administered for the treatment of small children should be small; and likewise their enemas if their anus is weak or painful.
Clistere magnum.	 "A large enema.
Cistere paruum.	 "Small clyster
Canna eius, id est, caput superius in quo ligatur uter, sit amplum secundum hunc modum: et sit ei distinctio ut ligetur uter sicut uides, et extremitas eius inferior quae intromittitur in anum, sit surda, id est, non aperta, lenis, ualde, trahens ad subtilitatem: et in uno laterum eius sint duo foramina, et in latere altero foramen unum.	 "The tube of it, that is, the upper end where the bag is tied, should be wide according to this manner; and there should be a distinct part so that the bag can be tied as you see, and its lower end which enters into the anus should be plugged, that is, not open, very gentle, drawing to fineness; and on one of its sides there should be two holes, and on the other side one hole.
Et sit amplitudo foraminis secundum grossitudinem radiorum, et grossius parum, et sit uter in quo ponuntur medicinae ex uesica animalis: aut ex charta ouis, quae sit secundum formam asofrati paruae: cuius radix sit palmus unus.	 "And the width of the hole should be according to the thickness of the reeds, somewhat thicker; and let the bag in which the medicines are placed be from a bladder of an animal or from sheepskin, which should be according to the shape of a small syringe, whose tube is one palm long.
Et perforetur foraminibus multis sicut reuoluitur, et sit spacium quod est inter omne foramen grossitudo digiti.	 "And it should be pierced with many holes as it is rolled, and the space between each hole should be the thickness of a finger.
Deinde intromitte in illa foramina filum forte ex filo crudo, quod sit ex decem filis, aut circiter ea, et aggrega cum eo utrem sicut asofrati.	 "Then insert through those holes a thread made of raw silk, which should consist of ten threads or thereabouts, and attach the bag to it like an ear syringe.
Cum ergo ponitur in eo uter, stringatur in capite clisteris inter duo distinguentia constrictione forti.	 When therefore it is placed within, let the enema be tied at the head between two tightenings with a strong constriction.
Deinde clisteriza cum eo.	 Then let him be given an enema with it.
Et haec est forma circuli utris hic depicta, et foraminum.	 And this is the form of the circle of the bag here depicted, and its openings.
Qualitas autem clisterizandi cum eo, est: ut impleas utrem, aut uesicam ex medicina, quae sit calefacta secundum quantitatem tolerantiae infirmi: et caue ne sit calida ualde, aut frigida ualde.	 The quality of administering the enema with it is this: that you fill the bag or bladder with medicine which has been heated according to the tolerance of the patient; and be careful that it is not very hot nor very cold.
Deinde resupinetur infirmus super dorsum suum, et eleuet crura sua ad superiora: et pone sub eo inthaan, id est, corium super quod iacent homines, aut linteamen.	 Then let the patient be turned onto their back and lift up their legs; and place under him an intahaan, that is, a hide upon which people lie, or a cloth.
Deinde inunge extremitatem Clisteris cum oleo, aut cum albugine oui, aut cum mucillagine foenugraeci, aut similium.	 Then anoint the end of the enema with oil, or with egg white, or with fenugreek mucilage, or similar substances.
Deinde intromitte ipsum in anum cum facilitate.	 Then insert it into the anus gently.
Deinde accipiat minister utrem cum duabus manibus suis simul, et exprimat ipsum cum uehementia, donec euacuet totum quod est in Clisteri in intestinum.	 Then let the attendant take the bag with both his hands together and squeeze it forcefully until he has expelled all that is within the enema into the intestine.
Deinde extrahe Clistere, et eleuet infirmus crura sua ad parietem.	 Then remove the enema, and let the patient raise their legs against the wall.
Quod si medicina cogit eum ad exitum, tunc teneat quantum potest.	 And if the medicine forces him to go out, then let him hold it as long as he is able.
Et si dormit cum ea nocte tota, est magis ultimum in iuuamento.	 And if he sleeps with it throughout the night, it is more efficacious in its assistance.
Si autem clisterizas eum in aegritudinibus solutionis uentris, et festinat exitus eius: tunc itera clistere, donec sanetur.	 But if you give him an enema for abdominal pains and his evacuation is urgent; then repeat the enema until he is cured.
Quod si in ano sunt hemorroides, aut apostemata laedentia, tunc sit clistere subtile ualde, lene, ex clisteribus quibus clisterizantur pueri.	 And if there are hemorrhoids or painful abscesses in the anus, then let the enema be very fine and mild, like those with which children are given enemas.
Et haec sit forma clisteris subtilis super quod sit stricta cutis.	 And this is the form of a fine enema on which the skin should be tightly drawn.
¶ De curatione Vulnerum capitis sine fractura ossis.	 ¶ On the Treatment of Head Wounds Without Fracture of the Bone.
Caput LXXXIIII.	 Chapter 84
Iam dixi in diuisione de curatione uulnerum quod conueniebat libro, et ego dicam hic curationem eorum cum manu, et cum medicinis secundum complementum.	 And I have already said in the division on the treatment of wounds what was suitable for the book, and here I will say the treatment of them with the hand and with medicines according to their nature.
Dico ergo, quod uulnera diuersificantur secundum illud quo fiunt uulnera, et secundum locum super quem cadit uulnus.	 Therefore, I say that wounds are distinguished according to that by which the wound is made and according to the place upon which the wound falls.
Res ergo quibus fiunt uulnera multotiens, sunt sicut iactus lapidis: aut incisio ensis, aut cultelli: aut percussio cum lancea, aut ligno, aut sagitta: et similibus illis ex rebus multis.	 The things by which wounds are made are often like these: a blow with a stone; or a cut with a sword or knife; or a strike with a spear, stick, or arrow; and similar things from many objects.
Vulnera autem quae fiunt secundum loca corporis sunt, sicut uulnus quod cadit super caput, aut collum, aut pectus, aut uentrem, aut epar: et similia ex eis membris.	 Moreover, wounds according to the parts of the body are as follows: a wound that falls upon the head, or neck, or chest, or belly, or liver; and similar things from those members.
Et ego sum narrans curationes quorundam uulnerum, ut ponam eam ratiocinationem et regulam super reliqua uulnera.	 And I am narrating the treatments of some wounds so that I may place this reasoning and rule over other wounds. 》
Et ego incipiam a uulneribus capitis simplicibus: quoniam rememoratio compositorum ueniet in principio capituli tertii.	 And I will begin with simple head wounds, because the treatment of compound wounds will come at the beginning of the third chapter.
Dico ergo.	 Therefore, I say.
Quando accidit in capite uulnus simplex, et non est fractura ossis: considera tunc, si est ex iactu lapidis, aut ei similibus, et iam fregit cutem tantum: et est uulnus magnum, et times super infirmum euentum apostematis calidi: tunc propera, et phlebotoma cephalicam statim: et non tardes illud: et extrahe ei ex sanguine secundum quantitatem uirtutis eius: si non fuerit prohibens aliquid a phlebotomia, praecipue si fuerit sanguis qui egreditur ex uulnere paucus.	 When a simple wound occurs on the head and there is no fracture of bone, consider if it is from the blow of a stone or similar things and has only torn the skin, and the wound is large, and you fear an unfavorable outcome of a hot aposteme; then hasten and make an immediate cephalic phlebotomy; and do not delay that; and draw out from the blood according to its quantity. If there is nothing preventing the phlebotomy, especially if the amount of blood coming out of the wound is small.
Et sit phlebotomia ex contrario partis uulneratae.	 And let the phlebotomy be from the opposite side of the wounded part.
Et caueat infirmus sibi a repletione, et uino, et cibis grossis.	 And let the patient take care to avoid fullness, and wine, and heavy foods.
Si autem minutionem prohibet aliquid, tunc minoretur ex cibo, et non appropinquet carnibus, neque uinis.	 If something prevents the cutting off, then let it be cut off from food, and not approach meats or wines.
Et pone super uulnus si accidit ei apostema calidum, cotum infusum in oleo rosato solo, aut cum uino in quo est stipticitas.	 And place on the wound if it develops a hot abscess, cooked onion infused only in rose oil or with wine that has an astringent property.
Si autem securus fueris ab apostemate calido, tunc pone super uulnus, si est recens cum sanguine suo, et non mutauit ipsum aer, puluerem quem ego narrabo post paululum: et si iam mutauit ipsum aer, tunc pone super ipsum quaedam unguenta, donec sanetur.	 But if you are safe from the hot abscess, then place on the wound, if it is fresh with its own blood and the air has not changed it, the powder that I will describe shortly: and if the air has already changed it, then place on it certain ointments until it heals.
Si autem uulnus est magnum, aut est ex incisione ensis, et similium: et non aggregantur labia eius per puluillos, tunc aggrega ipsa cum sutura, secundum quod ego narrabo in uulneribus uentris de sutura eorum.	 But if the wound is large or from a sword cut and similar: and its edges do not come together with stitches, then gather them with stitching, as I will describe in the chapter on wounds of the belly about their stitching.
Si autem uulnus iam detectum est ab osse, et pendet, et non est retentio eius, nisi in suspensorio paruo: tunc incide ipsum.	 But if the wound has already been detached from the bone and hangs down and there is no retention of it except in a small ligament: then cut it off.
Deinde cura uulnus cum medicinis, et restaura in eo carnem duram loco cutis, et praecipe infirmo, ut alatur cibis in quibus est grossitudo, sicut sunt capita, et triticum coctum, donec sit ut puls: et eis similia.	 Then care for the wound with medicines and restore hard flesh in place of skin, and instruct the patient to be nourished with foods that are thick like porridge and boiled wheat until it is like a paste and similar foods.
Quod si inuenis in cute putrefactionem, et non adhaeret ossi: tunc incide putrefactum totum, et proiice ipsum: deinde cura illud.	 But if you find putrefaction in the skin and it does not adhere to the bone, then cut off all of the putrefied part and throw it away; then care for it.
Si autem in his uulneribus est arteria, aut uena ex qua fluit sanguis: et non abscinditur per medicinas, tunc inquire super arteriam.	 But if in these wounds there is an artery or vein from which blood flows and it does not clot with medicines, then seek for the artery.
Si ergo inuenis eam non sectam, tunc seca eam cum Spatumili, aut liga eam.	 Therefore if you find it uncut, then cut it with a scalpel or ligature it.
Quod si necessitas prouocat quando non confert illud quod diximus, tunc cauteriza eam, donec abscindatur sanguis.	 But if necessity demands when the aforementioned method does not work, then cauterize it until the blood clots.
Si autem uulnera ista sunt parua, simplicia, tunc res eorum est facilis, leuis: ita ut puluerizes super ea hunc puluerem: quoniam consolidat ea antequam mutet ea aer.	 If these wounds are small and simple, then their condition is easy and light; sprinkle this powder over them, for it will heal them before the air changes them.
¶ Modus Pulueris incarnatiui.	 Method of the flesh-forming powder:
Recipe olibani partem unam, et sanguinis draconis partes duas, et calcis non extinctae partes tres: teratur totum multum, et cribelletur: et impleatur ex eo uulnus, et constringatur constrictione bona, donec adhaereat super ipsum bene, et coaguletur cum sanguine.	 Take one part of frankincense and two parts of dragon's blood, and three parts of fresh lime. Grind them all together very finely and sift them; then fill the wound with it and bind it tightly until it adheres well and coagulates with the blood.
Deinde stringe ipsum desuper cum puluillis, et dimitte ipsum, neque soluas ipsum dum permanet, ita quod non apostemetur.	 Then bind it over with small pieces of cloth, and leave it undisturbed until it is completely healed, so that it does not become detached.
Nam non eradicatur ab eo medicina, donec sanatur.	 For the medicine will not be removed from it until it has healed.
Et quandoque facit illud calx sola, quando non sunt tibi in praesenti olibanum, et sanguis draconis etiam facit eandem operationem in multis ex uulneribus magnis, quando conuenit ut ponatur super ea et stringantur, et sunt uulnera recentia cum sanguine suo, quae non alterauit aer.	 And sometimes lime alone does this, when you do not have frankincense and dragon's blood at hand; for dragon's blood also performs the same function in many large wounds, when it is placed upon them and they are bound, and the wounds are fresh with their own blood, which the air has not yet changed.
Quod si iam alterauit ea aer quadam alteratione, praecipue quando est in tempore aestatis, tunc non est in positione huius pulueris intentio: cura ergo ipsum cum eo quod diximus, ita ut ponas super ea quaedam unguenta digestiua: aut ponas super ea pultes ex farina hordei, factas cum aqua et melle, donec emittant pus.	 But if the air has already changed them somewhat, especially in summertime, then this powder is not useful for their treatment; therefore care for them with what we have said, placing upon them certain digestive ointments, or place upon them poultices made from barley meal, mixed with water and honey, until they put forth pus.
Deinde cura ea reliqua curatione, donec sanentur.	 Then care for them with the remaining treatment until they are healed.
Si uero accidat cum uulnere fractura in osse, et est parua, tunc extrahe illud cum Gesti: et ego iam dicam curationem fracturarum capitis in eo quod futurum est.	 But if a bone is broken along with the wound, and it is small, then extract it with pincers; and now I will speak of the treatment for head fractures as follows.
¶ De uulneribus Colli.	 On wounds of the neck:
Caput LXXXV.	 Chapter Eighty-Five.
SI Autem uulnus accidat in Collo, tunc non est inter ipsum differentia in medicatione, et inter uulnus capitis quando est simplex.	 But if a wound occurs on the neck, there is no difference in its treatment from that of a simple head wound.
Si autem iam incisus est neruus Colli, aut arteria: tunc si est neruus, non est in eo ingenium, nisi ut deuitetur curatio eius cum eo quod facit stipticitatem uehementem, sicut ziniar, et zegi, et eis similia.	 If however the nerve of the neck or artery has already been cut: then if it is a nerve, there is no remedy for it, except to avoid its treatment with what causes intense coagulation, such as ziniar and zegi, and similar things.
Quoniam nocent neruis, et contrahunt eos.	 Since they harm nerves and constrict them.
Et non ponas super uulnus aliquid frigidum omnino: quoniam substantia neruorum est frigida, et continuatio eius est cum cerebro, quod est sublimius membrorum: et sit illud quo curatur ex medicinis lene, sicut calx lota cum aqua dulci aliquotiens infusa cum oleo, aut cum oleo rosato, et tuthia, quando abluitur etiam cum aqua dulci: et reliqui lapides minerales, secundum hunc modum, et unguenta humida.	 And you shall not place anything cold at all on the wound; because the substance of nerves is cold, and its continuation is with the brain, which is the highest part of the body: and let that which is used for treatment be mild, such as lime washed many times with sweet water mixed with oil, or with rose oil and tuthia, when it is also washed with sweet water; and other mineral stones in this manner, and moist ointments.
Si autem uulnus est magnum, tunc administra suturam: aut coarta labia eius cum puluillis.	 However, if the wound is large, then apply stitches; or close its lips with small pieces of cloth.
Deinde cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	 Then care for him until he heals.
Si uero uulneri est profunditas, aut accidit in eo sinus in inferiori parte eius, in quo iam aggregatur pus, tunc perfora ipsum in magis depresso loco in eo.	 However, if the wound is deep or an abscess has formed at its lower part where pus is already gathering, then pierce it in a deeper place therein.
Quod si iam incisa est in uulnere arteria, et consecutus est sanguinem eius fluxus: tunc separa, uel seca eam, et liga ipsam: aut cauteriza eam, si prouocat necessitas ad illud.	 If an artery has been cut in the wound and its bleeding has followed, then separate it or cut it off and tie it; or cauterize it if necessity demands that.
Si autem iam incidit spondiles gutturis, aut totum, et saluatae sunt alhaudegi: tunc aggrega labia cutis cum sutura super cannam gutturis, et non tangas guttur, imo aequa ipsum, et reduc ipsum super figuram naturalem.	 However, if the thyroid cartilage has been cut entirely or in part and the alhaudaj have been saved, then gather the lips of the skin with stitches above the cricoid cartilage, and do not touch the throat; rather make it equal and return it to its natural shape.
Deinde stringe ipsum strictura decenti, et dimitte ipsum diebus aliquot.	 Then bind it with a proper tightness and leave it for several days.
Deinde cura ipsum cum unguentis in quibus est stipticitas et exiccatio, donec sanetur.	 Then care for him with ointments that have coagulant and drying properties until he heals.
Si autem uulnus iam fecit impressionem in osse, tunc perquire ipsum: tunc si in ipso sunt fragmenta ossis, extrahe ea omnia, aut quae potes ex eis: et quod non praeparatur, dimitte illud, donec putrescat uulnus, et separetur et alleuietur egressio eius.	 If the wound has already made an impression on the bone, then examine it: if there are bone fragments in it, remove all of them, or as many as you can; and what is not ready, leave it until the wound becomes putrid, and its opening separates and softens.
Quod si uulnus fuerit recens, tunc pulueriza super ipsum puluerem quem narraui.	 If the wound is fresh, then sprinkle on it the powder that I mentioned.
Si autem uidetur in uulnere os, et fit Fistula: tunc cura ipsam cum eo cuius rememoratio uenit in capitulo suo.	 If bone appears in the wound and a fistula forms, then treat it as mentioned in its chapter.
¶ De uulnere in Spatulis.	 ¶ On wounds of the lips.
Caput LXXXVI.	 Chapter 86.
SI Est percussio lanceae, aut cultelli: et uides eius profunditatem, tunc considera.	 If it is a wound from a spear or knife: and you see its depth, then observe.
Si ergo ex uulnere egreditur uentositas, quando anhelat ex eo infirmus, tunc scias, quia uulnus est mortale.	 If, therefore, there is windiness coming out of the wound when the patient pants, then know that the wound is mortal.
Quod si non fuerit ei profunditas, et est recens cum sanguine suo: tunc non ponas in eo a prima hora puluerem, neque stringas ipsum, ut non retineatur sanguis in profunditate eius, et reuertatur ad cor, et interficiat infirmum: sed pone in ipso unguentum attractiuum, et solue ipsum in die bis.	 But if the wound is not deep and it is fresh with its own blood: then do not put powder on it from the first hour, nor bind it, so that the blood is not retained in its depth and returns to the heart and kills the patient; but put on it a drawing ointment, and dissolve it twice a day.
Si uero unguentum non est tibi praesens, tunc pone in orificio uulneris cotum uetustum, ut sugat illud quod egreditur de eo ex humiditatibus: et fac ut dormiat infirmus super uulnus, ut currat quod aggregatur in eo.	 But if you do not have the ointment present, then put an old cloth on the mouth of the wound to absorb what comes out of it from moisture; and make the patient sleep on the wound so that what accumulates in it runs off.
Si uero iam praeterierint uulneri tres dies, aut plures, et non accidit infirmo spasmus, neque tremor cordis malus, neque strictura in anhelitu, et uides reliquas dispositiones eius bonas: tunc scias, quia uulnus est saluum.	 But if three days or more have already passed for the wound, and no spasm, nor bad heart tremor, nor constriction in breathing has befallen the patient, and you see that its other dispositions are good: then know that the wound is safe.
Cura ergo ipsum et cum liciniis, et reliqua curatione, donec sanetur.	 Therefore, treat him with linen cloths and the rest of the treatment until he is healed.
Si uero excusatur sanatio eius, et iam aperitur semper, tunc scias, quia iam factum est Fistula.	 If healing is hindered and it always opens up again, then know that a fistula has formed.
Cura ergo ipsam ex capitulo suo.	 Treat it according to its own chapter.
Et si uulnus est ex incisione ensis, aut cultelli, et est simplex in superficie pectoris, aut dorsi: tunc cura ipsum cum eo quod praecessit ex sutura, si est magnum: aut cum puluere, si est paruum.	 And if the wound is from the cut of a sword or knife and is simple on the surface of the chest or back, then treat it with what was mentioned before for stitching, if it is large; or with powder, if it is small.
Si autem iam fecit impressionem in osse, et incidit ex eo frusta: tunc inquire uulnus, et propera ad extrahendum illa frusta, si sunt separata.	 But if it has already made an imprint on the bone and fragments have broken off from it, then search for the wound and hasten to extract those fragments if they are separate.
Si uero non sunt separata, tunc dimitte ea, donec putrefiat uulnus, alleuiatur enim extractio eorum.	 But if they are not separate, then leave them until the wound becomes foul, for their extraction will be easier.
Reliquorum autem uulnerum accidentium in reliquis membris iudicium in curatione, est iudicium eius quod diximus.	 But the treatment of other wounds occurring in other parts follows the same judgment as we said.
¶ De uulneribus Ventris, et exitu intestini, et exitura eorum.	 ¶ On Wounds of the Belly and Exit of Intestines and Their Healing
Caput LXXXVII.	 Chapter 87
Disruptio quae accidit uentri, est magna, et media, et parua.	 A wound that occurs in the belly is great, medium, or small.
Ex magna igitur quandoque egreditur intestinum, aut numerus intestinorum.	 Therefore, from a great wound sometimes an intestine or several intestines protrude.
Quare fit intromissio eorum, et eorum sutura uehementior et difficilior.	 Because of this, their introduction and their stitching are more forceful and difficult.
Et disruptio parua etiam fit difficilis ex modo alio.	 And a small wound also becomes difficult in another way.
Sequitur ergo, ut sit reductio eorum difficilior, si non properas in intromissione sua ad locum suum statim: quoniam inflatur, aperitur, et ingrossatur: quare fit difficilis introitus eius.	 Therefore, if you do not hasten to return them immediately to their place, the swelling will occur, it will open up and become thick, which makes their entry difficult.
Propter hoc ergo fit melior disruptionum disruptio media: quoniam cum ea non fit difficilis reductio intestini, sicut fit dissicilis in his duabus speciebus.	 Therefore, a medium wound is better for wounds, because with it the return of the intestine is not difficult, as it happens with these two kinds.
Scias, quod sutura uenris est secundum quatuor modos.	 Know that the stitching of the belly is in four ways.
Duae suturae communes conueniunt in sutura uentris, et in sutura reliquorum uulnerum corporis: et duae suturae aliae proprie communicant reliquis uulneribus.	 Two stitches are common to the stitching of the belly and to the stitching of other wounds of the body, while two other stitches are peculiar to other wounds.  /> > The common ones are: the first one is a simple one, and the second one is with a needle.
Verumtamen sunt magis propriae cum sutura uentris: et ego narro tibi unamquamque cum expositione, et declaratione.	 Truly they are more specific for the closure of the abdomen: and I narrate each to you with explanation and elucidation.
Dico ergo, quia quando uulnus est paruum, et egreditur ex eo aliquid ex intestino, et fit difficile reducere ipsum: tunc illud est propter unum duorum modorum.	 I say therefore, that when the wound is small and some of the intestine has protruded from it, and it is difficult to reduce it, then this is because of one of two things.
Aut propter paruitatem disruptionis, sicut diximus: Aut quoniam in intestino est inflatio propter frigus aeris.	 Either because of the smallness of the wound, as we said: Or because there is swelling in the intestine due to cold air.
Quando ergo illud est ita, tunc oportet ut calefacias ipsum, ita ut submergas spongiam, aut pannum humidum in aqua tepida sola.	 Therefore, when this is the case, you should heat it so that you dip a sponge or wet cloth in warm water alone.
Aut decoquas in aqua squinantum, et cyperum, et spicam, et embroces cum ea intestinum, donec resoluatur inflatio.	 Or boil in water safflower, cumin, and nutmeg, and smear the intestine with it until the swelling is resolved.
Quandoque facit illud uinum in quo est stipticitas: et est melius quam aqua sola in resolutione inflationis.	 Sometimes he does this with wine that has astringency, and it is better than plain water for resolving swelling.
Cum ergo uides inflationem iam resolui, tunc humecta intestinum cum aqua in qua decocta est altea, aut malua.	 Therefore, when you see the swelling has been resolved, then moisten the intestine with water in which althea or mallow has been boiled.
Nam per illud alleuiatur introitus eius cum re parua.	 For through this its entry will be facilitated with something small. ›
Si autem excusatur reditus eius post hanc curationem, tunc finde in disruptione parum, cum instrumento quo secantur hemorrhoides.	 But if its return is hindered after this treatment, then find the small wound with an instrument used for cutting hemorrhoids.
Et curatio prima est melior quando praeparatur, quam sectio: et non fit coactio ad secandum post necessitatem et defectum instrumenti.	 And the first cure is better when it is prepared than when it is cut: and there is no need to cut after necessity and lack of an instrument.
Sit pars eius una quae est torta, acuta, et pars eius altera non acuta, et extremitas subtilis non sit cum subtilitate Spatumilis, imo sit obtusior parumper: et est illa quae similatur caiada, sicut uides.	 Let one part of it be twisted and pointed, and the other part not pointed, and let its tip not be very fine like a spatula, but rather somewhat blunter; and it is similar to a hook, as you see. › ›
Cum ergo amplificatur uulnus, et ingreditur intestinum, tunc oportet, ut sit reductio eius secundum formam suam naturalem in loco suo sibi proprio, si possibile est super illud: quoniam est melius.	 Therefore, when the wound is enlarged and the intestine comes out, it is necessary that its reduction be according to its natural shape in its proper place, if possible, for this is better. › ›
Quando uero disruptio est ampla in inferiori parte uentris: tunc oportet ut facias iacere infirmum super dorsum suum, et pone crura sua altiora capite suo.	 When however there is a large disruption in the lower part of the abdomen, then it is necessary that you make the patient lie on his back, and place his legs higher than his head.
Et si est in superiore parte uentris, tunc pone caput eius, et pectus ipsius altiora quam eius inferiora.	 And if it is in the upper part of the abdomen, then place his head and chest higher than his lower parts.
Et similiter si est disruptio in una duarum partium uentris, tunc pone intentionem tuam, et tuam considerationem semper in hoc, ut pars in qua est uulnus sit altior parte altera.	 And likewise if there is a disruption in one of the two parts of the abdomen, then direct your attention and your care always to this, that the part in which the wound is may be higher than the other part.
Et ita oportet, ut admimistres illud in uulneribus magnis, et in uulneribus mediis.	 And thus you should do this for large wounds and medium wounds.
In uulneribus autem paruis, pone illud secundum quod praeparatur tibi.	 But for small wounds, place it as it is prepared for you.
Deinde fac ut sit praesens inter manus tuas minister pius, qui teneat disruptionem totam manu sua: et aggrega labia eius.	 Then make sure that there is a pious assistant at hand who holds the entire disruption with his hand: and gather its lips together. 
Deinde detege ex ea ei qui sequitur suturam aliquid post aliquid: et iste est modus suturae communis unius.	 Then let him who follows take the stitching one thing after another, and this is the common method of single stitching.
Et est, ut accipias acum, aut numerum acuum secundum quantitatem amplitudinis uulneris.	 And it is that you should take a needle or a number of needles according to the size of the wound.
Deinde dimitte ab extremitate disruptionis quantitatem digiti anularis, id est, medici: et fige acum unam praeter quod intromittas in eam filum in duabus extremitatibuis cutis, cum duabus extremitatibus sifac quod est sub cute ab interioribus, donec facias eam penetrare ab alia parte, et tu iam aggregasti duas extremitates cutis, et duas extremitates sifac: et fiunt quatuor ordines.	 Then leave from the end of the disruption a thumb's width, that is, the doctor's; and insert one needle through what you put in it a thread at both ends of the skin, with both ends of the sinew that is under the skin from within, until you make it penetrate on the other side, and you have already gathered together two ends of the skin and two ends of the sinew: and there are four rows.
Deinde stringe cum filo duplo in circumitu acus aliquotiens a duabus partibus simul, quousque sint aggregata duo labia uulneris aggregatione decenti.	 Then pull with the double thread around the needle several times from both sides together, until the two lips of the wound are gathered together with a decent union.
Deinde dimitte grossitudinem digiti etiam, et fige in eis acum aliam: postea reta eam cum filo, sicut fecisti cum acu prima.	 Then leave another thumb's width, and insert another needle; afterwards draw it with the thread, as you did with the first needle.
Non ergo cesses facere illud cum eo quo indiges ex acubus, donec compleas constrictionem uulneris totius.	 You should not hesitate to perform it with what you need from the cubits until you complete the constriction of the entire wound.
Et sint acus mediae inter grossitudinem et subtilitatem: quoniam acus subtiles ualde uelociter incidunt carnem: et grossae sunt difficilis introitus in cutem: propter illud oportet ut sint mediae in subtilitate, et grossitudine.	 And let the needles be of medium size between thickness and thinness: for thin needles cut the flesh very quickly; and thick ones are difficult to enter into the skin; therefore, they ought to be of medium size in both thinness and thickness.
Et non oportet, ut figatur acus in duabus extremitatibus cutis propinquae multum: ut non incidatur caro uelociter, et aperiatur uulnus ante consolidationem sui, et non elongentur etiam cum sutura, ut non prohibeatur uulnus a consolidatione.	 And it is not appropriate that the needle be inserted in the two extremities of the skin very close together so that the flesh is not cut quickly and the wound opens before its own healing, and also so that they do not elongate with the suture, lest the wound be prevented from healing.
Deinde incide extremitatem acuum, ut non laedant infirmum apud somnum suum: et pone eis puluillos ex pannis ab omni parte, qui teneant extremitates acuum: et dimitte eos, donec scias quod uulnus iam consolidatum est.	 Then cut the ends of the needles so that they do not harm the patient in his sleep; and put small woolen cloths around them from all sides, which hold the ends of the needles; and leave them there until you know that the wound has already healed.
Et haec quidem species suturae cum acubus taliter est conuenientior in uulneribus paruis.	 And this type of suture with needles is more suitable for small wounds in this manner.
Quoniam sufficit in sutura eorum acus una, aut duae, aut circiter eas.	 Because one needle, or two, or about that number is sufficient for their suture.
Sutura autem secunda communis est, ut aggreges cum sutura extremitates quatuor: extremitates, duas cutis, et extremitates duas sifac in uice una, cum acu in qua sit filum inuolutum aequale in subtilitate, et grossitudine.	 However, the second type of suture is common, so that you gather with the suture the extremities of four: two extremities of skin and two silk threads in place of one, with a needle on which an equal thread is wound in thinness and thickness.
Deinde quando penetraueris cum acu has extremitates quatuor, reduc acum a parte a qua incaepisti eadem, ut cadat filum retatum a superiori parte uulneris: ut sit sutura, sicut sutura panni quo stringuntur panni, et pone inter omnem suturam quantitatem grossitudinis digiti minoris.	 Then, when you have penetrated these four extremities with the needle, bring the needle back from the side where you began, so that the thread falls and remains at the upper part of the wound; thus let the suture be like the suture of a cloth by which clothes are sewn together. And put between each entire suture the thickness of a little finger.  />
Hanc autem suturam sciunt homines.	 This type of suture is known to people.
Et cum hac sutura ego sui uulnus quod acciderat uiro in uentre suo, qui fuerat uulneratus cum cultello, et erat disruptio uulneris maior palmo uno: et exierat ex intestinis circiter duos palmos ex intestino medio, et erat disruptio in medio uentris.	 And with this suture I healed a man of the wound which had happened to him in his belly, who had been wounded with a knife; and there was a rupture of the wound greater than one palm: and about two palms of the middle intestine had come out, and the rupture was in the middle of the belly.  />  />
Reduxi ergo illud postquam stetit intestinum eius extra uulnus xxiiii horis.	 I therefore returned after his intestine protruded from the wound for twenty-four hours.
Consolidatum est ergo uulnus in spacio quod fuit circiter XV dies: et curaui ipsum, et sanatus est: et uixit post illud annis multis, conuersatus in suis dispositionibus.	 The wound was therefore healed after about fifteen days, and I treated it, and he was cured; and he lived many years afterward, converted to his own ways.
Et medici iudicauerant, quod non sanaretur.	 And the physicians judged that he would not be cured.
Et ex miraculo fuit, quod non curaui illud cum unguento.	 And it was a miracle that I did not treat it with an ointment.
Quoniam fui in loco in quo non inueniebatur unguentum, neque aliquid ex medicinis.	 Because I was in a place where no ointment could be found, nor any medicine at all.
Posui ergo super uulnus cotum uetustum bis in die, et assiduaui ablutionem eius cum aqua mellis, donec sanatum est.	 I therefore placed an old cloth over the wound twice a day, and I continued to wash it with honey water until it was healed.
Duas autem species suturae proprias dicam secundum narrationem sermonis.	 I will describe two proper types of suture according to the account of the text.
Et est, ut incipias cum sutura acuta: et intromittas acum ab exteriori ad interiorem partem.	 And it is that you begin with an acute suture: and you insert the needle from the outer part to the inner part.
Cum ergo penetrat acus in cutem, et in lacertum euntem secundum longitudinem et latitudinem totius corporis: dimitte extremitatem sifac in latere in quo intromisisti acum, et fac penetrare in extremitatem aliam ab interiori parte ad exteriorem in extremitate altera mirach.	 Therefore, when the needle has penetrated the skin and into the flesh along the length and width of the entire body: leave the end of the thread on one side where you inserted the needle, and make it penetrate to the other end from the inner part to the outer part at the opposite end.
Cum ergo feceris eam penetrare, tunc fac eam penetrare secundum hoc in eadem hac extremitate mirach ab exteriori parte ad interiorem: et dimitte extremitatem sifac, quae est in hoc latere, et fac penetrare acum in extremitatem alteram ab interiori parte ad exteriorem: et fac penetrare cum penetratione tua qua facis eam penetrare in sifac extremitate mirach, quae est in parte eius, donec penetret in ipsum totum.	 Therefore, when you have made it penetrate in this way at that end from the outer part to the inner part: leave the thread on this side, and make the needle penetrate into the other end from the inner part to the outer part; and with your penetration as you are making it penetrate into the thread at the opposite end, which is in its place, until it penetrates completely.  />
Deinde incipe etiam ab hoc eodem latere, et sue ipsum cum extremitate, quae est ex sifac in latere alio, et extrahe acum ex cute quam penetrauit.	 Then begin again from that same side, and bring it together with the end which is from the thread on the opposite side, and withdraw the needle from the skin which it had penetrated.  />
Deinde reduc eam in illam cutem, et sue extremitatem sifac, quae est in latere alio, cum hac extremitate mirach: et extrahe eam ex cute quae est ex parte eius, et fac illud uice una, et alia: et fac illud uice post uicem, usquequo suas extrinsecum totum secundum illud exemplum.	 Then bring it back into that skin, and join the thread on one side with this end of the thread; and withdraw it from the skin which is on that side, and do this once and again; and continue to do this alternately, until you have brought everything together completely in this way.
Et summa huius suturae, est ut suas sutura pellipariorum qua suunt pelles: ita ut suas sifac uice una ex parte una extremitate cutis: et ut dimittas eam uice alia ex parte alia, donec compleas.	 And the essence of this stitch is like the stitches used by tanners to draw skins together; so that you should make a suture once from one end of the skin, and leave it in place on the other side, until you complete it.
Secunda species suturae propriae, quam dixit Gale nus.	 The second type of proper stitch, which Galen called.
Iste eius sermo narratus est, ut suas eam secundum similitudinem, qua suunt eas quidam medicantium, ita quod aggregant omnem partem ad comparem suam conuenientem per naturam: et applicant extremitatem sifac ad eius aliam extremitatem, et extremitatem mirach ad extremitatem eius aliam.	 This is the narrative of its description, and it should be made similarly to how some physicians make it, so that they bring together every part with its fitting counterpart by nature: and they apply one end of the thread to the other end of it, and one end of the needle to the other end.
Et illud fit secundum quod narro tibi.	 And this is done according to what I tell you.
Oportet ut figas acum in extremitatem mirach propinquam tibi ab exteriori parte, et facias eam penetrare ad interiorem in eo solo: et dimittas duas extremitates sifac.	 You should pierce the needle into the end of the thread nearest to you from the outside, and make it penetrate inside in this way only; and leave two ends of the thread.
Deinde reuolue acum, et fac eam penetrare ab exteriori parte ad interiorem in duas extremitates sifac, scilicet utrinque.	 Then turn the needle and make it penetrate from the outside to the inside through both ends of the thread, that is, on both sides.
Deinde reuolue utrasque, etiam fac penetrare utrasque ab interiori usque ad exteriorem, in duas extremitates mirach alias, quae sunt in latere opposito.	 Then turn both and make them penetrate from the inside to the outside through the other two ends of the thread, which are on the opposite side.
Et iste modus suturae est melior sutura communi facili, et est sutura cuius praecessit rememoratio.	 And this method of stitching is better than the common easy one, and it is the stitch which was mentioned before.
Iste est ergo sermo Galeni etiam.	 This then is also the narrative of Galen.
Et dixerunt quidam.	 And some said:
Retificatur sutura uentris cum duabus acubus.	 The stitching of the belly is done with two needles.  />
Quod est, ut intromittas in eis utrisque filum unum: et incipe cum intromissione acus, ex eo quod est apud te, et fac eam penetrare usque ad latus aliud, secundum suturam eorum qui suunt coria aequaliter.	 That is, you insert one thread into both of them; and begin with the introduction of the needle from what is on your side, and make it penetrate to the other side according to the stitching of those who equally sew skins.
Et scias, quod quando disruptio est in medio uentris: tunc sutura eius est difficilior quam reliquorum locorum uentris.	 And know that when the rupture is in the middle of the belly, then its stitching is more difficult than in other places of the belly.
Iudicium uero medicationis uulneris, est iudicium reliquorum uulnerum.	 The judgment of a wound's treatment is the same as that for other wounds.
Quod est, quia quando tu consequeris uulnus recens cum sanguine suo, antequam alteret ipsum aer: et reducis intestinum, et suis ipsum, et aptas ipsum: tunc pone super puluerem incarnatiuum.	 Because when you get a fresh wound with its own blood, before the air changes it: and bring out the intestines, and sew them up, and apply suitable remedies: then place powdered incense on it.
Quod si aer iam alterauit uulnus: tunc pone super ipsum quaedam unguenta, quae sunt tibi praesentia, donec faciant pus: et cadant fila, et consolidentur sifac, et mirach.	 But if the air has already changed the wound, then place upon it certain ointments that you have at hand, until they produce pus; and the threads fall out, and the sutures (or stitches) strengthen, and heal (or close up).
Deinde cura illud sicut est curatio reliquorum uulnerum, donec sanetur.	 Then care for it as you would other wounds, until it heals.
Si autem non sunt tibi praesentes medicinae, tunc pone super ipsum statim, exquo incipit emittere pus, cotum uetus: et permuta ipsum bis in die, sicut docui te, donec sanetur.	 But if the remedies are not at hand, then place upon it immediately, from when it begins to emit pus, old linen cloth: and change it twice a day, as I have taught you, until it heals.
Nam tu non indiges medicatione alia in pluribus dispositionibus, quando uulnera sunt simplicia.	 For you do not need another treatment for most conditions when the wounds are simple (or straightforward).
Si autem times, quod communicet uulnus membris principalibus in laesione, tunc oportet ut submergas lanam lenem in oleo temperatae caliditatis, aut in oleo rosato: et pone ipsam in circumitu locorum quae sunt inter inguina, et sub ascellas.	 But if you fear that the wound might communicate with the main parts (or vital organs) in an injury, then it is necessary to soak soft wool in moderately warm oil or rose oil: and place it around the areas between the groin and under the armpits.
Quod si sentit dolorem, aut punctiones, aut putrefactionem in intestinis suis (nam multotiens accidit illud) tunc clisteriza ipsum cum uino stiptico, nigro, tepido: praecipue si putredo iam peruenit in intestino, et facta est exitura penetrans usque ad concauitatem eius.	 If he feels pain or pangs or putrefaction in his bowels (for this often happens), then give him an enema with black, warm, astringent wine: especially if putrefaction has already reached the intestines and caused an exit wound through to its cavity.
Et scias, quod illud quod est ex intestino grosso, est facilioris sanationis: et quod ex eis est ex subtili, difficilioris sanationis.	 And know that what comes from the large intestine is easier to heal: and what comes from the small (intestines) is more difficult to heal.
Intestinum autem quod nominatur Ieiunum, non suscipit sanationem ex uulnere quod accidit in eo omnino: et illud est propter multitudinem eius, quod est ex uenis, et magnitudine earum, et propter subtilitatem corporis eius, et propinquitatem ipsius naturae neruorum.	 The intestine called the jejunum does not accept healing at all from a wound that occurs in it: and this is because of its great number of veins and their size, and because of the thinness of its body, and the closeness of its nature to the nerves (or nervous system).
Si autem illud quod procedit ex uulnere est zirbum, et consequeris ipsum recens: reduc ipsum secundum reductionem tuam, qua reducis intestina aequaliter.	 If, however, that which comes out of the wound is the zirb (i.e., a piece of bowel), and you acquire it freshly: bring it back according to your reduction, by which you bring back the bowels equally.
Si uero praeteriit ei spacium, et iam factum est uiride, aut nigrum: tunc oportet ut stringas ipsum cum filo supra locum qui denigratus est ex eo, ut non accidat fluxus sanguinis.	 If, however, the time has passed and it is now green or black, then it is necessary that you bind it with a thread above the place where it became darkened, so that there will not be a flow of blood.
In zirbo enim sunt uenae et arteriae.	 For in the zirb (i.e., piece of bowel) there are veins and arteries.
Deinde incide quod est praeter illud ligamentum, et pone duas extremitates fili pendentes ex inferiori parte uulneris extra ipsum: ut alleuietur super te attractio eius, et extractio ipsius apud casum zirbi, et emissionem pus uulneris.	 Then cut what is beyond that ligature and place the two ends of the thread hanging from below the wound outside it, so that its traction upon you may be relieved, and to prevent adhesion at the site of the bowel and emission of pus from the wound.
¶ Rememoratio uulneris quod accidit in Intestino.	 § A reminder of a wound that occurs in the intestine.
Quando accidit disruptio in Intestino, et est parua: tunc possibile est, ut restauretur in quibusdam hominibus: propterea, quia ego uidi qui fuit uulneratus in uentre suo cum percussione lanceae, et erat uulnus a dextra stomachi, et antiquatum est uulnus: et factum Fistula, et exiuit ex eo egestio, et uentositas.	 When a disruption occurs in the intestine and it is small, then it is possible that it may be restored in some people; for I have seen someone who was wounded in his belly with the thrust of a spear, and the wound was on the right side of the stomach, and the wound became old, and it formed a fistula, and from it came excretion and flatulence.
Posui ergo curationem, usque quod ego non fui confisus in sanatione eius: neque cessaui subtiliare ipsum, donec sanatus est, et consolidatus est locus.	 Therefore, I applied treatment until I was confident about his healing; nor did I cease to investigate him, until he was healed and the place was strengthened.
Postquam ego uidi locum iam consolidatum, timui super infirmum, quod accideret super infirmum accidens malum in uentre suo: et non accidit ei ex illo accidens malum.	 After I saw the place was already strengthened, I feared for the patient lest he suffer an accidental evil in his belly; and no accidental evil happened to him from that. ›
Et remansit in melioribus dispositionibus suis, comedens et bibens, et futuens, et intrauit balneum, et exercitatus est in dietis suis.	 And he remained in his better condition, eating and drinking, having intercourse, and entering the bath, and he practiced his regular activities. ›
Et iam dixerunt quidam experimentatorum, quia quando accidit in Intestino uulnus, et est paruum: tunc oportet ut ligetur secundum hunc modum.	 And now some of the experimenters said that when a wound occurs in the intestine and it is small, then it ought to be tied up in this manner.
Et est, ut accipias formicas magnorum capitum.	 And it is that you should take large-headed ants.
Deinde aggrega duo labia uulneris, et pone formicam unam ex eis quae habeant os apertum super duo labia uulneris.	 Then bring together the two lips of the wound, and place one ant with its mouth open upon the two lips of the wound.
Cum ergo capit super ea, et stringit os suum, abscinde caput eius, adhaeret enim, et non soluitur.	 When it bites into it, and closes its mouth, cut off its head; for it sticks there and does not come loose.
Deinde pone formicam aliam prope primam, et non cesses facere illud cum formica post formicam secundum quantitatem uulneris totius.	 Then place another ant near the first one, and do not cease to do this with ants, one after another, according to the size of the whole wound.
Deinde reduc ipsum, et sue uulnus.	 Then bring it back, and let the wound close.
Illa enim capita remanent annexa in Intestino, donec cibetur Intestinum, et sanetur, et non accidat infirmo nocumentum penitus.	 For those heads remain attached within the intestine until the intestines have digested them and healed, and no harm comes to the patient at all.
Et iam possibile est, ut ligetur Intestinum etiam cum filo subtili: quod abstersum est ex intestino animalis, annexo cum eo postquam intromittitur in acum.	 And it is now possible to tie the intestine even with a fine thread; that is, what has been cleansed from the intestines of an animal and attached with it after it is inserted into the needle.
Et est, ut accipias extremitatem huius fili ex intestino, et excarnetur multum.	 And it is that you should take the end of this thread from the intestine, and remove the flesh much.
Deinde liga in extremitate eius filum lini subtile inuolutum.	 Then tie a fine, thin linen thread at its end. ⋅
Deinde intromitte illud filum in acum, et sue cum eo intestinum.	 Then insert that thread into the needle, and sew with it along with the intestine.
Deinde reduc ipsum in disruptionem.	 Then bring it back to its break.
Et iste modus suturae cum formicis et intestino, non est nisi secundum uiam fiduciae et spei.	 And this method of suturing with ants and intestine is only according to the path of trust and hope.
Scias, uulnus quod est magnum, amplum, praecipue si est in uno intestinorum gracilium: tunc non est ingenium nisi subtiliatio, neque est eius sanatio omnino.	 Know that a large, wide wound, especially if it is in one of the thin intestines: then there is no remedy except for scraping away, and its healing does not happen at all.
¶ De cura Zuchemen, et Fistularum.	 ¶ On the care of goiters and fistulas.
Caput LXXXVIII.	 Chapter Eighty-Eight.
Scias, quod omne uulnus, aut apostema quando ueterascit et antiquatur, et fit ulcus, et non consolidatur, et emittit pus semper, et non abscinditur: tunc nominatur uniuersaliter in quocunque membro fuerit Fistula, et nos nominamus ipsum Zuchemen.	 Know that every wound or abscess, when it becomes old and chronic, and turns into an ulcer, and does not heal, and always emits pus, and is not cut away: then it is universally called a fistula in whatever member it may be, and we call it Zuchemen.
Et Fistula quidem est secundum ueritatem nodatio filtrata, dura, alba: cum qua non est dolor, cui est concauitas pennae auis: et propter illud nominant eam quidam Risati, id est, pennam.	 And indeed a fistula is truly a hard, white, perforated swelling with no pain, having the concavity of a bird's feather; and because of this, some call it Risati, that is, feather.
Et est in quibusdam horis humida, quae emittit pus.	 And there are certain hours in which it becomes moist, emitting pus.
Et fortasse scinditur humiditas in quibusdam horis.	 And perhaps the moisture divides in certain hours.
Et quandoque est haec humiditas multa, et est pauca: et est grossa, et est subtilis.	 And sometimes this moisture is abundant, and sometimes scarce; it can be thick, or thin.
Et ego iam praemisi in diuisione, tunc cum dixi uulnera, quod omne ulcus quod non sanatur, neque nascitur in eo caro, non est illud nisi propter unam nouem caussarum.	 And I have already mentioned this in the division, when I said 'wounds', that every ulcer which does not heal and does not generate flesh is caused by one of nine causes.
Quarum una est, aut propter paucitatem sanguinis in corpore: aut propter maliciam eius: aut quoniam inter ipsum, et super labia eius est caro dura, prohibens natiuitatem carnis: aut quia est multae sordis et sordiciei: aut quoniam ulcus in seipso est putridum, et materia quae mittitur ei est malae qualitatis: aut quoniam medicina est inconueniens in curatione eius: aut quoniam corruptio cadens in regione est genus pestilentiae, aut per proprietatem in regione, sicut accidit in Caesaraugusta: in qua fit difficilis digestio aegritudinum, et tardatur in ea sanatio apostematum per naturam: aut quoniam in eo est os unum, aut numerus ossium.	 One of these causes is either due to the scarcity of blood in the body, or its corruption; or because there is hard flesh between it and its lips, preventing the generation of flesh; or because it contains much dirt and filth; or because the ulcer itself is putrid and the substance sent to it is of poor quality; or because the medicine used for its treatment is unsuitable; or because the falling corruption in that region is of a pestilential nature, or due to a property of the region, as occurs in Caesaraugusta, where the digestion of diseases is difficult and the healing of apostemes is delayed by nature; or because there is a bone within it, or a number of bones.
Et ego iam ostendi omnes istas caussas et signa earum, et curationes ipsarum cum medicinis in diuisione: et oportet hic ut faciam te scire curationem Fistulae et Zuken, quae fit per uiam operationis cum manu.	 And I have already shown all these causes and their signs, as well as their treatments with medicines, in the division; and here it is necessary for me to make you know the treatment of fistulas and ulcers that is done by the way of surgical intervention with the hand.
Scias ergo, quod Fistula accidit in omnibus membris corporis.	 Know then that a fistula can occur in all parts of the body.
Nam ex eis sunt Fistulae quae perueniunt ad uenas magnas et arterias, aut neruos, aut sifac: aut ad intestinum, aut ad uesicam, aut ad aliquam ex costis: aut ad aliquam ex spondilibus dorsi, aut ad aliquam iuncturarum compositarum compositione: sicut manus, et pedis: et ex eis sunt quae uadunt ad propinquitatem membri principalis, et similium.	 For there are fistulas which reach large veins and arteries, or nerves, or the liver; or the intestines, or the bladder, or one of the ribs; or one of the vertebrae of the back, or one of the joints formed by the composition, such as the hand and foot; and there are those which extend to the vicinity of the main member, and similar ones.  />
Quae ergo ex his Fistulis est secundum hunc modum, est ex aegritudinibus difficilis sanationis, et non recipit curationem, et occupatio cum ea est labor et ignorantia.	 This fistula, according to this method, is difficult to heal due to the disease, and does not accept treatment; dealing with it is laborious and full of ignorance.
Quod si est ex Fistulis aliqua cuius profunditas non peruenit ad haec loca quae dixi: et speras, et confidis in curatione eius, et uis peruenire ad cognitionem illius, tunc accipe tentam ex aere, aut ferro, si Fistula tendit secundum rectitudinem, et perquire eam cum ipsa.	 But if the fistula is of any kind whose depth does not reach these places that I have mentioned; and you hope and trust in its cure, and wish to arrive at knowledge of it, then take a probe made of iron or copper, if the fistula extends straight, and search with it.
Si autem in Fistula est tortuositas, tunc inuestiga eam cum tenta de plumbo subtili.	 However, if there is a curvature in the fistula, then investigate it with a lead probe of fine quality.
Quoniam plumbum cum lenitate sui corporis alleuiatur, et curuatur circa tortuositatem.	 Because lead, due to its softness, adapts and bends around the curvature.
Quod si Fistula est habens orificia multa, non est tibi possibile ut significes super eam cum tenta.	 If the fistula has many openings, it is not possible for you to indicate its location with a probe.
Clisteriza ergo ex eis orificium ex orificiis suis.	 Therefore, irrigate one of its openings from among its openings.
Nam humiditas qua clisterizas ipsum, uadit uersus orificia alia, et currit ex eis.	 For the liquid with which you irrigate it passes towards the other openings and flows out of them.
Deinde exquisite inquire secundum quem modum est tibi possibile: ut cognoscas quod illic est os, aut neruus, et est Fistulae concauitas longinqua, aut propinqua: aut est Fistula una cui sunt orificia multa, et sta super totum illud, cum summa fortitudinis tuae: cum interrogatione tua, qua interrogas infirmum, et inuentione doloris apud compressionem cum manu tua super locum, et similibus ex significationibus et caussis accidentibus apostemati.	 Then carefully investigate according to the way that it is possible for you: so that you may know whether there is a bone or nerve there, and whether the depth of the fistula is distant or near; or whether the fistula is one whose openings are many, and stand over all of it, with your greatest strength: with your questioning of the patient, by which you ask the sick person, and with the discovery of pain upon pressing with your hand on the place, and similar indications and accidental causes.
Cum ergo steteris super omnia illa statione uera, tunc uade ad curationem secundum confidentiam: et est, ut consideres tunc, si est Fistula propinqua apparens, aut in loco saluo longinquo a iunctura, aut a neruo, aut arteria, aut uena, aut uno locorum quae dixi tibi: tunc seca Fistulam secundum quod praemissum est ex narratione mea, et aufer quod est in ea ex filtratione, et carnibus corruptis, quod nascitur in orificio eius ex carne, aut thelul, et similibus: et cura ipsam, donec sanetur.	 When you have stood over all these things with true positioning, then go to treatment with confidence. And consider then, if the fistula is appearing near or in a safe place distant from a joint, or from a nerve, or an artery, or a vein, or one of the places that I mentioned to you; then cut the fistula as was previously stated from my account, and remove what is in it by filtration, and rotten flesh that grows in its opening from flesh, or pus, and similar things: and care for it until it heals.  />
Si autem Fistula est longinquae profunditatis, et est secundum rectitudinem: tunc oportet ut seces eam in profundo quantum est tibi possibile.	 If, however, the fistula is of great depth and straight, then it is necessary that you cut as much of it out as possible.
Deinde mundifica ipsam ex omnibus carnibus eius corruptis.	 Then cleanse it from all its corrupted flesh.
Deinde administra licinia inuoluta in medicinis acutis: et intromitte ea usque ad concauitatem Fistulae quam comprehendisti cum ferro: fac cum ea illud aliquotiens, donec corrodat medicina acuta totum quod remansit in concauitate Fistulae ex corruptione.	 Then apply a bandage soaked in sharp medicine and insert it until it reaches the hollow of the fistula that you have grasped with the iron; do this several times, until the sharp medicine has eaten away all that remains in the hollow of the fistula from the corruption.
Deinde restaura ipsam cum unguentis quae generant carnem sanam, donec sanetur.	 Then treat it with ointments that promote healthy flesh until it heals.
Si uero non sanatur per illud, tunc cauteriza ipsam secundum quod narrauimus.	 If it does not heal through this, then cauterize it as we have described.
Si ergo caussa Fistulae est os, et certificatur apud te illud: tunc inquire ipsum, et seca ipsum secundum quod narraui tibi: si non prohibet te aliquid ex uena, aut neruo, aut membro principali, sicut diximus.	 Therefore, if the cause of the fistula is a bone and it is certain to you, then search for it and cut it as I have told you: if nothing prevents you from the vein, nerve, or main member, as we have said.
Si ergo detegitur tibi os, et est in eo quiddam corruptionis, et nigredinis: tunc rade ipsum, donec auferatur corruptio eius tota.	 Therefore, if a bone is revealed to you and there is some corruption or blackness in it, then scrape it until all its corruption is removed.
Deinde cura ipsum cum eo quod incarnat ipsum, donec sanetur.	 Then treat it with what promotes healing until it heals.
Quod si non sanatur, et emittat pus sicut faciebat: tunc scias, quod tu non peruenisti ad totam eradicationem corruptionis.	 If it does not heal and continues to discharge pus as before, then know that you have not reached the complete removal of the corruption.
Detege ergo super illud secundo, et exquisite fac rasionem eius, et mundificationem ipsius cum ultima fortitudine tua.	 Therefore, examine it again and make a very careful scraping and cleansing of it with all your strength.
Deinde restaura ipsum.	 Then treat it.  />
Si ergo sanatur, bonum est: et si non, tunc scias quod illa corruptio est in profunditate longinqua corporis, quam non es consecutus.	 If it heals, that is good; if not, then know that the corruption is in a deep part of the body which you have not reached.
Non est ergo tibi in ea ingenium, nisi dimittere ipsam naturae.	 You therefore lack skill in it, except to leave it to nature.
Quod si corruptum est os paruum, et est possibile tibi, attrahe ipsum cum forficibus subtilibus quae conueniunt ad illud.	 If the bone is small and possible for you, draw it out with fine forceps suitable for it.
Si autem sunt ossa multa, tunc exquisite fac attractionem eorum omnium, neque dimittas ex eis aliquid cum tua fortitudine.	 If indeed there are many bones, then make a careful extraction of all of them, and do not let any slip by with your strength.
Si uero contrarietatem facit tibi aliquid ex humiditatibus, et non est in incisione eorum timor, uel error: tunc incide illas humiditates et carnes, si sunt illic, et libera ossa.	 If however something from the moisture is causing trouble for you and there is no fear or error in their incisions, then cut those moistures and flesh if they are present, and free the bones.
Si uero non est tibi praeparatio auferendi ossa ex hora tua, tunc pone super uulnus quod putrefaciat ipsum: et dimitte ipsum, donec putrefiat quod est in circumitu illorum ossium ex carnibus et humiditatibus.	 If however you are not prepared to remove the bones at that time, then place something on the wound to cause it to putrefy; and leave it until what is around those bones from flesh and moisture putsrefies.
Et custodi uulnus ut non consolidetur.	 And guard the wound so that it does not heal over.
Et constringatur sectio quam tu secuisti in operatione tua.	 And let the cut which you have made in your work be constricted.
Imo pone super ipsum, si times, cotum submersum sulfure trito cum oleo: aut cotum submersum in unguento aegyptio, aut aliquo unguentorum uiridium.	 Or if you are afraid, place on it a cloth soaked in ground sulfur mixed with oil; or a cloth soaked in Egyptian ointment, or any green ointment.
Nam quando putrefient illae scilicet humiditates, et separantur ex eis ossa, alleuiatur ablatio eorum, et ipsorum attractio.	 For when those moistures have putrefied and the bones have been separated from them, their removal is made easier and their extraction also.
Si autem est os unum magnum, sicut os cruris, aut os coxae, et similia illis, et quod ex eo corruptum est, est pars magna: tunc rade ipsum rasione ultima, donec auferatur illa nigredo et corruptio.	 But if it is a large bone, such as the shinbone or the hipbone, and part of it has become corrupted; then scrape it with the finest rasp until that blackness and corruption are removed.
Deinde restaura uulnus.	 Then restore the wound.
Si uero quod est in eo corruptum, est pars magna, et corruptio iam consecuta est medullam ossis, tunc necesse est serrare ipsum, et incidere ipsum totum usque ad locum, ubi peruenit corruptio: tunc cura ipsum, donec consolidetur.	 But if what is corrupted in it is a large part and the corruption has already reached the marrow of the bone, then it is necessary to saw it and cut it completely up to the place where the corruption reaches; then care for it until it heals over.  />   />   />
Et ego narro tibi zuken, quae accidit uiro in crure suo: ut ponas ipsam exemplum et adiutorium super operationem tuam.	 And I tell you a story which happened to a man in his leg; so that you may use it as an example and assistance for your work.
Fuit uir iuuenis aetate circiter triginta annos, cui accidit dolor in crure suo, a caussa quae mota est super ipsum intra corpus, id est, ab interioribus, donec peruenerunt materiae ad crus, et apostematum est apostemate magno: et non fuit ei caussa extrinseca.	 There was a young man about thirty years old, who had pain in his leg from an internal cause that moved within him; that is, from the inside, until the material reached his leg and it swelled up with a large swelling: and there was no external cause for it.
Extensum est ergo cum eo tempus cum errore medicorum, donec apertum est apostema, et concurrerunt cum eo materiae multae.	 Therefore, time passed with error on the part of the physicians until the abscess burst, and many substances gathered with it.
Et postposita est curatio eius, donec fistulatum est crus, et facta sunt in eo orificia multa: quae omnia emittebant pus, et humiditates corporis.	 And his cure was delayed until the leg became ulcerated and many openings formed in it, which all discharged pus and bodily fluids.
Curauit ergo ipsum multitudo medicorum circiter duos annos, et non fuit in eo sapiens in arte manus, donec uocatus sum, et uidi crus eius, et materias quae currebant ex illis orificiis cursu magno: etiam omne uiri corpus iam tabuerat, et color eius citrinus erat.	 Therefore, many physicians attended to him for about two years, and there was no one skilled in the art of surgery among them until I was called, and I saw his leg and the substances flowing from those openings in great quantity; indeed, all his body had already withered away, and his color was jaundiced.
Intromisi ergo tentam in uno locorum orificiorum, et peruenit tenta ad os.	 Therefore, I inserted a probe into one of the openings and the probe reached the mouth.
Deinde perscrutatus sum orificia omnia: et inueni ea peruenire ad se inuicem ex omnibus partibus cruris.	 Then I investigated all the openings and found that they were interconnected to each other from every part of the leg.
Properaui ergo, et secui super unum illorum orificiorum, donec detexi partem ossis: et inueni ipsum corruptum: quod iam corrosum erat, et denigratum, et putruerat, et perforatum erat, donec penetrauerat usque ad medullam.	 Therefore I hastened and cut over one of those openings until I exposed part of the bone, and found it corrupt, that it had already rotted away and blackened, and become putrid, and penetrated all the way to the marrow.  />
Serraui ergo quod detectum est mihi, et praeparatum ex osse corrupto.	 I therefore sawed off what was exposed to me, and prepared it from the rotten bone.
Et deputaui, quod non esset in osse nisi illa corruptio, quam abscidi, et serraui.	 And I judged that there was nothing else in the bone except for that corruption which I cut away and sawed off.
Et ego iam eradicaueram eam.	 And I had already rooted it out.
Deinde posui restaurationem uulneris cum medicinis consolidatiuis spacio longo.	 Then I applied a wound dressing with consolidating medicines for a long time.  /> 
Et non est consolidatum.	 And it did not heal.  
Deinde tentaui, et detexi super os secundo supra detectionem primam: et inueni corruptionem continuam cum osse: et serraui quod apparuit mihi etiam ex illa corruptione.	 Then I probed again and exposed the bone a second time above the first exposure, and found continuous corruption with the bone, and sawed off what appeared to me from that corruption as well.
Deinde conatus sum restaurationem eius.	 Then I attempted to dress it.
Et non est restauratum.	 And it did not heal.
Detexi ergo super ipsum iterum, et non cessaui incidere os particulatim, et conari restaurationem eius: et non est restauratum, donec incidi ex osse circiter palmum unum, et extraxi illud cum medulla sua.	 Therefore I exposed it again and did not stop cutting the bone piece by piece and trying to dress it, and it did not heal until I had cut away about a hand's breadth of bone with its marrow.
Deinde restauraui ipsum cum medicinis, et consolidatum est uelociter, et sanatum: et non fuit necessaria haec iteratio in operatione eius, et sectione ipsius, nisi propter dispositionem debilitatis infirmi, et paucitatem tolerantiae eius, et timorem meum super ipsum de morte: quoniam accidebat ei in omnibus horis ex superfluitate euacuationis syncopis mala.	 Then I restored him with medicines, and he was quickly consolidated and healed. This repetition of the operation and section would not have been necessary except for the weak condition of the patient, his limited tolerance, and my fear of his death; because he was experiencing syncope from excessive evacuation at all hours.
Sanatus est ergo sanatione integra: et nata est in loco ossis caro dura, et bona facta est dispositio in corpore suo, et rediit uirtus eius: et conuersatus est in dispositionibus suis: et non fecit ei contrarietatem in ambulatione nocumentum omnino.	 Thus he was completely cured; and a strong, good flesh grew in the place of the bone; his body became well-proportioned, and his strength returned; he resumed his normal habits; and there was no damage at all to his walking.
Si autem os eminens in loco corporis iam fractum est: tunc oportet ut serres ipsum, secundum hunc modum: et est: ut accipias ligamentum, et stringe ipsum in extremitate ossis eminentis: et praecipe alicui, qui extendat ipsum ad sursum: et pone ligamentum aliud ex lana grossius ligamento primo.	 But if the projecting bone has already been broken off in the body, then you must sew it up in this way: Take a string and tie it to the end of the projecting bone; and command someone to pull it upward; and place another thicker woolen thread over the first string.
Deinde liga ipsum super carne, quae est suh osse: et extende extremitatem eius, ut trahas carnem ad inferiora: et tu detegis carnem super locum quem uis serrare, ut non laedat Serra carnem.	 Then tie it over the flesh that is next to the bone; and extend its end so as to pull the flesh downward; and you will uncover the flesh over the place where you wish to sew, so that the saw does not cut the flesh.
Pone lignum, aut tabulam sub osse inferius decenter: quoniam quando facis illud, non prohibetur quin secet carnem corruptam.	 Place a piece of wood or board under the bone properly; for when you do this, it will not prevent the saw from cutting through the rotten flesh.
Et oportet ut sit Serratura super locum corruptum parumper, ut non sit in concauitate ossis corruptio: et non appareat in apparitione sua sensui, et cogat ad Serraturam sui uice alia.	 And the sawing should be slightly above the rotten spot, so that the rot is not in a hollow of the bone; and it does not appear to the touch, and thus induces an alternate method of sawing.
Quod si os est corruptum, et non est eminens, imo continuatur pars eius cum parte: et corruptio est in medio eius, aut in parte ipsius: tunc detege carnem ab omnibus partibus totam.	 But if the bone is rotten and does not project outward, but rather continues connected to another part; and the rot is in its middle or side; then uncover all the flesh from all sides completely.
Deinde pone lignum inferius.	 Then place a piece of wood underneath.
Postea serra illud ex parte prima, ubi est corruptio, donec continuetur Serratura ex parte altera: et sit Serratura secundum longitudinem a corruptione parumper, secundum quod diximus.	 Then saw through it from the first side where there is rot, until the sawing reaches the other side; and let the sawing be slightly longer than the rot, as we have said.
Quod si corruptio est in iunctura, incide ipsam iuncturam corruptam, et serra os ubi continuatur ex parte altera.	 If corruption is in the joint, cut the corrupted joint and saw the bone where it continues on the other side.
Si uero corruptio est in continuatione duarum iuncturarum, tunc non est in ea ingenium nisi abrasio.	 However, if corruption is between two joints, then there is no skill in that except to scrape it off.
Quod si corruptio est in pectine manus, aut in pectine pedis: tunc res in eo est difficilis ualde.	 But if corruption is in the comb of the hand or the comb of the foot, then the matter is very difficult.
Verum oportet, ut inquiras corruptionem qualiter appareat tibi.	 Indeed, you must examine how the corruption appears to you.
Et abradas eam, et mundes ipsam secundum quamcunque dispositionem tibi possibile est, et cum quocunque ingenio rectificatur tibi: quando non facit tibi contrarietatem Vena, aut Neruus.	 And scrape it off, and clean it as best you can with whatever skill is available to you: when the vein or nerve does not work against you.
Et scias quod incisoria, et Serrae ad incidendum ista ossa sunt multa, secundum situm ossium, et praparationem eorum, et ipsorum grossitudinem, et subtilitatem eorum, et magnitudinem, et paruitatem ipsorum, et duriciem ipsorum, et eorum raritatem.	 And know that there are many different cutting tools and saws for cutting these bones, depending on the position of the bones, their preparation, their thickness or thinness, size, smallness, hardness, and softness.
Quapropter oportet, ut praepares omni speciei operationis instrumentum conueniens ad illam operationem.	 Therefore, it is necessary to prepare a suitable tool for each type of operation.
Et scias, quod operationes istae significant tibi super speciem instrumenti quo indiges, quando tecum est studium longum.	 And know that these operations indicate to you the kind of tool you need when your study is prolonged.  />
Et cognitio modorum huius artis, testimonium modorum aegritudinum: tunc enim iam inuenies per teipsum illud quod conuenit ei ex instrumentis ad omnem infirmitatem.	 And the knowledge of the methods of this art is a witness to the methods of diseases, then indeed you will find through yourself what suits it from the instruments for every ailment.
Et ego sum firmans tibi in ultimo huius capituli numerum instrumentorum, quae pones exempla super quae incides, et probationem qua experiaris super alia.	 And I assure you at the end of this chapter the number of instruments that you will use as examples for what you cut, and a test by which you try others.
Forma Serrae.	 The shape of the saw.
Forma alterius Serrae.	 The shape of another saw.
Forma Serrae alterius.	 The shape of yet another saw.
Forma Serrae alterius.	 The shape of another saw.
Haec forma Serrae depicta, sit decenter facta.	 This form of the saw is depicted, let it be done neatly.
Fiat arcus eius superior, acuitas eius ex ferro: et manubrium eius ex buxo, et sit pyramidale decenter factum.	 Let its upper part be a bow made of iron and its handle made of boxwood, let it be neatly shaped into a pyramid.
Forma Rasorii iuncturarum.	 The form of the knife for joints.
Sit caput huius Rasorii, secundum formam capitis claui stellati: et puncta eius sint secundum formam punctorum elischetfegi.	 Let the head of this knife be in the shape of a star-headed nail: and its points should be in the shape of the points of the elischetfegi.
Et non conuenit, nisi ut fricentur cum eo capita iuncturarum, quando corrumpuntur, aut os amplum, et magnum est.	 And it is not suitable except to smooth the heads of joints when they are injured, whether a large or great bone is present.
Forma maioris Rasorii.	 The form of the larger knife.
Forma medii Rasorii.	 The form of the medium-sized knife.
Forma Rasorii lati.	 The form of the broad knife.
Forma Rasorii in quo est concauitas.	 The form of the knife which has a concavity.
Forma Rasorii alterius subtilis.	 The form of another fine knife.
Forma Rasorii alterius curuatae extremitatis.	 The form of another knife with a curved tip.
Forma Rasorii parui, subtilis tentae.	 The form of the small and delicate needle-like knife.
Forma Rasorii cum quo inciduntur ossa.	 The form of the knife with which bones are cut.
Forma etiam Rasorii magni.	 Also, the form of the large knife.
Hoc similatur Radio, et extremitas est sicut Serra: exhibetur in locis multis ex rasione ossium.	 This resembles a file, and its tip is like a saw; it is used in many places for the sake of cutting bones. xspace
Forma Rasorii quod conuenit ad rasionem eius quod perforatum est ex ossibus.	 The form of the knife suitable for removing that which has been perforated from the bone.
Extremitas eius triangula, acutarum est extremitatum.	 Its tip is triangular and its points are sharp.
Fit ex Indi.	 It is made of iron.
Et similiter oportet, ut fiant omnia quae diximus ex Rasoriis, et Incisoriis, et Serris.	 And similarly, all that we have mentioned should be made from knives and saws.
¶ De incisione extremitatum, et Serratura ossium.	 ¶ On the cutting of tips and sawing of bones.
Caput LXXXIX.	 Chapter 89.
Putrefiunt extremitates, aut ex caussa extrinseca, aut intrinseca.	 The tips become putrid either from an external cause or from an internal one.  /> Caput XC.
Cum ergo medicatus fueris illam corruptionem curatione medicinarum, et non confert curatio: et uides corruptionem incidere in membrum, quam non repercutit aliquid: tunc oportet ut incidas illud membrum usque ubi consequitu corruptio, ut euadat infirmus per illud a morte, aut a malicia quae est maior defectu membri.	 Therefore, when you have treated that putrefaction with medicines and the treatment does not help, and you see the putrefaction spread into a limb which is not affected by anything else: then it is necessary for you to cut off that limb up to where the putrefaction has reached, so that the patient may escape from death or from the greater evil of loss of the limb.
Et signum cui accidit illud est, quod denigratur membrum, donec putetur: quod ignis combussit ipsum, aut putrefit post nigredinem: donec inciditur illa putredo usque ad illud quod sequitur illud membrum, et serpit in totum corpus.	 And the sign of that which occurs is that the member darkens until it appears to be burnt by fire or decayed after blackening; until that decay spreads to the point where it follows that member and creeps throughout the whole body.
Propera ergo cum incisione eius, et similiter si caussa corruptionis est a percussione quorundam uenenosorum: sicut scorpionis marini, et uiperae, et rutellae, et similium.	 Therefore, hasten with its incision, and similarly if the cause of decay is from the bite of certain venomous creatures, such as the marine scorpion, viper, or asp, and similar ones.
Si ergo corruptio, aut percussio est in extremitate digiti, tunc incide digitum, et non des spacium corruptioni, ut incedat usque ad reliquam manum.	 If therefore the decay or bite is on the tip of a finger, then cut off the finger, and do not leave space for the decay to advance to the rest of the hand.
Et similiter si accidit in manu, tunc incide eam ex radice focilis, et non des spacium corruptioni, donec capiat in focili brachii.	 And similarly, if it occurs on the hand, then cut it off at the root of the wrist, and do not leave space for the decay to reach the forearm.
Et si inuadit in eo, tunc incide brachium apud cubitum in iunctura sua.	 And if it invades that [forearm], then cut off the arm at the elbow joint.
Si autem pertransit corruptio, et uides eum circiter cubitum: tunc in illo est mors infirmi.	 If, however, the decay passes through and you see it around the elbow, then death is certain for the patient.
Et administrare praeter illud ex curatione, est quantitas uirtus.	 And beyond that, administering from the treatment is a matter of skill.
Et similiter fac de pede, quando inuadit corruptio in digito, tunc incide ipsum apud unum nodorum: et si capit in pectine pedis, tunc incide pedem totum.	 And similarly, do the same with the foot when decay invades a toe; then cut it off at one of the joints. If it reaches the sole of the foot, then cut off the entire foot.
Si autem ascendit ad genu, tunc incide crus apud iuncturam genu.	 If it however advances to the knee, then cut off the leg at the knee joint.
Quod si corruptio iam peruenit supra genu, tunc non est in ea ingenium, nisi dimissio, et relinquere infirmum morti.	 When decay has already reached above the knee, then there is no skill [to save him], except to abandon and leave the patient to death.
Et modus incidendi membrum, aut serrandi ipsum est, ut stringas ligamentum in inferiori, quem uis incidere: et stringe ligamentum aliud supra locum.	 And the method of cutting or sawing a member is to tie a ligature below the place you wish to cut and tie another ligature above that place.
Et extendat minister ligamentum unum ad inferiora: et extendat minister aliud ligamentum superius ad sursum.	 And let one assistant pull the lower ligature downward, and let another assistant pull the upper ligature upward.
Et tu separa carnem quae est inter duo ligamenta, cum Spatumili lato, donec detegatur caro tota.	 And you separate the flesh that is between the two ligatures with a broad scalpel until all the flesh is laid bare.
Deinde incidatur, aut serretur.	 Then it should be cut or sewn.
Et oportet, ut ponas ab omnibus partibus pannum lini, et non tangat Serra locum sanum: et accidat infirmo laesio addita, et apostema calidum.	 And you should place a cloth of linen over all parts, so that the saw does not touch the healthy area; and it may happen that an additional injury is inflicted on the sick person, and a hot abscess forms.
Si autem accidat fluxus sanguinis interius dum operaris, tunc cauteriza locum uelociter: aut pone super ipsum quosdam pulueres abscindentes sanguinem.	 But if bleeding occurs internally while you are operating, then quickly cauterize the area, or place some powders that absorb blood on it.
Deinde redi ad medicationem tuam, donec compleatur.	 Then return to your treatment until it is completed.
Deinde liga membrum uulneratum cum ligamento conueniente ei, et cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	 Then bind the wounded limb with a suitable bandage and care for it until it heals.
Et ego narro tibi quod accidit uiro in pede suo, hoc idem accidens quod narro tibi.	 And I tell you that this happened to a man on his foot, the same event as I am telling you.
Quod est, quia accidit in pede suo nigredo, cum adustione quae assimilatur combustioni ignis: et corruptio illa in primis accidit in digito suo, donec coepit pedem totum.	 Which is to say that a blackening occurred on his foot, similar to the burning of fire; and this corruption first began in his toe until it spread to his entire foot.
Properauit ergo uir ex seipso, postquam uidit corruptionem incidere in membro cum uehementia eius, quod inuenit ex dolore, et adustione eius: et incidit ipsum apud iuncturam, et sanatus est.	 Therefore the man hastened to cut himself off, after he saw that the corruption was advancing into his limb with great intensity, which he found from the pain and burning of it; and he cut himself at the joint, and he was healed.
Et postquam praeteriit ei tempus longum, accidit ei illa eadem corruptio in digito manus suae indice.	 And after a long time had passed, that same corruption occurred in his index finger of his hand.
Venit ergo ad me, et conatus sum recuperare illam superfluitatem cum eo quod posui super manum ex medicinis post mundificationem corporis eius: et non repercussa est superfluitas, et coepit incedere in digitum alium: donec coepit coruptio in manum.	 So he came to me, and I tried to draw out that excess with the ointment I placed on his hand after cleansing his body; but the swelling did not subside, and began spreading to another finger until the corruption spread to the whole hand.
Vocauit ergo me, ad incidendum manum eius: et nolui illud, sperans ex me super repercussionem illius superfluitatis: et timui etiam super ipsum apud incisionem manus eius mortem.	 So he called upon me to cut off his hand; and I refused, hoping for the subsiding of that swelling from me; and I also feared death at cutting off his hand. ➤
Quoniam uirtus uiri erat super casum.	 Because the man's strength was greater than the condition.
Postquam ergo desperauit de me, reuersus est ad terram suam: et peruenit ad me de eo, quia properauit, et incidit manum suam totam: et sanatus est.	 So after he despaired of me, he returned to his own land; and news came to me about him that he had hastened and cut off his whole hand; and he was healed.
Et non attuli hanc narrationem, nisi ut sit adiutorium super illud quod cadit de genere huius aegritudinis: et ut sit significatio qua significetur, et secundum quam agatur.	 And I did not bring forward this narrative except to be of assistance concerning that which falls under the category of this illness: and so that it may serve as a signifier by which is indicated, and according to which one should act.
¶ De cura Sinuum, et qualitate clisterizationis cum medicinis.	 About caring for the sinuses, and the quality of enema administration with medications.
Caput XC.	 Chapter 90
Quando accidit apostema in quibusdam membris carnosis, et prolongatur spacium apostematis, donec collectionem facit saniei: deinde rumpitur, aut perforatur, et egreditur quod in eo est ex sanie, et remanet locus uacuus quasi sit uas: et cutis quae est super ipsum sicut pannus qui iam subtiliatus est: et non peruenit ad ultimum in corruptione sua, neque imprimit in os, neque in neruum, neque in ligamentum: meretur ut nominetur Sinus: et non nominatur Fistula: uerumtamen si prolongatur spacium eius, donec imprimat corruptio in aliquid horum membrorum, tunc nominatur Fistula, aut zuken.	 When an abscess occurs in some fleshy members and the space of the abscess is prolonged until it forms a collection of pus: then it bursts or perforates, and what is within it comes out as pus, and the place remains empty like a vessel: and the skin that is above it is like a cloth that has already been made thin: and it does not reach to the end in its corruption, neither imprinting on a bone, nor on a nerve, nor on a ligament: it deserves to be called a Sinus; and it is not called a Fistula. However, if its space is prolonged until the corruption imprints on any of these members, then it is called a Fistula or fistula.
Et cura eius est, ut incidas illam cutem totam sicut reuoluitur: et praecipue quando subtiliata est, et facta sicut pannus: et confidis quia non aaehaeret cum loco, propter corruptionem suam.	 And its treatment is that you should cut off all that skin as if you were rolling it up: and especially when it has been made thin, like a cloth: and you trust that it does not adhere to the place because of its corruption.
Si autem speras quod adhaereat cutis, et non consequitur ex eo corruptio illa ultima consecutione: et si in cute est spissitudo ex carne, tunc cura ipsum cum Clisteri: et est, ut consideres ad Sinum.	 But if you hope that the skin adheres, and it does not follow from this final corruption; and if there is thickness in the skin of flesh, then treat it with an enema: and it is as if for a sinus.
Tunc si est magnus, et pus quod emittitur ex eo est foetidi odoris: tunc clisteriza ipsum cum medicamine aegyptio, quod est aceti, et olei, et ziniar, partes recipiens aequales, aggregentur in uase: et decoquantur super ignem, donec rubeat medicamen: et ueniat in spissitudinem mellis.	 Then if it is large, and the pus that comes out of it has a foul odor: then enema it with Egyptian medication, which is vinegar, oil, and sumac, receiving equal parts, gathered together in a vessel; and boil them over fire until the medication becomes red: and reaches the consistency of honey.
Deinde accipe ex eo quod tibi necesse est: et dissolue ipsum cum aqua et melle, et clisteriza cum eo Sinum: et stringe orificium eius, et dimitte medicinam in eo ad quantitatem duarum horarum.	 Then take what you need from it, dissolve it with water and honey, and use this mixture as an enema for the bladder; then tie off its opening and leave the medicine inside for two hours.
Deinde extrahe ipsum cum expressione: fac illud diebus tot, donec mundificetur Sinus, et remoueatur foetor.	 Then draw it out with a suppository. Do this for as many days as are necessary until the bladder is cleansed and the stench removed.
Et quandoque clisterizatur cum aqua cineris, quando non est tibi praesens hoc medicamen: et est, ut accipias cinerem lignorum uitis, aut cinerem ex lignis ilicis: et proiicias super eam aquam.	 And sometimes it should be irrigated with ashes water when this medicine is not available to you. Take the ashes of vine wood or holm oak wood and pour them over the water.
Deinde cola eam, et clisteriza cum ea, donec confidas quod Sinus iam ablutus est.	 Then strain it and use it for an enema until you are confident that the bladder is now clean.
Quod si infirmo non est tolerantia super medicamen aegyptium, neque aquam cineris, tunc clisteriza ipsum cum aqua et melle, cui iam permixtum est aliquid ex ziniar contrito.	 But if the patient cannot bear the Egyptian medicine or ashes water, then use an enema of water and honey into which some powdered ginger has already been mixed.
Aut clisteriza ipsum cum melle et uino permixtis, quoniam de proprietate mellis est, ut mundificet, et abluat: et uinum facit adhaerere Sinum, praecipue quando in uino est superfluitas stipticitatis et siccitatis.	 Or irrigate it with a mixture of honey and wine, because it is the nature of honey to cleanse and wash, and wine causes the bladder to adhere, especially when the wine is somewhat astringent and dry.
Cum facis illud aliquotiens, et confidis quod Sinus corruptio iam remota est: tunc clisteriza ipsum cum eo quod facit nasci carnem in eo.	 When you have done this several times and are confident that the corruption of the bladder has been removed, then irrigate it with what causes flesh to grow there.
Et est, ut accipias ex emplastro dyafinicon: et dissoluas ipsum cum oleo rosato, et uino stiptico: aut clisteriza ipsum cum quibusdam medicinis, et unguentis aliis, quorum proprietates scripsi in tractatu unguentorum.	 And this is done by taking some diachylon plaster and dissolving it with rose oil and astringent wine; or you can irrigate it with certain other medicines and ointments whose properties I have written about in the treatise on ointments.
Quod si orificium Sinus est strictum, in quo non capit cannula clisteris: tunc amplifica ipsum cum ferro parumper: aut pone in ipso licinium inuolutum in unguento aegyptio, aut in unguento basilicon, donec amplificetur.	 But if the opening of the bladder is too narrow to accept an enema cannula, then dilate it briefly with an iron instrument; or insert into it a tampon wrapped in Egyptian ointment or basilicum ointment until it is sufficiently dilated.
Et similiter si est orificium etiam amplum, tunc aggrega labia eius cum sutura: et dimitte ex eo quantitatem in quam ingrediatur clistere sine additione.	 And similarly, if the opening is also large, then gather its lips with a stitch; and leave from it the amount into which a clyster may enter without addition.
Et similiter si orificium eius ex quo currit pus, est eleuatum ad superiora: tunc seca ipsum in depressiori loco qui est in ipso, ut currat ex eo pus usque inferius: quoniam pus quando coartatur in profunditate Sinus, prohibet carnem generari in eo.	 And similarly, if the opening from which the pus flows is elevated upwards; then cut into it in the deeper part that is within it, so that the pus may flow downwards: for when pus is constricted in the depth of the Sinus, it prevents flesh from growing there.
Quod si non est tibi possibile secare Sinum circiter inferius eius secundum quod uis: tunc conare, ut praepares membrum praeparatione qua currat ex eo pus cum facilitate secundum quod praeparatur tibi.	 If it is not possible for you to cut the Sinus lower as you wish; then strive to prepare the membrane with a preparation that allows the pus to flow easily according to how it is prepared for you.
Conare, ut non retineatur in eo aliquid ex pus omnino: et accipe medicinas consolidatiuas quae ponuntur super signum, conuenientes ad illud quod uis.	 Strive that nothing at all of the pus be retained within it; and take healing ointments which are applied to the wound, suitable for what you wish.
Et extende eas super pannum lini.	 And spread them on a linen cloth.
Et sit pannus tantae quantitatis, qua fiat communicatio totius Sinus.	 And let the cloth be of such size that it may cover the entire Sinus.
Deinde incide cum forficibus in directo orificii Sinus foramen, amplius orificio Sinus parumper.	 Then cut with scissors a hole directly in the orifice of the Sinus, a little wider than the orifice of the Sinus.
Deinde extende ex unguentis lenibus super pannum alium, secundum quantitatem foraminis: et pone eum super ipsum positione longinqua ab orificio Sinus, ut alleuietur exitus pus ex eo: et non auferas pannum magnum, nisi post dies aliquos uice una.	 Then spread gentle ointments on another cloth according to the size of the hole; and place it over the Sinus, distant from its orifice, so that the exit of the pus from it may be relieved; and do not remove the large cloth, except after a few days once.
Ille autem qui est super orificium Sinus, est ille quem remoues in omni hora, ut egrediatur quod aggregatur in eo ex pus: et ut scias, an illud quod currit ex eo uirus, est multum, aut parum: aut digestum, aut indigestum.	 But the one that is over the orifice of the Sinus; it is this one which you remove in every hour, so that what accumulates within it from pus may exit; and so that you may know whether that which flows out of it is much or little; or digested or undigested.
Et cum hoc iterum considera locum Sinus ipsius, an in ipso sentiat dominus eius dolorem, aut non sit in eo dolor, et an sit in eo apostema, aut non sit in eo apostema.	 And with this again consider the place of the Sinus itself; whether the master of it feels pain within it, or if there is no pain in it, and whether there is a swelling within it, or if there is no swelling in it.
Cum ergo protenditur medicatio tua taliter, et uides materiam quae egreditur super orificium Sinus, tunc scias, quod Sinus iam adhaeret, aut approximat adhaerentiae: tunc ergo solue ipsum in mane, aut in tertio die: et quando soluis uulnus, tunc permuta pannum alium, et renoua unguentum.	 When your treatment is extended in this manner and you see the material exiting from the opening of the sinus, then know that the sinus has adhered or is approaching adhesion; therefore, dissolve it in the morning or on the third day. And when you dissolve the wound, then change the cloth for another one and renew the ointment.
Si autem egreditur ex Sinu post spacium longum uirus subtile, tunc non desperes de adhaerentia eius, nam sanatio eius appropinquat, quoniam ex hominibus sunt qui tardant generationem carnis in uulneribus suis, et ex eis sunt qui agunt econtrario illius.	 But if a thin pus exits from the sinus after a long period, then do not despair of its adhesion, for its healing is approaching, since there are people who slow down the growth of flesh in their wounds, and there are those who act contrary to that.
Si autem egreditur ex Sinu post dies multos pus indigestum, tunc scias quod sinus non adhaeret.	 But if after many days an undigested pus exits from the sinus, then know that the sinus has not adhered.
Si ergo tardatur adhaerentia Sinus, et prolongatur res eius: tunc adde in exiccatione medicinarum, uerum faciant medici, ut sint medicinae in substantia sua humidae, et in uirtute sua siccae: sicut unguentum dyafinicon, quando additur in eo superfluitas additionis ex zegi.	 If therefore the adhesion of the sinus is delayed and its course prolonged, then add to the drying of medicines; but let the physicians make sure that the medicines are humid in their substance and dry in their power, like the ointment called dyafinicon when a superfluous amount of egg is added.
Et ex magis ultimo quo curatur, est, ut accipias unguentum dyafinicon, et soluatur cum oleo rosato, et roretur super ipsum uinum antiquum aequale in substantia sua.	 And from the above-mentioned treatment, it is that you should take the ointment called dyafinicon and dissolve it with rose oil, and pour over it an equal amount of old wine in its substance.
Deinde confice ipsum cum eo, et utere ipso.	 Then prepare it with this, and use it.
Et iam facit simile huic actioni, quando non est tibi praesens unguentum dyafinicon, mel, quando decoquis ipsum, donec ingrossetur, et uteris eo.	 And now perform a similar action when you do not have the ointment called dyafinicon present; for honey, when you boil it until it thickens, and use it.
Aut accipe myrrham, et aloen, et olibanum: tere totum, et pulueriza illud super mel dum est super ignem.	 Or take myrrh, aloe, and frankincense; grind all of them together and powder it over the honey while it is on the fire.
Deinde line super ipsum pannum, et stringe ipsum super Sinum: et line cum melle quod decoquisti, donec ingrossatum est: et pulueriza super ipsum species, et pone super ipsum pannum, et stringe eum.	 Then line it with a cloth and tie it over the sinus; and line it with the honey you have boiled until it thickens, and powder over it spices, and place a cloth over it, and tie it.  ///
Et quandoque administratur in illo aristolochia longa, et radices lilii coelestis, et est lilium: et farina herbi, et centaurea.	 And sometimes it is given with long birthwort, and root of the heavenly lily, and lily: and flour of the herb, and centaurie.
Utere eis simplicibus, aut aggregatis, tere ea, et cribella ipsa: et pulueriza super mel quod narraui, et utere eo.	 Use them either as simples or mixed together; pound them and sift them; then powderize over the honey I mentioned, and use it.
Quod si prolongatur res Sinus, et non sanatur hac curatione: tunc scias, quod in profundo eius est corruptio: aut iam facit impressionem in ossibus, aut in reliquis membris duris, aut ligamentis: tunc cura ipsum curatione Fistularum, secundum quod praemissum est.	 But if the abscess is prolonged and does not heal with this treatment, then know that there is a corruption in its depth; either it is already making an impression on the bones, or on the other hard members, or on the ligaments; then treat it with the treatment of fistulas, as has been mentioned before.  /> 133
¶ De cura Panaritii et unguis attritae, et incisione digiti additi, et sectione.	 On the care of a whitlow and crushed nail, and the cutting of the finger, and its sectioning.
Caput XCI.	 Chapter 90
Panaritium est apostema quod nascitur sub ungue pollicis manus, aut pedis: et fortasse nascitur in reliquis digitis.	 A whitlow is an abscess that arises under the thumbnail of the hand or foot; and perhaps it can arise in the other fingers as well.
Cum ergo prolongatur res eius, et negligitur curato eius, et apostematur apostemate calido: aut corrumpitur, et emittit pus, donec corrodit radicem unguis: et fortasse corrumpit eam totam, et fortasse peruenit corruptio ad os, donec est ei odor foetidus: et fit extremitas digiti lata, et fit color eius fuscus.	 But when the abscess is prolonged and its treatment is neglected and it becomes a hot abscess; or it is corrupted and emits pus until it gnaws at the root of the nail; and perhaps it corrupts it entirely, and perhaps the corruption reaches the bone, so that there is a foul odor; and the tip of the finger becomes swollen, and its color becomes dark.
Quando ergo tu curas ipsum, cum eo quod diximus in diuisione, et non confert curatio tua: tunc oportet ut incidas cum ferro totam superfluitatem quae remansit ex ungue.	 Therefore, when you treat it with what we said in the section on division, and your treatment is not effective; then you must cut off with a knife all the remaining excess from the nail.
Deinde cauteriza uulnus post illud.	 Then cauterize the wound after that.
Cauterium enim iuuatiuum est ualde.	 For cautery is very beneficial.  /> 135 
Si uero os est sanum, et est unguis etiam sana, et additiones uacuae unguis iam comprimunt carnem ad interiora, et incipiunt pungere ipsam, et laedunt eam: tunc oportet ut ponas Radium subtilem sub angulo unguis quae pungit carnem, et impelle eam sursum: et incide eam carnem cum facilitate, et pone super illud quod remanet de carne ex medicinis comburentibus, corrosiuis, donec remoueatur totum eius.	 But if the bone is healthy and the nail is also healthy, and the additions of the nail now press the flesh inward and begin to prick it and hurt it; then you must place a fine wire under the corner of the nail that pricks the flesh, and push it upwards; and cut off that part of the flesh with ease, and put on what remains of the medicinal substances that burn and corrode until all of it is removed.
Deinde cura illud cum unguentis, donec sanetur.	 Then care for it with ointments until it heals.
Si autem corruptio iam imprimit in os, tunc oportet ut incidas illud os, et extrahas ipsum: non enim sanatur unquam dum permanet in eo os corruptum.	 But if the corruption has already begun in the ulcer, then it is necessary that you cut into that ulcer and remove it; for it will never heal as long as there remains a corrupted ulcer within it.
Quod si uides corrosionem et corruptionem incedere in digitum, tunc incide eum in uno nodorum, secundum quod praemissa est eius rememoratio.	 If you see the gangrene and corruption advancing into the finger, then cut it at one of its joints, as was mentioned earlier in its description.
Deinde cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	 Then care for it until it heals.
Si autem accidat ungui attritio, aut percussio: et contingit in ea dolor uehemens, tunc oportet ut phlebotomes infirmum in primis.	 But if it happens that the nail is worn down or struck: and there arises a severe pain from it, then it is necessary to bleed the patient first.
Deinde seca unguem cum Spatumili acuto sectione transuersa de sursum ad uisum.	 Then cut the nail with an acutely pointed spatula, making a transverse section from top to bottom as you see fit.
Et custodi, ne sectio perueniat ad carnem quae est sub ungue, nam tu facies accidere per illud super infirmum dolorem uehementem, et erit caussa ad natiuitatem carnis additae in loco.	 And take care that the section does not reach the flesh beneath the nail, for you will cause a very severe pain to occur through this over the patient, and there will be an additional cause of scarring in that place.
Deinde cura locum cum eo quod sedat dolores.	 Then care for the place with something that soothes the pains.
Digitus uero additus qui nascitur in quibusdam manibus hominum, fortasse est carnosus totus: et fortasse sunt in quibusdam eorum ossa, et fortasse est in eo unguis: et quidam eorum nascitur in radice iuncturae, aut est natiuitas eius in quibusdam nodis digiti.	 But the extra finger that is born in some people's hands is perhaps entirely fleshy; and perhaps there are bones in some of them, and perhaps there is a nail on it; and sometimes it is born at the root of the joint, or its birth is in some of the finger's joints.
Ille ergo qui nascitur in quibusdam nodis digiti, non mouetur: et ille qui nascitur apud iuncturam digiti, fortasse mouetur.	 Therefore, that which is born in some of the finger's joints does not move; and that which is born at the finger's joint, perhaps moves.
Eius ergo qui ex eis est carnosus, sectio eius facilis est.	 The section of those which are fleshy is easy.
Quod est, ut incidas ipsum apud radicem suam cum Spatumili lato.	 Which is to say: cut it at its root with a broad spatula.  /> Et sic de iuncturae addita: et similiter quae sunt in manibus aliorum, et est eisdem remediis curanda, et idem est modus curandi eorum.
Eius autem cuius natiuitas est in radice iuncturae curatio, est difficilis.	 However, the cure for that whose birth is at the root of the joint is difficult.
Abstine ergo ab incisione eius.	 Avoid cutting it.
In illo uero qui nascitur in digito apud ultimum nodorum, tunc oportet ut incidas in primis carnem eius incisione rotunda usque ad os.	 But if it is born on a finger at the last joint, then you should cut its flesh with a round incision right up to the bone.
Deinde serra os cum una illarum Serrarum conuenientium ad illud.	 Then saw the bone with one of those suitable saws for it.
Deinde cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	 Then care for it until it heals.
Consolidatio autem quae accidit digitis adinuicem, multotiens accidit aut ex natiuitate hominis, id est, nascitur cum eo, aut a consolidatione uulneris, aut combustione ignis, et similibus.	 A contraction that occurs between fingers can often happen due to a birth defect, that is, it is born with it, or from the healing of a wound, or a burn from fire, and similar causes.  />
Oportet ergo ut seces illam consolidationem, donec redeant digiti secundum formam suam naturalem.	 Therefore, you must cut away that contraction until the fingers return to their natural shape.
Deinde pone inter eos licinia, aut pannos infusos in oleo rosato: ut non consolidentur uelociter, et separa inter eos: aut pone inter eos laminam plumbi subtilem, donec consolidetur locus secundum quod oportet.	 Then place between them bandages or cloths soaked in rose oil, so that they do not quickly heal together, and separate them; or place between them a thin sheet of lead until the place heals as it should.
Et similiter si accidat consolidatio quibusdam digitis cum palma, tunc seca illam consolidationem, secundum quod praeparatur et conuenit figurae membri.	 And similarly, if a contraction occurs between some fingers and the palm, then cut away that contraction according to what is prepared and suitable for the shape of the limb.
¶ De incisione Vitium.	 ¶ On the incision of a tumor.
Caput XCII.	 Chapter 92.
Uites sunt Venae inuolutae, grossae, plenae superfluitatibus melancholicis quae accidunt in pluribus membris corporis: et plurimum euentus earum est in cruribus, praecipue in cruribus iter agentium et laborantium, et portantium.	 Veins are swollen, thick, full of melancholic excesses that occur in many parts of the body; and most of their occurrences are in the legs, especially in the legs of travelers and workers and bearers.
Oportet ergo ut administres excussionem corporis ex cholera nigra aliquotiens excussione forti.	 Therefore, you must administer a purgative made from black bile several times with a strong laxative.
Deinde phlebotoma patientis eas basilicam.	 Then bleed the patient from those veins.
Curatio uero earum cum ferro, est secundum duos modos.	 Their treatment with iron is in two ways.  /> ● If it is on a small part of the body or not very swollen: then incise it gently, and extract what is inside it, and cauterize it so that it does not swell again.  /> ● But if it is large or very swollen: then cut away its skin, and take out what is in it, and stitch up the wound with silk thread until the swelling goes down. 》
Vnus eorum est, ut secentur, et extrahatur sanguis niger.	 One of these methods is to cut them open and extract the black blood.
Et modus alter est, ut eleuetur Vena, et extrahatur tota.	 And another method is to lift the vein and remove it entirely.
Sectio uero eius est secundum hunc modum.	 Its section is according to this manner.
Embroca crus in primis cum aqua calida multum, donec resoluatur sanguis grossus faeculentus.	 First, soak the leg with very hot water until the thick and feculent blood dissolves.
Deinde stringe crus infirmi a superiori parte coxae eius, usque ad inferiorem partem genu cum uitta.	 Then tie off the patient's leg from the top of the thigh to below the knee with a bandage.
Deinde seca uenam in loco uno, aut duobus, aut tribus sectione ampla.	 Then cut the vein in one place, or two, or three, with a wide incision.
Deinde eleua, id est, extrahe sanguinem in manu tua ab inferiori parte cruris, usque ad sursum, et a superiori oportet ut phlebotomes infirmum in primis.	 Then lift, that is, draw out the blood into your hand from the lower part of the leg up to the top, and first of all, let the phlebotomist bleed the patient.
Deinde seca unguem cum usque inferius: donec egrediatur ex sanguine quantitas quam uides sufficere, et quam tolerat uirtus infirmi.	 Then cut the nail along with it below: until enough blood comes out as you see fit and which the patient's strength can bear.
Postea liga eam: et praecipe ei, ut abstineat a cibis generantibus choleram nigram: et itera euacuationem et phlebotomiam, quando implentur Venae, et nocet illud infirmo.	 Afterwards, tie it off and instruct the patient to abstain from foods that generate black bile. Repeat the evacuation and bloodletting whenever the veins are full and it harms the patient.
Eleuatio autem eius est secundum hunc modum.	 Its lifting is according to this manner.
Rade crus infirmi, si in ea sunt pili multi.	 Shave the leg of the patient if it has many hairs.
Deinde intromitte ipsum in balneum: aut embroca ipsum in crure eius cum aqua calida, donec rubeat, et exuberentur Venae: aut exercitetur exercitio forti, si non est ei praesens balneum, donec calefiat membrum.	 Then put the patient into a bath or soak his leg in hot water until it becomes red and the veins swell, or if there is no bath available, exercise strongly until the limb warms up.
Deinde seca cutem in directo uenae sectione per longitudinem: aut in ultimo eius apud genu, aut in inferiori parte eius apud calcaneum.	 Then cut the skin along the length of the vein's path: either at its end near the knee or at its lower part near the heel.
Deinde aperi cutem cum uncinis, et excoria uenam ab omni parte, donec appareat sensui: et est apud apparitionem eius, quod uides eam rubeam ad nigredinem decliuem.	 Then open the skin with hooks and strip the vein from all sides until it is visible to the touch, and at its appearance you will see it redden towards blackness.
Cum ergo uadit ex cute, uides eam albam quasi sit chorda.	 When it emerges from the skin, you will see it white like a string.
Deinde intromitte sub ea Radium, donec quando eleuatur et egreditur de cute: suspende eam cum uncino caeco, leni.	 Then insert under it a reed until when lifted and emerges from the skin; hang it with a blind hook, soft.
Deinde seca sectionem aliam prope illam sectionem tribus digitis.	 Then cut another incision near that incision three fingers wide.
Deinde excoria cutem a superiori parte uenae, donec appareat.	 Then scrape away the skin from above the vein until it appears.
Deinde eleua eam cum Radiis sicut fecisti, et suspende eam cum uncino alio, sicut fecisti in primis.	 Then lift it with tongs as you did before, and hang it with another hook as you did at first.
Deinde seca sectionem aliam, aut sectiones plures, si indiges illo.	 Then cut another incision or several more if you need to.
Deinde eleua, et incide ipsam ultima sectione apud calcaneum.	 Then lift it and cut it off at the last incision near the heel.
Deinde extrahe eam ad sectionem quae est supra eam.	 Then draw it out to the incision above it.
Et fac illud, donec extrahas eam ex sectione quae est superior, uel altior sectionibus omnibus, donec quando egreditur tota: tunc incide eam.	 And do this until you draw it out from the uppermost or all of the incisions, when it comes out entirely; then cut it off.
Si autem non obedit tibi ad extrahendum, et eleuandum: tunc intromitte acum cum filo forti duplo, et liga eam, et extrahe ipsam: aut intromitte sub ea Radium: et reuolue manum tuam ad omnem partem, donec egrediatur.	 But if it does not obey you by being drawn out and lifted up, then insert a needle with a strong double thread and tie it off, and draw it out; or insert under it a hook: and turn your hand to every side until it comes out.
Et caue, ne incidatur.	 And be careful that it is not cut.  />
Nam si incidatur, fit difficile tibi eleuare eam ualde, et ingreditur super infirmum ex ea nocumentum.	 For if it is cut, it will be very difficult for you to lift it up, and harm may come to the patient from that.
Cum ergo extraxeris eam totam: tunc pone super locum uulnerum lanam submersam in uino et oleo rosato, aut oleo: et cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	 When you have drawn it out entirely, then place over the wound a woolen cloth soaked in wine and rose oil or oil, and care for him until he is healed.
Quod si Vitis est contracta, habens tortuositatem cui sit inuolutio ad partes, et non est sicut diximus secundum rectitudinem: tunc oportet ut findas super eam ad omnem partem tortuositatis eius, et loca inuolutionis ipsius.	 But if the vein is constricted and has a tortuous course which it follows to its parts, and is not straight as we have said, then you must slit over it along every part of its tortuous course and places of its twisting.
Deinde suspende eam cum uncinis, donec eleues eam totam: et caue apud sectionem tuam super eam ne incidas uenam, aut uulneres: nam difficile fiet super te eleuare, uel extrahere eam.	 Then hang it with hooks until you lift it all out; and be careful at your incision above it that you do not cut the vein or injure it, for it will become very difficult for you to lift or draw it out.
Conserua ergo prudentiam tuam.	 Therefore keep your discretion.
Forma Incidentis quo sanatur Vitis.	 The Shape of a Wound that is Healed by a Wine-based Remedy.
Forma Vncini caeci.	 The shape of a blind tumor.
Non est ei curuitas sicut reliquis Vncinis, neque est acutae extremitatis, ut non uulneret uenam: et est grossae flectuositatis, lenis: quoniam si esset subtilis, incideret uenam subtilitate sua: imo sit ei superflua grossitudo, sicut diximus.	 It does not have the convexity of other tumors, nor the sharp extremities so as not to wound a vein; and it is large and twisted, soft: because if it were thin, it would pierce the vein with its thinness; but it must have excessive thickness, as we said.
De extractione Venae cruris.	 On the Extraction of the Vein of the Leg.
Caput XCIII.	 Chapter XCIII.
Haec Vena generatur in cruribus in terris calidis, sicut Alizegi, et terra Arabum, et in terris aridis, calidis, paucae teneritatis, id est, in quibus non nascitur herba, neque arbor.	 This vein is generated in the legs in hot lands, such as Alizegi and the Arabian land, and in dry, hot lands where there is little tenderness, that is, where neither grass nor trees grow.
Et fortasse generatur in locis aliis corporis praeter crura.	 And perhaps it is generated in other parts of the body besides the legs. xspace
Et generatio quidem eius est a putrefactione quae accidit sub cute, sicut accidunt intra corpora serpentes et uermes ascarides, et uermes generati inter cutem et carnem.	 And its generation is due to putrefaction occurring under the skin, just as happens within bodies with serpents and worms called ascarids, and the worms generated between the skin and flesh.
Et signum incaeptionis euentus huius Venae est, quod accidit in crure inflammatio uehemens.	 And the sign of the beginning of this vein's appearance is that a severe inflammation occurs in the leg.
Deinde uesicatur locus.	 Then the spot becomes blistered. 
Deinde incipit Vena exire ex loco illius uesicationis, quasi sit radix plantae, aut animal.	 Then the vein begins to emerge from that blistered spot, as if it were a root of a plant or an animal.
Cum ergo apparet ex ea extremitas eius, tunc oportet ut inuoluas super ipsam frustum plumbi, cuius pondus sit ex drachma keil, usque ad drachmas II et noda ipsam: et dimitte plumbum suspensum ex crure.	 Therefore, when its extremity becomes visible from that, then you should wrap around it a piece of lead weighing one drachm and two nqbats, and leave the suspended lead hanging from the leg.
Quotiens ergo egreditur ex ea aliquid ad exteriora, inuolue illud in plumbo, et noda illud.	 So whenever something emerges out of it to the outside, wrap that in lead and tie it up.
Quod si prolongatur multum, tunc incide partem eius, et inuolue residuum.	 If it becomes very long, then cut off a piece of it and wrap the rest.
Et non incidas eam radicitus antequam egrediatur tota.	 And do not cut it off at its root before all of it has emerged.  ?>
Quoniam si incidis, contrahitur, et ingreditur in carnem: et facit accidere apostema, et putredinem in loco, et ulcus malum.	 If you cut, it contracts and enters into the flesh, causing an abscess and putrefaction in the place, and a bad sore.
Quapropter oportet, ut suauiter tractetur, et extrahatur paulatim, donec egrediatur ex ultimo sui, et non remaneat ex ea aliquid in corpore: et ex hac quidem Vena egreditur in quibusdam hominibus quod est in longitudine sua quinque palmorum et decem.	 Therefore, it should be treated gently and extracted gradually until it comes out from its last part, so that nothing remains of it in the body; and this vein, in certain people, extends to a length of five palms and ten.
Et iam peruenit ad me, quia exiuit uiro ex XX palmis.	 And now it has come to me because it came out of a man from twenty palms.
Si autem inciditur tibi in hora medicationis tuae: tunc intromitte radium in foramine eius, et perfora eam foramine longo, cum corpore, donec euacuetur totum quod est in ea ex materia: et administra putrefactionem loci cum medicinis diebus aliquot.	 But if it is cut during your treatment time, then insert a reed into its opening and perforate it with a long hole along with the body until everything that is in it from matter is evacuated; and administer treatments for putrefaction of the place for several days.
Deinde cura ipsum curatione apostematum.	 Then treat him according to the method for treating abscesses.
Et haec quidem Vena quandoque habet ramos multos, praecipue quando apparet in iunctura pedis, aut in pede ipso: et accidunt ei orificia multa, et egreditur ex omni orificio ramus.	 And this vein sometimes has many branches, especially when it appears at the ankle or in the foot itself; and there are many openings for it, and from each opening a branch comes out.
Cura ergo ipsam, sicut diximus in diuisione, et cum eo quod praemissum est.	 Therefore treat it as we have said in the division, along with what was stated beforehand.
¶ De sectione super Vermes generatos sub cute, et dicitur Aegritudo bouina.	 ¶ On cutting above worms generated under the skin, which is called bovine disease.
Caput XCIIII.	 Chapter 94.
Haec Aegritudo nominatur in quadam terra apud nos Aegritudo bouina: propterea, quia multotiens accidit bouibus, et est uermis paruus unus, qui nascitur inter cutem et carnem.	 This disease is called in a certain land among us bovine disease because it often happens to cows and it is a small worm that is born between the skin and flesh.
Et uadit in corpore toto, ascendendo et descendendo: et ostenditur sensui apud ambulationem eius de membro ad membrum, donec disrumpit ubicumque disrumpit in cute locum, et egreditur.	 And it goes through the entire body, ascending and descending; and it is felt when walking from member to member until it breaks through wherever it breaks through the skin and comes out.
Et generatio eius est ex putredine quorundam humorum.	 And its generation is from the putrefaction of certain humors.
Sicut accidunt uermes et serpentes, id est, lumbrici, et ascarides in uentre.	 Just as worms and snakes, that is, earthworms and roundworms, occur in the belly.  />
Et timetur ex malicia eius.	 And fear is caused by its malignancy.
Quia quando ipse uadit in corpore, et eleuatur ad caput, et peruenit ad locum: tunc fortasse aperit in eo, et egreditur, et destruit oculum: et accidit illud multotiens.	 Because when it goes into the body and is raised to the head and reaches that place, then perhaps it opens up there and exits, and destroys the eye, and this often happens.
Cum ergo uis curare eum, et extrahere ipsum, tunc non fit illud nisi apud ambulationem eius, et apparitionem ipsius sensui.	 Therefore, when you want to cure it and extract it, this is only done during its movement and appearance to the senses.
Oportet ergo, ut stringas quod est supra eum, et quod est sub eo cum ligamento constrictione forti.	 You must therefore tie strongly with a ligature what is above it and what is below it.
Deinde seca super ipsum, et extrahe eum.	 Then cut above it and extract it.
Quod si profundatur in carne, et non inuenis ipsum: tunc pone super locum cauterium cum igne, donec moriatur.	 But if it goes deep into the flesh and you cannot find it, then put a cautery with fire on that place until it dies.
Et maius quod timetur, est corruptio eius, qua corrumpit oculum, sicut diximus.	 And what is even more feared is its corruption, by which it corrupts the eye, as we have said.
Si autem uides eum iam peruenisse in capite prope oculum, tunc stringe sub eo supercilium strictura bona.	 But if you see that it has already reached near the eye at the head, then tie a good ligature under it on the eyebrow.
Deinde seca super ipsum, et extrahe eum.	 Then cut above it and extract it. abei
Et oportet ut utatur infirmus mundificatione sui corporis, cum medicinis soluentibus humores putridos malos.	 And the patient must use bodily cleansing with medicines that dissolve bad putrid humors.
Et caueat sibi a cibis generantibus putrefactionem.	 And he should avoid foods that cause putrefaction.
¶ De sectione super aegritudinem Nakir.	 ¶ On the incision for Nakir's disease.
Caput XCV.	 Chapter XCV.
Haec aegritudo nominatur in terra nostra Nakir: et est dolor qui accidit in quibusdam membris: deinde permutatur de membro ad membrum.	 This disease is called Nakir in our land, and it is a pain that occurs in certain limbs, then changes from one limb to another.
Et ego quidem iam uidi ipsum, secundum quod narro tibi.	 And I myself have already seen this, as I am telling you.
Vocatus sum ad mulierem infirmam in quibusdam uillis.	 I was called to a sick woman in certain villages. beyi beyi
Et detexit brachium suum, et uidi inflationem paruam in uena funis brachii.	 And she uncovered her arm, and I saw a small swelling on the tendon of the arm vein.
Et postquam remansi hora una, uidi unam inflationem incedere cum focili, sicut incedit uermis, ascendendo ad humerum eius uelocius quam esse potest: ut sit sicut argentum uiuum, quando currit de loco ad locum.	 And after I remained for one hour, I saw a swelling go forth like a caterpillar, moving quickly up her arm to the shoulder faster than is possible, just as silver moves when it runs from place to place.
Recessit ergo dolor ex illo loco, et fixus est in humero.	 The pain then retreated from that place and fixed itself in the shoulder.
Deinde sedi hora una, et cucurrit in reliquum corpus, donec perueniret in brachium aliud.	 Then I sat for an hour, and it ran through the rest of the body until it reached the other arm.
Deinde narrauit mihi, quia reuoluebatur in toto corpore suo, secundum quod uidi.	 Then he told me that it was turning throughout his whole body, as I saw.
Miratus sum ergo de uelocitate permutationis eius de membro ad membrum.	 So I marveled at the speed with which it changed from member to member.
Et ego quidem ante illud non uideram hanc aegritudinem oculis meis taliter secundum hunc modum.	 And truly, before that, I had never seen this illness in my eyes acting in such a way.
Verumtamen uidi multos, qui inueniunt dolorem permutari de membro ad membrum: et non uidi ipsum oculis, sicut uidi eum in muliere.	 However, I have seen many people in whom pain was transferred from member to member; but I had never seen it with my own eyes as I saw it in the woman.
Et ego non cogito illud esse, nisi quod est propterea, quod mulier fuit ex illis qui sunt ex uillis sicci corporis detectarum uenarum: hinc ergo apparet sensui illa uentositas permutata.	 And I do not think that this happened except because she was one of those women with dry bodies and visible veins; from which it seems to the senses that the wind was transferred.
Et est necesse, ut non appareant secundum hanc rationem in illis qui sunt deliciosi, et corporibus humidis, occultarum uenarum.	 And it is necessary that these do not appear according to this reasoning in those who are delicate and have moist bodies with hidden veins.  />
Cum ergo uis curationem eius, et sentit patiens illud dolorem: tunc si est apparens tibi oculo, sicut diximus, tunc stringe supra ipsum, et sub ipso uelociter: et seca supra ipsum, donec egrediatur illa uentositas coartata: et cauteriza locum.	 Therefore, when you want to treat it and the patient feels that pain, then if it is visible to your eye as we have said, quickly tie above it and below it; and cut above it until that wind comes out constricted; and cauterize the place.
Si autem non uides ipsum oculis tuis: tunc cura ipsum cum excussione corporis, et cum eo quod expellit uentositates, et carminat eas cum pillulis foetidis, et pillulis de serapino, et similibus.	 But if you do not see it with your own eyes, then treat it with bodily evacuation and with what expels winds and binds them with fetid pills, and pills of serpentaria, and similar things.
¶ De extractione Sagittarum.	 § On the Extraction of Arrows.  />
Caput XCVI.	 Chapter 96
Sagittae diuersificantur secundum species suas, et secundum loca in quibus cadunt ex corpore.	 Arrows are distinguished by their kinds and by the places where they fall from the body.
Earum uero diuersitas est: quoniam ex eis sunt quae habent cuspides magnos, et paruos: et concauae, et surdae.	 Their diversity is such that some have large heads and others small; some are hollow and others solid.
Et ex eis sunt quae habent tres angulos.	 And among them are those which have three angles.
Et ex eis quibus sunt linguae.	 And among these are tongues.
Et ex eis quibus sunt astellae.	 And among these are stars.
Illae uero quae sunt secundum membra in quibus cadunt, est secundum duos modos.	 However, those which fall according to the members are of two kinds.
Aut enim membra sunt ex membris principalibus concauis, sicut cerebrum, et cor, et epar, et pulmo, et renes, et intestina, et uesica, et eis similia.	 For the members are either from the principal hollow organs, such as the brain, heart, liver, lung, kidney, intestine, bladder, and similar things.
Quando ergo cadit in aliquo horum membrorum, et apparent tibi signa mortis, quae ego narro tibi post, tunc oportet ut deuites extractionem illius sagittae ex eis, nam mors consequitur illum in quo est, in pluribus dispositionibus.	 Therefore, when it falls into one of these members and the signs of death, which I will tell you later, appear to you, then you must avoid extracting that arrow from them, because death follows him in whom it is, in many cases.
Et quando non apparent tibi ista signa mala, et sagitta non est absconsa in profunditate membri, tunc extrahe ipsam, et cura uulnus.	 And when these bad signs do not appear to you and the arrow is not hidden deep within the member, then extract it and treat the wound.
Ex signis enim cerebri quando cadit in eo sagitta, et penetrat os, et egreditur siphac quod est super cerebrum, est: quoniam accidunt ex illo soda uehemens, et scotomia, et uertigo, et rubedo in oculis, et inflatio, et rubedo linguae, et spasmus, et permixtio intellectus, et uomitus cholerae.	 For the signs of the brain when an arrow falls into it and penetrates the bone and exits through the fontanel on top of the brain are: because there occurs from it a severe headache, blindness in one eye, dizziness, redness of the eyes, swelling, redness of the tongue, spasms, confusion, and vomiting of bile.
Et fortasse egreditur sanguis ex naribus, aut auribus.	 And perhaps blood will come out of the nose or ears.
Et fortasse abscinditur sermo, et destruitur uox.	 And perhaps speech is cut off and the voice destroyed.
Et egreditur ex loco uulneris humiditas alba similis pulti.	 And a white fluid like dough comes out of the place of the wound.
Et exit ex eo simile aquositati carnis.	 And from it comes something resembling the wateriness of meat.  />
Si ergo apparent tibi ista signa, tunc abstine a curatione, et extrahe sagittam si non egreditur.	 If therefore these signs appear to you, then refrain from treating it, and extract the arrow if it has not exited.
Signa autem sagittae quando cadit in corde, sunt: quod ipsa est prope mammillam sinistram: et sentit cum ea quasi ipsa sit fixa in re dura, non in re uacua.	 The signs of the arrow when it falls into the heart are that it is near the left nipple and feels as if it is stuck in a hard thing, not an empty one.
Et fortasse sagittae est motus similis motui pulsus: et currit ex uulnere sanguis niger.	 And perhaps there is a movement in the arrow similar to the pulse and black blood runs from the wound.  /> 89463217
Et sequitur illud frigus extremitatum, et sudor frigidus, et syncopis.	 And it is followed by coldness in the extremities, cold sweat, and fainting.
Scias ergo, quod mors descendit procul dubio.	 You should know that death has certainly come.
Et signum sagittae quando uulnerat pulmonem, est exitus sanguinis spumosi ex uulnere: et uasa quae sequuntur collum, apostematur, et mutatur color infirmi.	 And the sign of an arrow wound to the lung is that blood-froth comes out of the wound; and the veins that follow the neck become inflamed, and the color of the sick person changes.
Et expirat spiritum magnum, altum: et quaerit attractionem aeris frigidi.	 And he exhales a great deal of air with great force; and seeks to inhale cold air.
Quod si cadat sagitta in uelamen, quod est in pectore: tunc est prope costas paruas: et fit anhelitus magnus cum dolore uehementi, cum suspirio: et mouentur omnia membra humerorum.	 If the arrow falls on the diaphragm which is in the chest, then it is close to the small ribs; and there is a great gasping with severe pain and sighing; and all the limbs of the shoulders tremble.
Et si cadat sagitta in stomachum, tunc fortasse egreditur ex uulnere ex cibo aliquid indigestum.	 And if the arrow falls on the stomach, then perhaps something undigested comes out of the wound from food.
Et si cadit sagitta in Ventrem, et figitur in eo: egreditur aliquid stercoris ex uulnere, aut zirbum, aut intestinum quod iam disruptum est.	 And if the arrow falls on the belly and pierces it, then something of fecal matter comes out of the wound, or an intestine that has already been torn.
Non est ergo spes in curatione eius, neque in extractione sagittae.	 There is therefore no hope for his cure, nor in extracting the arrow.
Quod si sagitta cadat in Vesicam, et egrediatur urina: et procedit ex ea aliquid ad exteriora, et fortior sit dolor super infirmum: tunc scias, quia est mortale.	 If the arrow falls on the bladder and urine comes out; and something comes out of it to the outside, and the pain is greater on the sick person; then you should know that it is fatal.
Reliqua autem membra, sicut facies, et collum, et guttur, et spatula, et adiutorium, et spondiles dorsi, et furcula, et coxa, et crus, et eis similia ex membris saluantur secundum plures dispositiones: quando non inuenit sagitta arteriam, aut neruum: et non est sagitta uenenosa.	 The remaining limbs, such as the face, and neck, and throat, and shoulder blade, and shoulder joint, and back of the loins, and collarbone, and hip, and leg, and others like them from the limbs are healed according to various dispositions; when the arrow does not find a main artery or nerve; and is not a poisoned arrow. 》 》
Et ego narro tibi quod uidi de esse harum sagittarum, ut significes per illud super curationem tuam.	 And I tell you that I have seen of these arrows, in order for you to know through this concerning your cure.
Quod est, quia cuidam uiro cecidit sagitta in lachrymali oculi eius, in radice nasi.	 That is, because a certain man had an arrow fall on his tear duct at the root of his nose.
Extraxi ergo eam ipsi ex parte altera, sub adipe auris eius: et sanatus est, et non accidit ei in oculo eius nocumentum.	 I removed it from her other side, under the fat of her ear; and she was healed, and no harm came to her eye.
Et extraxi sagittam aliam Iudaeo, quae cecidit ei in adipe oculi sui sub palpebra inferiori: et sagitta iam occultata erat, et non consecutus sum ex ea nisi extremitatem paruam eius, cum qua adhaeret in ligno suo: et erat sagitta magna ex sagittis arcuum Turcorum, cum ferro leni, in qua non sunt aures.	 I also removed an arrow from a Jew that had fallen into his eyelid fat under the lower eyelid; and the arrow was already hidden, and I could not get anything but its small end, which was attached to its shaft: and it was a large arrow of the Turkish bows, with a soft iron tip, in which there are no barbs.
Sanatus est ergo Iudaeus, et non accidit in oculo eius accidens malum.	 Therefore, the Jew was healed, and no evil befell his eye.
Et extraxi sagittam aliam ex gutture Christiani.	 And I removed another arrow from a Christian's throat.
Et erat sagitta arabica, et est illa cui sunt aures.	 And it was an Arab arrow, and that is the type with barbs.
Secui ergo super ipsam inter duas guidegi: et iam submersa erat in gutture eius.	 I cut, therefore, above it between the two rings: and it was already sunk into his throat.
Subtiliatus sum ergo cum ea, donec extraxi eam: et sanatus est Christianus.	 Therefore, I became skilled with it, until I removed it; and the Christian was healed. />
Et extraxi sagittam aliam uiro quae ceciderat in uentre eius: et cogitauimus, quia moreretur ex ea.	 And I removed another arrow from a man that had fallen into his belly; and we thought that he would die from it.
Postquam ergo praeterierunt ei triginta dies, et non mutatum est super eum aliquid ex dispositionibus eius, secui super sagittam: et ingeniaui super eam, et extraxi eam: et sanatus est, et non accidit ei accidens malum.	 Therefore, after thirty days had passed and nothing changed in his condition, I cut above the arrow; and I sharpened it, and removed it; and he was healed, and no evil befell him.
Et uidi uirum cui cecidit sagitta in dorso eius, et consolidatum est uulnus super eam.	 And I saw a man on whom an arrow had fallen into his back, and the wound over it had become healed.
Postquam ergo fuit post septem annos, exiuit sagitta in radice coxae eius.	 Therefore, after seven years had passed, the arrow came out at the base of his thigh.
Et uidi mulierem cui cecidit in uentre suo sagitta, et consolidatum est uulnus super eam, et remansit sagitta intra ipsam: et non mutata est ex dispositionibus eius aliqua, et mulier non inuenit ei nocumentum in aliqua ex operationibus suis naturalibus.	 And I saw a woman on whom an arrow had fallen into her belly, and the wound over it had become healed, and the arrow remained inside her; and nothing changed in her condition, and the woman did not find any harm in any of her natural functions.
Et uidi uirum alium, cui cecidit sagitta in facie sua: et consolidatum est uulnus, et remansit, non inueniens ei multum dolorem: et similia istis multa.	 And I saw another man who was struck by an arrow in his face; the wound hardened and remained, causing him little pain. There were many similar cases like this.
Et extraxi sagittam uiro ex principibus Regis, quae ceciderat ei in medio nasi sui, et iam declinauerat ad partem dextram parumper: et occultata erat sagitta tota.	 And I removed an arrow from a man who was one of the king's nobles; it had struck him in the middle of his nose and slightly deviated to the right side, and the entire arrow was hidden.
Vocatus sum ergo ad curationem eius post casum sagittae usque ad tres dies.	 I was therefore called to treat him three days after the incident with the arrow.
Inueni ergo uulnus sagittae strictum ualde.	 I found that the arrow wound was very tight.
Inquisiui ergo eam cum tenta subtili, et non sensi eam: et ipse quidem inueniebat punctionem et dolorem sub aure sua ex parte dextra.	 So I examined it with a fine probe and did not feel it; the man himself found pain and discomfort under his right ear.
Speraui ergo, quod erat illa punctio ex extremitate sagittae.	 Therefore, I hoped that this was a point of exit from the tip of the arrow. 
Emplastraui ergo locum cum emplastro in quo erat uirtus attractiua, et digestiua, confidens apud me, quod apostemaretur locus, et appareret mihi signum sagittae, ut secarem super eam: et non accidit in loco accidens significans quod sagitta consecuta sit locum.	 I then applied a plaster with attracting and digesting powers to the area, hoping that the wound would suppurate and reveal to me the sign of the arrow so that I could cut over it; but this did not happen, indicating that the arrow had not reached that location.
Assiduaui ergo cum emplastro super eum diebus multis: et non accidit accidens, et consolidatum est uulnus interim: et remansit infirmus de extractione eius spacio dierum, donec sensit sagittam die quodam intra nasum suum.	 I continued to apply the plaster for many days, and no discharge occurred; the wound healed, but the man remained weak from the arrow's removal for some time until one day he felt the arrow inside his nose.
Et narrauit mihi illud.	 And he told me about it.
Posui ergo super illud uulnus medicinam acutam, corrosiuam diebus multis, donec apertum est: et cum tenta tentaui ipsum, et sensi extremitatem sagittae subtilem quae adhaeret in ligno.	 So I placed a sharp, corrosive medicine on the wound for many days until it opened up; and when I probed it with a probe, I felt the tip of the arrow attached to the wood.
Deinde addidi in apertione uulneris per illam medicinam acutam, donec apparuit nobis uisibiliter extremitas sagittae: et praeteriit mihi cum eo spacium temporis circiter quatuor menses.	 Then I continued to widen the wound with that sharp medicine until we could see the tip of the arrow visibly; and this process took about four months. 
Deinde postquam amplificatum est uulnus, et possible fuit mihi intromittere forcipes in ipsam, et mouere ipsam, et non obediuit ad exitum: tunc non cessaui subtiliare, et ingeniare super eam cum modis ingeniorum, donec coepi super eam die quodam cum forcipibus decenter factis, secundum quod ueniet forma eorum in fine capituli, donec extraxi eam.	 Then after the wound had been widened enough to allow me to insert forceps into it and move the arrow, but it did not exit; I did not stop refining and inventing methods for removing it until one day I began with well-made forceps, as will be shown in their form at the end of this chapter, until I removed it.
Deinde restauraui uulnus.	 Then I repaired the wound.
Et medici quidem iudicant, quod cartilago nasi non restauratur.	 And indeed, doctors judge that the cartilage of the nose cannot be restored.
Restauraui ergo ipsam, et consolidatum est uulnus, et sanatus est infirmas sanitate integra: nec nocuit ei aliquid omnino.	 Therefore I repaired it (the cartilage of the nose), and the wound was healed, and the patient was restored to full health; nothing whatever harmed him.
Et ego narro tibi qualitatem extractionis quarundam sagittarum: ut ponas illud regulam et significationem super illud quod non dixi.	 And I tell you about the method of extracting certain arrows: so that you may use this as a rule and understanding for what I did not say.
Quoniam partes huius artis et distinctiones earum non comprehenduntur cum narratione: neque comprehendit illud liber, et artifex prudens comparat cum pauco super multum: et cum eo quod est paesens, super illud quod est absens: et inuenit operationem nouam, et instrumentum nouum apud descensus rerum extranearum huius artis quando accidunt.	 Since the parts of this art and their distinctions are not comprehended by mere narrative; nor does the book comprehend them, but a skillful craftsman compares a little to much, and what is present to what is absent; and he finds a new operation and a new instrument in dealing with external things of this art when they occur.  />
Dico ergo, quod sagittae non egrediuntur ex membris quibus sunt fixae, nisi secundum duos modos.	 I say therefore that arrows do not exit from the members to which they are fixed except in two ways.
Aut per attractionem ex loco ex quo intrauit.	 Either by retracing their path back out of the place where they entered.
Aut contrario partis alterius.	 Or through the opposite side (of the body).
Et illa quae egreditur unde intrauit, aut est sagitta procedens in loco carnoso: et attrahitur, et egreditur.	 And those that exit where they entered are either arrows passing through fleshy parts, which can be drawn out and exit.  />
Quod si non obedit ad exitum ex hora in qua cadit: tunc oportet ut dimittas ipsam aliquot diebus, donec putrefiat caro quae est in circumitu eius: et alleuietur attractio eius, et eius egressio.	 But if it does not yield to exit at the time it fell, then you must leave it for some days until the flesh around it putrefies, and its extraction will be facilitated, along with its exit.
Et similiter si figitur in osse, et non obedit tibi ad exitum, tunc dimitte ipsam etiam aliquot diebus: et itera eam cum attractione et motione omni die, donec egreditur.	 Similarly, if it is embedded in bone and does not yield to you for extraction, then leave it also for some days; and every day try to extract it with traction and motion, until it comes out.
Quod si non obedit tibi ad exitum post dies, tunc oportet ut perfores in circumitu sagittae in ipso osse ab omni parte cum terebro subtili, donec amplificentur sagittae.	 But if after several days it does not yield to you for extraction, then you must bore around the arrow in the bone itself from all sides with a fine awl, until the arrow becomes enlarged.
Deinde attrahe eam, et extrahe ipsam.	 Then draw it out and extract it.
Si autem sagitta est fixa in capitis osse, et iam processit in uno uentrium cerebri, et apparent ex infirmo quaedam illorum accidentium quae dixi: tunc abstine ab attractione sagittae, et dimitte eam, donec aequetur esse eius post dies.	 If however the arrow is fixed in the bone of the head and has already entered one of the ventricles of the brain, and some of those effects which I have mentioned appear from the patient, then refrain from extracting the arrow and leave it there until its condition becomes equal after several days.
Nam si sagitta peruenit ad sifach, tunc mors non prolongatur ei.	 For if an arrow reaches the pituitary gland, then death will not be delayed for him.
Et si sagitta non est fixa, nisi in corpore ossis tantum, et non penetrat usque ad sifach: et remanet infirmus aliquot diebus, et non accidit ei ex illis accidentibus aliquid: tunc ingenia in attractione sagittae et extractione eius.	 And if the arrow is not fixed except in the bone alone and does not penetrate as far as the pituitary gland, and the patient remains for several days and nothing of those effects happens to him, then one should proceed with extracting the arrow and removing it.
Si autem est fixa ualde, et non obedit tibi ad attractionem: tunc administra terebella in circumitu sagittae, sicut narraui tibl: deinde cura locum, donec sanetur.	 But if it is very fixed and does not yield to you for extraction, then apply trepanning around the arrow, as I have told you; then care for the place until it heals.
Si autem Sagitta iam absconsa est in loco corporis, et occultatur et absconditur a sensu: tunc inquire eam cum tenta.	 But if the arrow is already hidden in some part of the body and is concealed and hidden from sense, then seek it out with a probe.
Si autem sentis eam, tunc attrahe eam cum quibusdam instrumentis quae conueniunt attractioni eius.	 But if you feel it, then extract it with certain instruments that are suitable for its extraction.
Si autem non potes super eam, propter constrictionem uulneris, et propter longitudinem sagittae in profundo: et non est illic os, neque neruus, neque uena: tunc finde super eam, donec amplificetur uulnus, et sit possibile extrahere sagittam.	 But if you cannot reach it because of the narrowness of the wound and the length of the arrow deep inside, and there is no bone, nerve, or vein there, then cut open above it until the wound is widened and it becomes possible to extract the arrow.
Quod si sunt ei aures quibus teneatur, tunc libera carnem fixam in eis ab omni parte, omni ingenio quo potes illud, et ingenia, si non potest super euasionem carnis in fractura aurium, et contorsione earum, donec euadat.	 But if there are ears (i.e., pieces of flesh) by which it is held, then free the attached flesh from every side and in every way you can manage to do that, and if it cannot be extracted because of the breaking of the ears and their twisting, then persist until it comes out. )))
Et tu quando administras extractionem Sagittae, in quocumque loco est, tunc utere contorsione manus tuae, cum forficibus ad partes omnes, donec facias eam euadere: et subtilia ultima subtilitate, ut non frangatur Sagita, et fiat difficilis tibi attractio eius, et ipsius extractio.	 And when you administer the extraction of an arrow in whatever place it is, then use the twisting of your hand with forceps on all parts until you make it come out; and be subtle with the utmost subtlety so that the arrow does not break and its attraction and extraction become difficult for you.
Quod si non potes super eam ex hora una, tunc dimitte eam diebus aliquot, donec putrefiant quae sunt in circumitu eius.	 If you cannot cut it in one hour, then leave it for some days until what surrounds it decays.
Deinde itera eam: alleuietur enim tuncia Si uero contrarietatem tibi facit fluxus sanguinis, tunc administra quod diximus ex curatione in capitulo suo: et custodi uirtutem tuam ab incisione uenae, aut nerui, aut chordae.	 Then repeat the process; the swelling will be relieved. However, if the flow of blood is causing difficulty for you, then administer what we said in its own chapter on treatment: and guard your virtue from cutting a vein or nerve or sinew.
Et administra ingenium omni modo quo tibi possibile est euasionis Sagittae: et sit illud cum facilitate, et tranquillitate, uel tarditate, et firmitate, sicut narraui tibi.	 And administer the medicine in every way that is possible for you to evade the arrow: and let it be with ease, calmness, slowness, and firmness, as I have told you.
Et oportet, ut facias cum trahis Sagittam, ut infirmus sit secundum figuram, secundum quam fuit apud casum Sagittae in ipso.	 And it is necessary that when you draw the arrow, it should be weakened according to the figure as it was at the time of the arrow wound itself.
Quoniam est magis iuuatiuum.	 Because it is more beneficial.
Si autem non est tibi possibile illud, tunc administra quod tibi est possibile ex figuris.	 If this is not possible for you, then administer what is possible from the figures.
Sagitta autem quae egreditur ex contrario partis alterius, aut iam procedit ex ea aliquid ad exteriora: aut facit gibbositatem extremitas Sagittae per sensum ex superiore parte cutis propinquae, et uides eam eminentem: seca ergo super eam, et sit sectio secundum quantitatem quod capiant in ea forcipes.	 If the arrow comes out of the opposite part, or something is already protruding to the outside, or if it forms a swelling at the tip of the arrow that you can feel under the skin and see it protruding, cut above it; let the incision be according to the size that the forceps can grasp in it.  ()
Deinde attrahe eam: ipsa namque fit facilis ad exitum.	 Then draw it out, for it becomes easy to remove.
Si uero retinetur in osse, tunc torque manum tuam secundum rotunditatem, donec imprimat Sagitta in osse, et amplificet sibiipsi: deinde trahe ipsam.	 But if it is lodged in the bone, then twist your hand according to its roundness until the arrow presses into the bone and enlarges its own opening; then draw it out.
Et si non: dimitte eam diebus aliquot: deinde itera eam, donec egrediatur.	 And if not, leave it for some days; then repeat the process until it comes out.
Quod si lignum Sagittae est in ea, tunc impelle ipsam cum eo.	 If the arrow has a wooden shaft, then push it out with its shaft.  ()
Si autem cecidit lignum, et uis administrare impulsionem: tunc intromitte ad eam instrumentum concauum, ut ingrediatur concauitas eius in caudam Sagittae: deinde impelle eam cum ipso.	 But if the wooden shaft has broken off and you wish to administer a push, then insert into it a concave instrument so that its concavity enters into the tail of the arrow; then push it out with it.  ()  ()  ()  ()
Si autem Sagita est concaua, tunc impelle eam cum instrumento intrante in ipsam.	 If however the arrow is barbed, then push it through with an entering instrument.
Sagitta enim alleuiatur per illud.	 For the arrow should be removed by that means.
Quod si Sagitta est toxicata, tunc oportet, ut concaues carnem totam, in qua est uenenum: si est tibi possibile illud.	 If the arrow is poisoned, then it is necessary to cut out all the flesh in which the poison is located, if it is possible for you.
Deinde cura eam cum eo quod conuenit ad illud.	 Then treat it with what is suitable for that.
Quod si Sagitta est cadens in pectore, aut in uentre, aut in uesica, aut in latere: et est propinqua ex eo quod tangis cum tenta, et possibile est tibi secare super eam: tunc seca, et caue ab incisione uenae, aut nerui, et extrahe eam.	 If the arrow falls into the chest or belly or bladder or side and is close to the surface so that you can feel it with your finger, and it is possible for you to cut above it, then cut, and be careful not to cut a vein or nerve, and extract it.
Deinde sue uulnus, si uides, et cura illud, donec sanetur.	 Then treat the wound, if you see it, until it heals.
Et haec est forma Forcipum, quibus extrahuntur Sagittae.	 And this is the form of the forceps with which arrows are extracted.
Sint extremitates similes rostro auis, quae factae sunt sicut ferra: quando capiunt super Sagittam, non dimittunt eam.	 The ends should be like the beak of a bird and made in such a way that when they grasp the arrow, they do not let it go.
Et fiunt ex eis species multae, magnae, et paruae, et mediae, secundum quantitatem magnitudinis Sagittae, et paruitatis eius, et amplitudinis uulneris, et constrictionis eius.	 And many forms are made from them, large and small and medium, according to the size of the arrow and its narrowness, and the width of the wound and its narrowness.
Forma Impellentis concaui.	 The form of the pushing instrument for barbed arrows.
Et forma Impellentis surdi.	 And the form of the pushing instrument for blunt arrows.
Hoc est surdae extremitatis sicut Radius, ut alleuietur introitus eius in sagittam concauam, et impellatur cum eo.	 This is the end of the blunt arrow like a radius, so that its entry into a barbed arrow may be facilitated and it may be pushed with it.  />
Huius extremitas impellentis concauae est concaua sicut penna auis: ut alleuietur introitus sagittae in ipsam et impulsio eius.	 The end of the pushing instrument for barbed arrows is like a bird's feather, so that the entry of the arrow into it and its pushing may be facilitated.
¶ De phlebotomia Venarum.	 ¶ On the bleeding of veins.  />
Caput XCVII.	 Chapter 97.
Uenae phlebotomandae, quarum cucurrit consuetudo in corpore, sunt triginta.	 There are thirty veins that run in the body and into which it is customary to bleed.
Ex quibus in capite sunt sexdecim: duae Venae pulsatiles, quae sunt post aures, dictae duae Herbae: et duae Arteriae, quae sunt in duobus timporibus apparentes: et duae Venae quae sunt in duobus lachrymalibus duorum oculorum, quae dicuntur Aspicientes: et Vena praeparata in medio frontis: et uena quae est in extremitate nasi.	 Of which there are sixteen in the head: two pulsating veins behind the ears, called the two herbs; and two arteries that appear in both temples; and two veins in both tear ducts of the eyes, which are called the watchers; and one prepared vein in the middle of the forehead; and one vein at the tip of the nose.
Et duae Guidegi, quae sunt in collo.	 And two veins of Guidugi, which are in the neck.
Et duae uenae quae sunt in labio superiore oris.	 And two veins which are in the upper lip of the mouth.
Et duae uenae quae sunt in labio inferiore.	 And two veins that are in the lower lip.
Et istae sunt uenae quae dicuntur Algecherich.	 And these are the veins which are called Algecherich.
Et duae uenae quae sunt sub lingua.	 And two veins that are under the tongue.
Venae autem quae phlebotomantur in brachiis, sunt quinque uenae in omni brachio.	 But the veins which are bled in the arms are five in each arm.
Vna earum est Cephalica, et est ex latere syluestri: et nominat eam uulgus uenam capitis.	 One of them is called the cephalic vein and it comes from the outer side; and the common people name it the head vein.  />
Et Fusca.	 And the dark one.
Et est Media uena, et est composita ex ramo Basilicae, et ramo Cephalicae: et nominat eam uulgus uenam corporis.	 And it is the median vein and it is formed from a branch of the basilic vein and a branch of the cephalic vein; and the common people call it the body vein.
Et Basilica, et est posita in latere domestico: et nominatur etiam Titillicaris.	 And the basilic vein, which is situated on the inner side, and is also called the tickler.
Et nominat eam uulgus uenam uentris.	 And the common people call it the belly vein.
Et Funis brachii, et est posita super focile: et est illa in qua phlebotomatur, et est illa quae apparet supra pollicem appatitione manifesta.	 And the cord of the arm, which is situated over the axilla; and that is the one which is bled, and it appears clearly above the thumb.
Et Saluatella: et est uena quae est inter annularem et minimum: et sunt ei duo rami.	 And the little saver: and it is a vein between the ring finger and the little finger, and there are two branches of it.
Et in crure et in pede sunt tres uenae.	 And in the leg and foot there are three veins.  />  />  />
Vna earum est quae est sub pollicis curuatura ex latere syluestri.	 One of them is the one which is under the arch of the thumb on the outer side.  />  />
Et secunda est Saphena: et locus eius est apud calcaneum ex latere domestico.	 And the second one is the saphenous vein, and its location is near the heel on the inner side.
Et uena Nesse: et locus eius est apud calcaneum ex latere syluestri.	 And the nessian vein; and its place is near the heel on the outer side.
Et in crure alio sunt tres uenae similes illis.	 And in the other leg there are three veins similar to those.
¶ De phlebotomia duarum uenarum post Aures.	 ¶ About the bleeding of two veins behind the ears.
Phlebotomiae uero duarum uenarum quae sunt post Aures, iuuamentum est ad catarros antiquos, et hemigraneam, et sahafati, et ulcera capitis mala antiqua.	 However, the bleeding of two veins that are behind the ears is beneficial for old coughs, and headaches, and sahafati, and long-standing bad sores on the head.
Et qualitas phlebotomandi eam est secundum quod narro.	 And the manner of bloodletting it is as I will tell you.
Et est, ut radatur caput infirmi: et fricetur occipitium eius in loco duarum uenarum cum panno aspero fricatione bona.	 And it is done by shaving the head of the patient; and his occipital region where the two veins are located should be rubbed with a rough cloth using good friction.
Deinde stringat infirmus collum suum cum uitta, donec appareant duae uenae.	 Then the patient should tie their neck with a band, until the two veins appear.
Et loca earum sunt post Aures in duobus locis depressis capitis.	 And their locations are behind the ears in the two depressed areas of the head.
Quaere ergo eas digito tuo, et ubi sentis pulsum earum sub digito tuo, illic signa cum encaustro.	 Seek them therefore with your finger, and where you feel their pulse under your finger, mark that spot with encaustic paint.
Deinde accipe phlebotomum cultellarem, et est ille qui dicitur Incidens.	 Then take the bloodletting knife, which is called the incisor.
Deinde intromitte ipsum sub uena in cute, donec perueniat phlebotomus ad os.	 Then insert it under the vein into the skin, until the bloodletter reaches the mouth of the vein.
Deinde eleua manum tuam cum uena et cute ad superiora, et incide uenam cum cute incisione incidente.	 Then lift your hand with the vein and skin upward, and cut the vein with the skin using an incising cut.
Et sit longitudo incisionis quantitas duorum digitorum iunctorum, aut circiter illud: et fac exire ex sanguine quantum uis.	 And let the length of the incision be two fingers' breadths joined together, or about that: and allow as much blood to flow out as you wish.
Deinde stringe eam cum puluillis, et dimitte eam, donec sanetur.	 Then tie it with small bandages, and leave it until it heals.
Et iam praecessit in principio libri incisio earum, et ipsarum cauterizatio.	 And now at the beginning of the book there has been explained the cutting of them and their own cauterization.
¶ De phlebotomia duarum Arteriarum in timporibus.	 ¶ On bloodletting the two temporal arteries.
Duarum uero Arteriarum quae sunt in duobus timporibus phlebotomiae iuuamentum, est ad hemigraneam antiquam: et sodam prauam, et obtalmiam assiduam: et cursum superfluitatum effusarum acutarum ad oculos.	 The bloodletting of the two arteries in the temples is beneficial for chronic migraine; and for recurrent dizziness; and for persistent headache; and for the flow of acute discharges to the eyes. ■
Et qualitas phlebotomandi eas est secundum quod narro tibi.	 And the manner of bloodletting them is as I will tell you.
Stringat infirmus collum suum multum, donec appareant duae uenae sensui apparitione manifesta: et demonstretur pulsus earum sub digito tuo.	 Let the patient tighten their neck strongly, until the two veins become clearly visible to the touch; and let their pulse be felt under your finger. ■ ■
Tunc enim signa cum encaustro.	 Then mark it with encaustic paint.
Deinde eleua cutem desuper uenam ad superiora cum digito tuo indice, et intromitte phlebotomum incidentem desubtus, et eleua uenam ad superiora.	 Then lift up the skin with your index finger above the vein and insert a lancet underneath it, and lift up the vein above.
Et incide eam, sicut fecisti in duabus uenis aliis: et fac currere ex sanguine secundum quantitatem necessitatis tuae.	 And cut it, as you did with the two other veins: and let the blood flow according to your need.
Deinde solue coartationem infirmi, et pone digitum tuum super uenam hora una.	 Then loosen the binding of the patient, and place your finger over the vein for one hour.
Postea pone super ipsam cotum et puluillos, et stringe ipsum desuper constrictione forti: et dimitte ipsam, donec sanetur.	 Then put a cloth and bandages on it and bind it tightly above; and leave it until it heals.
Et iam praecessit rememoratio earum, et ipsarum incisio, et earum extractio in principio libri.	 And now the description of them, their cutting, and their extraction has been mentioned at the beginning of this book.
¶ De phlebotomia uenae frontis post phlebotomiam Cephalicae.	 About phlebotomy of the forehead vein after cephalic phlebotomy.
Iuuamentum uero phlebotomiae uenae frontis est post phlebotomiam Cephalicae, ad aegritudines faciei antiquas: et ad hemigraneam, et rubedinem: et ulcera foeda.	 The benefit of phlebotomy of the forehead vein is after cephalic phlebotomy for old facial diseases, and for migraine, and redness, and foul ulcers.
Et qualitas phlebotomiae eius est, secundum quod narro tibi.	 And its quality is as I tell you.
Coartet infirmus collum suum cum uitta, donec appareat uena.	 Let the patient bind their neck with a band until the vein appears.
Deinde accipe instrumentum quod nominatur Fossorium.	 Then take the instrument called a scarifier. ¶
Cuius haec est forma.	 Whose form is this.
Pone acumen eminens quod est in capite Fossorii super ipsam uenam, et percute super ipsum cum pectine, aut cum re alia in modo eius: et dimitte sanguinem currere secundum quantitatem quam uis.	 Place the projecting point of the scarifier on the vein and strike it with a comb or something similar, allowing the blood to flow according to your will.
Deinde solue perforationem infirmi, et stringe eam, donec sanetur.	 Then loosen the patient's binding and bind it until it heals.
Et quandoque aperitur cum phlebotomo lato.	 Sometimes it is opened with a wide lancet.
Verumtamen non oportet, ut sit phlebotomus acutae extremitatis, sicut reliqui phlebotomi, imo sit latae extremitatis.	 However, it should not be a sharp-pointed lancet like the others; rather, it should have a broad point.
Et phlebotoma eam secundum transuersionem: quoniam os est propinquum: et fortasse in eo frangetur phlebotomus quando est subtilis.	 And cut the lancet according to the direction of the vein, because the mouth is nearby; and perhaps a thin lancet will break when it is there. ¶ ¶
¶ De phlebotomia Venarum in duobus Lachrymalibus.	 On bleeding veins in both tear ducts.
Iuuamentum autem duarum Venarum quae sunt in duobus Lachrymalibus duorum oculorum, est ad oculum ex scabie et rubedine: et sebel in oculo, et aegritudinibus faciei.	 The affliction of the two veins that are in the two tear ducts of both eyes is for eye disease from scabies and redness: it causes blindness in the eye and facial pain.
Et qualitas phlebotomiae earum est, ut stringat infirmus collum suum cum uitta.	 And the method of bleeding them is that the patient tightens his own neck with a cord.
Deinde phlebotoma eas: et tu sis stans super caput eius.	 Then perform the bloodletting on these veins, and you should be standing over their head.
Et fiat phlebotomia secundum transuersum ad longitudinem parum, cum phlebotomo paruo, lato parumper, nam in loco non est caro.	 And let the bloodletting be done transversely along its length a little bit, with a small fleam, wide a little bit, for there is no flesh in that place.
Si enim phlebotomus est subtilis extremitatis, fortasse frangitur.	 For if the fleam is too fine at the tip, it might break.
Deinde fac currere ex sanguine quantum est tibi necesse.	 Then let as much blood flow out as you deem necessary.
Et pone super eas cotum, et stringe eas nocte una, et solue eas.	 And place a bandage over them, and bind them for one night, and then remove the bindings.
¶ De phlebotomia uenarum Nasi.	 ¶ On bleeding the veins of the nose.
Venae autem Nasi phlebotomia, est conferens ad febrem acutam, et sodam uehementem, et aegritudines faciei, sicut hemigraneam, et rubedinem quae accidit in facie: praecipue quando est antiqua.	 The veins of the nose are beneficial for acute fever, severe headache, and facial pain, such as migraine and facial redness, especially when chronic.
Et qualitas phlebotomiae eius est, ut stringat infirmus collum suum.	 And the method of bleeding them is that the patient tightens his own neck. xspace
Deinde tene nasum eius manu tua sinistra, et accipe phlebotomum subtilem, longum: et fige eum in medio leporis ipsius, inter illud quod distinguit nasum secundum rectitudinem.	 Then hold the patient's nose with your left hand, and take a fine, long fleam, and insert it into the middle of the lip between the two parts that divide the nose along its length.
Quoniam uena non apparet sensui illic, et quia sanguis incipit fluere statim.	 Because the vein is not visible or palpable there, and because the blood begins to flow immediately. xspace ething
Et oportet, ut ultimes manum tuam cum phlebotomo parumper: et facias currere ex sanguine secundum necessitatem tuam.	 And you must hold your hand with the fleam a little bit, and let as much blood flow out as necessary. xspace ething ething ething ething ething ething
Deinde liga ipsam nocte una.	 Then bandage it for one night.
Ipsa enim restauratur uelociter.	 For it recovers quickly.
¶ De phlebotomia uenarum Guidegi.	 About venous bloodletting of Guy.
Duarum uero Guidegi phlebotomiae iuuamentum, est ad constrictionem anhelitus, et incaeptionem leprae, et aegritudines melancholicas, et impetiginem et ulcera mala, et corrodentibus, id est, herpetibus estiomenis.	 The two bloodlettings of Guy are beneficial for constriction of shortness of breath, the onset of leprosy, melancholic diseases, impetigo, and bad ulcers, as well as for corrodents, that is, herpetic eczema.
Et qualitas phlebotomiae earum est ut stringat infirmus sub utrisque in collo suo cum ligamento: et stet artifex super caput infirmi, et infirmus sit sedens super sedem.	 And the method of these bloodlettings is for the patient to tighten both his veins under his collarbone with a ligature; and let the physician stand over the head of the patient, while the patient sits on a stool.
Deinde phlebotoma uenam ad longitudinem phlebotomia ampla parumper.	 Then the phlebotomist should cut the vein for bloodletting slightly longer than usual.
Deinde extrahe ex sanguine quantitatem temperatam, aut secundum illud quod uides ex necessitate quae est ad illud.	 Then draw from the blood a measured amount, or as much as is necessary for that purpose.
Deinde fac similiter de uena alia.	 Then do the same with the other vein.
Postea solue ligamentum, et stringe duas uenas strictura media: ut non praefocetur infirmus.	 Afterward, release the ligature and tighten both veins moderately so that the patient is not overly constricted.
Et dimitte eam usque mane.	 And leave it thus until morning.
Sanatur enim uulnus.	 For the wound will heal.
¶ De phlebotomia uenarum Algeberich.	 About venous bloodletting of Al-Ghafiqi.
Venae autem Algeberich phlebotomiae iuuamentum est: quia confert ad alcolam in ore, et corruptionem gingiuae: et ulcera mala: et fissuras labiorum, et ulcera mala, etiam quae sunt in naso, et in circumitu eius.	 The bloodletting of the veins of Al-Ghafiqi is beneficial because it helps with a sore throat, corruption of the gums, bad ulcers, and fissures of the lips, as well as bad ulcers that are also on the nose and its surroundings.
Et qualitas phlebotomiae earum est, ut facias sedere infirmum coram te: et stringe collum eius cum uitta.	 And the method of these bloodlettings is to have the patient sit before you and tie his neck with a cord.
Deinde reuolue labium eius, et aspice ad duas uenas: quarum una est a dextera labii, et secunda a sinistra eius: et demonstratio utriusque est per nigredinem ambarum.	 Then turn his lip and look at the two veins, one of which is on the right side of the lip and the other on the left, and you can identify each by the blackness of both.
Et illud uerum est: quia in circumitu earum sunt uenae minutae, nigrae.	 And this is true because around them are small, dark veins.
Incide ergo utramque incisione incidente.	 Therefore, cut both with a single incision. (): 100)
Si autem dubitatio est super te, et non scis quae earum est: tunc intende ad incisionem maioris earum, et ipsarum manifestiorem.	 If however there is doubt about which one it is and you do not know which one it is, then pay attention to the larger of them and the more obvious.
Et similiter fac de duabus uenis quae sunt in labio superiore: et plurimum quidem currit consuetudo cum eo: et incide duas uenas quae sunt in labio inferiori.	 And do the same with the two veins that are in the upper lip, for this is the most common practice; and cut the two veins that are in the lower lip.
¶ De phlebotomia Venae sub lingua post Cephalicae phlebotomiam.	 ¶ On bloodletting: After the phlebotomy of the cephalic vein, the veins under the tongue should be bled.
Duarum uero Venarum quae sunt sub lingua phlebotomiae iuuamentum: est, quod phlebotomia Cephalicae est ad praefocationes quae sunt in gutture, et aegritudinem uuulae, et aegritudines oris.	 The advantage of the bloodletting of these two veins that are under the tongue is that the phlebotomy of the cephalic vein is for throat diseases and also for mouth disease and other oral diseases.
Et qualitas phlebotomandi eas est, ut sedeat infirmus inter manus tuas coram sole: et eleualinguam eius, et aspice sub lingua a latere eius uno uenam, et a latere eius alio uenam: et color utriusque decliuis ad nigredinem.	 And the manner of bleeding them is to have the patient sit between your hands in front of the sun, and lift up his tongue, and look under his tongue on one side a vein, and on the other side another vein, and the color of both leans towards blackness.
Phlebotoma ergo utramque: et custodi, ne ultimes manum tuam in phlebotomando eas.	 Therefore, bleed both; and be careful not to finish bleeding them with your hand.
Nam sub eius sunt arteriae, et fortasse accidet fluxus sanguinis ex illis arteriis.	 For under these [veins] are arteries, and perhaps a flow of blood from those arteries may occur.
¶ De tribus Venis in cubito.	 ¶ On the three veins in the elbow.
Venae autem tres quae phlebotomantur in cubito, sunt in quarum phlebotomia cucurrit consuetudo in omnibus hominibus.	 And the three veins that are bled in the elbow, the bloodletting of these is commonly practiced on all people.
Et phlebotomia earum fit secundum duos modos.	 Their bloodletting is done according to two methods.
Aut pungendo cum phlebotomo myrtino lato: aut oliuari ad subtilitatem decliui: aut secando cum phlebotomo cultellari, et est Alnesil.	 Either by pricking with a broad myrtle bloodletting needle, or with an olive wood needle that has been planed to sharpness; or by cutting with a surgical knife, which is called Alnesil.
Et haec est forma eius.	 And this is its form.
Sic Alnesil est, quod conuenit ad sectionem.	 This is the Alnesil, which is suitable for cutting. 
Et ex eis sunt species latae, et subtiles secundum amplitudinem uenarum et stricturam earum Forma phlebotomi myrtini sit lata, sicut uides.	 And of these there are broad and fine types according to the size and narrowness of the veins. The form of the myrtle bloodletting needle should be broad, as you see.
Et conuenit ad aperiendas uenas concauas, plenas, procedentes, apparentes, grossas, et illas quae continent sanguinem grossum, turbidum.	 And it is fitting for opening hollow, full, prominent, large veins, and those that contain thick, turbid blood.
Et iste phlebotomus est minoris latitudinis, et subtilioris extreminatis.	 And this phlebotomy is of lesser width and more delicate in its ends.
Et conuenit ad phlebotomiam uenarum subtilium, quae continent sanguinem subtilem citrinum	 And it is fitting for phlebotomy of subtle veins, which contain thin citrine blood.
¶ De phlebotomia Basilicae.	 On Phlebotomy of the Basilic Vein.
Basilicae autem quae est una harum trium uenarum phlebotomiae iuuamentum est.	 However, the basilica, which is one of these three veins for phlebotomy, is useful.
Quia extrahit sanguinem ex aegritudinibus, quae sunt sub gutture et collo, ex eo quod sequitur pectus, et uentrem: et conuenit phlebotomatori cum phlebotomat eam, ut caueat, et sit super timorem ex ea nam sub ea est arteria.	 Because it extracts blood from illnesses that are under the throat and neck, since it follows the chest and belly: and it is fitting for the phlebotomist to be cautious when he phlebotomizes it, because of fear of it, for under it there is an artery.
Si ergo errat, et addit in punctura phlebotomi, incidet illam arteriam, et accidet fluxus sanguinis.	 If therefore he errs and adds to the puncture of the phlebotomy, he will cut that artery, and a flow of blood will occur.
Quapropter oportet, ne phlebotomet eam cum phlebotomo pungente: imo sit secans cum Alnesil.	 Therefore it is necessary that he not phlebotomize her with the phlebotomy needle; rather let him cut with alnacil. 
Quod si non apparet Basilica apparitione manifesta, tunc oportet, ut alienes ipsam, et permuteris ad aliam, aut quaeras aliquem ramum eius: aut phlebotomes loco eius Funem brachii.	 If the basilic vein does not appear clearly, then it is necessary to remove it and replace it with another one, or look for some of its branches; or in place of that vein, the vein of the arm.
Ipsa enim est manifesta, et seca eam cum phlebotomo Anesil, sicut diximus.	 For it is clear, and cut it with a phlebotomy needle, as we said.
Si autem uis phlebotomiam ipsius eiusdem, tunc oportet ante stricturam brachii, ut tangas locum, donec cognoscas locum pulsus.	 But if you want to phlebotomize that same one, then it is necessary before the constriction of the arm, to touch the place until you know the place of the pulse.
Deinde signa super locum cum encaustro, postea brachium, et seca uenam sectione concaua cum phlebotomo Alnesil, sicut diximus.	 Then mark the place with cautery, afterward constrict the arm, and cut the vein with a concave section using the phlebotomy needle called alnacil, as we said. 
Et caue ne cadat percussio per spacium a loco arteriae.	 And be careful that the incision does not fall into the space of the artery.
Et quando uides, cum tu stringis ligamen, inflationem in loco quem signasti cum encaustro, tunc illa inflatio est inflatio arteriae: deuita ergo eam.	 And when you see, as you tie the ligature, swelling in the place marked with cautery, then that swelling is of the artery; therefore, avoid it.
Quod si uides sanguinem apud phlebotomiam salire, sicut urina pueri, et est sanguis subtilis, rubeus: tunc scias, quia est ex sanguine arteriae.	 If you see blood spurt at the site of venipuncture, as in a child's urine, and it is fine and red; then know that it is from the artery.
Tunc ergo propera, et pone digitum tuum super ipsum spacio longo, deinde aufer digitum tuum.	 Then hasten, and place your finger on it for a long time, and afterwards remove your finger.
Si ergo abscinditur sanguis (multotiens namque abscinditur) tunc stringe brachium, et dimitte ipsum: et caueat infirmus a motione eius: et sit super timorem eius.	 Therefore, if the blood is cut (for it is often cut), then tie off the arm and leave it; and let the patient beware of moving it; and let him be in fear of it.
Et non moueat ipsum diebus aliquot, donec sanetur.	 And do not move it for several days until it heals.
Si autem non abscinditur sanguis, et uincit te: et non est tibi praesens in momento tuo medicina, tunc incide arteriam, si apparet tibi.	 But if the blood does not spurt and it overcomes you; and you do not have a remedy at hand, then cut the artery, if it appears to you.  ​
Nam extremitates eius contrahuntur, et abscinditur sanguis.	 For its extremities contract, and the blood spurts out.
Aut accipe corticem fistici, et finde eum: accipe medietatem unam, et stringe eam super locum uenae strictura decenti, cum ligamento et puluillis usque ad diem alium.	 Or take the bark of a fig tree and pound it; take half of it, and tie it over the vein with a suitable bandage, along with a thread and cotton wool until another day.
Tunc si abscinditur sanguis, est bonum.	 Then if the blood spurts out, that is good.
Et si non: tunc cura ipsum cum eo cuius praecessit rememoratio ex loco puluerum abscindentium fluxum sanguinis: et abscisio sanguinis eius non est difficilis in pluribus dispositionibus, propter locum paruum uulneris, et possibilitatem ligamenti ex brachio.	 And if it does not spurt out, then treat him as described above for the dust that causes blood to flow; and its bleeding is not difficult in many conditions because of the small wound and the possibility of tying off from the arm.
¶ De phlebotomia uenae Fuscae.	 § On Venipuncture of the Dark Vein.
Venae autem Fuscae phlebotomiae iuuamentum est, quod trahit sanguinem ex superiori parte capitis, et inferiore corporis: propterea, quia est composita ex ramo Basilicae, et ramo Cephalicae, sicut diximus.	 Venipuncture of the dark vein is beneficial because it draws blood from the upper part of the head and the lower part of the body; for this reason, it is composed of a branch of the basilica and a branch of the cephalic, as we have said.  ​
Et conuenit phlebotomanti eam, ut sit super timorem ex phlebotomia eius, nam sub ea est neruus.	 And it is suitable for the person drawing blood that they be without fear of bleeding her, for under her is a nerve.
Si ergo addit in punctura phlebotomi, et inuenit neruum, accidit in ea stupor, et difficilis fit sanatio eius, et fortasse non sanatur penitus.	 Therefore, if he adds to the incision for bleeding and finds a nerve, it happens that she becomes stunned, and her healing becomes difficult, and perhaps she does not heal at all.
Et iste neruus multotiens apparet sensui.	 And this nerve often appears to the sense of touch.
Si autem occultatur in quibusdam hominibus, et est subtilis, et non ostenditur: tunc oportet ut ponas phlebotomiam tuam qua eam phlebotomas, sectionem cum Alnesil, et deuita neruum cum fortitudine tua.	 But if in some people it is hidden and subtle and does not show itself, then you should place your bleeding incision where you will bleed her, with the section of Alnesil, and avoid the nerve with your strength.
Quod si uena est inter duos neruos, tunc finde uenam in longitudine.	 If a vein is between two nerves, then find the vein along its length.
¶ De uena Cephalica.	 About the cephalic vein.
Phlebotomiae autem uenae Cephalicae iuuamentum est, quia attrahit sanguinem ex capite, et confert ad aegritudines oculorum.	 The benefit of bleeding the cephalic vein is that it draws blood from the head and helps with diseases of the eyes.
Et oportet in hac uena proprie, si uis, ut phlebotomes eam pungendo cum phlebotomo oliuari, aut cum phlebotomo myrtino: quoniam est saluior uenarum omnium, quoniam non est subea arteria, neque neruus.	 And it is necessary in this vein, if you wish, to bleed her by pricking with an olive-wood lancet or a myrtle-wood lancet, because it is the safest of all veins, because there is no artery beneath it, nor a nerve.  />
Verumtamen conuenit tibi apud phlebotomiam, ut deuites cum phlebotomo caput lacerti tantum, et quaeras locum leniorem: et non nocet ei, si non inuenitur cum percussione prima, ut iteretur super eam cum phlebotomia aliquotiens.	 Nevertheless, it is suitable for you when bleeding, that you avoid with the lancet only the head of the biceps, and seek a softer place: and it will not harm her if it is not found on the first strike, to repeat the bleeding over her several times.  />  />
Verumtamen fortasse apostematur in quibusdam hominibus quando non phlebotomatur in percussione prima, sed non nocet ei illud apostema in aliquo.	 Nevertheless, perhaps it swells in some people when not bleed on the first strike, but that swelling does not harm them in any way.
¶ De utilitate Phlebotomiae, et cautelis in ea obseruandis.	 About the usefulness of bleeding and the precautions to be observed in it.
Qualitas autem Phlebotomiae, et accidentia eius ex ea, in cuius rectificatione oportet te cogitare.	 The nature and effects of bleeding are from that which you should consider for its correction.
Primum ergo illius est de quo oportet ut scias, quod phlebotomia non administratur, nisi in conseruatione sanitatis, et perseuerantia eius, et cautela ab aduentu aegritudinum.	 First, therefore, is what you should know: that bloodletting is not done except for the preservation of health, and its persistence, and caution against the onset of illnesses.
Et ut fiat phlebotomia in una uenarum trium quae sunt in cubito, scilicet Cephalica, et Fusca, et Basilica.	 And let bloodletting be done in one of the three veins that are in the elbow, namely the Cephalic, the Fusca, and the Basilic.
Et ut fiat phlebotomia in principio Veris super ieiunium, in uere, et aestate: et autumno, et hyeme post comestionem, quando apparent significationes repletionis.	 And let bloodletting be done at the beginning of spring on an empty stomach; in summer and autumn after eating, when there are signs of fullness.
Et fiat phlebotomia in die primo, aut in tertio, postquam praeterierint de die tres horae.	 And let bloodletting be done on the first or third day, after three hours have passed from midday.
Phlebotomia autem quae administratur in aegritudinibus, non habet horam determinatam: sed quando prouocat conuenientia et necessitas ad illud, in nocte, aut die, et in omni hora, et in omni tempore.	 However, bloodletting that is administered for illnesses does not have a fixed time, but whenever the circumstances and necessity demand it, whether at night or day, at any hour, and in any season.
Et non oportet, ut phlebotomentur pueri, donec ueniant super eos quatuordecim anni.	 And children should not be bled until they reach fourteen years of age.
Neque phlebotometur mulier praegnans, nisi a mense quarto usque ad septimum.	 Nor should a pregnant woman be bled except from the fourth to the seventh month.
Neque phlebotomentur senes, qui iam pertransierunt sexaginta annos.	 Nor should elderly people who have passed sixty years be bled.  />
Cum ergo aliquis uult phlebotomari propter quemcumque modum sit: oportet, ut mundificet intestina sua ante phlebotomiam cum clisteri leni, si in eis est stercus multum retentum: ut non attrahant uenae apud phlebotomiam ex intestinis superfluitates putridas nocentes membris principalibus.	 Therefore, when someone wants to be bled for any reason, it is necessary that they cleanse their bowels before the bloodletting with a gentle enema, if there is a lot of retained feces in them, so that the veins do not draw putrid harmful substances from the intestines during the bloodletting into the principal members.  />  />
Neque phlebotometur patiens toctina, id est, satietatem nauseatiuam: neque crapulatus, neque euadens ab ebrietate, donec remoueatur illud ab eis.	 Nor should a patient be bled who is suffering from nausea, or drunkenness, or recovering from drunkenness, until that condition is removed from them.
Neque infirmus cum hydropisi.	 Nor [should one bleed] a sick person with dropsy.
Et caueatur phlebotomia iterum post colicam passionem, et uomitum, et fluxum uentris, et multiplicationem coitus, et laboris, et exercitii, et uigiliarum, et ieiunii, et omnis quod dissoluit uirtutem ex re corporea aut animali.	 And one should avoid bleeding again after an attack of colic, vomiting, diarrhea, excessive sexual activity, labor, exercise, sleeplessness, fasting, or anything else that diminishes strength from the body or animal nature.
Deinde considera in subtilitate humorum ante illud, si sanguis est grossus cum cibis et potibus, et medicinis: si possibile est ei illud.	 Then consider the subtlety of the humors before that: if the blood is thick with foods and drinks, and medicines; if it is possible for him to do so.
Deinde introeat balneum, si non prohibet ipsum aliquid: aut exercitetur aliquo exercitio, ut subtilietur sanguis.	 Then let him enter the bath, unless something prevents him; or he should exercise in some way to refine the blood.
Et pone phlebotomiam eius in pectore, circa tertiam diei, sicut diximus: et conare, ut euacuetur pectus eius illa die ex omnibus accidentibus animalibus malis: sicut angustia, et ira, et timor: et ex omnibus accidentibus corporeis, sicut labor, et poena, et superfluicoitus, et illis similia.	 And place his phlebotomy in the chest, around the third hour of the day, as we have said; and strive that his chest be emptied that day of all evil accidents of the soul, such as anxiety, anger, and fear; and of all bodily accidents, such as labor, pain, superfluities, and similar things.
Et sedi suae faciat esse praesentes res cum quarum usu cucurrit consuetudo hominum ex aromaticitate, et odoramento, et tripudio et similibus illis per quantitatem possibilitatis.	 And he should have present those things whose use customarily runs in the lives of men for their fragrance, scent, and merriment, and similar things, according to what is possible.
Deinde sedeat phlebotomator super puluinari, quod sit altius quam puluinar phlebotomandi: postea extrahat brachium suum, et fricet ipsum phlebotomator manu sua bis, aut ter.	 Then let the phlebotomist sit on a chair that is higher than the chair of the one being bled; then he should draw out his arm and rub it with his hand twice or thrice.
Deinde stringat ligamentum cum corrigia, et inuoluat eam bis.	 Then let him tie the band with a cord and wrap it twice.
Et sit strictura temperata, quoniam strictura quando est inaequalis, aut per superfluitatem in strictura, tunc prohibet cursum sanguinis: aut in mollificatione, tunc etiam prohibet cursum sanguinis.	 And let the tightness be moderate, for if the tightness is uneven or too tight, then it prevents the flow of blood; and if it is too loose, then it also prevents the flow of blood.
Deinde post stricturam oportet, ut fricet phlebotomandus manus suas simul adinuicem, donec inflentur uenae, et declarentur sensui.	 Then after tying, it is necessary for the one being bled to rub his hands together until the veins swell and become apparent to the touch.
Deinde abstergat phlebotomator phlebotomum cum pauco oleo, antiquo proprie.	 Then let the phlebotomist wipe the place of the bleeding with a small amount of old oil properly.
Deinde ponat digitum suum indicem manus sinistrae super ipsam uenam sub loco cuius phlebotomiam uult, parum: ut non fugiat uena, et cassetur percussio.	 Then let him place his left index finger slightly above the vein in the place where he wants to make the incision, so that the vein does not flee and the strike is not missed.
Quoniam ex uenis est quam inuenis sicut chordam fugientem apud phlebotomiam: et ex eis est quae est plena uentositate: et quando ponis phlebotomum super eam, contrahitur sub phlebotomo, et decipitur phlebotomator, et non aperit phlebotomus uenam: et si aperit eam, est stricta: propter illud ergo oportet, ut firmetur phlebotomator, et sit sollicitus in his rebus omnibus.	 For there are veins that flee like a string during phlebotomy, and there are those filled with air; and when you place the incision on them, they contract under the incision, and deceive the phlebotomist, and the incision does not open the vein; and if it opens it, it is constricted. Therefore, it is necessary for the phlebotomist to be firm and attentive in all these matters.
Deinde deponat phlebotomum.	 Then put aside the phlebotomy.
Si ergo aperitur uena ex uice una, tunc bonum est.	 If, therefore, the vein is opened with one stroke, then it is good.
Et si non, tunc itera illud uice alia sub illo loco parum, aut supra ipsum cum festinatione: si non apostematur locus.	 And if not, then repeat it with another stroke under that place, or above the same with haste; if the place does not suppurate.
Quod si apostematur, aut expauescit infirmus, tunc dimitte eum die, aut duobus diebus: et non stringat ligamentum.	 If it suppurates, or if the patient is alarmed, then leave him for a day, or two days; and do not let the ligature be too tight.
Fortasse enim attrahet apostema calidum.	 For perhaps a hot abscess will be drawn out.
Neque ingrediatur balneum.	 Let him not enter a bath. 》 Neque comedat cibum nimis frigidum, nec calidum, nec siccum, nec umidum: sed mediocriter temperatum.
Deinde iteret phlebotomiam, si amat.	 Then let him repeat the phlebotomy, if he wishes.
Quod si apertio est parua, aut currit sanguis subtiliter: et times ut non egrediatur ex sanguine quantitas quam uis: tunc itera phlebotomum in foramine ipso secundum rectitudinem, et adde in operatione parum.	 If the opening is small or if the blood flows finely and you fear that not enough will come out, then repeat the phlebotomy in the same hole along its length, and add a little to the operation.
Et fac illud cum festinatione, antequam apostemetur locus, apostematus enim locus est in multis hominibus apud operationem paruam.	 And do this with haste, before the place suppurates, for a suppurating place is common among many people during a small operation.
Si ergo uides ipsum iam apostematum, tunc non iteres super ipsum omnino, non enim excusat apud te aliquid.	 If you see that it has already suppurated, then do not repeat at all on top of it, for nothing will be excused to you.
Et pone super ipsum aliquid ex faece olei: quoniam alleuiat cursum sanguinis.	 And put some olive residue on it, for it will help the flow of blood. 》 Hoc faciet medicus in omni operatione sanguis.
Et est melior in hoc loco quam oleum ipsum, et quam reliqua olea.	 And this is better in this place than oil itself and any other kind of oil.
Et similiter administra faecem olei in omni phlebotomia tua, qua phlebotomas uenas apud prohibitionem cursus sanguinis: et faciunt illud tyriaca alfarach, et sagzenea, quando ponitur ex una earum super locum.	 And likewise administer olive residue in every phlebotomy where you forbid the flow of blood; and they do this with theriac, with alfarach, and with saffron, when any one of them is placed on the spot.
Sanguis enim subtiliatur et resoluitur, quando est grossus.	 For blood becomes thin and dissolves when it is thick.
Quod si accidat in loco phlebotomiae apostema magnum, nam multotiens accidit, praecipue ei qui non est phlebotomatus nisi uice illa, aut est apertio uenae parua, tunc propera et pone super locum spongiam infusam in aqua et sale, calefacta parumper: et stringe eam hora una: quoniam soluitur.	 But if a large abscess occurs in the place of phlebotomy - for this often happens, especially to those who are not bled except on that occasion or whose vein opening is small - then hasten and put a sponge soaked in salt water over the spot, heated slightly; and let it remain there for an hour, for it dissolves. 》 Quod si non soluitur, tunc scinde eam et pone aliud super ipsum: quoniam et illud faciet idem.
Et oportet, ut facias illud post exitum sanguinis ex uena ipsa, cum complemento sui, aut ex uena alia.	 And it is necessary that you do this after the flow of blood from that vein, with its completion, or from another vein.
Quod si remanet in loco post dies aliquid nigredinis, aut uiriditatis, non nocet illud: et si uis, pone super ipsum aliquid aloe, aut myrrhae solutorum: aut aliquid ex succo menthastri, id est, calamenti aut simile illius.	 If some blackness or greenness remains in the place after several days, it does not harm; and if you wish, put something of dissolved aloe or myrrh on it, or some juice of mint, that is, calamint or something similar to it.
Et multotiens quidem accidunt apostemata et eminentiae apud phlebotomiam Basilicae.	 And indeed, many times pustules and swellings occur at the basilic vein phlebotomy.
Pone ergo manum tuam super ipsam, tunc si inuenis molliciem apud compressionem tuam super ipsam, tunc illa eminentia est mala.	 Therefore, place your hand on it; if you find softness upon pressing it, then that swelling is bad.
Caue ergo, ut ponas super eam aliquid ex eo quod diximus.	 Be careful not to put anything of what we mentioned on it.
Nam fortasse fluet ex ea sanguis arteriae.	 For perhaps blood from the artery will flow out from there.
Sed fac emplastrum ei cum eo in quo est stipticitas, ut induretur locus.	 But make a plaster for it with what has an astringent property, so that the place may harden.
Deinde cura ipsum cum reliqua curatione, donec sanetur.	 Then care for him with the rest of the treatment until he is healed.
Et oportet, ut extrahas omni homini ex sanguine secundum quantitatem uirtutis suae.	 And it is necessary that you extract blood from every man according to his strength.
Et quod apparet ex colore uincente super sanguinem.	 And it appears from the prevailing color of the blood.
Nam sanguis si est niger, tunc dimitte ipsum exire, donec rubeat: et similiter si uides ipsum grossum: tunc dimitte eum, donec subtilietur: et similiter si est acutus, donec auferatur acuitas eius.	 For if the blood is black, then allow it to flow until it turns red; and similarly if you see that it is thick, then let it flow until it becomes thin; and similarly if it is sharp, until its sharpness is removed.
Et oportet ei qui est plenus, fortis, et indiget extractione sanguinis uice una, ut amplificetur phlebotomia uenae, et sit phlebotomus latus: et in eo qui est debilis, sit econtrario illius.	 And it is necessary that he who is full, strong, and needs bloodletting once a year should have an ample bloodletting of the vein, and the phlebotomy should be broad; and in him who is weak, it should be the opposite.
Et oportet, ut extrahat ipsum in uicibus, et ut sit foramen strictum: et melius quod administratur in phlebotomia uenae est, ut sit transuersa sectio, non punctura.	 And it is necessary that he should be bled at intervals, and the opening should be narrow; and better than what is done in bloodletting by venesection is a transverse cut, not a prick.
Et iste modus phlebotomiae est saluus a fluxu sanguinis, et ab incisione nerui: et est laudabilior, et saluior quam phlebotomia per latitudinem et longitudinem.	 And this method of bloodletting is safe from excessive bleeding and from cutting the nerve, and it is more praiseworthy and safer than bloodletting by width and length.
Et cui consueuit peruenire apud phlebotomiam syncopis, oportet ut cibes ante phlebotomiam modico pane infuso in aqua granati muzi: aut secaniabin, si est calefactus: et extrahas ei ex sanguine in tribus uicibus, aut quatuor.	 And if one is accustomed to fainting during bloodletting, it is necessary that before the bloodletting they eat a moderate amount of bread soaked in pomegranate juice or wine if it is heated; and extract from them blood in three or four times.
Et si est infrigidatae complexionis, tunc accipiat ante phlebotomiam panem infusum in syrupo miua, aut in syrupo de melle aromatizato cum speciebus, aut in syrupo aromatizato odorifero.	 And if they have a cold constitution, then before bloodletting let them eat bread soaked in apple syrup or in honey syrup flavored with spices, or in fragrant scented syrup.
Quod si accidat syncopis apud phlebotomiam, et est caussa eius exitus sanguinis multi: tunc oportet, ut sumat in potu aquam carnis, et syrupum odoriferum subtilem: et utatur aromaticitate cum algalia, et liniatur pectus eius cum ea: et utatur reliquis quae diximus in diuisione in capitulo syncopis ex euacuatione.	 But if fainting occurs during bloodletting and the cause is much blood loss, then it is necessary that they drink meat water and a subtle fragrant syrup; and let them use aromatics with algalia, and anoint their chest with it; and use the other things we have mentioned in the division of the chapter on fainting from evacuation.
Qui autem uult euentare brachium suum, et soluere sanguinem suum secundo: oportet ei cuius phlebotomia est propter euacuationem multam, et uirtus eius est debilis, ut soluat sanguinem paulatim per quantitatem uirtutis in diebus continuis.	 But whoever wants to extend their arm and release their blood a second time, if the bloodletting is for much evacuation and his strength is weak, he should release the blood gradually according to the amount of his strength over continuous days.
Qui uero uult euentare brachium suum, et soluere sanguinem suum secundo, et est corpus eius forte: tunc faciat illud post septem horas, aut nouem a phlebotomia sua prima.	 But whoever wants to extend their arm and release their blood a second time, and their body is strong, then let them do it after seven or nine hours from their first bloodletting.
Qui autem uult attrahere sanguinem ex corpore suo ad contrarium partis ad quam declinat: oportet ut euentetur ei in die secundo, aut in tertio.	 But whoever wants to draw blood from their body to the opposite side to which it inclines, they should extend themselves on the second or third day.
In cuius uero corpore est sanguis multus iam calefactus, et acuitur, et facit accidere febrem: oportet, ut egrediatur ex eo sanguis in uice una, et extrahatur ex eo quantitas multa: et amplificetur apertio usquequo accidat syncopis: postquam tu fueris conseruans omnes conditiones phlebotomiae: et ut ponas manum tuam super pulsum eius apud cursum sanguinis, ut non accidat mors loco syncopis.	 In whose body the blood is already heated and sharpened, and causes fever to happen, it is necessary that blood come out of them in one go, and a large amount be drawn from them; and the opening be widened until fainting occurs, after you have observed all the conditions of bloodletting; and place your hand on their pulse during the flow of blood, so that death does not occur instead of fainting.
Multotiens enim accidit illud, quando ignorat phlebotomator, et cadit negligentia.	 Often it happens that the phlebotomist is unaware and falls into neglect.
Et non oportet quando uis soluere brachium, et soluere sanguinem secundo, cum iam clausum sit orificium uenae, et fiat difficilis exitus sanguinis, ut prematur super ipsum cum uehementia, et curuatum extendatur uelociter.	 And it is not appropriate when one wants to release the arm and let out blood a second time, after the vein's opening has already been closed, making the exit of blood difficult, to press strongly on it with force and quickly stretch out the arm.
Nam illud est malum ualde, imo dimitte ipsum, donec phlebotometur secundo.	 For that is very bad; indeed, leave it alone until it is bled again a second time.
Aut remoue cum acuitate phlebotomi illud quod coagulatum est ex sanguine in orificio uenae, et pone super ipsum aliquid salis dissoluti in aqua.	 Or remove the clotted blood from the vein's opening with a sharp phlebotomy instrument, and place some salt dissolved in water on it.
Et pone super ipsum aliquid ex tyriaca alfaroch, aut sagzenea, et pone ipsum compressione leni, donec egrediatur sanguis.	 And place on it some of the theriac called Alfaroc or Sagzena, and cover it with a gentle bandage until the blood comes out.
Si uero iam apostemata est uena, tunc dimitte eam, et non tegas eam, donec sedetur apostema.	 But if the vein has already formed an abscess, then leave it alone and do not cover it until the abscess is settled.
Quod si necessitas prouocat ad soluendum sanguinem secundo, et non est excusatio, tunc aut phlebotoma ipsum supra illum locum, aut in brachio alio in uena alia.	 If the necessity compels one to let out blood a second time and there is no excuse, then either phlebotomize at that same place or in another arm in another vein.
Funis autem brachii phlebotomatur loco Fuscae, et Basilicae, cum non inueniuntur, et sunt occultae, quoniam est composita ex eis.	 The cord of the arm is phlebotomized at the place of the Fusca and the Basilica, when they are not found and are hidden, because it is composed from them.
Et qualitas phlebotomiae eius est, ut intromittat infirmus manum suam in aqua calida, donec rubeat focile, et appareat uena manifeste.	 And the manner of its phlebotomy is such that the patient places his hand in warm water until it becomes hot like fire and the vein appears clearly.
Deinde stringatur super ipsam cum ligamento parum constrictione media.	 Then tie a bandage around it with moderate tightness.
Deinde phlebotoma secundum transuersationem paulatim, non latitudinaliter, neque secundum longitudinem: et sit apertio ampla, et sit phlebotomia tua qua eam phlebotomas super iuncturam manus parumper.	 Then phlebotomize transversely little by little, not broadly, nor longitudinally; and let the opening be wide, and let your phlebotomy be such that you phlebotomize it a little above the wrist joint.
Quod si prohibetur exitus sanguinis, tunc itera manum in aqua calida, et dimitte sanguinem currere in aqua, donec consequaris necessitatem tuam.	 If the exit of blood is prevented, then place your hand in warm water again and let the blood run in the water until you achieve what you need.
Si autem fueris in diebus aestatis, tunc excusaris ab iteratione manus in aqua calida.	 If however you are in the days of summer, then you should avoid washing your hands frequently in hot water.
Et plurimum quidem ponitur cursus sanguinis in aqua calida in tempore hyemis.	 And indeed the course of blood is most placed in hot water in the time of winter.
Et phlebotomia huius uenae est saluior omnibus uenis, quoniam non est sub ea uena pulsatilis, neque neruus.	 And phlebotomy from this vein is safest of all veins because there is no pulsating vein beneath it nor a nerve.
Phlebotomia uero Saluatellae manus dextrae, est conferens aegritudinibus epatis.	 But the phlebotomy of the right hand’s salutary vein is beneficial for illnesses of the liver.
Et qualitas phlebotomiae eius est, ut stringas mahason manus cum ligamento, aut manu tua, postquam tu intromittis eam in aquam calidam, donec infletur uena, et demonsteretur sensui ualde.	 And the method of phlebotomy is to tightly bind the vein of the hand with a ligature or your hand after you insert it into hot water until the vein swells and becomes very noticeable. 》
Deinde phlebotoma eam transuersando.	 Then prick it transversely.
Et si incidis eam totaliter, non nocebit ei illud in aliquo.	 And if you cut it completely, it will not harm him at all.
Et conserua, ne ultimes manum tuam cum phlebotomo.	 And preserve so that you do not end your hand with the phlebotomy.
Sub ea enim sunt nerui digitorum denudati ex carne.	 For beneath it are the nerves of the fingers, exposed from the flesh.
Deinde itera manum ad aquam calidam, et dimitte currere sanguinem in ea.	 Then immerse the hand in hot water again and let the blood run into it.
Nam si tu non iteras eam in aqua calida, coagulatur sanguis in orificio uenae, et prohibetur a cursu.	 For if you do not immerse it in hot water, the blood will clot at the opening of the vein and be prevented from flowing.
Cum ergo extraxeris ex sanguine quantitatem necessitatis, tunc pone super uenam oleum et sal: ut non consolidetur uelociter.	 Therefore, when you have drawn out the necessary amount of blood, then place oil and salt on the vein so that it does not heal quickly.
Et similiter oportet, ut facias cum omni ramo stricto.	 And likewise, you should do this with every branch tied off.
Iuuamentum uero phlebotomiae eius ex manu sinistra, est: quoniam est conferens ad aegritudines splenis: et similiter fac in phlebotomia eius, sicut fecisti in secunda aequaliter.	 The benefit of this phlebotomy from the left hand is that it is beneficial for illnesses of the spleen; and likewise do so with its phlebotomy as you did previously equally.
Saphenae autem phlebotomiae iuuamentum, est ad aegritudines quae sunt in inferiori parte corporis, sicut aegritudines matricum, et retentionem menstruorum, et infirmitates renum, et ulcera coxarum et crurium antiqua, et similia ex aegritudinibus.	 The benefit of saphenous phlebotomy is for illnesses in the lower part of the body, such as illnesses of the uterus, and retention of menses, and diseases of the kidneys, and old ulcers of the hips and legs, and similar illnesses.
Et qualitas phlebotomiae eius est, ut intromittat infirmus pedem suum in aquam calidam: et faciat super ipsum fricationem, donec exuberent uenae: et liga supra iuncturam pedis cum corrigia.	 And the quality of its phlebotomy is such that the patient places his foot in warm water and makes a rubbing on it until the veins swell, and then binds above the ankle with a cord.
Et uenae quidem locus est apud calcaneum, apparens uersus pollicem: et ramificantur ex ea in facie pedis rami multi.	 And the place of the veins is at the heel, appearing towards the big toe, and many branches extend from it on the sole of the foot.
Phlebotoma ergo eam in ampliore ramo eius, aut apud calcaneum in aggregatione eius: quoniam est melius et saluius.	 Therefore, phlebotomize it in its larger branch or at the heel in its junction, for this is better and safer.
Quod si phlebotomas eam in facie pedis, tunc caue a neruis qui sunt sub ea super faciem pedis.	 But if you phlebotomize it on the sole of the foot, then be careful of the nerves that are beneath it and extend over the sole of the foot.
Et pone phlebotomiam tuam qua eam phlebotomas ex transuerso, quasi tu uelis incidere eam: et sit phlebotomus Nesil.	 And place your phlebotomy as if you want to cut it from the side, and let the phlebotomist be Nasil.
Si autem prohibetur exitus sanguinis, tunc itera pedem eius in aqua calida: et dimitte sanguinem currere in eam, donec euacuatur.	 But if the flow of blood is prevented, then immerse his foot in warm water and let the blood run into it until it is evacuated.
Quod si errat uenam phlebotomator in prima uice, tunc iteret cum phlebotomia ad superiora parumper, nam locus est saluus, et non times ex eo maliciam, quando tu caues a neruis, sicut diximus.	 But if the phlebotomist errs in the first attempt, then repeat with a little phlebotomy above, for this place is safe and you need not fear harm from it when you avoid the nerves, as we have said.  />
Et similiter cum Saphena pedis alterius aequaliter.	 And similarly with the saphenous vein of the other foot likewise.
Venae autem Sciaticae locus, sicut diximus, est apud calcaneum ex latere syluestri.	 But the place of the sciatic veins, as we have said, is at the heel on the inner side.
Et iuuamentum phlebotomiae eius est, ad dolorem anchae, quando est propter sanguinem calidum.	 And the benefit of its phlebotomy is for pain in the inguinal region when it is due to hot blood.
Et qualitas phlebotomiae eius est, ut ingrediatur infirmus balneum, et festinet: et stringe crus eius a latere anchae usque supra calcaneum quatuor digitis, cum uitta subtili longa: non enim apparet nisi propter illud.	 And the quality of its phlebotomy is such that the patient enters the bath and hurries; and bind his leg from the inner side of the groin to above the heel with four fingers' width, with a thin long cord, for it does not appear otherwise.
Quando ergo apparet, tunc phlebotoma eam secundum quodcumque ingenium est tibi possibile, aut secundum transuersionem: et est melius, aut ut incidas eam incisione, aut seces eam sectione.	 Therefore, when it appears, then phlebotomize it in whatever way is possible for you, either by transverse incision or by longitudinal section, and the latter is better.
Locus enim eius est saluior, et ipsa est in pluribus hominibus occulta ualde.	 The place of it is safer, and this thing is very hidden in many people.
Quod si non inuenis eam, et non apparet sensui omnino: tunc phlebotoma aliquem ramum eius, et est ille qui apparet in dorso pedis, et uersus auricularem: et caue a neruis, et fac currere ex sanguine quantitatem quam uis.	 But if you do not find it and it does not appear at all to the senses, then perform phlebotomy on some part of it, which is the one that appears on the back of the foot, and turn towards the ear; and beware of the nerves, and let as much blood run out as you can.
Deinde solue stricturam, et pone super locum phlebotomiae corium, et stringe locum.	 Then release the constriction and place the skin over the site of the phlebotomy, and bind the site.
Uelociter enim sanatur.	 For it heals quickly.
¶ De Ventosatione, et qualitate usus eius.	 ¶ On Cupping and the Benefit of Its Use.
Caput XCVIII.	 Chapter XCVIII.
Uentosae fiunt ex cornibus, et ex aere, et ex uitro.	 Cupping glasses are made from horn, metal, or glass.
Et Ventosatio quidem fit secundum duos modos.	 And cupping is done in two ways. 》
Cum scarificatione, et extractione sanguinis: et alter est uentosatio sine scarificatione.	 One way is with scarification and bloodletting, and the other is cupping without scarification.
Et haec Ventosatio quae est sine scarificatione, est secundum duos modos.	 And this type of cupping that is done without scarification is done in two ways.
Aut enim est cum igne.	 Either it is with fire, 》 》
Aut est absque igne.	 Or it is without fire.
Et uentosis quae administrantur cum scarificatione et extractione sanguinis sunt quatuordecim loca corporis.	 And the sites for cupping that are given with scarification and bloodletting are fourteen places on the body.
Quorum unus est, Ventosatio Alnocrati, et est postremum capitis: et Alkehel, et est medium colli: et uentosae Alhagdahim, et sunt duae laminae colli a duabus partibus simul: et uentosae menti, et est sub mandibula in inferiori oris: et uentosae duarum spatularum: et uentosae Alachosos super finem caudae: et uentosae duorum focilium, et sunt medium duorum brachiorum: et uentosae duorum crurium: et uentosae duarum cauillarum.	 One is the cupping of the occiput, which is at the back of the head; and Alkehel, which is in the middle of the neck; and cupping of Alhagdahim, which are two sites on either side of the neck at the same time; and cupping under the jawbone below the mouth; and cupping of the two shoulders; and cupping above the tailbone; and cupping of the two elbows in the middle of both arms; and cupping of both legs; and cupping of both knees.
Et Ventosatio quidem non extrahit sanguinem tibi ex uenis minutis sparsis in carne, et propter illud non cadit uirtus ex eis, sicut est casus eius ex phlebotomia.	 Cupping does not draw blood from the small, dispersed veins in the flesh, and therefore their potency is not diminished as it is with bloodletting.
Neque oportet, ut administretur uentosatio siue cum igne, aut absque igne in aliqua aegritudinum quae fiunt ex repletione, donec euacuetur totum corpus.	 And it is not fitting to administer cupping either with fire or without fire for any illnesses that are caused by fullness until the entire body has been evacuated.
Quod si necessitas prouocat ad Ventosationem ex aegritudine, aut propter consuetudinem, administramus eam in omni hora in principio mensis, in fine eius, et in medio ipsius, et in quocumque tempore fuerit.	 If necessity calls for cupping due to illness or habit, we administer it at the beginning of the month, at the end, and in the middle, and at whatever time it may be.
Quod est, quia ex hominibus est qui quando multiplicatur in eo sanguis, donec indiget extractione eius per uentosationem, inuenit in capite suo grauedinem, et sodahan.	 That is to say, because there are some people who, when their blood increases, require its extraction through cupping, find headache and vertigo in their head.
Et ex eis est qui inuenit repletionem et rubedinem in facie sua, capite suo, et collo suo.	 And among them are those who find fullness and redness in their face, head, and neck.
Et ex eis est qui inuenit pruritum in facie sua, et fronte sua, et tenebrositatem, et hebetudinem in oculis suis.	 And among them are those who find itching in their face and forehead, and darkness and dullness in their eyes.
Et ex eis est qui scalpit locum uentosationis suae.	 And among them are those who scratch the site of their cupping.
Et ex eis est cuius risus multiplicatur.	 And among them are those whose laughter is increased.
Et ex eis est qui inuenit gustum sanguinis in ore suo: aut apostematur lingua, et expuit sanguinem.	 And among them are those who taste blood in their mouth; or the tongue swells and they spit out blood.
Et ex eis est cuius somnus multiplicatur.	 And among them are those whose sleep is increased. xspace
Et ex eis est qui uidet in somno suo sanguinem et rubedinem, et interfectos, et plagas, et quae sunt similia illis.	 And among them are those who see blood and redness, and the slain, and wounds, and things similar to these in their sleep.
Quando ergo uidemus aliquid ex illis, et proprie si est in tertia media mensis: praecipimus tunc uentosationem fieri, postquam praeterierunt de die duae horae, aut tres.	 Therefore, when we see any of these things and especially if it is on the third day of the month, we then order cupping to be done after two or three hours have passed from midday.
Iuuamentum autem Ventosationis nuchae, est: quoniam ipsa confert ad grauitatem in capite, et quod effunditur ad oculos.	 The benefit of cupping the neck is that it alleviates heaviness in the head and the discharge into the eyes.
At uero oportet, ut sit illud post euacuationem totius corporis.	 But it should be done only after the evacuation of the entire body.
Et haec quidem Ventosa est loco phlebotomiae Cephalicae.	 And this cupping is used in place of cephalic venesection.
Et non licet, ut utatur ea qui est frigidae complexionis, aut in quo est catarrus.	 And it is not permitted for those of cold temperament or with a head cold to use it.
Nam infert ei nocumentum magnum.	 It causes great harm to him.
Et propter illud non oportet, ut utantur ea senes, et in cuius capite sunt aegritudines frigidae.	 And because of that it is not appropriate for the elderly to use it, nor for those whose heads are afflicted with cold diseases.
Qui autem super eam fit assiduus, generatur super eum obliuio.	 But he who becomes accustomed to it continually has forgetfulness generated in him.
Et propter illud oportet, ut praecipias Ventosatori, ut deponat manum suam cum uentosa parumper ad inferiora, timendo ex generatione obliuionis.	 And because of that it is necessary for you to instruct the person cupping in bloodletting to briefly lower his hand with the cup towards below, fearing lest forgetfulness be generated.
Ventosatio aut Alkehel, est loco phlebotomiae Fuscae, et phlebotomiae Basilicae, et propter illud confert asmati, et constrictioni anhelitus, et fissurae instrumenti anhelitus, et tussi, et repletioni.	 Cupping or Alkehel is the place of dark bloodletting and basilica bloodletting, and because of that it benefits asthma, constriction of breath, rupture of the lung, coughing, and fullness.
Et oportet, ut impellatur Ventosa Alkehel parumper, quoniam si ponitur inferius, generat debilitatem in corde, et stomacho.	 And it is necessary that the cup of Alkehel be briefly applied, because if it is placed lower, it generates weakness in the heart and stomach.  /> Et oportet, ut sit ei purgatus intestinum.
Ventosatio uero alhagdahim, confert doloribus accidentibus in capite, et obtalmiae, et hemigraneae, et perforationi, et dolori in radicibus dentium: et est loco phlebotomiae Basilicae.	 Cupping however of alhagdahim benefits pains occurring in the head, and eye diseases, and hemiplegia, and perforation, and pain in the tooth roots: and it is the place for basilica bloodletting.
Et oportet, ut praecipias Ventosatori, ne premat manum suam cum scarificatione: ut non incidat arteriam, et accidat fluxus sanguinis.	 And it is necessary to instruct the person cupping in bloodletting not to press hard with the cup after scratching, lest he cut an artery and cause a flow of blood.
Ventosatio autem sub mento, confert alcolae in ore, et corruptioni gingiuae, et similibus eis ex aegritudinibus quae sunt in ore: et stat loco phlebotomiae alieherich, quae sunt in duobus labiis.	 Cupping however under the chin benefits ulcers of the mouth and corruption of the gums and similar diseases which are in the mouth; and it stands in place of bloodletting at Ali Ehriq which is on both lips.
Ventosatio autem spatularum, confert ad alchafacham, quae fit ex replexione, et caliditate.	 Cupping however with spoons benefits al-khafeefah, which occurs from congestion and heat.
Ventosatio uero interiorum partium duorum focilium, confert iuuamentum phlebotomiae uenarum trium, Basilicae, et Fuscae, et Cephalicae: quoniam ipsa attrahit sanguinem ex omnibus illis uenis minutis, quae sunt in carne: et attrahunt illae uenae minutae ex uenis aliis grossioribus eis, donec peruenit attractio ad uenas tres.	 Cupping however of the inner parts of the two buttocks benefits the supplement to bloodletting of the three veins, basilica and dark and cephalic; because it draws blood from all those small veins which are in the flesh, and those small veins draw from other larger veins until the drawing reaches the three veins.
Et oportet, ut praecipias Ventosatori, ne multum procedat in scarificatione: quoniam locus est denudatus carne, et sub eo sunt nerui et arteriae.	 And you should instruct the bloodletter not to proceed too much with the incision, because the place is bare of flesh, and under it are nerves and arteries.
Ventosa autem quae uentosatur super alchausos, confert hemorroidibus Ani, et ulceribus inferioribus.	 And the cupping glass that is applied to the anus benefits hemorrhoids and lower ulcers.
Et oportet, ut praecipias Ventosatori, ut sit uentosa magna, et ut sit ex aere: quoniam locus indiget suctione forti, et fortasse franguntur Ventosae subtiles: et scarificetur scarificatione magna.	 And you should instruct the bloodletter to use a large cupping glass and one made of metal, because the place requires strong suction; perhaps delicate ones break, and it should be incised with a large cut.
Ventosae autem crurium minuunt diminutione manifesta: quoniam attrahunt sanguinem ex toto corpore, et conferunt doloribus antiquis in renibus, et matricibus, et uesica: prouocant menstrua, et conferunt bothor, et ademenul: et stant loco phlebotomiae duarum saphenarum, et alhorcobeni.	 But cupping glasses on the legs diminish greatly, because they draw blood from the whole body; and they benefit old pains in the kidneys, womb, bladder; they provoke menstruation, and benefit boils and amenorrhea; and they serve as a substitute for two saphenous bleedings and alchorbe.
Verumtamen debilitant corpus multum, et faciunt accidere syncopim in pluribus hominibus.	 However, they weaken the body greatly, and cause syncope to happen in many people.
Et Ventosarum alhorcobeni iuuamentum est propinquum iuuamento Ventosarum duorum crurium.	 And the benefit of cupping glasses on the Alchorbe is close to the benefit of two leg cups.
Qualitas positionis Ventosarum est, ut ponas uentosam in primis uacuam, et sugas suctione temperata: et non prolonges positionem uentosarum, sed pone eas uelociter, et remoue eas uelociter, ut ueniant humores ad locum aduentu aequali: et non cesses iterare illud et continuare, donec uideas locum iam rubere et inflari, et appareat rubedo sanguinis: tunc ergo scarifica, et itera suctione paulatim.	 The quality of the position of the cupping glasses is that you should place the cupping glass in the beginning empty and draw with moderate suction; and do not prolong the position of the cupping glasses, but place them quickly and remove them quickly so that the humors may come to the place with equal arrival; and do not cease from repeating and continuing this until you see the place already reddening and swelling, and the redness of blood appears; then scarify, and repeat the suction gradually.
Deinde considera in dispositione corporum.	 Then consider in the disposition of bodies.
Nam qui ex hominibus est tenerae carnis, rarorum pororum, oportet ut scarifices ipsum semel, non plus: ut non ulceretur locus.	 For someone who has tender flesh and few pores, you should scarify him only once, not more, so that the place does not become ulcerated.
Et praecipe Ventosatori, ut amplificet scarificationem, et profundet parum: et temperet suctionem in facilitate, et uelocitate, et motu suaui.	 And instruct the bloodletter to enlarge the incision and make it a little deep; and let him regulate the suction in ease, speed, and gentle motion.
Quod si in sanguine est grossitudo, tunc oportet, ut scarifices ipsum bis.	 If there is a growth in the blood, then it is necessary that you incise him twice.
In uice quidem prima aperitur uia subtiliationi sanguinis, et aquositati eius: et in secunda quidem perscrutationi exquisitae extractionis sanguinis grossi.	 The first incision opens the way for the blood to be made subtle and watery, while the second incision is used for a precise examination of the extraction of thick blood.
Si uero sanguis est faeculentus ualde, tunc fiat scarificatio uice tertia: ut consequatur ultimum.	 If however the blood is very foul, then a third incision should be made so that it reaches its end.
Et ad ultimum, quando uolumus extrahere sanguinem paulatim, uel parumper, sufficit nobis scarificatio una.	 And finally, when we want to extract blood gradually or briefly, one incision is sufficient for us.
Quod si uolumus extractionem sanguinis multi, scarificamus scarificatione plurima.	 If we want to extract much blood, we should use multiple incisions.
Et si nos mensuramus, quod sanguis est grossus: tunc oportet, ut scarificetur scarificatione profunda: et terminus aequalis in scarificatione, est profunditas cutis.	 And if we judge that the blood is thick, then it is necessary to incise with a deep incision, and the end of the incision should be equal to the depth of the skin.
¶ Quid sit illud quod oportet administrari ex oleis apud positionem Ventosarum, et quid caueat uentosandus.	 ¶ What is that which must be administered from the oils at the site of incision, and what should the person being bled avoid?
IN illo quidem cuius cutis est grossa, dura, fusca, et pori eius sunt stricti, oportet ut ungantur loca Ventosare cum oleis apertiuis, lenitiuis, resolutiuis: si est in tempore aestatis, sicut est oleum alkeiri, aut oleum uiolatum, aut oleum de amigdalis dulcibus, aut oleum de semine cucurbitae.	 In the case of one whose skin is thick, hard, dark, and whose pores are narrow, it is necessary that the sites of incision be anointed with open, soothing, softening oils: if this is in the summertime, such as alkali oil, or violet oil, or oil from sweet almonds, or oil from pumpkin seeds.
Et si est in tempore hyemis, tunc oleum narcissinum, aut oleum de lilio, aut oleum camomellinum, aut sarbatinum: et eis similia.	 And if this is in the wintertime, then narcissus oil, or lily oil, or chamomile oil, or safflower oil, and others similar to these.
Si uero superfluitas est grossa, frigida: tunc oleum sit amaracinum, aut oleum de balsamita aut oleum alben, aut oleum anetinum: et eis similia.	 But if the excess is thick and cold, then let the oil be bitter orange oil, or oil of balm, or oil of aloe, or oil of dill, and others similar to these.
Si uero uentosandus est amplorum pororum, tenerae carnis: tunc oportet, ut prohibeatur ab oleo, et oportet ut isti abluant loca Ventosarum earum post uentosationem cum aqua rosata, aut cum aqua frigida, aut cum aqua solatri, aut cum aqua cucurbitae, aut cum aqua portulacae: et similibus eis.	 If the person to be bled has large pores and soft flesh, then it is necessary that they be kept from oil, and it is necessary that these people rinse the sites of incision with rose water, or cold water, or solarium water, or pumpkin water, or purslane water, and others similar to these. /> ¶
Ille autem cuius sanguis est multae humiditatis, abluat uentosas cum aceto, aut cum aqua myrti, et sumach: et similibus eis.	 He whose blood is very moist should cleanse his wounds with vinegar or water of myrtle and sumac, and similar things.
Cuius autem superfluitates sunt grossae, abluat uentosas suas cum uino antiquo, aut cum aqua samsuci, aut decoctione aneti, aut camomillae: et eis similibus.	 As for him whose discharges are thick, he should cleanse his wounds with old wine or water of sumac, or decoction of anise or chamomile, and similar things.
Et oportet, ut caueatur uentosatio in balneo, aut in uestigio balnei, imo oportet, ut administretur post exitum ex balneo per horam, aut per horas duas.	 And it is necessary that cleaning should be avoided in the bath or after leaving the bath; rather, it should be administered one hour or two hours after leaving the bath.
Et non oportet, ut dormiat aliquis post uentosationem.	 And it is not permissible for someone to sleep after cleaning.
¶ Quid est quo oportet ut regatur Ventosandus, aut Phlebotomatus ante uentosationem.	 What should be used to fumigate or bloodlet before cleansing?
ET post eam oportet, ut consideres in primis: tunc si Ventosatus, aut Phlebotomatus sit cholericus, et uincunt super sanguinem eius acuitas et inflammatio: tunc oportet, ut accipiat infrigidantia, sicut granatum muzum: et etiam endiuiam cum aceto et lactuca, et secaniabin, et iuleb: et eis similia.	 And after that you should consider first whether the patient who has been fumigated or bloodlet is choleric and if sharpness and inflammation prevail over his blood; then he should receive cooling things, such as pomegranate seeds, and also endive with vinegar, lettuce, sowthistle, and mallow, and similar things.
Et pone cibaria eius pullos, et carnes ouium sekebiget, et cibos conditos cum agresta: et eis similia.	 And his food should be simple, and the meat of mutton or fowl, and seasoned foods with sour condiments, and similar things.
Et cuius complexio est frigida, oportet ut sumat in potu syrupum de melle, aut de almiua, aut alsecaniabin de seminibus factum: et sumat uinum odoriferum medium, quod est inter uetus et nouum: et praecipiatur, ut utatur paucitate cibi.	 And if his constitution is cold, he should take in drink syrup of honey or sweet wine, and althaea made from seeds; and let him take medium-aged fragrant wine, which is between old and new; and it is particularly recommended that he use a small amount of food. 
Et pone cibum eius pullos, et canebir: et passeres, id est, paruas aues: et pullos columborum issiadebet.	 And let his food be simple and let him eat quail or turtledoves; and small birds like sparrows; and young pigeons.
Et oportet, ut potus die uentosationis et phlebotomiae plus sit quam cibus: et oportet, ut detur in potu in quibusdam hominibus in horis tyriaca alfaroch, aut medicamen de musco, id est, muscata, aut alesselithe ante uentosationem: et ante phlebotomiam, aut post: ut confortentur membra principalia, et subtilietur sanguis.	 And on the day of cleansing and bloodletting, drink should be more than food; and it is necessary to give in drink to certain people, in some hours, theriac alfaroch or a medicine made from musk, that is, mastic or aloeswood, before cleansing: and before or after bloodletting: so that the main members may be strengthened, and the blood refined.
Et non oportet, ut sumant eam in potu calefacto.	 And it is not necessary for them to take it in a heated drink.
¶ De Ventosis sine scarificatione.	 Of cupping without scarification.
Uentosae autem quae sunt sine scarificatione, sunt Ventosae quae ponuntur super epar, et splenem, et podagram, et super uentrem, umbilicum, et loca renum, et pixidem anchae: quoniam ista membra non sufferunt scarificationem super se.	 Now cupping without scarification are the cuppings placed on the liver, and spleen, and gout, and on the belly, and navel, and kidney region, and the bladder: because these members do not tolerate scarification on them.
Et non quaeritur per eas, nisi aut attactio ex membro sanguinis ad membrum: sicut ponimus Ventosam super mammillas in aegritudine fluxus sanguinis narium.	 And through them is sought nothing except drawing of blood from one member to another, as we place the cupping on the breasts during the illness of nosebleed.
Et utimur eis, ut soluamus a membro uentositatem frigidam inuiscatam in membro: sicut ponimus uentosam super uentrem, et umbilicum.	 And we use them so that we may dissolve from the member the cold and unseen windiness in the member, as we place the cupping on the belly and navel.
Ipsa enim rarificat membrum, et calefacit ipsum, et remouet dolorem propterea, quia resoluit illam uentositatem.	 For it makes the member porous and warms it, and removes pain on account of this, because it dissolves that windiness.
Etiam ponitur super renes, quando accidit in eis opilatio, aut lapis.	 Also it is placed on the kidneys when there occurs in them a stone or bladder stone.
Uirtute enim attractionis suae fortasse aperit opilationem, aut eradicat lapidem ex loco suo.	 By the power of its drawing indeed perhaps it opens up the stone or roots out the stone from its place.
Et similiter facit quando ponitur super epar, et splenem apud uentositatem terendam in eis utrisque.	 And similarly it does when placed on the liver and spleen for dissolving windiness in both.
Et istae Ventosae administrantur uacuae cum sectione tantum.	 And these cuppings are administered empty with only a cut.
Et quandoque administrantur cum igne.	 And sometimes they are administered with fire.
Et quandoque administrantur plenae aqua tepida in aegritudinibus pleuresis: et illud est, ut impleatur Ventosa, et sit magna, aqua calida sola, aut aqua in qua decoctae sint herbae quae conueniunt.	 And sometimes they are administered full of warm water during pleurisy illnesses: and this is done so that the cupping be filled and large with only hot water or water in which suitable herbs have been boiled.
¶ Forma Ventosae administratae cum igne.	 The form of the cupping administered with fire.
Sit amplitudo orificii eius duorum digitorum apertorum, secundum quod formauimus: et quantitas eius in profundo sit medietas palmi: et sit in latere eius in loco qui est circiter medium eius, foramen paruum, secundum quantitatem quod ingrediatur ipsum acus: fiat ex aere simul, aut citrino, grossorum marginum, lenium, aequalium, tersorum: ut non laedat membrum apud positionem suam super ipsum: et sit in medio eius uirga transuersa ex aere, aut ferro, ubi ponitur candela cum igne.	 Let the width of its opening be two fingers' breadth, as we have formed: and let its depth be half a palm: and let there be on its side in the place which is about the middle of it a small hole, according to the size that can enter into it a needle: let it be made at once from brass or copper, thick-rimmed, smooth, even, polished so that it does not harm the member upon its position over it: and let there be in its midst a transverse rod of brass or iron where the candle with fire is placed.
Et iam fit haec uentosa magna, maior ea quam narrauimus, et parum minor illa, secundum aegritudines et aetatem eius qui utitur.	 And now this wound becomes large and swollen, larger than the one we have described, and only slightly smaller than that, according to the illnesses and age of the person using it.
Ventosae enim puerorum, et extenuatorum sunt aliae, quam uentosae uirorum, et grossorum corporum.	 For indeed, the ventoses for boys and thin people are different from those for men and those with thicker bodies.
Qualitas autem ponendi hanc uentosam cum igne super membrum, est, ut accendas licinium cum igne ex lino decenter, aut candelam paruam ex caera: et pone eam super medium uirgae transuersae quae est in medio uentosae: ut sit accensus ignis circiter inferiorem partem uentosae, ut non comburatur corpus infirmi.	 The manner of applying this ventose with fire on the limb is as follows: Light a wick made from linen or a small candle made from wax, and place it on the middle of the crosspiece that is in the center of the ventose, so that the fire burns around the lower part of the ventose, to prevent the patient's body from being burned.
Deinde ponatur super membrum: et digitus sit super foramen quod dixi, donec quando tenemus uentosam: dum indigemus, auferamus digitum, et egredietur uapor super illud foramen, et soluetur uentosa statim.	 Then place it on the limb, and let your finger be on the opening that I mentioned, until when we hold the ventose; while we need to, remove the finger, and the vapor will come out of that opening, and the ventose will immediately release.
Deinde igni licinium secundum modum suum, et itera eam, si indiges illa.	 Then light the wick as needed, and repeat the process if you require it again.
In Ventosa autem quae administratur in aegritudine pleuresis cum aqua, non est uirga transuersa, neque foramen: et non administratur, nisi quia impletur aqua, et ponitur super membrum tantum.	 However, in the ventose used in the illness of pleuresis with water, there is no crosspiece nor opening; and it is only applied after being filled with water and placed on the limb.
Et haec est forma eius.	 And this is its form.
Et haec Ventosa quanto plus est magna, ut capiat aquam multam, est melior.	 And the larger this ventose is, so that it can hold much water, the better it is.
¶ De suspensione Sanguisugarum.	 ¶ About the Suspension of Bloodletters.
Caput XCIX.	 Chapter 99.
Sanguisugae non administrantur in pluribus, nisi in quibus membris non est possibilis positio uentosarum, propter paruitatem eorum, sicut labium, et gingiua, et eis similia.	 Bloodletters are not used on many [parts of the body], except for those limbs where the application of ventoses is impossible due to their smallness, such as the lip and gum, and similar parts.
Aut in membro denudato a carne, sicut digitus, et nasus, et eis similia.	 Or on limbs that are bare of flesh, like the fingers, nose, and similar parts.
Et qualitas utendi eis est: ut ueneris ex Sanguisugis quae sunt in aquis dulcibus, mundis a putredinibus.	 And the quality of using them is: that you come from bloodletters which are in sweet and clean waters, free from decay. ›
Deinde dimittantur die et nocte in aqua dulci, donec famelicae sint, et non remaneat in uentre earum aliquid.	 Then they are released day and night into fresh water until they are hungry, and there is nothing left in their stomachs.
Deinde euacuetur corpus in primis cum phlebotomia, et cum uentosis.	 Then the body should be first evacuated with phlebotomy and with enema.
Deinde absterge membrum infirmi, donec rubeat.	 Then cleanse the member of the patient until it reddens.
Postea ponantur super ipsum.	 Then they are placed upon it.
Cum ergo implentur, et cadunt, et est possibilis suctio loci cum uentosa, tunc est magis ultimum in iuuamento: et si non, tunc ablue locum cum aceto.	 When they are filled and fall off, and if it is possible to suck the place with an enema, then it is more useful; and if not, then wash the place with vinegar.
Deinde cum aqua multa, et fricetur, et exprimatur.	 Then with much water, let it be washed and squeezed out.
Quod si prolongatur cursus sanguinis post casum Sanguisugarum, et est illud resudando: tunc infunde pannum lini in aqua frigida, et pone ipsum desuper, donec abscindatur resudatio.	 If the flow of blood continues after the fall of leeches, and if this is due to perspiration, then pour a flax cloth into cold water and place it on top until the sweating stops.
Quod si multiplicatur sanguis, tunc pulueriza super ipsum zegi tritum, aut gallas, et similia eis ex stipticis: donec abscindatur sanguis.	 If the blood increases, then sprinkle on it powdered alum or oak galls and similar astringents until the bleeding stops.
Aut ponantur super locum medietates fabarum excorticatarum: et dimittantur, donec adhaereant fabae in loco, nam sanguis abscinditur.	 Or place half-peeled beans on the spot and let them stay until they stick to the spot, for the blood will stop.  \\
Et oportet si necessaria est iteratio Sanguisugarum, quando est possibile, mutare eas.	 And if it is necessary to repeat the use of leeches, when possible, change them.
Si autem prohibentur Sanguisugae a suspensione, tunc abstergatur locus cum sanguine recenti.	 But if leeches are prevented from biting, then cleanse the spot with fresh blood.
Aut fige acum in locis, donec egrediatur aliquid ex sanguine.	 Or prick with a needle until some blood comes out.
Deinde ponantur, nam ipsae quando sentiunt aliquid ex sanguine, adhaerent statim.	 Then place them on, for they will stick immediately when they sense something from the blood.
Quando ergo uis ut cadant, pulueriza super eas aliquid ex aloe trito, aut salem, aut cinerem: et cadent statim.	 When you want them to fall off, sprinkle some powdered aloe or salt or ash on them, and they will immediately fall off.
¶ Partis Secundae Finis.	 The end of the second part.
¶ Liber Chirurgici Albucasis Pars III.	 Book of Surgery by Albucasis Part III.
¶ Sermo uniuersalis de restauratione, et dislocatione, et curatione torsionis, et similibus.	 General discussion about restoration, dislocation, the treatment of torsion, and similar topics.
Caput I.	 Chapter 1
Hoc Capitulum etiam multotiens est necessarium in arte Medicinae, et est restauratio fracturae, et dislocationis accidentium in ossibus.	 This chapter is also often necessary in the art of Medicine, and it concerns the restoration of bone fractures and dislocations.
Scitote o Filii, quia iactant se de hoc Capitulo stolidi medicorum et uulgi, et qui non inspexerunt unquam antiquorum librum, neque legerunt ex eo literam.	 Know, O Sons, that fools and the common people boast about this chapter, even though they have never looked into an ancient book nor read a single letter from it.
Et propter hanc caussam fit, quod iste modus ex scientiis in terra nostra est priuatus.	 And for this reason, this method has been privately concealed among the sciences in our land.
Et ego non obuiaui in eo unquam bono omnino, et non adeptus sum ex eo illud, quod sum adeptus nisi propter longitudinem lectionis librorum antiquorum, et studium super intellectum eorum, donec extraxi scientiam illius ex eis.	 And I have never found anything good in it at all, and I would not have attained what I have attained except through the lengthy study of ancient books and diligence in understanding them, until I extracted that knowledge from them.
Deinde adhaesi experimento et studio longitudine uitae meae.	 Then I devoted my life to experiments and long study.
Et iam descripsi uobis ex illo in hoc Capitulo totum quod continet scientia mea: et super quod praeteriit experimentum meum, postquam abbreuiaui illud uobis, et liberaui illud ex occupatione elongationis, et abbreuiaui illud fine abbreuiationis, et ostendi illud fine declinationis: et formaui in eo formas multas ex formis instrumentorum quae administrantur in eo, cum sit ex additione declinationis, sicut feci in duobus Capitulis praecedentibus.	 And now I have described to you in this chapter all that my science contains: and concerning the experiment which I passed over after I shortened it for you, and released it from prolongation, and shortened it with the end of shortening, and showed it with the end of variation: and I formed many forms from the forms of instruments used in it, when they are added to variation, as I did in the two preceding chapters. ︎
¶ Summae, et collectiones ex esse fracturae ossium, ex eis quarum praemissio necessaria est, antequam incipiamus rememorationem membrorum fractorum, et diuersorum, si uniuscuiusque.	 Summary and collection of the essence of bone fractures, from which it is necessary to begin before we start remembering the broken members, and their various types.
Caput II.	 Chapter 2
Oportet, ut dicamus in prologo huius Capituli, summas sermonis, et capitula, ad quarum intellectum cogitur in primis artifex ad stationem super earum ueritatem: scilicet ut uos, et qui sunt prompti, sciant, uel addiscant hanc artem nobilem, et alii a uobis.	 In the prologue of this chapter, it is fitting to summarize the key points and topics that are necessary for understanding them first: so that you, and those who are quick to learn, may know or learn this noble art, and teach others from you.
Dico, ergo, quod quando accidit alicui fractura, aut dislocatio, aut torsio, aut casus: tunc oportet, ut properes in primis ad phlebotomandum eum, et soluendum ipsum, aut utraque simul: si non prohibeat aliquid, sicut debilitas uirtutis: aut est ille cui accidit aliquid ex illis puer, aut senex decrepitus: aut est tempus uehementis caloris, aut uehementis frigoris ualde.	 I say, therefore, that when someone has a fracture, dislocation, twist, or fall, you should hasten first to bleed them and loosen them, or both together, unless something prevents it, such as weakness of strength: or the one who experienced something of these things is a child, or an old man withered by age: or it is a time of very hot weather, or very cold. ︎
Deinde sit contentus in cibo suo, oleribus frigidis, et carnibus auium, et haedorum: et prohibe uinum, et carnes grossas, et repleri ex cibis et omni cibo qui replet uenas sanguine.	 Then let him be content with his food, cold vegetables, and birds or goat meat; and avoid wine, heavy meats, and overeating of all foods that fill the veins with blood.
Donec quando securus sis ex apostemate calido, et non times effusionem materiei ad membrum: tunc redeat infirmus ad regimen suum primum cum quo cucurrit consuetudo eius.	 Until you are sure of the healing of the warm swelling, and you do not fear the outpouring of matter to the member; then let the sick man return to his first regime with which he was accustomed.
Cum ergo incipit os fractum restaurari, tunc oportet, ut cibetur infirmus cibis nutrientibus nutrimento multo, grosso, graui, in quibus sit uiscositas: sicut cibaria facta ex tritico cocto cum aqua, et rizum, et capita, et pedes, et uentres uaccarum, et oua, et pisces recentes: et uinum grossum, et similia illis.	 When the fracture of the mouth begins to heal, then it is necessary for the sick person to be fed with nourishing foods that are abundant in nutrients and thick; such as foods made from boiled wheat with water, rice, fish heads, fish tails, cow intestines, eggs, fresh fish, and heavy wine, and similar things.
Cum hoc enim regimine fit coagulatio fracturae uelocius, et melius.	 With this diet, the healing of the fracture is faster and better.
Et scias, quod ossa fracta, quando sunt in uiris qui sunt in prima senectute, et decrepitis, non est possibile, ut continuentur et consolidentur secundum naturam suam semper, propter exiccationem membrorum eorum: et consolidantur et continuantur quae ex eis sunt in fine lenitatis, sicut ossa puerornm paruorum.	 And know that broken bones, when they are in men who are in the first stage of old age and decrepit, it is not possible for them to be joined and healed according to their nature always, because of the dryness of their members; and they heal and join together those which are in the end of softness, just like the bones of little children.
Verumtamen natura annectit super os fractum ex omni parte aliquid simile glutino, in quo est grossitudo, quo adhaeret et stringit ipsum, donec conglutinantur adinuicem, et ligantur adinuicem, donec uenit in fine fortitudinis et firmitudinis, sicut fuit in primis, donec non prohibet ipsum aliquid ab operationibus suis: et propter hanc caussam est necesse, ut ponas nutrimentum infirmi cibaria, in quibus sunt grauitas, et uiscositas, et grossitudo, sicut diximus.	 However, nature attaches to the broken bone from every side something similar to glue, which has thickness, by which it adheres and binds together until they are joined together and bound together until it reaches the end of strength and firmness as it was at first, so that nothing prevents it from performing its functions; and because of this cause, it is necessary to provide for the sick person foods in which there is heaviness, thickness, and abundance, as we have said.
Et scias, quod fracturae species sunt diuersae, secundum diuersitatem membrorum: quoniam fractura cruris, est diuersa a fractura ossis capitis: et fractura ossis pectoris, est diuersa a fractura ossis dorsi: et similiter reliqua membra omnia diuersa existunt adinuicem: et ego ueni cum rememoratione omnis speciei fracturae expositae in Capitulo suo distinctae ab alia.	 And know that the types of fractures are diverse according to the diversity of the members; for a fracture of the leg is different from a fracture of the head bone, and a fracture of the chest bone is different from a fracture of the back bone; and similarly all other members are diverse from one another. And I have come with the recall of every type of fracture described in its own chapter, distinguished from others.
Et diuersificantur species fracturae ossis etiam in seipsa.	 And the types of bone fractures are also diverse among themselves.
Quoniam fit fractura eius arcuata, praeter quod accidant in ea astellae.	 Since a fracture can be curved, besides which splinters may occur in it.
Et quandoque fit fractura eius secundum longitudinem ossis: et sunt fracturae eius satagiae, id est, astellae, et additiones procedentes, sicut sunt in calamo, cum aptatur cultello ad scribendum.	 And sometimes the fracture occurs along the length of the bone: and these fractures are fragmented, that is, splinters, and protruding pieces, like those in a reed when it is trimmed with a knife for writing.
Et non procedentes: et est fractura cum uulnere et disruptione in capite: et est fractura fissura parua.	 And they do not protrude: and there is a fracture accompanied by a wound and tearing at the end: and there is a small fissure fracture.
Et omni speciei est ingenium, uel instrumentum proprium in restauratione eius, secundum quod ueniet rememoratio eius, distincta in locis suis.	 And every type has its own skill or tool for its repair, as will be mentioned later, arranged by topic.
Et ex eo quo cognoscitur fractura ossis, est tortuositas eius, et ipsius eminentia: et apparitio eius sensui, et sonitus eius quando comprimis ipsum manu tua.	 And from that which is recognized as a bone fracture is its twist and prominence, and its appearance to the touch, and its sound when you press it with your hand.  />
Quando ergo non est in loco tortuositas apparens, neque sonitus apud tactum tuum cum tangis os cum agitatione, neque inuenit infirmus magnum dolorem: tunc non est illic fractura, imo possibile est, ut sit tortuositas, aut fissura parua: non ergo oportet, ut moueas ipsum cum manu et compressione omnino, imo pone super ipsum ex medicinis, quarum uenit rememoratio, post momentum illud quod conuenit loco: deinde stringatur strictura subtili.	 When there is no apparent twist or sound to the touch when you move the bone, and the patient does not feel great pain, then it is not a fracture. Rather, it may be a twist or a small fissure. Therefore, do not disturb it with your hand or pressure. Instead, place on it some of the medicines whose use will be mentioned after, when the time is right for that: then bind it tightly with fine bandages.
Et scias, quod locus quando arcuatur, et scinditur in duo, praeter quod accidant in eo satagiae, uerumtamen remouetur omnis pars a compari sua: tunc oportet tibi, ut incipias ab hora tua ad rectificationem eius, aequando ipsum antequam accidat ei apostema calidum.	 And know that when a place is curved and split into two, besides which splinters occur in it, however, every part is removed from its pair: then you should begin to straighten it immediately, evening it out before an inflammation occurs.
Si autem accidat ei apostema calidum, tunc dimitte ipsum diebus aliquot, donec quiescat apoestema.	 But if an inflammation occurs in it, then leave it for some days until the inflammation subsides.  />  />
Deinde aequa ipsum secundum quemcunque modum potest ex lenitate et ingenio.	 Then straighten it according to whatever method is possible with gentleness and skill.
Et scias, quod restauratio eius, et ipsius aequatio, est facilior quam ossis, in quo accidunt satagiae.	 And know that its restoration and equalization are easier than that of bone, where fractures occur.
Deinde stringe ipsum, secundum quod ueniet tibi rememoratio eius.	 Then tie it according to how you remember it.
Si uero in osse sunt satagiae, tunc necessaria est extensio huius membri fracti ex duabus partibus, si manus sit, aut pes: aut cum manu tua, si membrum est paruum: aut cum duobus funibus, aut cum fune et manu.	 But if there are fractures in the bone, then it is necessary to extend this broken limb from two sides, whether it be hand or foot; either with your hand, if the limb is small; or with two ropes, or with a rope and your hand.
Et sit positio tua qua ponis membrum super locum aequalem, secundum figuram suam naturalem, donec quando extenduntur partes membri fracti: tunc conare, ut redire facias illas additiones omni ingenio, et secundum quemcunque modum potes in locis suis: et caue secundum fortitudinem tuam, ne accidat super infirmum per operationem tuam dolor, neque laesio: et conare secundum fortitudinem tuam, ut applices unum duorum ossium cum socio suo, secundum meliores formas.	 And let your position be such that you place the limb on an equal spot, according to its natural shape, until when the parts of the broken limb are extended; then strive with all your skill and in whatever manner you can to return those additions to their places: and beware lest by your operation any pain or injury occur to the weak spot. And strive with all your skill that you join one of the two bones with its mate, according to the best forms.
Et oportet in illa hora, ut tentes et tangas ipsum manu tua.	 And it is necessary at that time that you feel and touch it with your hand.
Si ergo uides illic aliquid diuersum, rectifica ipsum, et aequa illud per quantitatem tuae uirtutis.	 Therefore, if you see something different there, correct it and make it equal according to the extent of your skill.
Et caue extensionem uehementem, et compressionem fortem, sicut faciunt multi stolidorum.	 And beware of making a violent extension or a strong compression, as many foolish ones do.  />
Multotiens enim faciunt accidere per operationem illam suam apostema calidum, aut contractionem in membro: sicut iam uidimus illud ex operationibus eorum multotiens.	 For often they cause a hot abscess or contraction in the limb through their operation; as we have already seen this from their operations many times.
Deinde annecte post aequationem, et decentem operationem, et stricturam illius membri, et quietem, et tranquillitatem: et mone infirmum super ipsum.	 Then bind it after equalization and proper operation, stricture, rest, and tranquility; and admonish the patient about this.
Et fac ipsum cauere, ne moueat ipsum in hora suarum uigiliarum, et somni sui apud reuolutionem suam, et agitationem suam, et apud egestionem suam, et omnes motus suos ultima uirtute sua.	 And instruct him to be careful not to move it during his vigils or sleep, and during his turning, moving about, and all his movements with all his might.  />  />
Et ut caueat, ne sit positio membri positio cum qua sequatur dolor.	 And so that he may avoid the position of the limb which causes pain to follow.
Quod est, quia quando sentit in dispositione positionis membri dolorem, aut laesionem: tunc oportet, ut permutes ipsum ad dispositionem aliam ab illa cum qua non sentiat dolorem.	 "When he feels pain or injury in the position of a limb, then it is necessary to change its position to one that causes no pain.
Et caue cum illo, ut sit positio eius illa aequalis, recta: ut non accidat in membro tortuositas, quando restauratur.	 "And be careful with him so that his position is equal and straight, so that the limb does not become twisted when it is restored.
Et qualitas stricturae membri fracti est, secundum quod narro.	 "And the condition of a broken limb's constriction is as I describe.
Scias, quod membra fracta diuersificantur in paruitate sua, et eorum magnitudine, et ipsorum forma.	 "Know that broken limbs are varied by their smallness, and their size, and their shape.
Quae ergo ex eis sunt parua, sicut brachium, et digitus, et focile, et similia eis, tunc oportet, ut sit inuolutio panni mollis, subtilis.	 "Therefore, those that are small, such as the arm, finger, and thigh, then it is necessary for there to be a wrapping of soft, fine cloth.
Quae autem ex eis sunt grossa, sicut coxa, et crus, oportet ut sit in eis inuolutio lata, dura.	 "But those that are thick, such as the thigh and leg, there should be a broad, hard wrapping.
Quoniam ligamentum latum, connectit membrum magnum, et stringit ipsum ab omni parte strictura aequali, ita quod non ingreditur ipsum macula.	 "Because the wide bandage binds the large limb and constrains it from all sides equally with even tightness, so that no blemish enters it.
Deinde incipe post euacuationem tuam ab aequatione ponere linimentum conueniens ad illud, in stuppa leni super locum fracturae ipsius.	 "Then begin after your evacuation from the equal position to place on top of the broken area an appropriate ointment on soft tow.
Deinde incipe inuoluere ligamentum super locum fracturae ipsius tribus inuolutionibus, aut quatuor, secundum quod meretur membrum: et stringe manum tuam parumper cum ligamento.	 "Then begin to wrap the bandage over the broken area with three or four wraps, according to what the limb deserves, and tighten your hand a little with the bandage.
Deinde uade cum eo ad partem superiorem a loco fracturae, et stringe minus quam fuit strictura tua, qua strinxisti locum fractum.	 "Then go with it to the upper part from the broken place, and tighten less than you tightened the broken place.
Deinde elonga te cum inuolutione a loco fracturae parumper, et mollifica stricturam paulatim, donec capias ex loco sano rem magnam.	 "Then extend yourself with the wrapping from the broken place slightly, and gradually ease the tightness until you reach a large healthy part.
Deinde accipe uittam aliam, et inuolue eam iterum super locum fractum inuolutionibus.	 "Then take another bandage and wrap it again over the broken place with wraps.
Postea uade cum inuolutione ad partem inferiorem a fractura.	 "After that, go with the wrapping to the lower part from the break.
Et sit operatio tua in strictura inuolutionis, et mollificatione eius, secundum quod diximus in inuolutione prima superiore.	 "And let your work be in the tightening of the wrapping and its easing, according to what we said in the first upper wrapping.
Deinde pone inter inuolutiones ex stuppa leni, aut panno, cum quo aequetur tortuositas fracturae, si est in ea tortuositas: et si non, non ponas in ea aliquid.	 Then place between the layers of soft tow or cloth, with which the twisting of the fracture is made even, if there is any twisting in it; and if not, do not put anything in it.
Deinde inuolue super ipsam uittam aliam.	 Then wrap another layer over it.
Postea aequa super has inuolutiones astellas decenter factas statim, si non est in loco inflatio, neque apostema calidum.	 Afterwards, place on these layers evenly made and well-shaped splints immediately, if there is no swelling or hot abscess in the place.
Si autem in ea est inflatio, aut apostema: tunc pone super eam quod sedet illud apostema, et auferat inflationem: et dimitte eam aliquot diebus.	 But if there is swelling or abscess in it, then place on it something that will relieve the abscess and remove the swelling; and leave it for some days.
Deinde stringe super ipsam tunc astellas.	 Then tie the splints over it.
Et sint Astellae ex medietatibus cannae latae, rasae, formatae sapienter: aut sint ex ligno unde fiunt cribra, quae fiunt ex pino, aut geraid, id est, ramis palmae, aut calingi: et sit amplitudo omnis Astellae, secundum hanc formam, et hanc eandem figuram.	 And let the splints be made from half-round canes, planed and wisely shaped; or they may be made of wood used for sieves, which are made from pine or geraid, that is, branches of the palm tree, or calingi: and let the width of each splint be according to this form and figure.
Verumtamen oportet, ut Astella quae ponitur super ipsam tracturam, sit grossior et latior parumper, quam reliquae Astellae: et longitudo Astellae sit secundum quod licet membro ex magnitudine et paruitate.	 However, it is necessary that the splint placed on the tracture be somewhat thicker and wider than the other splints; and the length of the splint should be according to what is allowed by the member in terms of size and narrowness.
Deinde stringe super Astellas cum uitta alia, secundum stricturam primam eandem.	 Then tie another bandage over the splints, similarly to the first binding.
Deinde liga desuper cum filis decenter, secundum quod diximus de strictura: et est, ut sit strictura tua super locum fracturae plus: et quanto plus elongatur a fractura sit, strictura minor.	 Then tie it securely with threads, as we have said about the binding; and know that your binding over the site of the fracture should be more, and the farther it extends from the fracture, the less the binding.
Et oportet, ut sint fila media in grossitudine et subtilitate, et sint ex lino molli.	 And know that the threads should be of medium thickness and fineness, and they should be of soft linen.
Quoniam si fila sunt grossa, sicut uidi ex operatione stolidorum ponentium fila sua ex chordis lini tortis, est error magnus: quoniam cadit strictura cum eis extra qualitatem.	 For if the threads are thick, as I have seen from the practice of foolish people who use their threads made from twisted flax cords, it is a great mistake; for the binding slips with them outside of the proper quality.
Et fila subtilia iterum non conueniunt: quoniam tu non consequeris per stricturam cum eis illud quod uis.	 And fine threads are not suitable again because you will not achieve through them what you want due to narrowing.
Et non oportet, ut sit inter astellam et astellam minus quam digitus.	 And it should not be less than a finger's width between the stitches.
Quod si laeditur infirmus per extremitates astellarum post stricturam in locis sanis: tunc pone sub eis ex stuppa leni, aut lana carminata, donec nihil laedatur ex illo.	 If the patient is injured by the tips of the stitches after constriction in healthy places, then place under them some soft tow or carded wool until he is no longer harmed by it.
Quando autem est fractura cum uulnere, et accidit disruptio in cute, ego ueniam cum rememoratione eius in capitulo secundum singularitatem.	 When there is a fracture with a wound and disruption of the skin occurs, I will excuse myself from mentioning it again by its singularity in the second chapter.
Et scias, quod non omne membrum fractum oportet ut stringatur cum astellis a primo die.	 And know that not every broken bone should be tied with stitches on the first day.
Quod est, quia membrum quando est magnum, non oportet ut ponas superipsum astellas, nisi post quinque dies, aut septem, aut plus, secundum securitatem tuam ab euentu apostematis calidi.	 Which means that if the bone is large, you should not place stitches on it except after five days, or seven, or more, according to your security from the occurrence of a hot swelling.
Et iste est modus emplastrorum, quibus restaurabant antiqui, quae ponuntur super fracturam et dislocationem.	 And this is the method of plasters by which the ancients used to restore, and which are placed on a fracture or dislocation.
¶ Modus Emplastri communis abbreuiati, restaurans fracturam, conueniens pluribus complexionibus, praecipue mulieribus, et pueris: quoniam est ex eo super quod non uincit calor, neque frigus.	 The method of a common shortened plaster for restoring a fracture, suitable for most constitutions, especially women and children, because it is made from something that neither heat nor cold can overcome.
Et est, ut accipias ex puluere molendini, et est medulla farinae quae pendet in parietibus molendini apud motum molae: et conficias ipsum sicut est, praeter quod cribelles ipsum cum albugine oui: et pone confectionem eius non spissam, neque subtilem.	 And it is, that you take from the mill's dust, which is the marrow of flour hanging on the walls of the mill during the movement of the millstone: and make it as it is, except that you sift it with the thin skin of an egg; and put its preparation not thick, nor fine.
Deinde utere eo.	 Then use it.
¶ Modus Emplastri alius, restaurantis fracturam, et dislocationem, et torsionem.	 Another method of plaster for restoring a fracture, and a dislocation, and a twist.
Recipe almess, et laudani, et acaciae, et enulae, et mugath: et suc, omnium ana ʒ X myrrhae, et aloes amborum ana ʒ V et alethil ʒ XX terantur omnia, et cribellentur, et misceantur cum aqua alethil: aut cum albugine oui, si complexio infirmi est calefacta.	 Take almess, and laudanum, and acacia, and enula, and mugwort: and the juice of all, ana ʒ X; of myrrh, ana ʒ V; and of both aloes, ana ʒ V; and alethil, ʒ XX. Let everything be ground and sifted, and mixed with alethil water, or with the thin skin of an egg, if the patient's constitution is hot. ›
Deinde utere hoc emplastro.	 Then use this plaster.
Nam ipsum est bonae compositionis, restaurat ossa fracta uelociter, et confert pluribus hominibus.	 For it is of good composition, it quickly restores broken bones, and it benefits many people.
¶ Modus Emplastri alius, quod etiam confert fracturae et torsioni.	 Another method for making a plaster that is also beneficial for fractures and dislocations:
Recipe mugath, et mess, et alteae albae, omnium ana ʒ X myrrhae, et aloes amborum ana ʒ V acaciae ʒ VI boli armeni ʒ XX terantur omnia contritione multa, et cribellentur, et conficiantur cum aqua, aut albugine oui: et administrentur.	 Take equal parts of mugwort, marshmallow, and white hellebore, each one ounce; also take myrrh and both kinds of aloe, each half an ounce; and Armenian bole, two ounces. Grind all these ingredients very finely, sift them, and make them into a paste with water or the whites of eggs, then administer it.
¶ Modus Emplastri ad iuncturas, et ossa separata ex locis suis: et sedat dolorem accidentem eis, et scissuram ossis, et fracturam.	 A method for making a plaster to reattach separated joints and bones to their proper places, and to soothe the pain that occurs in them, as well as bone fissures and fractures:
Sumatur lana succida, et submergatur in aceto, et oleo decocto: et ponatur super locum.	 Take clean wool, soak it in vinegar and boiled oil, and apply it to the place.
Et in hoc quidem Emplastro non est uirtus restaurationis, sed est bonum in sedatione apostematis calidi: et expellit dolores proprie.	 And indeed this plaster does not have the power of restoration, but it is good for soothing hot inflammation and properly drives away pain. ︎
¶ Modus Emplastri, quod restaurat os fractum.	 A method for making a plaster that restores broken bone:
Sume folia fici surdi, et folia papaueris syluestris: et tere omnia, et fac emplastrum ex utrisque.	 Take the leaves of the common fig and the leaves of wild poppy, grind them all together, and make a plaster from both.
¶ Modus Emplastri abbreuiati, administrati apud restaurationem fracturae ossis: et quando tu uis resolutionem residui apostematis.	 A method for making an abbreviated plaster, to be used in the restoration of a bone fracture and when you wish to resolve any remaining inflammation.
Recipe radicis alteae, et camomillae, et florum uiolarum, et farinae herbi, omnium ana partem unam: terantur omnia, et conficiantur cum uino, si non est membrum calefactum.	 Take equal parts of the root of white hellebore, camomile, violet flowers, and barley flour. Grind all these together and make them into a paste with wine, unless the limb is hot.
Si uero est calefactum, tunc confice illud cum aqua coriandri humidi, aut cum aqua, et utere eo.	 If it is hot, then make it with water of moist coriander or with water and use it.
¶ Modus Emplastri alius fortioris in resolutione, quam istud primum, quando accidit apostema durum apud restaurationem membri.	 Another method for a stronger plaster for resolving inflammation than the first one, to be used when a hard inflammation occurs during the restoration of a limb: ︎
Recipe radicis alteae, et seminis lini, et balaustiae, et melliloti, et samsuci, et floris uiolarum, et camomillae, omnium ana, partem unam, terantur omnia, et conficiantur cum aqua salicis, aut cum aqua dulci, aut cum uino.	 Recipe of althea root, flax seed, balm, mallow, sumac, violet flower, and chamomile, all in equal parts; grind everything and make it with willow water or sweet water or wine.
Totum illud secundum caliditatem membri, et quietem caloris eius.	 All of this according to the warmth of the limb and the calmness of its heat.
Hippocrates uero non dixit in libro suo, quod ponatur super membrum fractum apud restaurationem eius, nisi caerotum factum ex caera, et oleo: non aliud: et narrauit, ut sit medium inter grossitudinem et subtilitatem.	 Hippocrates however did not say in his book that anything should be placed on a fractured limb at the time of its restoration except for plaster made from wax and oil; nothing else; and he related that it is a medium between coarseness and fineness.
Galeno autem uisum est, ut ponantur super membrum fractum apud restaurationem eius res, in quibus est exiccatio caliditatis, sicut myrrha, et aloes et olibanum, et similia eis ex eis quae narrauimus.	 However, Galen believed that substances which have a drying effect on heat, such as myrrh, aloes, and frankincense, along with similar substances from those we mentioned, should be placed on a fractured limb at the time of its restoration.
¶ Modus Emplastri quod confert ad laesionem et dolorem.	 ¶ Method of plaster which is beneficial for injury and pain.
Recipe mugath, et ciceris, et capillorum hominis incisorum, aut pennae auis, et alteae, et salis partes aequales: terantur, et cribellentur, et conficiantur: et fiat ex eo emplastrum.	 Recipe mugwort, chickpeas, human hair cuttings or bird feathers, marshmallow root, and salt in equal parts; grind, sift, and make it into a plaster.
Quantitas autem secundum quam oportet, ut remaneat ligatura, deinde soluatur, est, ut consideres tunc, si non accidit infirmo dolor, neque pruritus, neque mouetur os fractum a loco suo: tunc non resoluas ipsum diebus multis.	 The quantity by which it should remain bound and then be dissolved is to observe at that time if no pain occurs in the patient, nor itching, nor does the broken bone move from its place; then you should not dissolve it for many days.
Quod si accidat ei in loco pruritus uehemens, aut dolor inquietans, aut inflatio: tunc propera, et solue in hora ipsum, et aufer emplastrum ab eo: et accipe pannum lenem, aut spongiam marinam lenem, humidam: et submerge eam in aqua tepida, et ablue cum ea locum, donec quiescat pruritus, et sedetur dolor.	 If it happens that a severe itch or disturbing pain or swelling occurs in that place, then hurry and dissolve it in the same hour; remove the plaster from him; and take a soft cloth or a soft marine sponge moistened with water; submerge it in warm water and wash the place with it until the itching subsides and the pain is relieved.
Deinde dimitte membrum quiescere una hora.	 Then allow the member to rest for one hour.
Deinde pone super ipsum lanam succidam, submersam in aceto et oleo, aut oleo rosato: et liga super ipsum nocte una, donec sis securus ab apostemate calido, et quiescat inflatio membri, et remoueatur dolor eius.	 Then place on it a piece of cloth soaked in vinegar and oil, or rose-scented oil; and bind it on for one night, until you are sure that the hot abscess has been relieved, and the swelling of the member has subsided, and its pain is removed.
Deinde itera ipsum ad stricturam subtilem, et emplastrum paruum: et non stringas ipsum constrictione tua prima, et subtilia cum eo, donec sanetur.	 Then apply to it a fine bandage and a small poultice; but do not bind it too tightly with your first bandage, and make the bandages that follow with it, until it is healed.
Quod si uides, quod apostema, et rubedo, et dolor, et inflatio, et omnia accidentia iam remota sunt penitus, et indiges emplastro et strictura, tunc itera illud sicut fecisti in primis aequaliter.	 But if you see that the abscess, redness, pain, swelling, and all symptoms have been completely removed, and you no longer need a poultice and bandage, then bind it as you did at first, evenly.
Quod si non accidit membro aliquid ex eis quae diximus, tune non soluas ipsum, nisi post tres dies, aut quatuor, aut quinque, aut septem.	 But if nothing happens to the member from those things which I have mentioned, then do not unbind it until after three or four or five or seven days.
Et quando que dimittitur uiginti diebus totum illud, secundum quod apparet tibi ex solutione membri, sicut diximus, donec quando adhaeret fractura, et approximat coagulatio carnis super eam: adde etiam tunc in strictura plus quam strictura tua prima tota: et adde etiam in ingrossatione cibi infirmi, secundum quod praecessit rememoratio eius.	 And when it is unbound after twenty days, according as you see from the release of the member, as we have said, until such time as the fracture adheres and the coagulation of flesh comes together upon it: add also at that time more to your bandage than your first whole bandage; and add also in the thickening of weak food, according as you remember before.
Si autem uides locum fracturae iam exiccari, et extenuari plus quam oportet: tunc scias, quod nutrimentum prohibetur peruenire ad ipsum.	 But if you see the place of the fracture already drying out and becoming thin beyond what is fitting: then know that nourishment is prevented from reaching it.
Embroca ergo ipsum cum aqua tepida apud omnem uicem qua soluis ipsum, et sit illud in omnibus tribus diebus, et alleuia stricturam parumper.	 Soak it therefore with warm water at every time when you unbind it, and let this be for all three days, and relieve the bandage a little.
Per hanc ergo operationem currit ad membrum nutrimentum, et sanatur uelociter.	 By this procedure nourishment comes to the member, and it is healed quickly.
Illud autem quod faciunt stolidi restauratores ex fractura membri uice alia, quando non restauratur in primis, secundum quod oportet, et restauratur secundum tortuositatem, est error ex operatione eorum, et timor magnus: et si esset rectum, dixissent illud antiqui in libris suis, et operati fuissent cum eo.	 But what foolish repairers do to a member when it is not first properly repaired after a fracture, and they repair it according to crookedness, that is an error from their procedure, and a great fear: and if it were right, the ancients would have said this in their books, and would have done so with it.
Et ego non uidi alicubi eorum uestigium in illo omnino, et rectius est, ut non fiat illud.	 And I did not see their trace anywhere in that at all, and it is better if it is not done.
¶ De factura accidente in capite.	 On the making of an injury to the head.
Caput III.	 Chapter III.
Species fracturae sunt diuersae, et figurae eius multae: et caussae eius sunt distinctae.	 There are various kinds of fractures and many shapes; their causes are also distinct.
Nam ex fractura est quae fit a percussione cum ense: et percussio aufert os totum usquequo peruenit ad siphac, quod est sub osse, sicut facit axia in ligno: et propter illud nominatur haec species fracturae Axialis.	 For there is a fracture caused by a blow with a sword: and the blow removes the bone entirely to where it reaches the marrow, which is under the bone, just as an axe does in wood; and on account of this, this type of fracture is called 'axial'.
Aut ensis incidit quiddam ossis, et incidit faciem eius, et non penetrat incisio usque ad ultimum eius: et nominatur haec species fracturae Kalaan, id est, Leuatio absolute.	 Or the sword cuts into part of a bone and cuts its surface but does not penetrate all the way through; and this type of fracture is called 'kalaan', that is, 'complete incision'.
Et est uulnus duarum fracturarum, aut magnum, aut paruum.	 And there are two types of wounds of fractures: large or small. ¶
Et ex fractura est, quae est contritio, aut attritio: et caussa eius est percussio cum lapide, aut casus super lapidem, aut eis similia.	 And among the fractures is 'crushing' or 'grinding', and its cause is a blow with a stone or falling onto a stone or similar things.
Et haec fractura est etiam aut penetrans, quae iam appropinquat panniculo, quod est sub osse: aut est in facie ossis: et est uulnus harum duarum fracturarum etiam aut paruum, aut magnum.	 And this fracture is also either penetrating and approaching the marrow which is under the bone, or it is on the surface of a bone; and there are two types of wounds of these fractures: small or large.
Et ex fractura est, quae est occulta in osse in subtilitate capilli: et est fissura parua, et propter illud nominatur haec species fracturae Capillaris.	 And among the fractures is one which is hidden within a bone, like a hair's breadth, and it is a small crack; and on account of this it is called 'capillary'. ¶ ‌
Et ex eis est fractura, quae fit a casu, aut percussione lapidis, et eis similium, quae faciunt ingredi laminam ossis ad interiora, et fit loco concauitas: sicut accidit caldariis aeris, quando occurrit eis percussio, et ingreditur pars eorum ad interiora.	 And among them is the fracture which occurs from a fall or blow with a stone and similar things, which cause a layer of bone to split towards the inside, creating a depression, as happens in bronze cauldrons when they are struck, and part of them splits towards the inside.
Et plurimum quidem fit illud in capitibus humidorum ossium, sicut sunt capita puerorum.	 And this occurs most frequently in the heads of moist bones, such as those of children.
Et fiunt omnibus istis speciebus fracturae satagiae separatae, et ego ueniam cum rememoratione illius totius in loco suo.	 And for all these types of fractures, splints are separated, and I will come with a reminder of the whole in its place.
Et cognoscimus omnes has species fracturae per detectionem super eam, et inquisitionem earum cum tentis, et ablationem carnium corruptarum, quae sunt super eas.	 And we know all these types of fractures by examination upon them, and investigation with probes, and removal of corrupted flesh that is upon them.
Species uero Capillaris cognoscitur per hoc, quod detegitur super os, et abstergitur, et linitur super ipsum cum encaustro: fractura enim apparet nigra.	 But the species of the capillary is recognized by this, that it is exposed above the skin, and cleaned, and covered with wax: for the fracture appears black.
In curatione autem fracturae, considera in primis accidentia infirmi: tunc si uides ex accidentibus quod significet significatione manifesta super timorem, sicut uomitus cholerae, et extensio, et amissio intellectus, et abscisio uocis, et syncopis, et febris acuta, et egressus oculorum, et rubedo eorum, et similia eis ex accidentibus in pluribus dispositionibus, proculdubio non sanatur: et si uides accidentia non terrentia te, et speras salutem: tunc incipe curationem eius.	 In the treatment of fractures, consider first the patient's symptoms: then if you see from the symptoms something that indicates a clear danger, such as vomiting of bile, distention, loss of intellect, hoarseness, fainting, acute fever, protrusion of the eyes, their redness, and similar symptoms in various conditions, it is certainly not cured: and if you see non-threatening symptoms and hope for recovery, then begin its treatment.
Quod est, si uenit ad te uulneratus in primis cum uulneratur: et est illud in diebus hyemis, tunc oportet, ut studeas in ablatione ossis ante diem quartumdecimum secundum omnem dispositionem.	 That is, if a wounded person comes to you at the time of wounding: and it happens in the winter days, then you must strive for the removal of bone before the fourteenth day according to every condition.
Et si est in diebus aestatis, tunc oportet, ut properes remouere os ante diem septimum, antequam corrumpatur quod est sub osse ex panniculo, et accidant illa accidentia quae narrauimus.	 And if it is in the summer days, then you must hasten to remove the bone before the seventh day, before that which is under the bone from the membrane corrupts, and those symptoms we have mentioned occur.
Quod si fractura ossis iam peruenit ad panniculum tangentem cerebrum, et est cum minutiis, et attractione: tunc oportet, ut incidas partem comminutam, et attritam, secundum quod narro tibi.	 But if the fracture of bone has already reached the membrane touching the brain, and it is with fragments, and drawing inward: then you must cut away the broken and drawn part, as I tell you.
Et est, ut radas caput uulnerati: et detege super os secundum quemcunque modum possibile est tibi: et secundum figuram uulneris, et quod leue est super infirmum.	 And it is that you shave the head of the wounded person: and expose the bone in whatever way possible for you: according to the shape of the wound, and what is easiest on the patient.
Quod si accidat tibi apud detectionem ossis fluxus sanguinis, aut apostema calidum: tunc oppone ei cum eo quod oportet.	 If during the extraction of a bone there is bleeding or a hot abscess, then apply that which is necessary.
Et est, ut impleas locum cum pannis infusis in uino, et oleo rosato: et facias quiescere uulnus, donec sedetur apostema, et sis securus a fluxu sanguinis.	 And it is that you should fill the place with cloths soaked in wine and rose oil, and make the wound rest until the abscess settles, and be secure from bleeding.
Deinde incipe in curatione ossis, et ablatione eius.	 Then begin with the treatment of the bone and its removal.
Et illud fit secundum unum duorum modorum.	 And this is done according to one of two methods.
Modus quidem unus est, ut incidas os cum Incisorio strictae aciei: et haec est forma eius.	 One method is to cut the bone with a trephine of sharp edge, and this is its form.
Dende administra Incisorium aliud post Incisorum latius eo parumper: et haec est forma eius.	 Then administer another trephine after the first, wider than it by a little; and this is its form.
Deinde administra etiam Incisorium aliud latius etiam quam secundum.	 Then administer also another trephine, even wider than the second one.
Et modus secundus est, ut sit apud te numerus Incisoriorum diuersorum: quorum quaedam sint latiora quibusdam, et quaedam eorum breuiora quibusdam: et sint in ultimo acuitatis extremitatum suarum, et sint ex ferro indo, aut fuled: et utere facilitate in percussione super Incisorium, ut non concutiat caput, et laedat ipsum.	 And the second method is that you should have with you a number of different trephines, some of which are wider than others and some shorter; and they should be sharp at the end of their extremities, and made of Indian iron or steel; and use facility in striking over the trephine, so that it does not shake the head and injure it.  />
Si autem os est forte, durum: tunc oportet, ut perfores in circumitu eius, antequam tu administres Incisoria, cum Terebris quae nominantur Terebra non profundantia: et non nominantur ita, nisi quoniam ipsa non pertranseunt terminum ossis carnei ad illud, quod est post ipsum: propterea, quod Terebro est extremitas rotunda super illud, quod est sub capite eius acuto, similis margini, et circulus paruus prohibet submergi, et pertransire spissitudinem ossis.	 But if the bone happens to be hard and strong, then it is necessary that you should bore around it before you administer the trephines with boring instruments called non-penetrating borers; and they are not so named except because they themselves do not penetrate the end of the bony substance to what is behind it; for this reason, since the end of the borer is rounded over that which is under its sharp point, like a border and small circle, it prevents sinking in and penetrating the thickness of the bone.  /> />
Et conuenit tibi, ut accipias ex istis Terebris numerum multum, quorum unumquodque conueniat quantitati spissitudinis ossis, donec praesens sit tibi omni craneo Terebrum: cuius extremitatis acutae quantitas in longitudine et breuitate sit, secundum quantitatem spissitudinis illius cranei.	 And it is fitting for you to take from these borers a great many, each of which fits the thickness of the bone, until you have with you a borer for every skull; and the length and shortness of the sharp end of its tip should be according to the thickness of that particular skull.
Et haec est forma trium specierum Terebrorum, uel Trepanorum.	 And this is the form of three types of Terebrae, or Trepanes.
Qualitas autem perforandi in circumitu ossis fracti, est: ut ponas Terebrum super os, et reuoluas ipsum digitis tuis, donec scias, os iam penetratum esse.	 The quality of penetrating around the broken bone is this: you place the Terebra on the bone and roll it with your fingers until you know that the bone has already been penetrated.
Deinde permuta Terebrum ad locum alium, et pone quod est inter omne foramen quantitatem grossitudinis radii, aut circiter illud.	 Then change the Terebra to another place and put between every hole a quantity of thickness of the radius or about that amount.
Deinde incide cum Incisoriis quod est inter omne foramen ex osse: et fac illud subtilius quam potes super illud ex fine leuitatis, sicut diximus, donec eradices os, aut manu tua, aut cum aliquo alio ex quibusdam instrumentis, quae parasti ad illud: sicut tenaliae, et forpices subtiles.	 Then cut with the Incisors what is between every hole from the bone and make that thinner than you can over that to the point of fineness, as we said, until you remove the bone either by hand or with some other of those instruments which you have prepared for it, such as tweezers and fine forceps.
Et oportet, ut caueas omni cautela, ne tangat Terebrum, aut Incisorium aliquid ex siphac.	 And it is necessary that you take care with all caution that the Terebra or Incisors touch nothing of the brain.
Cum ergo circumieris os perforando, et separatum fuerit a siphac, si fuerit continuum cum eo, et extraxeris ipsum, oportet ut radas, et aeques extremitatem eius quod remanet in osse cum instrumento alio simili Incisorio.	 Therefore when you go around the bone by penetrating and have separated it from the brain if it was continuous with it, and after you have extracted it, it is necessary that you scrape and even out the end of what remains in the bone with another similar instrument like the Incisors.
Verumtamen oportet, ut sit tenuis et subtilis magis aliis Incisoriis.	 However, it ought to be thin and fine more than other Incisors.
Quod si remanet aliquid ex ossibus paruis, et satagiae: tunc accipe ea cum facilitate, cum eo quod est apud te ex instrumentis.	 If something remains from the small bones and splinters then take those easily with that which you have among your instruments.
Deinde cura uulnus post illud cum liciniis, et unguentis quae diximus.	 Then cure the wound afterwards with compresses and ointments as we said.
Et modus alius operationis est facilis, prorsus longinquus a timore: quem dixit Galenus, et laudauit ipsum laude magna: et iste est sermo eius.	 And another method of operating is very easy and far from fear, which Galen said and praised it greatly, and this is his statement.
Necese est tibi in primis, ut incipias detegere partem ossis ex loco, in quo fractura est uehementior, et manifestior: donec quando detexeris illam partem, et posueris sub eo extremitatem huius Incisorii lenticularis, cuius haec est forma.	 It is necessary for you first to begin to uncover the part of the bone from the place where the fracture is more violent and manifest until when you have uncovered that part and placed under it the end of this lenticular Incisors, which has this form.
Et pars lenticularis, lenis non incidit aliquid: et pars acuta eius in duabus lateribus eius uadens in longitudinem, sicut uides: ut sit pars lenticularis innixa ad siphac, facie eius incidente acuta in osse.	 And the lens-shaped part, the gentle one, does not cut anything: and its sharp part goes into two sides of it, along its length, as you see: so that the lens-shaped part rests against the siphac, with its sharp end cutting into the bone.
Deinde percute super Incisorium a parte una cum malleo paruo, donec incidas totum os cum facilitate, sicut reuoluitur: et tu sis securus ex panniculo, quod non accidat in eo accidens, quod timeas prorsus.	 Then strike over the Incisor with a small hammer from one side until you cut through the entire bone easily, as it is turned: and you will be confident from the cloth that no accident will happen to it which you fear completely.
Et si medicans non esset stultior hominum, et magis ignarus eius, nec esset dormiens, tunc si remaneret aliquid annexum ossi ex panniculo in quibusdam locis, incideret ipsum ab eo cum extremitate incisorii lenticularis ipsius, et liberaret ipsum ab eo cum facilitate.	 And if the physician is not more foolish than other men and is less ignorant of it, and does not sleep, then if anything from the cloth remains attached to the bone in certain places, he would cut it off with the end of the lens-shaped incisor itself, and free it from there easily.
Liberatur enim ab eo sine nocumento, et absque timore.	 It is freed from that without harm and without fear.
Et si fractura ossis non penetret usque ad panniculum, et illud quod abscinditur ab osse est facies eius, et remanent in ipso asperitas et satagiae subtiles: tunc oportet, ut radas illam asperitatem, et eradices illas satagias cum rasoriis subtilibus ex quibus praeparasti numerum diuersarum quantitatum, ut sit tibi possibile administrare ex eis in omni loco conuenientiora eorum, et rectiora ipsorum, secundum illud ad quod perducit te operatio, et ipsum os fractum, et figura eius.	 And if the bone fracture does not reach the cloth, and what is cut off from the bone is its surface, and roughness and fine splinters remain in it, then it is necessary to scrape away that roughness and remove those splinters with fine rasps which you have prepared in various sizes, so that you may administer the most suitable and straightest ones according to the nature of the operation, the fractured bone itself, and its shape.
Et oportet, ut administres in rasione tua, qua in primis radis os, latius illorum rasoriorum.	 And it is necessary for you to administer with wider ones first than those rasps.
Deinde utere post ipsum subtiliore eo.	 Then use a finer one after that.
Et non cesses facere illud secundum continuitatem, donec peruenias ad administrandum tenuius, et subtilius eorum omnium.	 And do not cease to do this continuously until you reach the point of using the finest and most delicate one of all.
In unaquaque autem fissurarum reliquarum paruarum capillarium, et fractura subtili, oportet ut administres curam, secundum illud quod perducit ad rectificationem eius.	 But in each of the remaining small cracks and subtle fractures, it is necessary to take care according to what leads to its correction.
Et est res quae non occultatur super omnem, cui in hac arte est quodlibet studium, et stetit super illud quod scripsimus, et ostendimus in fracturis magnis.	 And it is a thing that is not hidden from anyone who has any interest in this art, and we have written about it and demonstrated in cases of great fractures.
Si autem panniculus detectus retinetur, quando tu eradicas os: tunc oportet, ut accipias pannum lini, secundum quantitatem uulneris, et submerge ipsum in oleo rosa, et pone ipsum super orificium uulneris.	 But if the skin flap is retained when you extract the bone: then it is necessary to take a piece of linen cloth according to the size of the wound and soak it in rose oil, and place it over the opening of the wound.
Deinde accipe pannum alium duplicatum, aut triplicatum, et submerge ipsum in uino et oleo rosa, et pone ipsum super pannum primum: et fac illud quam facilius potes super illud, ut non grauetur siphac.	 Then take another piece of cloth, either double or triple-folded, and soak it in wine and rose oil, and place it over the first cloth. And make sure to do this as lightly as possible so that it does not burden the patient.
Deinde administra supra ipsum ligamentum latum: et non stringas ipsum, nisi per quantitatem quae teneat uulnus tantum: et dimitte ipsum cum hac cura die uno, aut diebus duobus, donec sis securus ab apostemate calido.	 Then apply a broad bandage over it and do not tighten it unless it holds the wound firmly; and leave it for one day or two days until you are certain that there is no hot swelling.
Deinde solue ipsum, et administra post illud medicinas cum quibus est superflua siccitas: sicut radices lilii, et farina herbi, et puluis thuris, et aristolochia, et similia eis: et est, ut facias ex istis medicinis puluerem, qui puluerizetur super uulnus sicut sunt siccae.	 Then loosen it and apply after that medicines with which there is a dry excess, such as the root of lily, powdered herb, frankincense dust, aristolochia, and similar things; and it should be made into a powder from these medicines to be sprinkled over the wound like dry things. 》
Et uniuersaliter administra in illo omnem medicinam de proprietate cuius est ut abstergat, et non mordicet.	 And generally apply every medicine that has the property of cleansing and not causing irritation.
Et caue secundum tuam uirtutem, ut uulnus in curatione tua sit limpidum: neque sit in ea sordes unguenti, neque sordicies.	 And be careful according to your skill that the wound in your treatment is clean; and there is no dirt from ointment or other impurities in it.
Neque dimittas uirus aggregari in eo omnino: quoniam quando uirus aggregatur super panniculum cerebri, corrumpit eum, et putrefacit ipsum, et accidit super infirmum post illud malicia magna: et iam accidit in siphac capitis, cum mundificatur ab eo os, praecipue quando negligitur cura eius, nigredo in superficie eius.	 Do not allow any pus to gather on it at all; for when pus gathers on the membrane of the brain, it corrupts and putrefies it, and a great evil befalls the patient afterwards: and this happens especially in skull wounds, when the bone is cleared from them, particularly when its care is neglected, with blackening on its surface.
Considera ergo tunc, si accidunt infirmo accidentia quae diximus, scias, quia est pernitiosum proculdubio.	 Therefore, if such afflictions befall the patient, know that it is undoubtedly fatal.
Et si nigredo non accidit, nisi a medicina quae ponitur super ipsum, et est in uirtute illius medicinae, ut faciat illam nigredinem: tunc oportet, ut accipias ex melle partem unam, ex oleo rosato partes tres, et linias cum eis pannum.	 And if the blackness does not occur except from the medicine that is placed upon it, and it is in the power of that medicine to produce that blackness; then you should take one part of honey and three parts of rose oil, and anoint a cloth with them.
Deinde pone ipsum super siphac: postea cura ipsum cum speciebus curationis quae conueniunt, donec sanetur.	 Then place it upon the pillow; afterwards treat it with the appropriate remedies until it heals.
¶ De restauratione Nasi quando frangitur.	 ¶ On the Restoration of the Nose When It Is Broken.
Caput IIII.	 Chapter Four.
Scias, quod non franguntur ex Naso nisi duae partes eius superiores simul, aut una earum: propterea, quod ipse sunt duo ossa: quoniam inferius eius est cartilaginosum, non frangitur, et non accidit ei nisi attritio, et tortuositas, et simitas.	 Know that only the two upper parts of the nose are broken simultaneously or one of them, because they are two bones; for the lower part is cartilage and cannot be broken, and nothing happens to it except for abrasion, twisting, and flattening.
Si frangitur una duarum partium eius, tunc oportet, ut intromittas digitum paruum in foramen Nasi, et aeques illam fracturam digito tuo indice, et pollice deforis, donec redeat Nasus super figuram suam naturalem: et fiat illud arte, cum facilitate.	 If one of the two parts is broken, then you should insert a small finger into the nostril and equalize that fracture with your index finger and thumb from outside until the nose returns to its natural shape; and this should be done skillfully and easily.  />
Et caue, ne accidat per operationem tuam illam super infirmum dolor.	 And take care that no pain occurs to the patient due to your action.
Quod si fractura est in superiore parte Nasi, et non perueniat ad illam digitus: tunc oportet, ut aequetur extremitate radii, in quo sit grossitudo parua.	 But if the fracture is in the upper part of the nose and your finger cannot reach it; then it should be equalized with the tip of a small stick.
Si uero fractura est in duabus partibus, tunc fac simile illius: et propera cum restauratione eius in die primo fracturae, si est possibile.	 But if the fracture is in both parts, then do likewise; and hasten with its restoration on the first day of the fracture, if possible.
Et si non, tunc post diem septimum, aut decimum apud quietem apostematis calidi.	 And if not, then after the seventh or tenth day during the quiet stage of a hot swelling.
Deinde intromitte in extremitate Nasi licinium ex panno lini, si fractura est in parte una: aut intromite duo licinia si fractura est in duabus partibus: et sit in licinio grossitudo tantae quantitatis, quae impleat foramen Nasi.	 Then insert a linen wick into the tip of the nose if the fracture is in one part; or insert two wicks if the fracture is in both parts; and let the thickness of the wick be such that it fills the nostril.  /> 
Et dixerunt quidam antiquorum restauratorum, ut infundantur licinia in butyro, et permutentur omni die.	 And some of the ancient surgeons said that ointments should be poured into butter and changed every day.
Illud uero non uidetur mihi, imo oportet, ut infundatur licinium in albugine oui, confecto cum puluere molendini.	 However, this does not seem right to me; rather, the ointment should be poured into a bladder of an egg and mixed with ground pepper.
Deinde dimitte licinium, donec firmetur os, et induretur cartilago.	 Then leave the ointment until the bone hardens and the cartilage thickens.
Et quandoque intromittitur in Nasum loco licinii penna anseris, postquam inuoluitur super ipsam pannus lenis: et fit, quod ipsa tenet fracturam Nasi uehementius, et ut non prohibeatur infirmus ab inspiratione.	 And sometimes a goose feather is inserted into the nose instead of ointment, after wrapping the nose in a soft cloth: and this happens so that it holds the broken nose more firmly, and so that the sick person is not prevented from breathing.
Et non est haec res necessaria.	 And this is not necessary.
Si uis, fac illud: et si uis, fac licinia.	 If you want, do that; and if you want, make ointments.
Quod si accidat Naso iterum dum operaris apostema calidum, emplastra nasum cum caeroto, aut cum coto infuso in oleo rosato, aut modico ex dyaquilon.	 But if a hot abscess occurs on the nose while you are working on it, make a plaster for the nose with caerot or cotyledon boiled in rose oil or a little of diacodion.
Si autem non accidit apostema calidum, tunc oportet, ut emplastres ipsum cum farina sisami, et puluere thuris confecti cum albugine oui.	 But if a hot abscess does not occur, then you should make plasters for it with sesame flour and frankincense powder mixed with an egg bladder.
Deinde pone super ipsum stuppam lenem, et non liges Nasum cum aliquo omnino.	 Then place soft wool on top of it, and do not bind the nose at all.
Si uero franguntur ossa Nasi fractura parua, aut comminuuntur, tunc oportet, ut scindas super ea, et extrahas ipsa cum instrumentis quae conueniunt eis.	 But if the broken bones of a small nose fracture are shattered, then you should cut through them and remove them with appropriate instruments.
Deinde sue scissuram, et cura ipsum cum eo quod incarnat, et consolidat ex emplastris conuenientibus ad illud, uel unguentis.	 Then, whether it is a cut or a wound, take care of it with what causes the flesh to grow and strengthens from suitable plasters or ointments for that.
Quod si accidat inter Nasum uulnus, tunc oportet, ut cures ipsum cum liciniis: et administres cannulam de plumbo, donec sanetur.	 But if a wound occurs between the nostrils, then you should take care of it with ointments and administer a lead tube until it heals. ➤
¶ De restauratione Mandibulae inferioris, quando disrumpitur.	 § On the restoration of the lower jaw when it is broken.
Caput V.	 Chapter 5
Quando disrumpitur Mandibula inferior, et fractura eius non est cum uulnere: conspice tunc si est fractura eius deforis tantum, et non frangitur in duo, et curuatur ad interiora: tunc cognitio eius est facilis.	 When the lower jaw is broken and its fracture is not with a wound, then see if it is only broken on the outside and is not split into two parts and curves toward the inside; then its diagnosis is easy.
Oportet ergo, si est fractura eius in parte dextra, ut intromittas digitum indicem sinistrae in os infirmi: similiter si fractura est in mandibula sinistra, tunc intromitte indicem manus dextrae: et impelle cum eo gibbositatem fracturae deintus cum facilitate ad exteriora cum manu tua altera ab interiori parte ossis decenter, et cum eo aequa ipsam.	 Therefore, if the fracture is on the right side, insert with your left hand the index finger into the patient's mouth; similarly, if the fracture is on the left mandible, then insert the index finger of your right hand: and with it push the prominence of the fracture inward with ease from the inside with your other hand from the interior part of the bone neatly, and make it equal.
Quod si fractura mandibulae iam separata est in duo, tunc oportet, ut administres extersionem a duabus partibus, secundum rectitudinem: donec possibilis sit aequatio eius.	 But if the jaw fracture is already separated into two parts, then you should administer traction from both parts, according to the straight line, until it is possible to make them equal.
Si autem iam accidit in dentibus commotio, aut disruptio: tunc stringe illos de quibus speras quod remaneant cum filo auri, aut argenti, aut seta.	 But if the shock or disruption has already occurred to the teeth, then bind them with gold wire or silver wire, or silk thread from which you hope they will remain.
Deinde pone super mandibulam fractam caerotum.	 Then place a splint on the broken jaw.
Deinde pone super ipsum pannum duplicatum, et pone super pannum astellam magnam decenter factam: aut frustum cutis soleae aequale, in longitudinem mandibulae.	 Then place on it two layers of cloth, and on the cloth a large neatly made bandage; or an equal piece of sole skin in the length of the jaw.
Deinde liga ipsum desuper, secundum quod praeparatur tibi ligatura eius, et conuenit ipsius applicatio, donec non destruitur: et praecipe infirmo, uti tranquillitate et quiete: et pone cibum eius sorbitiones lenes.	 Then bind it from above according to how its bandage is prepared and its application is suitable until it does not break; and advise the patient to rest and be quiet; and give him soft food.
Si autem estimas, quod iam alteratur aliquid figurae aliquo modorum: tunc propera, et solue ipsum in die tertio.	 But if you think that something has changed in the shape in any way, then hurry and remove it on the third day.
Deinde rectifica quod alteratum est ex eo, et emplastra ipsum ex puluere molendini, cum albugine oui, aut cum farina sisami, postquam tu abstuleris caerotum: et pone super emplastrum lanam lenem.	 Then correct what has changed from it, and apply a plaster of mill dust with egg white or sesame flour, after you have removed the splint; and place soft wool on top of the plaster.
Dum ergo permanet annexum illud emplastrum super ipsum, et non alteratur ossis dispositio, dimitte ipsum, ne soluas, donec sanetur: aut stringe fracturam.	 While that bandage remains on it and the bone's position does not change, leave it alone, lest you loosen it, until it heals; or bind up the fracture.
Multotiens enim stringitur haec fractura in tribus septimanis.	 For this fracture is often bound for three weeks.
Quod si interim accidat apostema calidum, tunc administra illud quod diximus multotiens in sedatione eius, donec remoueatur illud apostema.	 But if a hot abscess occurs meanwhile, then administer what we have often said for its reduction, until that abscess is removed.
Et si fractura est cum uulnere, considera.	 And if the fracture is with a wound, consider [this].
Namsi iam separatur ex osse frustum, aut a satagie: tunc subtilia te in hoc, ut auferas illa frusta satagiae cum eo quod conuenit tibi in ablatione eorum ex instrumentis.	 For if already a fragment is separated from the bone, either by itself or through carelessness; then be skillful in this, so that you remove those fragments of splinters along with what suits you among the instruments for their removal.
Si uero orificium uulneris est strictum, tunc amplifica ipsum cum phlebotomo secundum quantitatem necessitatis tuae.	 But if the wound's opening is narrow, then enlarge it with a fleam according to your need.
Deinde quando abstuleris illa satagie, et non remanserit ex eis aliquid, sue tunc orificium uulneris, si est amplum: et si non, pone super ipsum ex emplastris quae conueniunt ad illud, et incarnant illud, donec sanetur.	 Then when you have removed those splinters and nothing remains of them, whether the wound's opening is then wide or not—if it is not, place on it one of the bandages that suit it, and allow it to heal until it heals.
¶ De restauratione Furculae, quando frangitur.	 ¶ On restoring the collarbone when it breaks.
Caput VI.	 Chapter VI.
Plurimum quidem frangitur Furcula ab anteriore parte ex parte humeri, et fractura eius fit secundum unum trium modorum.	 Indeed, the collarbone most often breaks from its anterior part towards the shoulder, and its fracture occurs in one of three ways.
Aut enim frangitur et separatur in duo, praeter quod accidant in ea satagiae: et est facilius ad restaurationem eius.	 For it either breaks and separates into two parts, apart from the fact that splinters may occur in it; and this is easier to restore.
Aut ita, quod accidunt in osse satagiae: et est difficilius ad restaurationem.	 Or [it happens] such that splinters occur in the bone, and this is more difficult to restore.  /> Or [it breaks] with a fragment of bone remaining attached to it; and this is most difficult to restore.
Aut ita, quod est fractura cum uulnere.	 Or so that [the break] occurs with a wound.
Et operatio in ea quando fractura est absque uulnere, est, ut facias praesentes esse duos ministros, ut teneat unus eorum adiutorium quod sequitur Furculam fractam, et alter extendat collum uersus partem.	 And the procedure in it when the break is without a wound is to have two assistants present: so that one of them holds support for the broken collarbone, and the other extends the neck towards the affected side.  /> Then you place the fingers of your right hand under the broken end [of the collarbone], while with your left hand you push the healthy end upwards.  /> And you continue doing this until the broken ends join together perfectly.  /> Then you bind them tightly with a bandage, and leave it for fifteen days or so, not allowing anyone to touch it.
Deinde aequa fracturam digitis tuis, donec fiat forma eius, secundum quod oportet: et non sit in ea eminentia, neque concauitas.	 Then make the fracture even with your fingers until it takes on its proper form: and there should be no projection or depression.
Quod si indiges extensione plus, tunc oportet, ut ponas sub titillico infirmi spheram ex panno, aut lana: et sit magnitudo eius secundum quantitatem necessitatis tuae: et extende, et eleua Furculam, et coarta spheram manu tua, donec aeques fracturam, secundum quod oportet.	 If you need more extension, then it is necessary to place under the patient's scrotum a pad of cloth or wool: and its size should be according to your needs: and extend and raise the Furcula, and compress the pad with your hand, until you make the fracture even, as required.
Quod si non potes trahere extremitatem Furculae ad exteriora: propterea, quia peruenit ad profundum: tunc oportet, ut resupinetur infirmus super ceruicem suam: et ponas sub humero eius puluinar medium in magnitudine, et premat minister humerum eius ad inferiora, donec eleuetur os Furculae quod est in profundo ad sursum: atque tunc rectifica fracturam, et aequa eam digitis tuis.	 If you cannot pull the end of the Furcula outward because it has gone too deep, then it is necessary that the patient be turned over onto his back: and place under his shoulder a medium-sized pad, and have your assistant press down on the shoulder until the bone of the Furcula which is deep comes up: and then correct the fracture and make it even with your fingers.
Si autem sentis sathaiatum ex Furcula, et mouetur: tunc oportet, ut findas super illud, et extrahas ipsum alsathaiatum cum facilitate.	 But if you feel a splinter from the Furcula that moves, then it is necessary to scrape over it and remove the splinter easily.
Si autem est retentum in osse, tunc ingenia in incisione eius cum uno Incisoriorum quae praeparasti ad illud, postquam tu posueris sub Furcula instrumentum quod seruat sifach: et est instrumentum ex ligno, aut ex ferro.	 If however it is retained in the bone, then use an awl in its incision with one of the instruments that you have prepared for that purpose, after you have placed under the Furcula an instrument that preserves Sifach: and this instrument is made of wood or iron.
Et haec est forma eius.	 And this is its shape.
Assimilatur cochleari cui non est concauitas.	 It resembles a spoon without a bowl.
Et sit latitudo eius secundum illud quo indiges eo ex magnitudine ossis, et paruitate eius.	 And its width should be according to your need for it, in proportion to the size and thickness of the bone.
Longitudo uero eius etiam secundum quod possibile est tibi ad operationem.	 Its length also according to what is possible for you in working with it.
Et habeat duas extremitates, sicut uides: et extremitas una sit ampla, et altera stricta.	 And it should have two ends, as you see: and one end should be wide and the other narrow.
Si autem disruptio uulneris quod scidisti quando extraxisti sathaiatum ossis, est ampla, et securaris ab apostemate calido: tunc aggrega duo labia uulneris cum sutura.	 If however the gap of the wound that you cut when you removed the bone splinter is wide and you are safe from inflammation, then bring together the two lips of the wound with a stitch.
Et si disruptio est parua, aut times apostema calidum: tunc imple uulnus cum pannis, et puluillis secundum quantitatem scissurae uulneris.	 And if the wound is small or you suspect a warm abscess, then fill the wound with cloths and fine wool according to the size of the wound.
Quod si accidat apostema calidum, tunc infunde pannum in oleo rosato, et aceto, et uino, et pone super ipsum.	 If a warm abscess occurs, then soak a cloth in rose oil, vinegar, and wine, and place it on the wound.
Strictura uero ossis quando est absque uulnere, et absque sectione, est, ut ponas super os emplastrum factum ex farina molendini cum albugine oui.	 But a stricture of the bone without a wound or incision should be treated by placing on it an ointment made from flour and egg white.
Et pone stuppam lenem super ipsum.	 And place soft tow on top of it.
Deinde pone spheram sub titillico eius, si indiges illa.	 Then place a weight under its heel if necessary.  />
Deinde accipe himematem, id est, rotam quam tenent Saraceni, quae sit longa ualde: et sit latitudo eius palmi unius, aut circiter illud.	 Then take a bandage, that is, a roll as the Saracens use, which should be very long; its width should be one palm or about that.
Deinde pone puluillum duplicatum super stuppam et emplastrum.	 Then place a doubled piece of wool on top of the tow and ointment.
Deinde accipe astellam ex tabula subtili, cuius latitudo sit trium digitorum, et in longitudine similiter.	 Then take a splint from a thin board, whose width should be three fingers, and similarly in length.
Deinde inuolue eam in panno.	 Then wrap it in cloth.
Deinde inuolue pannum illum cum astella in loco alhimemati qui cadit super fracturam et locum.	 Then wrap the cloth with the splint in the place of the bandage that falls over the break and the place.
Deinde pone alhimemati super fracturam sicut reuoluiur, et inuolue eam super collum eius, et sub titillico eius sano, et sub titillico eius infirmo: et reduc eam super omnem partem, et quomodo uides quod strictura tenet fracturam strictura decenti: et est illud, quod non occultatur super te, et totum, ut non remoueatur astella desuper os fractum.	 Then place the bandage over the break as it was rolled, and wrap it around its neck and under its sound heel and under its damaged heel; and bring it back over every part, so that the stricture holds the break well: and this should not be hidden from you, nor removed, lest the splint slip off the broken bone.  />
Et propter hoc oportet, ut aspicias infirmum in omni die.	 And therefore it is necessary that you examine the patient every day.
Quotiens ergo mollificatur ligamentum, et uides astellam iam remoueri: tunc rectifica illud, et stringe ligamentum.	 Whenever the bandage softens and you see that the splint has already slipped off, then straighten it and tighten the bandage.
Deinde pone somnum infirmi super dorsum eius, et pone sub titillico eius apud somnum eius puluinar paruum in nocte, ut cum eo eleuetur adiutorium eius a latere ipsius.	 Then place the patient's back on his back, and place under his heel, by his bedside, a small pillow at night, so that with it his support is raised from his side.
Eleuatur ergo fractura furculae per eleuationem humeri.	 The fracture of the clavicle is healed by raising the arm.
Aut liga brachium eius ad collum ipsius: et non soluas ligamentum, si non accidat in loco accidens ex pruritu, aut ab apostemate, usque ad duodecim dies.	 Or tie the arm of that person to their own neck; and do not untie the bandage if it is not happening in the place of the injury due to itching or from a swelling, until twelve days have passed.
Deinde renoua emplastrum, si uideris faciem eius ad illud.	 Then renew the plaster if you see the face turning towards it.
Et adde in strictura, et dimitte ipsum, donec restauretur et coaguletur.	 And add tightness, and leave it until it is restored and solidified.
Et fractura quidem furculae stringitur et confortatur secundum plurimum in uigintiocto diebus: et quandoque fit in quibusdam hominibus in minore illo.	 And indeed the fracture of the clavicle is strengthened and reinforced most in twenty-eight days, and sometimes it happens more quickly in certain individuals.
¶ De restauratione fracturae Spatulae.	 ¶ On the healing of a scapula fracture.
Caput VII.	 Chapter Seven.
Raro frangitur Spatula, et in loco lato eius: et non franguntur ex ea nisi margines eius.	 The scapula is rarely broken, and only in its broad part; and from it nothing breaks except its edges.
Quando ergo frangitur ex eo locus, et frangitur in medio eius, et non cognoscitur illud nisi per tactum: tunc secundum quod est figura fracturae conare praeparationem eius.	 When it is broken in that place, and it breaks in the middle of it, and this is not known except by touch; then according to how the fracture appears prepare it.  />
Et reduc eam super figuram naturalem omni modo ingenii, quod est tibi possibile.	 And bring it back to its natural form in every way possible for you.
Deinde pone super locum puluerem molendini cum albugine oui, et stuppam lenem, et pone desuper puluillum ex panno duplato.	 Then place on the site powder of flour with the white of an egg and soft flax, and put a little bit of doubled cloth over it.
Deinde pone super ipsum astellam latam ex tabula subtili secundum quantitatem Spatulae totius, aut ampliorem ea parum.	 Then place on it a broad splint made of thin board according to the size of the entire scapula, or slightly larger than that.
Si uero sub astella est concauitas in aliquo locorum Spatulae, tunc aequa illam concauitatem cum stuppa leni, donec descendat astella secundum aequalitatem.	 If however there is a hollow beneath the splint in any place of the scapula, then fill that hollow with soft flax until the splint descends to an even level.  />  />  •
Deinde ftringe desuper cum alhimemati longa, constrictione decenti, et firmitudine astellae, donec non remoueatur a loco suo.	 Then fasten over it with a long bandage, of decent tightness and firmness of the splint, so that it is not moved from its place.  />  •
Et considera ligamentum in omni die.	 And examine the bandage every day.
Quotienscunque ergo mollificatur ligamentum, stringe ipsum, et aequa astellam si remoueatur a loco suo: et iaceat infirmus super latus suum sanum.	 Whenever the bandage becomes loose, tighten it and if the splint is moved from its place, even out the splint; and let the patient lie on their sound side.
Et Spatula quidem restauratur in uiginti diebus, aut in uigintiquinque diebus.	 And a spatula is restored in twenty days, or in twenty-five days.
Quando ergo completur iste numerus, tunc solue ligamentum: et tu sis in securitate.	 Therefore, when this number is completed, then release the bandage, and you will be secure.
Nam ipsa est ex ossibus quorum communitio non timetur, neque eorum solutio.	 For it [the bone] is of bones whose separation is not to be feared, nor their loosening.
Si autem procedat ex osse frustum, et pungit sub cute: tune scinde super ipsum, et aufer ipsum.	 But if it proceeds from a fragment of bone and pricks under the skin, then cut along with it and remove it.
Et fac quod diximus in fractura furculae ex sedatione apostematis calidi, si accidat ex eo aliquid.	 And do what we said about a fracture of the collarbone due to the subsidence of a hot abscess, if anything happens from it.
¶ De restauratione fracturae Pectoris.	 ¶ About the restoration of a rib fracture.
Caput VIII.	 Chapter Eight
Pectus quandoque frangitur in medio sui, et raro accidit illud.	 The chest is sometimes broken in its middle part, and this happens rarely.
Extremitates eius quidem plurimum franguntur, et comminuuntur ex accidentibus eius.	 Its extremities are frequently broken and crushed by its accidents.
Quando frangitur eius medium, quod declinat ad inferiora, et accidit ei dolor uehemens, et difficultas in anhelitu, et tussis: et fortasse euomit sanguinem, et declaratur concauitas in osse fracto, et non occultatur sensui, Restauratio eius est, ut resupinetur infirmus super dorsum suum: et pone inter Spatulas eius puluinar.	 When its middle part is broken and bends towards the lower [part], and there is a severe pain, and difficulty in breathing, and coughing; and perhaps it vomits blood, and the concavity of the broken bone is noticeable to the senses, the restoration is that the patient should be made to lie on his back: and place a pillow between its blades. 》
Deinde preme humeros eius, et aggrega costas a duabus partibus uel lateribus cum manibus: et subtiliare in aequatione eius, secundum omnem modum quo possibile est illud et conuenit, donec redeat figura ossis, secundum quod oportet.	 Then press its shoulders and gather its ribs from both sides or the flanks with hands; and make them equal in thickness according to all possible ways that are appropriate until the shape of the bone returns as it should be. 》
Deinde pone super ipsum emplastrum et stuppam, et pone desuper astellam ex tabula subtili ex salice, aut chalingi, et ex eis similibus in leuitate, postquam tu inuoluis eam in panno.	 Then place on it a plaster and wool, and place on top of them a splint made from thin wood such as willow or hazel, or similar light woods, after you have wrapped the [ribs] in cloth.
Deinde subtiliare in ligando eam super os fractum, ut non remoueatur: et uade cum ligatura secundum rotunditatem ad dorsum aliquotiens, et stringe ipsum strictura decenti.	 Then make it even and tie it over the broken bone so that it does not move; and go with the bandage following its roundness to the back several times, and bind it tightly with a decent tightness. 》
Deinde considera ligaturam in omni hora, et quotienscumque mollificatur, stringe eam: et si necessitas eius prouocat ad solutionem eius apud pruritum, uel corrosionem quae accidit in loco, aut dolorem, aut apostema: tunc propera, et solue eam, et eradica emplastrum, et rectifica quod accidit cum modo curationis eius.	 Then consider the ligature at any time, and whenever it becomes soft, tighten it; and if its necessity calls for its loosening due to itching or corrosion that occurs in the place, or pain, or an abscess: then hurry, and loosen it, and remove the poultice, and correct what happens with its method of treatment.
Deinde reduc emplastrum, si uides ad illud faciem: et annecte ei stricturam, donec sanetur.	 Then return the poultice if you see a pus-like substance; and attach to it a ligature until it heals.
¶ De restauratione Costarum, quando franguntur.	 About the restoration of ribs when they are broken.
Caput IX.	 Chapter IX
Scias, quod Costarum fractura non accidit, nisi in locis grossis quae sequuntur dorsum, et ex extremitatibus earum ab anteriori parte.	 Know that the breaking of ribs does not occur except in thick places which follow the back, and from their ends on the front part.
Et non accidit eis attritio, nisi propterea, quia sunt cartilaginosae.	 And they do not break except because they are made of cartilage.
Et cognitio ipsius non occultatur sensui apud inquisitionem cum digitis.	 And the recognition of it is not hidden from the sense by examination with the fingers.
Et restauratio eius fit ita, ut aeques fracturam cum digitis secundum modum possibilem, donec aequetur figura, secundum quod oportet.	 And its restoration is done thus: that you make the broken part even with your fingers as much as possible, until it matches the shape, as is necessary.
Deinde emplastra, et stringe os fractum cum astella, si indiget illo.	 Then apply a poultice and bind the broken bone with a splint if it needs it. 》
Et si fractura Costarum est decliuis ad interiora: tunc accidit infirmo dolor uehemens, et punctura, sicut punctura illa quae accidit illi qui habet pleuresim: propterea, quod os pungit uelamen, et etiam ei accidit difficultas anhelitus, et tussis, et uomitus sanguinis multi: et haec est difficilis curationis.	 And if the break of the ribs is inclined towards the inside: then a severe pain and stabbing occurs, just like that which happens to one who has pleurisy; because the bone pricks the membrane. And also difficulty in breathing, coughing, and vomiting of much blood occurs; and this is difficult to cure.
Et iam ingeniati sunt antiqui in ea cum ingeniis multis: et ex eis sunt qui dicunt, ut ponas cibos infirmi qui generent inflammationem et uentositatem, ut inflammetur uenter, et extendatur, et impellatur fractura ad exteriora.	 And the ancients have already devised many ingenious methods for it; and among them are those who say that you should give to the sick person foods that generate inflammation and flatulence, so that the stomach is inflamed and swollen and the break is pushed outwards. 》
Nos uero abhorremus, ut non fiat caussa uelox ad faciendum apostema calidum, si non accidit.	 But we absolutely reject doing this, lest a hot abscess be formed quickly if it is not already present.
Si autem iam accidit, tunc addit in eo.	 If however it has already happened, then he adds it in that (case).
Et dixerunt quidam eorum: ponatur super locum uentosa, deinde sugatur cum fortitudine, et est similius ratiocinationi.	 And some of them said: let there be placed over the wound a bellows, then let it be sucked out with strength, and this is more similar to reasoning.
Verumtamen timetur, quod attrahat uentosa superfluitates ad locum, propter dispositionem debilitatis.	 Nevertheless, one should fear that the bellows will attract superfluities to the place, due to the weakness of the body's condition.
Et dixerunt quidam eorum: oportet ut cooperiatur locus cum lana quae iam submersa est in oleo calido: et ponantur puluilli inter Costas, donec impleatur: ut sit ligatura aequalis quando inuoluis eam secundum rotunditatem.	 And some of them said: the wound should be covered with wool that has been soaked in hot oil; and between the ribs there should be placed small pieces (of cloth) until it is filled, so that when it is wrapped around it will make an equal bandage according to its roundness.
Deinde curetur infirmus curatione pleuresis ex cibo et medicina.	 Then the patient should be treated with a pleural cure made from food and medicine.
Quod si coartat infirmum res uehemens, quam non tolerat, et os pungit uelamen punctura laedente, et timemus super infirmum: tunc oportet, ut scindamus super locum, et detegamus a Costa fracta.	 But if something violent happens to the patient, which he cannot bear, and his face is pricked with a piercing pain, and we fear for the patient's life; then it is necessary to cut open the place and expose the broken rib.
Deinde ponamus super ea instrumentum quod conseruat sifac, cuius rememoratio praecessit: et incidamus os cum facilitate, et incidamus ipsum.	 Then we shall place over it the instrument that preserves the siphon, of which the description has been given previously; and we shall cut the bone with ease, and cut through it.
Deinde aggregemus duo labia uulneris, si est magnum cum sutura: et curemus ipsum cum emplastris, donec sanetur.	 Then we shall join together the two lips of the wound, if it is large, with a stitch; and we shall treat it with plasters until it heals.
Quod si accidat interim apostema calidum, tunc propera, et infunde puluillos in oleo rosato, et pone super locum: et curetur infirmus cum eo quod conuenit apostemati.	 But if a hot abscess occurs in the meantime, then hasten and pour small pieces into rose oil, and place them over the site; and the patient should be treated with what is suitable for an abscess.
Interim etiam resupinetur super latus super quod dormit, donec sanetur.	 Meanwhile, he should also lie on his side on which he sleeps, until he recovers.
¶ De restauratione fracturae Spondilium dorsi et colli.	 ¶ On the restoration of a fracture of the vertebrae of the back and neck.
Caput X.	 Chapter 10
Ossibus quidem colli quandoque aduenit fractura, et raro accidit eis attritio: et similiter Spondilibus dorsi etiam.	 For the bones of the neck, a fracture sometimes occurs, and rarely an abrasion; similarly also for the vertebrae of the back.
Cum ergo accidit illud alicui, et uis scire, an sanetur, an non sanetur: tunc confidera.	 When this happens to someone and you want to know whether it will heal or not heal, then observe.
Nam si uides manus eius iam mollificatas, et stupefactas, et mortuas: et non potest mouere eas, neque extendere eas, neque constringere eas: et quando constringis eas cum digitis tuis, et pungis eas cum acu, non sentit illud, et non sentit in eis dolorem: tunc scias, quia non sanatur, et in pluribus dispositionibus est mortale.	 For if you see that the person’s hands are already softened, numbed, and lifeless, and they cannot move them or extend them or clench them; and when you try to clench their fingers with your own and prick them with a needle, they do not feel it and experience no pain: then know that the condition is incurable and is often fatal.
Quod si mouet eas, et sentit in eis constrictionem cum digitis et puncturam: tunc scias, quia nucha ossis salua est, et quod infirmus sanabitur cum curatione.	 But if they can move their hands and feel the clenching with your fingers and the pricking with a needle: then know that the neck of the bone is intact, and that the patient will heal with proper care.
Quod si eueniat Spondilibus dorsi simile illius, et uis scire, an sanetur etiam, an non: tunc considera ad pedes eius: tunc si uides quod mollificati sunt, et accidit in eis illud quod accidit in manibus: deinde quando iacet super dorsum suum, egreditur uentositas et egestio absque uoluntate: et quando resupinatur super uentrem suum, egreditur egestio sine uoluntate: et quando resupinatur super dorsum suum, et uult mingere, et non potest: tunc scias, quia est mortale.	 But if the same thing happens to the vertebrae of the back, and you wish to know whether it will also heal or not: then observe the person’s feet. For if they are softened and experience what was described for the hands; and when lying on their back, there is a release of wind and waste without control; and when turned onto their stomach, there is a release of waste without control; and when lying on their back and wish to urinate but cannot: then know that it is fatal.  />
Non ergo labores in curatione eius.	 Do not bother with treating him.
Si uero non accidit ei aliquid ex illo, res est leuior.	 But if none of these things happen to him, then the condition is less severe.
Et curatio eius quod accidit ex illo est, ut coneris sedationem apostematis calidi: ita, ut ponas super Spondilem attritam oleum rosatum solum: aut cum uitellis oui assati.	 And the treatment for what happened is to try to reduce the hot swelling in this way: place crushed rose oil alone on the vertebra, or with fried egg yolks.
Pone super ipsam illud aliquotiens in die, donec quando sedatur apostema calidum: tum pone super locum unum ex emplastris confortantibus, exiccantibus, et stringe super ipsum cum ligamento: et praecipe infirmo, ut utatur quiete et tranquillitate.	 Apply this to the area several times a day until the hot swelling subsides; then place one of the strengthening and drying plasters on it and bind it firmly with a bandage. Advise the patient to rest and remain calm.
Nec dormiat super partem cum qua inuenit dolorem, donec sanetur.	 He should not sleep on the part where he feels pain until it is healed.
Quod si accidit apud attritionem ossis sathaiatum, aut aliquid quod iam separatum fit ex eo: tunc oportet, ut seces super cutem, et auferas illud.	 If it happens at the site of a fractured bone or any detached part: then it is necessary to make an incision over the skin and remove that.
Deinde aggrega duo labia uulneris, si est magnum, cum sutura.	 Then bring together the two lips of the wound with stitches, if it is large.
Deinde cura ipsum cum aliquo incarnatiuo, ex unguentis, donec sanetur.	 Then care for him with some ointment until he is healed.
Si uero frangitur postremum ossis alhausos, et est finis caudae: tunc oportet, ut intromittas pollicem manus sinistrae in anum, et aeques os fractum manu altera, secundum quod possibile est, et secunda aequatione.	 But if the last bone of the tail is broken: then it is necessary to introduce your left thumb into the anus and align the broken bone with your other hand as best you can, and re-align after the first alignment.
Deinde pone super ipsum, et aufer ipsum: et cura uulnus cum curatione quae praecessit, donec sanetur.	 Then place him on his side and remove it; and care for the wound with the preceding treatment until he is healed.
¶ De restauratione Anchae.	 ¶ On the restoration of the anus.
Caput XI.	 Chapter 11.
Raro franguntur ossa Ancharum.	 The bones of the anus are rarely broken.  />
Quod si franguntur, tunc fractura eorum non est, nisi comminutio in extremitatibus ipsorum: et scinduntur in longitudine, et declinantur ad interiora: et accidit infirmo dolor in loco, et punctura: et stupescit crus quod frangitur.	 If they are broken, then the break is not complete but a splintering at their extremities; and they split lengthwise and turn towards the inside; and pain occurs in that place with tenderness, and the leg that is broken becomes numb.
Et restauratio quidem eius est, ut extendas manum tuam super ipsum, donec stes super fracturam qualiter est figura eius.	 And its restoration is to place your hand over it until you are standing above the break as its shape shows.
Quod si fractura est in extremitatibus eius tantum, tunc aequa illam fracturam, secundum quod praeparatur tibi ex aequatione, donec assimiletur figurae suae naturali.	 If the break is only at its extremities, then align it as you prepare from the alignment until it conforms to its natural shape.  /> 
Si autem fractura est in longitudine, aut iam declinat ad interiora: tunc fac iacere infirmum super uentrem suum, donec praeparetur tibi restauratio illius fracturae.	 But if the break is lengthwise or has already turned towards the inside, then have the patient lie on his stomach until you are ready to restore that break.
Quando ergo aequaueris ipsam, pone super ipsam emplastrum: deinde pone super ipsam astellam ex ligno, aut ex cute: et stringe strictura super quam non timeas permutationem fracturae, neque remotionem astellae.	 So when you have aligned it, place a plaster over it; then place over it a splint of wood or leather and bind it with a bandage that will not cause displacement of the break nor movement of the splint.
Et aequa concauitatem illorum cum eo quod impleat eam, donec capiat eam strictura secundum aequalitatem: et praecipe infirmo, ut dormiat super dorsum suum, aut super latus suum sanum.	 And make the cavity of those equal with that which fills it, until the stricture takes it equally; and instruct the patient to sleep on their back or on their healthy side.
Si autem accidat ei apostema calidum: tunc cessa ab extensione eius, et ipsius restauratione, donec sedetur apostema calidum: et pone super ipsum quod sedet ipsum, secundum quod praecessit, deinde redi ad restaurationem eius: et stringe ipsum sicut oportet.	 But if a hot abscess occurs: then cease from extending it and its restoration until the hot abscess settles; and place upon it what settles it, as was said before, then return to restoring it; and tighten it as necessary.
Si uero accidit in osse satagie, aut comminuitur, extrahe.	 But if it occurs in a bony protuberance or is fractured, extract it.
¶ De restauratione fracturae Adiutorii.	 ¶ On the restoration of the fracture of the thumb.
Caput XII.	 Chapter Twelve
Adiutorium est illud, quod est inter cubitum usque ad caput Spatulae.	 The thumb is that which is between the elbow and the end of the palm.
Si ergo frangitur, tunc restauratio eius est secundum unum duorum modorum.	 Therefore, if it breaks, its restoration is according to one of two methods.
Quorum unus est: ut accipias lignum planum mediae grossitudinis, secundum hanc formam, quae sequitur.	 One of which is: that you take a flat wood of medium thickness, according to this shape which follows.
Et ligentur in duabus extremitatibus duo ligamenta.	 And two bands are bound at the two ends.
Deinde suspendatur ex loco eleuato: et sedeat infirmus super sedem.	 Then it is suspended from a high place; and the patient sits on a seat.  ?>
Deinde proiiciat brachium suum fractum super lignum, donec perueniat ad titillicum eius, in cuius medio sit annexa curuitas ligni.	 Then he lets his broken arm fall onto the wood until it reaches its tip, where in the middle of which is attached a curvature of the wood.
Deinde suspende desuper ipsum aliquid graue, ut extendat ipsum minister ad inferiora.	 Then place something heavy on top of it so that the assistant extends it downwards.
Deinde aequet medicus fracturam manibus suis simul, donec redeat fractura, secundum quod oportet.	 Then the physician sets the fracture with his hands at the same time until the fracture returns as necessary.
Et modus alter est, ut resupinetur infirmus super ceruicem suam: et suspende manum eius a collo ipsius cum ligamento.	 And the other method is that the patient lies on their back; and hang his hand from his own neck with a band.
Deinde praecipe duobus ministris, ut teneat unus eorum illud quod est supra fracturam cum manibus suis: et ut alter teneat inferius eius, et extendat unusquisque eorum ad partem suam.	 Then instruct two assistants to hold one of them what is above the fracture with his hands; and that the other holds below it, and each extends towards his own side.
Et si uis, ut sit extensio fortior, tunc stringe sub fractura cum ligamento, et supra ipsam cum ligamento alio: et extendat ea unusquisque duorum ministrorum ad duas partes suas.	 And if you wish for a stronger extension, then bind below the fracture with one band and above it with another; and each of the two assistants extends towards his own side.
Si ergo fractura est propinqua extremitati humeri, tunc oportet, ut ponatur unum ligamentum sub titillico, et alterum sub fractura uersus cubitum.	 If therefore the fracture is near the end of the humerus, then it is necessary that one ligament be placed under the armpit, and another under the fracture towards the elbow.
Et similiter si fractura est propinqua cubito: tunc oportet, ut ponatur ligamentum super illum locum, et super cubitum ipsum.	 And similarly, if the fracture is near the elbow, then it is necessary that a ligament be placed over that spot and over the elbow itself.
Deinde aequa fracturam cum facilitate absque labore, donec quando aequatur fractura secundum quod oportet, et applicatur applicatione bona: tunc stringe eam, si non accidit apostema calidum.	 Then equalize the fracture with ease and without effort until when the fracture is aligned as it should be and a good application is made: then tighten it, unless a hot abscess occurs.
Si uero accidit apostema calidum, tunc dimitte stricturam usque ad diem septimum.	 But if a hot abscess occurs, then loosen the bandage until the seventh day.
Et pone super ipsum lanam succidam imbibitam in aceto et oleo rosato, donec quando quiescit apostema: tunc stringe eam: et modus stringendi eam est, ut ponas emplastrum super fracturam.	 And place on it wool soaked in vinegar and rose oil until the abscess quiets down: then tighten it: and the way to tighten it is to place a poultice over the fracture.
Deinde pone inuolutionem ex panno nouo super emplastrum.	 Then wrap a new cloth bandage over the poultice.
Deinde aggreget brachium super adiutorium ipsum, et ponat manum suam apertam super humerum suum.	 Then raise the arm to the support, and place his open hand on his shoulder.
Et pone pannum, et stringe super adiutorium brachium, ut brachium stet loco astellarum: si non prohibet te ab illo aliquid, neque alteretur super te aliquid ex osse fracto.	 And wrap and bind the arm to the support so that the arm stands in place of a crutch: unless something prevents you or anything changes due to the broken bone.
Quod si times, quod alteretur super te ex osse fracto aliquid, tunc utere astellis: et est, ut ponas super fracturam ipsam astellam quae sit latior et fortior reliquis astellis.	 But if you fear that something may change due to the broken bone, then use crutches: and it is that you should place a wider and stronger crutch over the fracture itself.
Et ponas inter omnem astellam latitudinem digiti: et sit longitudo astellarum secundum fracturam cum additione trium digitorum ab omni parte.	 And between each crutch, place a finger's width of space: and the length of the crutches should be according to the fracture with an additional three fingers from every side.  />
Deinde stringe super astellas strictura quam dixi in principio capituli.	 Then bind over the crutches the bandage I mentioned at the beginning of the chapter.  />  />  />
Et est, ut sit strictura tua super locum fracturae strictior.	 And it is that your bandage should be tighter over the place of the fracture.
Et quanto plus elongatur fractura, sit strictura minor.	 And the more the fracture extends, the less should the bandage be.
Si ergo uides situm astellarum et stricturam, sicut diximus, in hora qua restauras membrum statim, tunc fac: et si times apostema calidum, tunc dimitte stricturam et astellas usque ad diem septimum, sicut diximus.	 If you see the position of the stars and the constriction, as we have said, immediately in the hour when you restore the limb, then do this: but if you fear a hot abscess, then leave the constriction and the stars until the seventh day, as we have said.
Deinde considera ligamentum in omnibus tribus diebus, ut non accidat in loco pruritus, aut inflatio, aut prohibeatur cibus peruenire ad membrum, propter dispositionem superfluitatis stricturae.	 Then consider the bond for three days, so that itching or swelling does not occur in the place, or food is prevented from reaching the limb because of the disposition of the superfluity of constriction.
Rectifica ergo illud totum, secundum quod diximus.	 Therefore correct all of that, as we have said.
Si uero es super fiduciam, ut non accidat ex illo aliquid: tunc non soluas ligamentum, nisi post tres dies, aut plus.	 But if you are confident that nothing will happen from it, then do not loosen the bond until after three days, or more.
Et sit dormitio infirmi super dorsum suum, et manus eius super stomachum suum: et pone sub adiutorio culcitram plenam lana aequaliter.	 And let the patient sleep on his back, and his hand on his belly; and place under his aid a cushion filled equally with wool.
Et considera in omni hora noctis, aut diei, ut non soluatur figura membri fracta, aut mollificetur ligamentum.	 And be mindful at every hour of the night or day, that the shape of the broken limb is not loosened or the bond softened.
Rectifica ergo illud totum uirtute tua.	 Therefore correct all of this with your strength.
Et pone cibum infirmi secundum ordinem quem praemisimus, ita ut sit cibus subtilis in primis, donec incipiat os stringi: tunc oportet, ut ingrosses cibum eius.	 And give the patient's food according to the order that we have described previously, so that it is fine at first, until the mouth begins to dry out; then it is necessary to thicken his food.
De consuetudine enim adiutorii et cruris est, ut stringatur in quadraginta diebus: tunc ergo oportet, ut soluatur, et administretur balneum, et medicetur cum unguentis quae rectificant illud.	 For the custom of aid and leg is that it should be tight for forty days; then therefore it is necessary to loosen it, and administer a bath, and treat with ointments that correct this.
Quod si fractura fuerit foeda, attrita: tunc non soluas ab ea ligamentum et astellas usque ad quinquaginta dies, et usque ad duos menses.	 But if the break is ugly and ground down, then do not loosen from it the bond and stars until fifty days, and even two months.
¶ De restauratione fracturae Brachii.	 ¶ On the restoration of a broken arm.
Caput XIII.	 Chapter XIII.
Brachium est compositum ex duobus ossibus, quae nominantur duo focilia.	 The arm is composed of two bones, which are called the two forearms.
Quorum unum est paruum: et est illud quod sequitur pollicem.	 Of these, one is smaller; and it is that which follows the thumb. ‌
Et alterum est magnum, et est illud quod est positum sub paruo ab inferiori parte.	 And another is large, and it is that which is placed under the small one from the lower part.
Fortasse ergo frangitur focile maius solum, aut paruum: et fortasse franguntur simul.	 Perhaps therefore only the larger forceps breaks, or perhaps the smaller one; and perhaps they both break at once.
Quando ergo frangitur focile paruum superius, tunc restauratio eius est facilis, et sanatio eius est facilior.	 Therefore when the small upper forceps breaks, then its restoration is easy, and its healing is easier.
Et quando frangitur focile inferius, est fractura eius mala, et sanatio eius difficilis.	 And when the lower forceps breaks, its breakage is bad, and its healing is difficult.
Et deterior ea est, quando franguntur duo ossa simul.	 And worse still when two bones are broken at once.
Si ergo os quod frangitur est focile parum superius, tunc conuenit medico apud restaurationem eius, ut ponat extensionem paruam cum facilitate, donec aequet ipsum.	 If therefore the bone that is broken is the small upper forceps, then it is fitting for the physician in its restoration to place a small extension with ease until he makes it even.
Si uero focile magnum est illud quod fractum est: tunc oportet, ut ponat stricturam fortiorem ualde.	 If however it is the large forceps that has been broken, then it is necessary to place a very strong extension.
Et oportet, ut ponat figuram manus apud restaurationem eius, et ipsius extensionem extensam super puluinar.	 And it is necessary for him to place the figure of the hand in its restoration, and its extension extended over the cushion.
Et sit pollex manus ad superiora altior omnibus digitis: et sit articularis inferior omnibus digitis, uel reliquis: et infirmus sedens quadratus super seipsum, et sit puluinar coram eo, uel in directo eius, in altitudine, ut non incurrat infirmus laborem.	 And let the thumb of the hand be higher than all the fingers; and let the lower joint of the thumb be higher than all the digits or others; and let the patient sit squarely on himself, and let the cushion be before him, or directly in front of him, at a height so that the patient does not incur labor.  />
Deinde extendat minister Brachium ab inferiori parte, aut manu sua, aut cum ligamento.	 Then let the assistant stretch the arm from below with his hand or with a bandage.
Et minister alius extendat desuper similiter.	 And let another assistant extend it similarly from above.
Deinde aequet medicus os, donec reducat ipsum secundum meliorem figuram quam potest.	 Then let the physician make the bone even until he brings it back to the best shape he can.
Quod si in fractura ossis sunt satagiae, tunc conare reducere omne frustum in loco suo uirtute tua.	 If there are splinters in the bone break, then strive to bring each fragment back to its place with your strength.  />  />  />
Si uero apparet in eo sathaiatum separatum, et pungit cutem, et non est tibi spes in restauratione eius: tunc finde super ipsum, et aufer ipsum secundum modum quem diximus in eis quae praemissa sunt.	 But if it appears to be a separate splinter that pricks the skin and there is no hope for its restoration, then shave over it and remove it according to the manner we have said before.
Si autem fractura est cum uulnere, ego iam feci ad illud capitulum singulare, ergo accipe curationem illius inde.	 If however the fracture is with a wound, I have already made a special chapter for that, therefore take the treatment from there.
Quod si accidat in principio tuae restaurationis apostema calidum, tunc line pannum cum caeroto facto ex oleo rosato, et caera alba, et sit medium inter spissitudinem et subtilitatem: et stringe pannum super ipsum strictura subtili, donec quando sedatur apostema: tunc remoue caerotum, et pone emplastrum praeparatum ex puluere molendini cum albumine oui.	 If a hot abscess occurs at the beginning of your healing, then take a cloth made from rose oil and white wax, with a consistency between thick and thin; bind the cloth over it with a fine bandage until the abscess subsides; then remove the wax, and apply an emplastrum prepared from millstone powder and egg white.
Deinde pone astellas, et sit astella quae ponitur super fracturam ipsam latior parumper, et fortior.	 Then place a compress, and let the compress that is placed directly over the break be somewhat wider and stronger.
Et scias, quod numerus astellarum Brachii est sex in pluribus dispositionibus: siue sit fractura in focili uno, aut in duobus focilibus simul.	 And know that the number of compresses for the arm is six, arranged in various ways; whether the break is in one or two joints at once.
Deinde pone stricturam tuam super locum fracturae fortiorem et uehementiorem, et aliquanto plus cum strictura ad superiora fracturae, aut ad inferiora eius: aut pone stricturam molliorem strictura eius parumper, secundum quod praecessit rememoratio eius in principio capituli.	 Then place your bandage over the break stronger and more vigorous, and somewhat tighter towards the upper part of the break or its lower part; or place a softer bandage for a short time, as has been mentioned at the beginning of the chapter.
Et sint panni qui inuoluuntur super fracturam, panni lenes, humidi: et non sint duri, asperi.	 And let the cloths that are wrapped around the break be soft and moist; and not hard or rough.
Et sit filum quo stringitur ex lino proprie, medium inter subtile et grossum, sicut narrauimus.	 And let the thread with which it is bound be made of linen, medium between fine and thick, as we have said.
Et considera membrum et ligamentum post dies.	 And examine the member and its ligaments after days.
Quod si accidat aliquid cuius rectificatio sit necessaria, sicut pruritus qui accidit membro: tunc oportet, ut embroces membrum cum aqua calefacta, donec quiescat ille pruritus, et dimittas membrum non constrictum, donec quiescat, deinde itera stricturam.	 If anything happens that requires correction, such as itching that occurs in the member; then it is necessary to bathe the member with warm water until that itching subsides, and leave the member unbound until it subsides; then renew the bandage.
Quod si strictura iam mollificata est, et os iam remotum, et similia illis: tunc rectifica illud totum uirtute tua, et considera iterum.	 If the bandage has already been softened, and the bone has been separated, and similar things; then strengthen that whole with your skill, and examine again.
Nam si nutrimentum prohibetur peruenire ad membrum, propter superfluitatem stricturae, tunc oportet, ut mollifices ipsum parumper, et dimittas ipsum aliquot diebus, donec currat ad ipsum nutrimentum, deinde stringe ipsum.	 For if food is prevented from reaching the member because of the excess tightness of the bandage, then it is necessary to soften it somewhat and leave it for some days until the food can reach it; then bind it again.
Si autem non accidit infirmo aliquid eorum quae diximus, tunc non oportet, ut soluatur, nisi post uiginti dies, aut circiter hos.	 If however nothing happens to the patient from those things which we have mentioned, then it is not necessary that he be bled, except after twenty days or thereabouts.
Deinde suspendatur manus infirmi ad collum eius.	 Then let the hand of the patient be suspended around his neck.
Et sit collum eius aequale, et custodiatur uirtute sua a motibus agitatiuis.	 And let his neck be straight and guarded by its strength from violent movements.
Et fac eum dormire super dorsum suum.	 And make him sleep on his back.
Et scias, quod haec fractura in triginta diebus, aut in triginta duobus diebus restauratur: et fortasse restauratur in uigintiocto diebus.	 And know that this fracture is healed in thirty days, or in thirty-two days, and perhaps it is healed in eighteen days.
Totum illud est secundum dispositiones complexionum, et dispositiones uirtutis.	 All of that depends on the temperaments of the body and the strength of the patient.
¶ De restauratione fracturarum Manus.	 ¶ On the Healing of Fractures of the Hand.
Caput XIIII.	 Chapter XIV
Scias, quod pectini Manus, et nodis digitorum raro accidit fractura.	 Know that a fracture of the bones of the hand and of the joints of the fingers rarely occurs.
Et non accidit ei, nisi attritio multotiens.	 And it does not occur unless there is frequent friction.
Quando ergo accidit plantae fractura, aut attritio: tunc oportet, ut sedeat infirmus quadratus: et coram eo sit sedes secundum aequalitatem.	 Therefore, when a fracture or attrition of the sole occurs, then it is necessary that the patient sit with his back straight, and before him let there be a seat according to its measurement.
Deinde pone Manum eius super eam extensam.	 Then place his hand upon it extended.  /> Si autem accidit infirmo fractura digitorum, tunc oportet, ut ponatur infirmus supinus: et quiescent digiti sui in terra.
Deinde extendat minister ossa fracta, et aequet ea medicus, donec quando coniunguntur coniunctione bona.	 Then let the assistant stretch the broken bones, and let the physician straighten them until they are joined together by a good union.
Tunc oportet, ut ponat emplastrum et stuppam, si non accidat apostema calidum.	 Then it is necessary to place a plaster and wool if there does not occur a hot swelling.
Deinde pone astellam desuper secundum quantitatem loci: et tu iam inuoluisti eam in panno lini.	 Then place a splint on top according to the size of the place, and you have now rolled it up in a linen cloth.
Si autem fractura est ad inferiora circiter uentrem plantae, tunc fac simile spherae ex panno: et praecipe infirmo, ut coartet super eam cum planta sua fracta: deinde stringatur cum panno longo.	 But if the fracture is near the bottom of the sole of the foot, then make something similar to a ball from cloth, and instruct the patient to press on it with his broken sole; then let it be bound with a long cloth.
Et sit astella ex corio, in quo sit lenitas, ut applicetur corium cum corpore plantae: et stringe eam, secundum quod oportet.	 And let the splint be of leather, which has softness, so that the leather may be applied to the body of the sole; and bind it as is necessary.
Si autem fractura est ad exteriora, tunc oportet: ut ponas astellam desuper, et astellam aliam ab inferiori in planta: et sit manus aperta recta.	 If, however, the fracture is on the outer side, then you should place a splint on top and another splint from below on the sole of the foot; and let the hand be held open and straight.
Deinde pone stricturam, sicut reuoluitur manus: et extende inter digitos cum ligamento.	 Then put a bandage around it, as the hand is wrapped: and stretch it between the fingers with a ligament.
Quod si accidat fractura alicui nodorum digitorum, tunc si est pollex, aequetur secundum quod oportet.	 If a fracture happens to any of the joints of the fingers, then if it is the thumb, let it be set as is proper.
Deinde stringatur cum planta: et si amas, pone ei astellam rectam, paruam: ut eleuetur fractura, et non moueatur.	 Then let it be bound with a splint: and if you wish, put a small straight splint on it so that the fracture may be lifted up and not moved.
Si autem fractura est reliquis digitis, sicut medio, et indici, aut auriculari, et anulari, tunc aequetur, et ligetur cum digito sano qui sequitur eum: aut ligentur omnes secundum continuationem: et est melius.	 But if the fracture is in any of the other fingers, such as the middle finger, and index finger, or ring finger, and little finger, then let it be set and bound with the healthy finger that follows it; or let them all be bound together according to their continuation: and this is better.
Aut pone super ipsum astellam paruam, sicut diximus in pollice.	 Or place a small splint on it, as we have said for the thumb.
Et considera in restauratione tua, et post ipsam dispositionem apostematis calidi: et oppone cum eo quod oportet, quando accidit aliquid ex illo, secundum quod iteratur eius narratio.	 And take into account in your restoration and after the arrangement of the warm compress: and apply what is needed when something from it happens, according to its narrative.
¶ De restauratione fracturae Coxae.	 ¶ On the restoration of a hip fracture.
Caput XV.	 Chapter 15.
OS Coxae multotiens frangitur, et declaratur sensui: quoniam conuertitur ad interiorem et posteriorem partem.	 The hip bone is often broken and becomes apparent to the senses because it turns inward and backward.
Et restauratio eius fit ita, quod stringitur ligamentum supra fracturam, et ligamentum aliud sub fractura.	 And its restoration is done thus: that a bandage is tied above the fracture, and another bandage below the fracture. ›
Et infirmus prostretur super faciem suam.	 And let the patient be laid on his back. › ›
Deinde extendat omne ligamentum minister ad partem suam secundum aequalitatem: et hoc, quando est fractura in medio ossis.	 Then let every bandage be extended by the assistant to its respective place according to equality; and this, when the fracture is in the middle of the bone. › › › ›
Si autem est fractura propinqua radici Coxae, tunc sit ligamentum ad partem pectinis, ut cadat extensio ad sursum: et ligamentum aliud sub fractura.	 But if the fracture is near the base of the hip, then let the bandage be at the pubic bone so that the extension goes upward; and another bandage below the fracture.
Et sic similiter si est fractura propinqua genu, tunc sit ligamentum propinquum genu, ut sit extensio ad inferiora.	 And thus likewise if there is a fracture near the knee, then let there be a ligament near the knee, so that it may extend to the lower parts.
Deinde aequet medicus os utriusque manibus suis, donec reducat ipsum secundum similitudinem figurae naturalis: et coniugatur os coniunctione bona.	 Then the physician should adjust the bone with both his hands until he restores it to its natural form: and join the bone with a good union.
Tunc oportet, ut ponas emplastrum et stricturam, si non accidit membro apostema.	 Then you must place a poultice and bandage, if an abscess has not occurred in the limb.
Quod si accidat in eo apostema: tunc dimitte ipsum diebus aliquot, donec sedetur apostema calidum, deinde redi ad curationem tuam.	 But if an abscess occurs in it, then leave it for several days until the hot abscess settles; then return to your treatment.
Strictura autem eius ita sit.	 And its bandage should be like this:
Oportet ut inuoluas super fracturam imema duram, id est, bindam: et dupla eam bis, aut ter: et remaneat ex ea superfluitas.	 You must wrap over the fracture a hard bandage, that is, a splint; and double it twice or three times, and let there be an excess of it.
Deinde inuolue crus, donec perueniat calcaneus apud radicem natis.	 Then wrap the leg until the heel reaches the base of the calf muscle.
Et intromitte filum longum inter Coxam et crus prope genu ad inferiora, et ueniant extremitates fili a superiori parte duarum partium.	 And insert a long thread between the thigh and the leg near the knee towards the lower part, and let the ends of the thread come out from the upper part on both sides.
Deinde reuolue super Crus et Coxam quod superfluit ex alimema.	 Then wrap over the leg and thigh what is in excess of the bandage.
Deinde pone super Coxam in loco fracturae ipsius astellas, et pone ex eis astellam unam super os cruris.	 Then place on the thigh at the site of the fracture itself a splint, and put one splint over the shinbone.
Deinde imple uacuitates inter crus et coxam cum pannis lenibus, ut aequetur strictura.	 Then fill the spaces between the leg and thigh with soft cloths, so that the bandage may be even.
Deinde incipe cum strictura forti a medio super locum fracturae tribus inuolutionibus, aut quatuor.	 Then begin strongly with the bandage from the middle over the site of the fracture with three or four wraps.
Et quanto plus elongaris cum ligamento a loco fracturae, sit strictura tua minor et mollior, et lenior.	 And as you extend more with the bandage from the site of the fracture, let your bandage be smaller and softer and gentler.
Deinde intende ad duas extremitates fili, quod tu intromisisti inter coxam et crus.	 Then attend to the two ends of the thread that you inserted between the thigh and leg. 》
Liga ergo cum utrisque tres astellas quae sunt desuper.	 Tie therefore with both three splints each which are above.
Deinde uade cum duabus extremitatibus fili ad inferiora, donec peruenias ad cauillam pedis.	 Then go with the two ends of the thread towards the lower part until you reach the heel of the foot.
Et cum utrisque stringe etiam extremitates astellarum a parte altera: ut non remoueatur ligamentum ex loco suo.	 And tie both ends of the strings to the other side: so that the ligature is not removed from its place.
Deinde dimitte stricturam super illud, dum permanet, ita quod non accidat membro corrosio, neque apostema, neque inflatio, et similia eis.	 Then leave the bandage on it until it heals, so that no decay, abscess, or swelling, and similar things occur in the limb.
Quod si accidat aliquid ex illo.	 If anything happens from this.
Propera ergo cum solutione eius, et rectifica illud quod accidit inde totum, secundum quod diximus multotiens.	 Therefore hasten with its removal, and correct whatever happened from it entirely, as we have said many times.
Si uero in osse est frustum ex osse quod pungat: tunc oportet, ut aeques illud, si est tibi possibile.	 If however there is a splinter of bone that is piercing, then it is necessary to equalize it, if it is possible for you.
Et si non, finde super illud, et remoue illud: et cura cum eo cuius praecessit rememoratio, donec sanetur.	 And if not, place a bandage over it and remove it; and care for it as we mentioned before, until it heals.
Et quandoque stringitur haec fractura Coxae, praeter quod addantur ei astellae, sicut diximus in adiutorio et brachio.	 And sometimes this fracture of the hip is tied with strings, just as we said for the arm and hand.
Verumtamen in restauratione eius taliter fracta, non accidit infirmo claudicatio.	 However, in the healing of such a fractured one, lameness does not happen to the invalid.
Et si restauratur sola, praeter quod applicetur ei crus alterum, tunc necesse est, ut claudicet ille cuius est, semper.	 And if it is restored alone, without the other leg being applied to it, then it is necessary for that one to always limp.
Et scias, quod Coxa stringitur in quinquaginta diebus, uel additur parum, aut minuitur parum: totum illud est secundum diuersitatem complexionum, et reliquarum dispositionum.	 And know that the hip is tied for fifty days, or a little more, or a little less; all of this depends on the diversity of temperaments and other dispositions.
¶ De restauratione fracturae Rotulae genu.	 ¶ On the healing of the fracture of the patella of the knee.
Caput XVI.	 Chapter XVI.
Scias, quod Rotulae genu raro accidit fractura, sed accidit ei attritio multotiens.	 Know that a fracture of the kneecap happens rarely, but its abrasion occurs often.
Si uero accidit ei fractura, tunc non nisi aut fissura, aut foramen in partibus suis.	 If however it does happen to be fractured, then only either a fissure or a hole in its parts.  /> Et si est fracta Rotula, tunc debet medici cognoscere, utrum est fracta tota, aut fracta pars eius.
Et est illud cum uulnere, et absque uulnere.	 And it is either with a wound or without a wound.
Et statur super illud totum cum sensu.	 And stand on it entirely with the sense of touch.
Et restauratio eius est ita, ut aequetur quod disruptum est ex partibus eius cum digitis, donec aggregetur, et coniungatur secundum quod possibile est ex aequatione et facilitate, et fabricatione.	 And its restoration is thus: that which was disrupted from its parts with fingers, until it is aggregated and joined together as much as possible by equality and simplicity, and construction.
Deinde pone emplastrum ex farina sisami, uel molendini, cum albumine oui: et pone super ipsum astellam rotundam, si indiges illa: et stringe desuper strictura conueniente ad illud.	 Then place a plaster made of sesame flour or from a mill with egg white; and place on top of it a round piece of cloth if you need it; and bind over it an appropriate bandage for that.
Deinde considera omnes dispositiones quas narrauimus in reliquis fracturis: sicut apostema calidum, et similia illi: ita, ut opponas omni accidenti cum eo quod conuenit ei, donec sanetur.	 Then consider all the arrangements we have mentioned for other fractures; such as a hot abscess and similar things; so that you oppose every incident with what is suitable for it, until it heals.
¶ De restauratione fracturae Cruris.	 ¶ About the restoration of a thigh fracture.
Caput XVII.	 Chapter XVII
Scias, quod Cruri sunt duo ossa, quorum unum est grossum, et nominatur nomine Cruris: et alterum subtile, et nominatur Focile.	 Know that the thigh has two bones, one of which is large and is called by the name 'thigh bone', and the other is fine and is called 'tibia'.
Et accidit utrisque ex speciebus fracturae quod accidit duobus ossibus brachii: et propter illud fit restauratio eius, sicut restauratio brachii aequaliter, et operatio est una.	 And it happens to both types of fracture that it happens to the two bones of the arm; and because of this its restoration is done like the restoration of the arm equally, and the operation is one.
Quod si franguntur duo ossa simul, conuertitur Crus ad omnes partes.	 If both bones break at the same time, the leg turns in all directions.
Et si frangitur os subtilius, conuertitur Crus ad anteriorem partem.	 And if the finer bone breaks, the leg turns to the front.
Et si frangitur os grossius, inuenis illud inferius: et est ex eis quae non occultantur tibi.	 And if the larger bone breaks, the leg becomes shorter; and it is one of those which do not conceal itself from you.
Deinde administra extensionem, et aequationem, et ligationem astellarum secundum illud aequaliter.	 Then administer extension, equality, and bandaging of the cloths according to that equally.
Verumtamen oportet, si fractura Cruris est fractura foeda, habens sethagie multa: ut sit extensio minor, et lenior alleuiatione tua.	 However, it is necessary, if the thigh fracture is a foul fracture, having many splinters; that the extension be less and gentler with your alleviation.
Et in Crure quidem est ex operatione quiddam super brachium: et est, ut quando tu aequas astellas, et comples omnem operationem tuam, tunc accipe duas fascias ex ligno pini, quod administratur in fabricatione solariorum quod ponitur sub tabulis: et fiunt ex spatulis palmae: et elige ex eis quibus est grossitudo parua, et neque sint ex minutis: et sit longitudo earum secundum longitudinem Cruris a genu usque inferius.	 And in the case of the thigh there is something more to do than for the arm; and that is, when you have made the cloths equal and completed all your work, then take two strips of wood from pine which are used in the construction of sunrooms placed under the boards: and they are made into palm-sized pieces; and choose those whose thickness is not too great nor are they among the smallest; and their length should be according to the length of the thigh from the knee downwards.  />
Deinde inuolue super unamquamque pannum duabus inuolutionibus secundum longitudinem eius.	 Then wrap around each cloth twice along its length.
Et pone unam partem Cruris a parte una, et alteram a parte altera: et sint ex genu usque inferius pedis.	 And place one part of the leg on one side and the other part on the other side; and they should be from the knee down to the foot.
Deinde liga duas fascias in tribus locis ex duabus extremitatibus et medio.	 Then bind two bandages in three places: at both ends and in the middle.
Cum enim strictura prohibetur, Crus declinat ad dextram et sinistram, et stat statione bona.	 For when constriction is prevented, the leg deviates to the right and left, and it stands firmly in place.
Et iam quidem administretur cunabulum ex ligno secundum longitudinem Cruris, et ponatur in eo Crus, ut conseruet ipsum a motu.	 And now indeed let a cradle be made of wood according to the length of the leg, and place the leg in it so that it may preserve it from motion.
Et plurimum quidem oportet, ut facias illud in fractura quando cum ea est uulnus proprie.	 And indeed you must do this especially in a fracture when there is an associated wound.
Deinde considera Crus in omni die, et stude cum eo studio ultimo ab apostemate, aut inflatione, aut reliquis aliis.	 Then examine the leg every day, and strive with all your might to prevent swelling or inflammation, or any other complications.  ()
Si ergo accidit aliquid ex illis, tunc oppone ei cum eo quod oportet, usquequo sanetur, si Deus uoluerit.	 If therefore any of these things happen, then treat it with what is necessary until it heals, if God wills it.  ()
De fractura ossium Pedis, et Digitorum.	 On the Fracture of the Bones of the Foot and Toes.
Caput XVIII.	 Chapter Eighteen.
Calcaneo quidem non accidit fractura penitus.	 Indeed, the heel bone never breaks completely.
Ossibus uero Pedis accidit quandoque fractura, et Digitis parum etiam accidit fractura: et non accidit eis nisi attritio in pluribus dispositionibus.	 However, the bones of the foot sometimes break, and the toes hardly ever break; and this does not happen to them except by abrasion in many cases.  () ():
Quod si accidit ossibus Pedis fractura, et uides illa ossa sublimari super se adinuicem, tunc ponat infirmus Pedem suum super terram praeparatam, sicut ambulans.	 If the bones of the foot break and you see those bones separate from one another, then let the patient place his foot on prepared ground as if he were walking.  () ():
Deinde sta tu, et pone Pedem tuum super illud quod eleuatur ex illis ossibus: postea preme, uel calca eam: et aequa ipsam, donec redeat in locis suis.	 Then stand on your own foot and place it over the one that is elevated from those bones; afterward press or step on it, and adjust it until it returns to its proper place.
Deinde pone emplastrum, et stuppam desuper: et pone sub uentre Pedis tabulam paruam, cui sint duo capita plana.	 Then apply a poultice and wool on top; and place under the sole of the foot a small board with two flat ends.
Deinde stringe eam cum Pede strictura decenti, postquam tu inuoluis eam cum pannis, et reliquis quibus indiget.	 Then bind it with a proper ligature after you have wrapped it with bandages and other necessities.
Cum ergo praetereunt ei tres dies, aut quatuor, tunc solue ligamentum.	 After three or four days have passed, then loosen the ligature.
Nam tu inuenies ossa aequata, siue sint fracta, aut sint dislocata.	 For you will find that the bones are leveled, whether they were broken or dislocated.
Operatio ergo in eis est, sicut uides.	 The operation is therefore on them, as you see.
Si autem franguntur aliqui digiti, tunc restaura eos, et aequa ipsos secundum quod narraui tibi in restauratione digitorum manus.	 But if some of the fingers are broken, then restore them, and level them as I have told you in the restoration of the fingers of the hand.
Deinde pone digito tuo astellam secundum longitudinem digiti, et sit latior eo parumper: deinde pone sub Pede hanc tabulam quam narraui tibi, et stringe eam strictura decenti.	 Then place a splint on the finger according to its length, and let it be slightly wider; then place this board that I have told you under the ligature, and bind it with a proper ligature.
Si uero quod frangitur ex ossibus est duo, aut tria, aut plus, tunc pone super omnem digitum astellam suae quantitatis, inuolutam in panno lini: et stringe tabulam in inferiori Pedis: et sit stans super unum capitum tabulae extra uentrem Pedis, ut teneat retentione bona.	 But if two, or three, or more of the bones are broken, then place a splint on each finger according to its size, wrapped in linen cloth; and bind the board below the ligature: and let it stand on one end of the board outside the ligature, so that it holds well.
Et conuenit tibi, ut non obliuiscaris, quin consideres omnia quae dixi tibi in reliquis fracturis ex accidentibus quae diximus: et oppone omni accidenti cum eo quod oportet.	 And it is fitting for you not to forget to consider all that I have told you in the other fractures from the accidents that we mentioned; and oppose every accident with what is necessary.
¶ De fractura Vuluae mulieris, et ossis pectinis, et uirgae uiri.	 ¶ On the fracture of a woman's vulva, and the pubic bone, and a man's penis.
Caput XIX.	 Chapter Nineteen.
Quando frangitur Vulua mulieris, tunc fac eam sedere quadratam.	 When a woman’s vulva is broken, then make her sit on a stool.
Deinde inclina eam ad partem dorsi ipsius parumper, et teneatur retro.	 Then incline her slightly towards her back, and let her be held from behind.
Deinde impleat obstetrix Vuluam eius coto, donec impleat eam: et fiat in Vulua ex eo sicut sphera.	 Then let the midwife fill her vulva with cotton until it is full; and let there be a sphere in the vulva from that.
Deinde concutiatur mulier, et eleua dorsum eius paulatim.	 Then let the woman be shaken, and gradually raise her back.  />
Illud enim cotum egreditur, donec fiat ante portam Vuluae sicut sphera, et os fractum redit.	 For that cotton comes out until there is a sphere before the opening of the vulva, and the broken part returns.
Deinde pone puluillum super dorsum eius.	 Then place a little down upon its back.
Quando ergo uult mingere, remoueat cotum cum facilitate, deinde mingat: et reduc ipsum secundum modum, quo intromisisti ipsum in primis: deinde redeat ad puluillum suum primum.	 When he wants to urinate, let him remove the probe easily, then urinate; and put it back as you first inserted it; then return to his little feather.
Faciat illud septem diebus, aut circiter, os ipsum enim restauratur.	 Let him do this for seven days, or thereabouts, until the wound heals.
Et si uis, accipe uesicam ouis, et stringe super foramen eius cannulam arundinis, et intromitte uesicam totam in Vuluam eius.	 And if you wish, take a sheep's bladder and tie a straw tube over its opening, then insert the whole bladder into his wound.
Deinde suffla in cannulam cum uirtute, donec infletur uesica intra Vuluam, fractura enim redit.	 Then blow forcefully into the tube until the bladder inside the wound swells up, for the bone will return to its place.
Deinde impleatur cum coto, et stet aliquot diebus, secundum quod narrauimus, donec sanetur.	 Then fill it with a probe and let it remain for several days, as we have said, until it heals.
Et quando frangitur os Pectinis uiri, aut mulieris, tunc administra in restauratione eius, et ipsius aequatione illud quod narrauimus in osse Anchae.	 And when a man's or woman's breastbone is broken, then administer for its restoration and alignment that which we have mentioned concerning the shinbone.
Et non occultatur rectum in his fracturis propinquis, quae parum contingunt, praecipue cui est quiddam studii, uel usus.	 And the rectum should not be hidden in these nearby fractures which hardly touch it, especially for someone who has some learning or experience. ›
Et intellige librum meum istum multum, quoniam fractura ipsa significat tibi in pluribus dispositionibus uiam rectam in restauratione sui, et strictura sui: intellige ergo.	 And understand this book of mine well, because the fracture itself indicates to you the right way in many arrangements for its restoration and setting; so understand.
In Virga autem uiri quando frangitur, accipe guttur anseris: et intromitte uirgam in ipso.	 But if a man's penis is broken, take the throat of a goose and insert the penis into it.
Deinde pone super ipsum inuolutionem ex panno, et inuoluatur, et dimittatur tribus diebus, aut circiter eos, et sanabitur, si Deus uoluerit.	 Then place a bandage of cloth over it and let it be wrapped up, and leave it alone for three days or thereabouts, and it will heal, if God wills it.
¶ De restauratione fracturae ossium, quando est cum uulnere.	 ¶ Concerning the setting of bone fractures when there is also a wound. ›
Caput XX.	 Chapter 20
Conuenit ei cui accidit fractura cum uulnere, praecipue si est magnum, sicut os coxae, aut adiutorii, aut simile illi, ut properes, et phlebotomes ipsum statim: si attestantur tibi conditiones phlebotomiae, sicut praemisimus.	 It is appropriate for someone who has a fracture with a wound, especially if it is large, such as the hip or thigh bone, to hurry and bleed him immediately: if you find the conditions for bleeding as we have mentioned previously.
Quod si uulnus effluit sanguinem, tunc oportet, ut properes ad abscisionem eius, ita ut puluerizes super ipsum zegi tritum: si non est tibi praesens aliud.	 If the wound is bleeding, you must hasten to cauterize it, so that you sprinkle ground zegi over it; if nothing else is available.
Deinde incipe restaurare fracturam in illo eodem die: et non postponas illud, si non accidit apostema.	 Then begin to restore the fracture on that same day; and do not delay this, unless an abscess occurs.
Si uero accidit apostema calidum, tunc dimitte restaurationem eius usque ad diem nonum, donec sedetur apostema.	 But if a hot abscess occurs, then leave the restoration of it until the ninth day, until the abscess subsides.
Et non appropinques ei in die tertio, et quarto omnino, nam tu faceres ei accidere accidentia mala.	 And do not approach it on the third and fourth days at all, for you would cause bad things to happen to him.
Si autem os fractum est eminens super cutem detectum: tunc oportet, ut coneris reducere ipsum, et aequare ipsum manibus tuis cum facilitate et extensione parua.	 But if the broken bone protrudes above the skin, then you must try to reduce it and make it even with your hands, with gentleness and a small amount of stretching.
Si autem non praeparatur extensio eius, et ipsius aequatio manibus tuis: tunc reduc ipsum cum isto instrumento.	 But if its extension and making it even with your hands are not prepared, then reduce it with this instrument.
Et est instrumentum quod fit ex ferro, cuius longitudo est quantitas septem digitorum, aut octo: et eius latitudo est secundum quantitatem uulneris.	 And the instrument is made of iron, whose length is seven or eight finger-widths; and its width is according to the size of the wound.
Et propter illud necesse est medico, ut accipiat ex eis tria, aut quatuor secundum quantitatem qua indiget ad illud ex curatione in omni specie fracturae.	 And because of this it is necessary for the physician to take three or four of them, according to the quantity needed for that treatment in every type of fracture.
Et sit rotundum: et sit in eo grossitudo parua, ut non duplicetur apud compressionem super ipsum in hora operationis: et sit acutae extremitatis, cui sit margo in extremitatibus suis.	 And let it be round; and let there be a small thickness in it, so that it does not bend during the operation; and let its end be sharp, with an edge at its ends.
Et sit superius eius ad grossitudinem ex medietate eius usque ad inferiora.	 And let its upper part be thick from half of it to the lower part.
Et haec est forma eius.	 And this is its form.
Oportet in Hac Operatione, ut ponatur extremitas eius acuta curuata super extremitatem ossis eminentis: et impelle ipsum cum eo uice una, donec quando redit os et aequatur quadam aequatione.	 In this operation, the sharp end should be placed on the protruding bone; and it should be pushed with one thrust until the bone returns and is made even to some extent.
Conare ergo aequare extremitates fracturae adinuicem.	 Therefore try to make the ends of the fracture even with each other.
Quod si extremitates eius fracta est subtilis, et non accipit eam instrumentum accaeptione bona, tunc opotet, ut incidas extremitatem illius ossis, donec instrumentum potestatem habeat eius.	 But if the ends of the fracture are fine and the instrument does not take them well, then it is necessary to cut the end of that bone, until the instrument has power over it.  \\
Si uero non potes reducere eos cum eo quod narrauimus omnino, tunc incide ipsum cum eo quod conuenit ei ex Incisoriis quae diximus: aut serra ipsum cum una serrarum quocunque modo possibile est tibi.	 If you cannot reduce them by the method we have described, then cut him with a suitable instrument from those we mentioned, or saw him with one of the saws in any way possible for you.
Deinde rade illud quod remanet in osse ex asperitate et corticibus minutis.	 Then scrape off what remains on the bone from roughness and small shells.
Cum ergo reducitur os, et inuenit infirmus post reductionem eius dolorem uehementem laedentem, tunc scias, quod os non rediit ad locum suum naturalem.	 Therefore, when the bone is reduced and the patient experiences severe pain after its reduction, then know that the bone has not returned to its natural place.
Fac ergo illud.	 Do this.
Nam tu confers infirmo iuuamentum magnum, cum completur restauratio tua quam facis ossi.	 For you grant great help to the patient when you complete the restoration that you perform on the bone.
Tunc submerge pannum in uino stiptico, nigro.	 Then dip the cloth in black astringent wine.
Et proprie si est in aestate.	 And especially if it is summer. ›
Et non ponas super uulnus caerotum, neque aliquid in quo sit oleum: ut non faciat accidere in ipso putredinem et corruptionem.	 And do not place a fatty substance or anything containing oil on the wound, so that it does not cause putrefaction and corruption in it.
Deinde administra astellas in hora complementi tui a restauratione ossis.	 Then administer pills at the hour when you complete the bone's restoration.
Et dimitte uulnus detectum: ita, ut incidas cum forficibus foramen in inuolutionibus secundum quantitatem uulneris.	 And leave the wound open: do this by cutting a hole with scissors in the bandages according to the size of the wound. ›
Et caue omni cautela, ne stringas uulnus cum fractura.	 And be very careful not to bind the wound too tightly over the fracture.
Multotiens enim fecerunt istud stolidi medici: et fecerunt accidere super infirmos suos aut mortem, aut corrosionem, aut zuchem, id est, saniem.	 Many times indeed have foolish doctors done this and caused either death or gangrene or purulent matter, that is, pus, to occur in their patients.
Et sit strictura tua mollis, lenis, diuersa stricturae fracturarum reliquarum.	 And let your bandage be soft and gentle, different from the binding of other fractures. › ›
Quod si uulnus est malum, aut est uulnus magnum, et times super ipsum quaedam accidentia mala quae narrauimus, et inuenis dolorem in loco suspensum: tunc non oportet, ut ponas super ipsum astellas.	 If the wound is bad or large and you fear certain evil consequences that we have mentioned, and you find pain in the affected area, then it is not right to place pills on it.
Et fac eis inuolutiones ex pannis duris in loco astellarum, et stringe ipsum cum eis.	 And make bandages of hard cloth where the pills would be and bind it with them.
Cum autem est post diem unum, aut dies duos, et uides uulnus iam incipere, ut in eo generetur pus: tunc aufer desuper ipsum pannum quem posuisti super ipsum cum uino.	 But when it is after one day or two days and you see that the wound has begun to generate pus, then remove from above the cloth which you placed on it with wine. › › › ›
Deinde administra licinia, et unguenta cum quibus de consuetudine nostra est, ut medicemur uulnera: sicut unguentum tetrapharmacon, et similia illi.	 Then administer ointments and unguents with which we are accustomed to treating wounds, such as the four-ingredient ointment, and similar ones.
Et conuenit tibi, ut soluas ligamentum.	 And it is suitable for you to dissolve the bandage.
Et considera uulnus in omni die mane et uespere, donec consolidetur, et sanetur.	 And observe the wound every morning and evening until it heals and consolidates.
Et oportet, ut praeparetur membrum taliter, ut currat ex eo pus ad inferiora cum facilitate.	 And it is necessary that the limb be prepared in such a way that the pus flows down from it easily.
Quod si praetereunt uulneri dies multi, et non consolidatur, neque abscinditur pus ab eo: tunc scias, quod illic sunt satagie ossis parua.	 If many days pass and the wound does not heal nor does the pus separate from it, then know that there are small bone fragments there.
Quare oportet, ut inquiras uulnus cum tenta.	 Therefore, you should examine the wound with a probe.
Quot uero ex illis alsatagie sunt separata, remoue ea, et extrahe ipsa.	 However many fragments are separated out, remove them and extract them.  ///
Et quae ex eis sunt non separata, et pungunt membrum, et faciunt accidere dolorem, conare incidere ea, et auferre ea omni modo quo possibile est tibi illud.	 And those that are not separated and cause pain in the limb, making it hurt, strive to cut them out and remove them by whatever means is possible for you.
Quod si accidat uulneri zuchen, aut ekileten, id est, estiomenus, aut species alia corruptionis et putrefactionis: tunc oportet, ut opponas unicuique ex eis cum eo quod conuenit ei ex curatione, cuius praecessit narratio in capitulo suo.	 If the wound becomes inflamed or develops a carbuncle (which is a stye) or another sign of corruption and putrefaction, then you should apply to each of these what is suitable from its treatment, whose description precedes in its chapter.
Et ex eo in quo oportet ut stet sermo meus, et cui facias praesentem mentem tuam quando frangitur os, et eminet super membrum, sicut os coxae, et adiutorii, et similia eis ex membris magnis, est, ut non praesumas attractionem eius, multotiens enim accidit ex illo mors, imo dimitte ipsum, donec putrefiat.	 And concerning what I have said and to which you should pay attention: when a bone is broken and protrudes from the limb, such as a hipbone or thighbone or similar large bones, do not attempt to reduce it, for often death results from this. Instead, leave it alone until it becomes gangrenous.  /// ///
Fortasse enim cadet per se post uiginti dies, aut triginta.	 Perhaps indeed it will fall out by itself after twenty or thirty days.
Tunc ergo cura uulnus, si uidetur tibi: et sinon, dimitte ipsum.	 Then treat the wound if it appears to you that you should, and if not, leave it alone.
¶ De curatione Nodationis in uestigio fracturae.	 ¶ On the treatment of swelling at the site of a fracture.
Caput XXI.	 Chapter 21
Multoties accidit haec Nodatio in uestigio sanationis fracturae.	 This swelling often occurs as a result of treating a fracture.
Praecipue, quae est prope iuncturas: et foedatur ex ea figura membri.	 Especially when it is near the joints; and it causes deformity in the limb.
Et fortasse prohibet membrum ab operatione sua naturali.	 And perhaps it prevents the limb from performing its natural function.
Considera ergo tunc, si nodatio est recens: administra in ea medicinas quae stipticitatem habent, sicut aloe, et olibanum, et myrrha, et sarcocolla, et acacia, et similia eis.	 Therefore, if the swelling is recent, apply to it remedies that have astringent properties, such as aloes, frankincense, myrrh, sarcollege, acacia, and similar substances.
Ita, ut accipias ex istis quasdam, aut omnes eas: et confice eas cum uino stiptico, aut cum albumine oui, aut cum aceto: et pone eas super nodationem in stuppa, et stringe eas super ipsam strictura bona.	 Take some or all of these and prepare them with astringent wine, or egg white, or vinegar; and place them on the swelling over a pad, and bind it firmly with a good bandage.
Et dimitte stricturam, nec soluas eam diebus multis.	 And leave the bandage in place, without removing it for many days.
Deinde solue eam, et itera aliam, donec remoueatur nodatio.	 Then remove it and apply another one, until the swelling is removed. ※
Aut stringe super ipsam laminam plumbi decenter.	 Or bind over it a sheet of lead neatly. ※ ※
Plumbo enim est proprietas remouendi omne quod timetur ex membris.	 For lead has the property of removing all that is feared in the limbs.
Si autem nodatio iam in lapidem conuersa est, et stricta est, et festine prouocat necessitas ad auferendum eam: tunc finde super eam ex superiori parte eius, et incide superfluitatem eminentem: aut rade eam cum quibusdam rasoriis, donec remoueatur: et cura ipsam, donec sanetur.	 But if the swelling has already turned to stone and is bound tightly, and there is an urgent need to remove it quickly, then cut a hole in it from above and trim off the prominent excess; or shave it with some razors until it is removed, and care for it until it heals. ※ ※ ※ ※ ※
¶ De curatione quando restauratur, et remanet membrum post illud subtile, non secundum naturam suam.	 ¶ On the treatment when a limb is restored but remains thin and not according to its natural state.
Caput XXII.	 Chapter 22
Quando restauratur fractura ossis, et remanet membrum post illud subtile, debile: tunc non fit illud nisi propter caussas multas.	 When a bone fracture is restored and the limb remains thin and weak afterward, this happens only for many reasons.
Quarum una est, multitudo solutionis ligamenti et ligationis eius non secundum quod oportet: aut propter superfluitatem stricturae ligamentorum, donec prohibeatur nutrimentum currere ad membrum: aut propter multitudinem embrocationis superfluae in non sua hora: aut propter paucitatem sanguinis in corpore infirmi, et debilitatem eius.	 One of these reasons is the frequent loosening and re-tying of the bandage not as required; or because of an excessively tight binding of the ligaments, so that nourishment cannot reach the limb; or because of excessive application of unguents at the wrong time; or because of a deficiency of blood in the patient's body and his weakness. ※
Et curatio illius est, cibare infirmum, et tenerum facere corpus eius, donec multiplicetur sanguis in eo.	 And the treatment is, to feed the patient and make his body soft, until blood increases in him.
Et administra balneum.	 And administer a bath.
Et intromitte gaudium et laeticiam super eum.	 And introduce joy and gladness upon him.
Deinde pone picem super membrum: ut attrahat pix ad ipsum nutrimentum multum.	 Then place pitch on the member, so that the pitch attracts much nourishment to it.
Et assiduet embrocationem eius cum aqua tepida, donec currat nutrimentum, et redeat ad figuram suam naturalem.	 And frequently apply an embrocation to it with warm water, until the nourishment flows, and it returns to its natural shape.
¶ De curatione ossium fractorum quando restaurantur tortuose.	 ¶ On the treatment of fractured bones when they heal crookedly.
Caput XXIII.	 Chapter XXIII.
Quando accidit membro iam restaurato post sanationem eius tortuositas, et eminentia ossi fracto, aut nodatio: et foedatur per illud forma membri, uerumtamen membrum non prohibetur ab operatione sua naturali: tunc non oportet ut recipias sermonem eius, qui existimat, ut frangatur membrum denuo.	 When a member already restored after healing becomes twisted or lumpy and the fractured bone has a knot or deformity which disfigures the shape of the member, yet the member does not prevent its natural operation; then it is not necessary to receive the opinion that the member should be broken again.
Et iam fuerunt multi stolidorum medicorum et restauratorum, qui fecerunt illud in terra nostra.	 And there have been many foolish physicians and surgeons who have done this in our land. ∙
Et haec quidem operatio est uituperabilis ualde, perducens ad mortem, uel timorem magnum, ut scilicet sit mortalis.	 And indeed this operation is very blameworthy, leading to death or great fear, as if it were deadly. ∙
Verum si claudicatio et nodatio sunt recentes: tunc oportet, ut embrocetur cum aqua tepida, in qua decoctae sint herbae mollificantes, sicut folia alteae, et radix eius, et mellilotum, et illis similia.	 But if the limping and knots are recent, then it is necessary that [the member] be embrocated with warm water in which have been boiled softening herbs, such as althaea leaves, its root, and melilot, and similar ones. ∙ ️ ️
Et fiat ei emplastrum cum emplastro mollificatiuo, sicut dyachilon decenter factum.	 And let there be made for it a softening plaster, such as well-made diachylon.
Aut sumatur mucilago radicis alteae, et concutiatur cum adipe gallinae, aut oleo sisamino: et emplastretur cum eo.	 Or let there be taken the mucilage of the root of althaea and mixed with chicken fat or sesame oil, and let it be plastered with it.
Aut sumantur ficus pingues, et terantur cum fimo columbino, et similibus eis quae nominantur ex medicinis diminuentes consolidationem.	 Or let there be taken fat figs and ground with pigeon dung and similar things from the class of drugs which are called diminishing consolidations.
Et quandoque soluitur nodatio cum fricatione assidua, antiqua, et leni, quae fit cum manibus humidis.	 And sometimes the knot is dissolved with frequent, gentle, old friction which is done with wet hands. ∙
Et administretur motus membri ad omnem partem in horis omnibus.	 And movement of the limb should be applied to every part at all hours.
Si autem tortuositas iam antecessit, et fortis facta est, et conuersa est in lapidem, et prouocata est necessitas ad curatonem eius cum ferro: tunc oportet, ut secetur superius eius, et soluatur continuatio ossis, et incidatur quod superfluit ex nodatione aut osse cum Incisoriis subtilibus: et administretur facilitas in illo cum sollicitudine et studio.	 If however the tortuosity has already advanced, and has become strong, and turned into stone, and there is a need to treat it with iron: then it is necessary that its upper part be cut, and the continuity of the bone be severed, and what is excessive from the knot or the bone be cut away with fine incisions; and ease should be applied to it with diligence and care.
¶ De sermone in Dislocatione.	 About speech in dislocation.
Caput XXIIII.	 Chapter 24
Dislocatio est exitus alicuius iuncturarum a loco suo.	 Dislocation is the departure of some joint from its place.
Quare prohibetur a motu suo, et foedatur figura membri.	 Why it is prevented from its movement and the figure of the limb is disfigured.
Et facit accidere super infirmum dolores, et laesiones uehementes.	 And it causes severe pains and injuries to happen to the sick person.
Quando ergo accidit alicui dislocatio, tunc oportet festinare ad restaurationem eius: neque tardet eam omnino.	 Therefore, when someone experiences a dislocation, it is necessary to hasten towards its restoration; and do not delay it at all.
Nam si tardatur, apostematur locus, et fortasse cum eo reductio dislocationis.	 For if it is delayed, the place becomes inflamed, and perhaps along with it the reduction of the dislocation.
Propter illud ergo non oportet, ut moueatur, neque extendatur in hora apostemationis eius.	 Therefore, because of this, it should not be moved or extended during its hour of inflammation.  ?>
Quoniam multotiens facit accidere spasmum, et dolores laedentes.	 Because often it causes spasms and painful pains to happen.
Verum quando accidit illud, tunc oportet, ut properes ad phlebotomiam infirmi.	 But when this happens, then it is necessary that you hasten towards bloodletting of the sick person.
Deinde dimittatur, donec quiescat apostema.	 Then let it be released until the inflammation quiets down.
Deinde embrocetur membrum cum aqua calida et oleo.	 Then the limb should be bathed with warm water and oil.  ?>  Et tunc oportet, ut sollicite resolvat medicus dislocationem.
Deinde reducatur cum facilitate.	 Then it should be reduced with ease.
Et curetur omne membrum cum eo cuius rememoratio ueniet in loco suo.	 And the entire limb should be scraped, along with the part that will come to its place.
Ego quidem iam ordinaui capitula dislocationis, etiam secundum quod praecessit in fractura, a superiori parte corporis usque ad inferiorem eius.	 I have already arranged the chapters on dislocation, following what was mentioned previously about fracture, from the upper part of the body to the lower part of it.
¶ De cura dislocationis Mandibulae inferioris.	 About the treatment of dislocation of the lower jaw
Caput XXV.	 Chapter 25.
Parum dislocantur duae Mandibulae nisi raro.	 The two jaws are rarely dislocated except on rare occasions.
Et dislocatio ambarum fit secundum unum duoru modorum.	 And the dislocation of both occurs in one of two ways.
Aut enim remouentur a locis suis remotione parua, et mollificantur parumper.	 For either they are removed from their place by a slight displacement and soften slightly.
Aut dislocantur dislocatione integra, completa, donec mollificentur ad partem pectoris, donec currat saliua infirmi, et non possit tenere eam, neque possit claudere os suum, et inuoluatur lingua eius cum sermone.	 Or they are dislocated completely until they soften to the point of reaching the chest, until the saliva of the patient runs out, and he cannot hold it or close his mouth, and his tongue rolls with speech.
Quando autem dislocatio eius est parua, tunc redit in pluribus dispositionibus per se cum paucitate.	 But when the dislocation is slight, then it returns to its place by itself in most cases.
Si uero est dislocatio completa, integra: tunc oportet, ut administretur reductio eius uelociter, et non tardetur penitus: et est, ut teneat minister caput infirmi: et intromittat medicus pollicem manus suae unius in radicem Mandibulae dislocationis inter os eius, si dislocatio est a parte una.	 But if the dislocation is complete, then it is necessary to administer its reduction quickly and not delay at all: and it is for the assistant to hold the head of the patient: and the physician should insert the thumb of one hand into the root of the dislocated jaw between his teeth, if the dislocation is on one side. ➤➤
Aut intromittat duos pollices suos simul, si dislocatio est a duabus partibus.	 Or he should insert both thumbs at once, if the dislocation is from both sides.
Et reliqui digiti manuum eius sint extra, quibus aequet.	 And the other fingers of his hands should be outside, with which he will equalize [the pressure]. ➤➤
Et praecipe infirmo, ut mundificet Mandibulas suas, et absoluat eas ad manducandum ad omnem partem.	 And order the patient to clean his jaws and return them to normal chewing in every respect.
Et medicus aequet Mandibulam, et impellat Mandibulam, donec redeat ad locum suum.	 And the physician should equalize the jaw and push it until it returns to its place.
Quod si difficilis sit reductio eius, praecipue si sunt ambae Mandibulae simul: tunc administra uaporationem cum aqua calida, et oleo, donec fiat facilis reductio ambarum: neque tardes reductionem ambarum omnino, sicut diximus.	 But if its reduction is difficult, especially if both jaws are together: then administer steam with hot water and oil until the reduction of both becomes easy: and do not delay the reduction of both at all, as we have said.
Cum ergo redeunt et aequantur, et clauditur os infirmi, et non mollificantur: tunc pone super eas puluillos pannorum, cum ceroto quod sit factum ex cera: et oleo rosato.	 Therefore, when they return and are equalized, and the patient's mouth is closed and does not soften: then place on them small wads of cloth with a plaster made from wax and rose oil. ➤➤
Deinde ligetur cum facilitate cum ligamentis mollibus.	 Then it is bound with ease using soft bandages.
Et sit somnus infirmi super dorsum suum: et caput eius sit stans inter duo puluinaria, ut non moueat ipsum ad dextram et sinistram: neque conetur, uel cogatur masticare aliquid: imo ponatur cibus eius sorbitio lenis, donec quando remouentur dolores, et nodatur Mandibula: tunc comedat quod uult, et administretur illud cum facilitate.	 And let the patient sleep on their back; and let his head be supported between two pillows, so that he does not move it to the right or left; nor should he attempt, or be forced, to chew anything; rather, his food should be a gentle drink until the pains are removed, and the jaw is bandaged. Then he may eat what he wishes, and it should be administered with ease.
Non laboret super operationem oris sui apud comestionem et potum, et oscitationem, donec nodetur Mandibula, et sanetur.	 Let him not strain when eating, drinking, or swallowing, until the jaw is bandaged and healed.
Quod si difficilis fiat reductio duarum Mandibuiarum, quando dislocantur in hora aliqua, et non conuertuntur ad loca sua: tunc multotiens accidunt inde febres, et soda assidua: et fortasse soluitur uenter infirmi, et fortasse uomit choleram puram.	 But if the realignment of the two jaws is difficult when they are dislocated at some time and do not return to their proper places, then frequent fevers and continuous sweating often occur; and perhaps the patient's stomach becomes upset, and perhaps he vomits pure bile.
Cum ergo uides illud: tunc scias, quia est perditio, et multotiens moritur ille cui accidit illud in decem diebus.	 Therefore, when you see this happening, know that it is fatal, and the patient often dies within ten days.
¶ De reducione dislocationis Furculae, et extremitatis humeri.	 ¶ On the reduction of the dislocation of the clavicle and the end of the humerus.
Caput XXVI.	 Chapter 26
Furcula quidem non dislocatur ex latere intrinseco, propter continuationem suam cum pectore.	 The clavicle is not dislocated from the inner side because of its connection with the chest.
Et dislocatur quandoque ad exteriora: et declaratur illud sensui.	 And it is sometimes dislocated to the outside, and this can be perceived by touch.
Et restauratio eius est, ut iaceat infirmus super dorsum suum, et extendat brachia sua.	 The restoration of it is that the patient lies on his back and extends his arms.
Deinde coarta locum cum palma tua coartatione forti, nam ipsa redibit.	 Then press upon the place strongly with your palm, for she will return. 》
Deinde pone super ipsam emplastrum, et puluillos, et stringe eam.	 Then place a poultice and pillows over it, and bind it.
Extremitates uero eius quae sequuntur cubitum, et continuantur cum eo, non dislocantur, nisi raro.	 However, the ends of it that follow the elbow and are continuous with it are rarely dislocated.
Quod s dislocatur die aliquo: tunc oportet, ut reducatur et aequetur secundum quod diximus, et quod praeparatur tibi.	 But if it is dislocated on any day, then it should be reduced and set according to what we have said and prepared for you.
Deinde pone super ipsam emplastrum, et puluillos, et stricturam.	 Then place a plaster, woolen cloths, and bandages on it.
Et praecipe infirmo, adhaerere tranquillitati et quieti, donec sanetur.	 And tell the patient to keep calm and rest until healed.
Et cum hac eadem curatione reducitur extremitas Humeri, quando separatur etiam a loco suo.	 And with this same treatment the end of the arm can be repositioned when it has also been displaced from its place.
¶ De reductione dislocationis Humeri.	 ¶ On the reduction of shoulder dislocation.
Caput XXVII.	 Chapter Twenty-seven.
Scias, quod Humerus non dislocatur, nisi secundum tres modos.	 Know that the humerus (upper arm bone) is not dislocated except in three ways.
Quorum unus est, ut dislocetur ad partem titillici ad inferiora.	 One of which is when it dislocates towards the armpit downwards.
Secundus est, ut dislocetur ad partem pectoris.	 The second is when it dislocates towards the chest.
Et fortasse dislocatur ad superiorem partem Humeri: et illud fit raro.	 And perhaps it dislocates towards the upper part of the humerus, and this happens rarely. ⟩
Et non dislocatur ad posteriora, propter spatulam.	 And it does not dislocate backwards, because of the glenoid cavity.
Et non dislocatur ad anteriora, propter neruos.	 And it does not dislocate forwards, because of the nerves.
Et plurimum quidem dislocatur et egreditur ad inferiora uersus titillicum: praecipue in illis, quorum carnes sunt paucae.	 Indeed, it most often dislocates and exits downwards towards the armpit, especially in those whose flesh is scanty.
Quoniam egrediur in eis uelociter, et ingreditur uelociter.	 Because it exits quickly in them, and also re-enters quickly. ⟩ ⟩
In illis autem quorum carnes sunt multae, est econtrario illius, scilicet quia egreditur cum difficultate, et ingreditur cum difficultate.	 But in those whose flesh is abundant, it is the opposite of this, that is, because it exits with difficulty and also re-enters with difficulty. ⟩ ⟩ ⟩
Et fortasse accidit quibusdam hominibus percussio, aut casus, et apostematur Humerus apostemate calido, et putatur propter illud, quia iam dislocatus est.	 And it happens to some people that a blow or fall occurs and the humerus swells with a hot swelling, and it is thought because of this that it has already been dislocated.
Oportet ergo, ut experiaris illud, donec stes super certitudinem eius, et tunc procedas in curatione eius.	 Therefore, you should test this until you are certain about it, and then proceed with its treatment.
Et cognoscitur dislocatio, quando est ad inferiora uersus titillicum: et distinguas inter Humerum dislocatum, et humerum sanum.	 And a dislocation is recognized when it is downwards towards the armpit: and distinguish between a dislocated humerus and a healthy one. ⟩ ⟩ ⟩ ⟩
Nam tu inuenis inter eos diuersitatem manifestam, et inuenis in capite Humeri concauitatem, et sub titillico apud tactum caput humeri quasi ipsum sit ouum: et non potest infirmus reducere manum ad aurem suam, neque mouere eam omnibus motibus.	 For you will find between them a clear difference, and in the head of the humerus there is a concavity, and under the armpit you can feel the head of the humerus as if it were an egg: and the patient cannot bring his hand to his ear, nor move it in all directions. ⟩ ⟩ ⟩ ⟩ ⟩ ⟩
Et similiter, si dislocatur uersus pectus, aut ad sursum: tunc inuenis manifestum tactum, neque occultatur.	 And likewise, if it is dislocated towards the chest or upwards: then the young person will have a clear sense of touch and it will not be hidden.
Et huius quidem dislocationis fit facilis reductio, quando est recens, aut infirmus est puer.	 And the reduction of this particular dislocation is easy when it is recent or if the child is weak.
Et reductio eius est, ut eleuet minister manum suam ad superiora.	 The reduction of it is such that the assistant lifts his hand upwards.
Deinde pone tu pollices tuos sub titillico eius, et eleua iuncturam cum fortitudine ad sursum ad locum suum: et minister eleuet manum suam, et extendat eam ad sursum.	 Then place your thumbs under its little finger and raise the joint with strength upwards to its proper place, and the assistant lifts his hand and extends it upwards.
Deinde ponat eam inferius, ipse enim redit uelociter.	 Then he places it downward, for it returns quickly by itself.
Si autem non redit per illud quod diximus, et sunt a principio quo accidit dislocatio dies multi: tunc oportet, ut balneetur infirmus in aqua calida, et administretur embrocatio quae mollificat et lenit, sicut si decoquantur radices alteae, et foenugraecum, et mellilotum in aqua, et administretur.	 However, if it does not return through that which we have said, and there are many days since the dislocation first occurred, then it is necessary for the patient to be bathed in warm water and an embrocation should be administered that softens and soothes, such as if althea root, fenugreek, and melilot are decocted in water and administered.
Deinde resupinetur infirmus super dorsum suum: et ponatur sub titillico eius sphera et lana, quae sit aequalis inter lenitatem et stricturam.	 Then the patient is placed on his back, and a ball and wool are put under his little finger, which should be equal between softness and tightness.  \\
Deinde ponat medicus calcaneum suum super spheram, et eleuet caput humeri cum uirtute, et attrahat manum infirmi ad inferiora.	 Then the physician places his heel on the ball and lifts the head of the humerus with strength, drawing the patient's hand downwards.
Et minister alius teneat caput infirmi, ut non moueatur ad inferiora: ipse namque redit statim.	 And another assistant holds the patient’s head so that it does not move downward; for it returns immediately.
Et si uis, reduc eum secundum modum hunc: et est, ut facias esse praesentem uirum qui sit longior infirmo, et stet a parte lateris, et intromittat humerum suum sub titillico infirmi: et eleuet titillicum eius ad superiora, donec sit infirmus suspensus in aere.	 And if you wish, reduce him according to this method: and it is as if you make a man taller than the patient stand on his side, and he places his shoulder under the patient's little finger; and he raises the little finger upwards until the patient is suspended in air.
Et minister alius trahat manum infirmi ad inferiora uentris eius.	 And another assistant pulls the patient’s hand down towards his belly.
Si autem infirmus est leuis: tunc oportet, ut suspendatur cum eo aliquid aliud, ut grauet ipsum: nam redit dislocatio statim.	 But if the patient is lightweight, then it is necessary to suspend something else with him so that he becomes heavier, for the dislocation returns immediately.
Et reducitur etiam secundum modum alium: et est, ut figatur in terra lignum longum, cuius caput sit rotundum figura: sicut manica mortarii: quod non sit grossum, neque subtile.	 And it can also be reduced by another method: and that is, to place a long stick in the ground, whose head is round like the top of a mortar, not too thick, nor too thin.
Deinde ponatur sub infirmo postquam ponuntur super caput ligni panni lenes: et infirmus sit stans secundum longitudinem ligni.	 Then let soft cloths be placed under the sick person after he has been laid on top of the head of the stick, and let the sick person stand along the length of the stick.
Deinde extendatur manus eius ad inferiora a parte altera, et extendatur corpus eius ab altera parte cum fortitudine: nam iunctura redit ad locum suum cum uelocitate.	 Then let his hand be extended to the lower part on one side, and let his body be stretched out from the other side with force, for the joint returns quickly to its place.
Quod si difficilis sit eius reductio per omnia quae diximus, tunc utere hac cura: et est, ut accipias lignum cuius longitudo sit quantitas duorum brachiorum, et eius latitudo quantitas quatuor digitorum, et grossitudo eius quantitas duorum digitorum: cui sit caput rotundum, ut alleuietur introitus eius in profundum titillici, secundum hanc formam.	 But if his reduction is difficult by all the methods we have mentioned, then use this remedy: and that is, to take a stick whose length is the length of two arms, and its width the width of four fingers, and its thickness the thickness of two fingers; let it have a round head, so that its insertion into the deep part of the armpit can be facilitated according to this shape.
Deinde ligentur super caput rotundum panni lenes, ut non laedat lignum infirmum.	 Then let soft cloths be tied over the round head, so that the stick does not hurt the sick person.
Deinde ponatur sub titillico infirmi, ut extendatur manus, aut brachium super lignum usque ad inferiora: et ligetur lignum super adiutorium et brachium et extremitatem manus.	 Then let it be placed under the sick person's armpit, so that the hand or arm may be extended over the stick down to the lower part; and let the stick be tied over the helper and the arm and the tip of the hand.
Deinde ponatur brachium super gradum scalae per latitudinem, et extendatur manus ad inferiora, et dimittatur reliquum corpus suspensum a parte altera.	 Then let the arm be placed across a step of the ladder by its width, and let the hand be extended downward, and let the rest of the body hang suspended on the other side.
Iunctura enim ingreditur statim.	 For the joint returns immediately.
Cum ergo completur introitus eius secundum quemcunque modum possibile est: tunc oportet, ut ponas sub titillico spheram aequalis quantitatis ex lana.	 Therefore, when its insertion is completed by any possible method, then it is necessary to place under the armpit a sphere of equal size made from wool.
Deinde pone emplastrum praeparatum ex puluere molendini cum olibano, et albumine oui super humerum totum, sicut reuoluitur desuper.	 Then apply a plaster prepared from powdered flour of wheat with frankincense and egg white over the entire shoulder, as it is rolled on top.
Deinde stringe sub titillico strictura decenti: et reuoluatur ligamentum super emplastrum desuper: et annectatur manus eius ad collum ipsius, et dimittatur, neque moueatur manus eius septem diebus.	 Then bind a decent bandage under the armpit, and let the bandage be rolled over the plaster on top; and fasten his hand to his own neck, and let it not be moved for seven days.
Et oportet, ut ponatur cibus infirmipaucus, donec confortetur membrum: quoniam est uelocius ad sanationem eius.	 And it is necessary that the food of the sick person be little, until the part becomes stronger: for it hastens its healing.
Deinde ponatur amplior post septem dies, aut quinque, et ex ercitetur cum motu.	 Then let there be more [food] after seven or five days, and it should be purged with exercise.
Si ergo firmatur et non mollificatur, tunc iam sanatus est.	 If then it becomes firm and not soft, it is already healed.
Si uero iunctura dislocatur multotiens, propter humiditatem quae accidit ei, aut propter caussam aliam: tunc oportet, ut administretur in ea cauterium cum tribus foraminibus, secundum quod praemissum est in capitulo de cauterio.	 But if the dislocation is often repeated, either because of moisture that afflicts it or some other cause, then it is necessary to apply a caustic with three holes, as was mentioned earlier in the chapter on cautery.
Quod si fiat hoc totum, et soluatur ligamentum post septem dies, et non confirmetur iunctura, et reducatur emplastrum et strictura super ipsum aliquotiens, et non firmetur, et cadat, et non possit eleuare ipsum ad superiora: tunc scias, quod nerui eius qui sunt ad caput humeri, iam incisi sunt, aut extensi, aut mollificati: et scias, quod iunctura nunquam figetur in loco suo.	 But if all this is done and the ligament is released after seven days and the joint is not strengthened and the plaster and the bandage are repeatedly applied over it and it does not become firm and falls and cannot be lifted upwards, then know that the nerves leading to the head of the shoulder have already been cut or stretched or softened, and know that the joint will never be fixed in its place.
Dislocationis autem quae fit uersus pectus et mammillam, aut ad posteriora reductio, fit cum impulsione et extensione cum manibus: donec redeat, et administretur in ea reliqua strictura et cura, donec sanetur.	 However, the dislocation that occurs towards the chest and the breast or backwards is reduced by pushing and stretching with the hands until it returns, and then the remaining bandage and care are applied to it until it heals.
Quod si accidat post sanationem grauitas in membro, et tarditas in motu eius, tunc utatur infirmus balneo multotiens, donec leniatur illa grauitas, et redeat ad naturam eius primam.	 But if after healing a heaviness occurs in the limb and slowness in its motion, then let the sick person use the bath frequently until that heaviness is relieved and returns to its original nature.
¶ De curatione dislocationis Cubiti.	 ¶ On the treatment of elbow dislocation.
Caput XXVIII.	 Chapter XXVIII.
Scias, quod iunctura Cubiti dislocatur cum difficultate, et similiter redit cum difficultate etiam: et ipsa quidem dislocatur ad omnes partes, et praecipue ad anteriorem, aut ad posteriorem.	 Know that the elbow joint is dislocated with difficulty, and likewise returns with difficulty. And indeed it can be dislocated in all directions, especially towards the front or the back.
Et eius dislocatio non occultatur tibi: quoniam est cadens sub uisu, et sub tactu, secundum quamcunque figuram dislocetur.	 And its dislocation will not be hidden from you, for it is visible and tangible, whatever shape it may take when dislocated. ›
Et quando coniungis cubitum dislocatum cum sano, declaratur tibi illud manifeste.	 And when you join the dislocated elbow with the healthy one, it is clearly indicated to you.
Concauatur enim iunctura, et non potest duplicare brachium, neque tangere cum eo humerum suum.	 For if the joint were correctly set in place, it would be possible for the arm to bend and to touch its shoulder with it.
Et oportet, ut properes, et reducas dislocationem statim, antequam accidat ei apostema calidum.	 And you should hasten and reduce the dislocation immediately, before a hot inflammation occurs in it.
Nam si accidit ei apostema calidum, difficilis fit eius reductio: et fortasse non sanatur omnino, praecipue quando est ad posteriora.	 For if a hot inflammation occurs in it, its reduction becomes difficult; and perhaps it does not heal at all, especially when it is towards the back.
Est enim deterior omnibus speciebus dislocationis, et uehementioris doloris eis: et multotiens descendit cum ea mors.	 For it is worse than all other types of dislocations and causes more intense pain in them; and often death accompanies it.
Et restauratio eius quando est ex eis quae possibile est reducere, est, ut extendatur manus eius cum duabus manibus: et brachium eius sit expansum, et manus medici sint supra cubitum et sub eo, et ipse impellat iuncturam cum pollicibus manuum suarum simul, aut cum radice palmae suae, donec redeat ad locum suum.	 And its restoration, when it is among those that can be reduced, is as follows: the hand is extended with two hands; and the arm is spread out; and the physician's hands are above the elbow and below it; and he pushes the joint with the thumbs of his hands together or with the base of his palm until it returns to its place.  />
Aut uero dislocatio est ad anteriora: tunc redit ita, ut duplicet manum cum manu sua, donec percutiat cum radice palmae suae cubitum qui est dislocatus.	 Or if the dislocation is towards the front, then it returns in this manner: he folds the hand with his hand until he strikes the dislocated elbow with the base of his palm.
Quod si non obedit dislocatio ad reductionem, tunc administra extensionem uehementem, fortem ualde: et est, ut extendant brachium duo ministri: et teneant ipsum duo ministri etiam, ut non remoueatur apud extensionem.	 But if the dislocation does not obey the reduction, then administer a very strong and powerful traction; and it is that two assistants extend the arm; and two assistants also hold him so that he does not move during the traction.
Deinde reuoluatur brachium ad omnem partem postquam inuoluitur super manum eius pannus duplicatus longus, aut ligamentum latum.	 Then the arm is rolled in every direction after a doubled long cloth or wide bandage has been wound around his hand.
Et quando tangit medicus manu sua iuncturam, inungat ipsam cum oleo: ut sit illud ex eis quae adiuuant in lubricitate iuncturae cum facilitate.	 And when the physician touches the joint with his hand, he should anoint it with oil, so that this helps in facilitating the slipperiness of the joint.
Deinde impellat iuncturam impulsione uehementi, donec redeat.	 Then he should push the joint with a strong thrust until it returns.
Et post reductionem eius oportet, ut ponatur super ipsam emplastrum, in quo sit stipticitas, et exiccatio cum albugine oui: et stringatur strictura decenti.	 And after its reduction, an emplaster should be placed on it, in which there is astringency and dryness with the white of an egg; and it should be bound with a moderate bandage.
Et suspendatur brachium a collo infirmi: et dimitte diebus aliquot.	 And let the arm be hung from the neck of the sick person: and leave it for some days.
Deinde soluatur.	 Then release it.
Si ergo firmatur iunctura in loco suo, tunc solue ligamentum ab ea, et dimitte ipsam.	 If therefore the joint is fixed in its place, then release the ligature from it and leave it alone.
Et si uides iuncturam non bene stringi, tunc itera emplastrum, et ligamentum, et dimitte ipsam diebus aliquot, donec stringatur.	 And if you see that the joint is not well bound, then repeat the bandage and ligature, and leave it alone for some days until it is firmly bound.
Deinde solue ipsam.	 Then release it.
Si autem accidit ei grauitas post reductionem iuncturae, et dispositio sit in motu: tunc administra humectationem in balneatione, et fricationem subtilem, et compressionem, donec liniatur, aut pone super iuncturam iliati, id est, natem arietis pinguem.	 But if after the reduction of the joint and its setting in motion heaviness occurs, then apply moistening with bathing, subtle friction, and compression until it is straightened, or place over the joint iliati, that is, fatty tallow of a ram.
Deinde ligetur, et dimitte ipsam super eam die et nocte.	 Then let it be bound, and leave it on the joint day and night.
Deinde aufer eam, et intromitte ipsum in balneum.	 Then remove it, and place him in a bath.
Cum ergo sudat, tunc frica iuncturam fricatione temperata.	 When he has sweated, then apply moderate friction to the joint.
Deinde itera super ipsam aleliati uice una, et secunda, et tertia cum introitu balnei, donec leniatur.	 Then repeat on the same place iliati once, and a second time, and a third time upon entering the bath until it is eased.
Et si uis, pone super ipsam stercus uaccinum, humidum, calefactum cum butyro, et stringe super ipsum.	 And if you wish, place on the same cow dung, moist, warmed with butter, and bind it over.
Fac illud aliquotiens.	 Do this several times.
Ipsa namque lenitur, et redit ad dispositionem suam.	 For it is thus eased, and returns to its own state.
¶ De curatione dislocationis Almahassem.	 ¶ On the treatment of dislocation according to Al-Zahrawi.
Caput XXIX.	 Chapter 29.
Mahassem manus multotiens dislocatur, id est, iunctura quae est inter brachium et manum.	 The hand is often dislocated, that is, the joint between the arm and the hand.
Et reductio dislocationis eius est facilis.	 And its reduction is easy.
Econtrario reliquarum iuncturarum.	 Unlike other joints. 》
Verumtamen oportet, ut uelocitas sit in reductione dislocationis eius in hora in qua dislocatur, antequam apostemetur locus: aut accidat in eo apostema calidum.	 Nevertheless, it is necessary that there be speed in the reduction of its dislocation in the hour when it is dislocated, before the place becomes swollen, or an inflamed swelling occurs there. 》
Et reductio dislocationis in eo est, ut ponas Mahassem manus infirmae super tabulam, et extendat minister manum eius: et ponat medicus palmam suam super eminentiam iuncturae, et impellat eam, donec redeat.	 And the reduction of dislocation is such that you place the hand of the sick person on a board, and let an assistant extend his hand; and the physician places his palm over the prominence of the joint and pushes it until it returns. 》 》
Verumtamen oportet, ut consyderetur, si palma iam recessit ad uentrem manus: tunc ponat infirmus dorsum manus suae super tabulam apud extensionem et reductionem: et si dislocatio est procedens ad dorsum manus, tunc sit positio manus eius intrinsece super tabulam, id est, interior pars manus eius super tabulam ponatur, ut cadat manus medici super ipsam eminentiam iuncturae.	 However, it should be considered whether the palm has already retreated to the abdomen; then the patient should place the back of their hand on a board for extension and reduction; and if the dislocation is towards the back of the hand, then the position of his hand should be inside on the board, that is, the interior part of his hand should be placed on the board so that the doctor's hand falls onto that same protuberance of the joint.
Si ergo redit statim, bonum est: et si non, tunc stringe eam cum emplastro sedante apostema: et dimitte ipsum, neque iteres illud.	 If it returns immediately, this is good; and if not, then bind it with a bandage to subdue the swelling, and leave it alone, do not agitate it.
Nam si non tolerat, neque potes super reductionem eius, postquam praetereunt ei dies, uerumtamen iunctura remanet secundum tortuositatem suam: et non nocet infirmo aliquid, nisi quod mollificatur manus, et non potest stringere aliquid: tunc scias, quod nerui sunt abscissi, aut attriti.	 For if he does not tolerate it, and you cannot reduce it, even after the days have passed, nevertheless the joint remains according to its crookedness; and nothing harms the patient except that his hand becomes weakened and cannot grasp anything; then you should know that the nerves are cut or torn.
Non est ergo ingenium in ea, nisi ut stringatur cum cauterio prope casum eius.	 Therefore, there is no skill required for it, except to bind it with a cautery near the site of the injury.
Et fortasse non confert illud aliquid.	 And perhaps this does not help at all.
Cum ergo non redit Almahassem, tunc pone super ipsum emplastrum, quod narrauimus.	 Therefore, when Almahassem does not return, then place on it the plaster that we have described.
Deinde stringatur, et dimittatur quinque diebus: postea soluatur et dimittatur, et exercitetur manus.	 Then it should be bound and left for five days; afterwards it should be loosened and left, and the hand should be exercised.
Si autem priuatur motus eius, et accidat in ea aliquid grauitatis: tunc leni eam cum aqua calefacta, et fricatione aliquotiens, donec leniatur.	 But if its movement is impeded and something heavy happens to it, then soften it with warm water and frequent friction until it becomes softer.
¶ De curatione dislocationis Digitorum.	 ¶ On the treatment of dislocated fingers.
Caput XXX.	 Chapter XXX.
Quando dislocatur ex eis Digitus ad omnem partem, uel ex eis Digitus ad dorsum palmae, aut uentrem eius: tunc extende Digitum, et impelle dislocationem pollicibus tuis, donec redeat.	 When one of the fingers is dislocated in any direction, or if a finger is dislocated towards the back of the palm or its abdomen; then extend the finger and push the dislocation with your thumbs until it returns.
Deinde sustenta caput Digiti, et suspende ipsum uersus partem ad quam dislocatur, et dimitte ipsum duobus diebus.	 Then support the head of the finger and hang it towards the direction in which it is dislocated, and leave it for two days.
Deinde suspende eum, et extende ipsum, donec aequetur rectus in illo die suo.	 Then hang him and extend him until he becomes straight on that day itself.
Cum ergo fuerit nox, liga ipsum secundum narrationem ipsam: et non cesses soluere ipsum in die: et exerce eum cum motu: et liga ipsum in nocte.	 When it is night, bind him according to the same account: and do not cease to release him during the day; and exercise him with movement; and bind him at night.
Fac illud diebus aliquot, donec stringatur.	 Do this for several days until he becomes stiff.
Et similiter fac cum eo, si dislocatur ad uentrem manus: et liga eum ad partem ipsam, et fac cum eo operationem tuam primam, donec sanetur.	 And do the same if his hand is dislocated towards the abdomen; and bind him to that part, and perform your first operation on him until he is healed.
Et similiter fac cum eo quando dislocatur ad reliquas partes.	 And do the same with him when he is dislocated in other parts.
¶ De curatione dislocationis Spondilium dorsi.	 § On the treatment of spinal dislocation.
Caput XXXI.	 Chapter XXXI
Quando accidit alicui Spondilium dorsi, aut colli dislocatio completa, aut remouentur Spondiles multae a locis suis: tunc non est in ea curatio, quoniam mors properat infirmo.	 When someone experiences a complete dislocation of the spine or neck, or when many vertebrae are displaced from their positions, then there is no cure for it, because death approaches the sick person quickly.
Et signum illius est, quod egestio infirmi egreditur absque uoluntate, neque potest tenere eam: et multotiens mollificantur ex eo quaedam membra eius, aut duo crura eius, aut duo brachia ipsius, aut unum eorum: aut remouetur Spondilis una de loco suo.	 And the sign of this is that the sick person discharges without control and cannot hold it back; and often some of his limbs become flaccid, or both his legs, or both his arms, or one of them; or a single vertebra may be displaced from its position.
Multotiens enim remouetur, quod multotiens fit remotio earum ad quatuor partes.	 For often it is displaced, because often there is a displacement in four parts.
Illa ergo quae remouetur ad posteriora, nominatur Gibbositas.	 That which is displaced towards the back is called a hump.
Curatio uero eius est, ut consyderes tunc, si Gibbositas accidit a puericia: tunc non est in ea curatio, neque ex ea est sanatio omnino.	 But its treatment is that you should consider then, if the hump occurs from childhood; then there is no cure for it, nor any healing at all. />
In illa autem quae accidit a casu, aut percussione, aut similibus illis, iam dixerunt antiqui modos curationis sermone prolixo.	 But in the case of those that occur from an accident, or a blow, or similar things, the ancients have already spoken about methods of treatment at length.
Cuius plurimum non redit cum proficuo.	 In most cases, it does not return to good health.
Ego uero iam abbreuiaui ex illo, cuius parum excusat a multo eius ex propinquitate mea ad intentionem: et expositione mea qua exposui illud, et formaui instrumentum eius diuerso modo ab eo quo ostenderunt illud, et exposuerunt ipsum.	 But I have already shortened it from him, whose account is excused by my own experience with many of his cases; and in my exposition, which I presented on that topic, and formed an instrument for it in a different way than they demonstrated and explained it.
Dico ergo, quod in gibbositate quae accidit ab anteriori parte, non est ingenium, neque sanatio ex ea.	 I say therefore that in a humpback which occurs from the front part, there is no skill nor healing from it.
Et similiter in illa quae fit ad duo latera etiam.	 And similarly in those [humps] that occur on both sides as well.
Et non curatur ex eis, nisi illa quae accidit in dorso proprie, cum eo quod ego narro: et est, ut extendatur infirmus super faciem suam super podium aequale prope parietem: et expandatur sub eo stramentum humidum, ut non laedatur pectus eius.	 And it is not cured by these [methods], except for the one that occurs in the back properly, as I shall describe: and it should be done thus – the patient should be stretched out on his face upon a level platform near the wall; and under him should be placed a moist covering, so that his chest is not harmed.
Deinde ponatur lignum rectum fixum in fouea in terra, in extremitate podii, circiter caput eius: et lignum aliud circiter pedes eius in extremitate altera podii: et minister teneat lignum, et sit non firmatum in fouea.	 Then a straight piece of wood should be fixed in the ground at the edge of the platform near his head; and another [piece of wood] at the opposite end near his feet. And an assistant should hold the [upper] piece of wood, and it should not be fixed in the hole.
Et minister alter teneat alterum.	 And another assistant should hold the other [lower piece of wood].
Deinde inuolue super caput infirmi, et sub titillicis eius ligamentum lene, firmum: et extende extremitatem ligamenti ad lignum quod est apud caput eius: et liga ipsum in eo.	 Then wrap a soft but sturdy bandage around the head of the patient and under his chin; and stretch out the end of the bandage to the piece of wood that is near his head, and tie it securely there.
Deinde stringe ligamentum aliud supra anchas eius, et supra genua ipsius, et apud cauillas eius.	 Then tie another bandage above his ankles and above his knees and at the back of his thighs.
Deinde aggrega ligamenta omnia, et liga ea in ligno altero quod est apud pedes eius.	 Then gather together all the bandages and tie them to the other piece of wood near his feet.
Deinde extendat omnis minister ad partem ligni ligamentum, et non remoueantur duo ligna ex locis suis in quibus sunt fixa: uerumtamen non sint firmata, sicut diximus.	 Then let each assistant pull on the bandage toward the piece of wood, and do not remove the two pieces of wood from their places where they are fixed; but they should not be fixed [securely], as we said.
Et medicus ponat palmas suas super Spondilem cum fortitudine, donec redeat: aut ponat super eam tabulam.	 And the doctor should place his hands on the spindle with strength until he returns; or [he may] place a board over it.
Deinde annectat super tabulam pedes suos, donec redeat.	 Then let him attach his feet to the board until he returns.
Si autem non redit per hanc curationem, tunc accipe tabulam cuius longitudo sit circiter tria brachia.	 But if he does not return by this treatment, then take a board whose length is about three spans [arms].
Et caua in pariete de quo diximus quod est prope infirmum, locum in quem ingrediatur extremitas tabulae.	 And make an opening in the wall near the patient (as I previously said) into which the end of the board can be inserted. />
Deinde pone medium tabulae super Spondilem.	 Then place the middle of the blade onto the vertebra.
Et ponat pedes suos medicus super extremitatem alteram.	 And let the physician place his feet on the other end.
Et stringat bene, donec coartetur Spondilis, et redeat ad locum suum.	 And he should pull firmly until the vertebra is dislocated and then return to its place.
Deinde si uis, operare cum torno quod inuoluitur cum manu tua: et est, ut figas in terram apud caput infirmi in postremo podii duo ligna, quorum longitudo sit brachii unius: et apud caput eius in postremo podii duo ligna.	 Then if you wish, operate with a device that is wound with your hand: and it is as follows: fix two pieces of wood into the ground at the head of the patient, at the far end of the bed, each one arm's length long; and at his head, at the far end of the bed, fix two more pieces of wood.
Et sit longitudo quae est inter omne lignum palmus unus: et iam factum est in omni loco foramen, in quo currit tornum: et firmetur lignum omne in terra multum, ne moueatur omnino.	 And let the distance between each piece of wood be one palm; and now a hole has been made in every place through which the device runs; and let each piece of wood be firmly secured in the ground so that it does not move at all.  />
Et intromittatur lignum rotundum: et est tornum in quo reuoluitur ligamentum in duobus foraminibus duorum lignorum.	 And insert a round piece of wood; and this is the device on which the band is wound between the holes of the two pieces of wood.
Et in extremitate eius est foramen, in quo firmatur lignum, cuius longitudo est palmus cum eo quod reuoluitur: et in duobus lignis aliis est similiter illius.	 And at its end is a hole in which the wood is secured, whose length is one palm including what is wound; and on the other two pieces of wood it is similar to this.
Deinde stringe ligamenta quae strinxisti in pectore infirmi torno quod est apud caput eius: et ligamenta quae strinxisti in cruribus eius in torno quod est apud pedes eius.	 Then tighten the bands that you have tightened on the patient's chest with the device that is at his head; and the bands that you have tightened on his legs with the device that is at his feet.
Deinde stet apud omne tornum minister, qui torqueat manum suam cum licinio, cum quo reuoluitur tornum: et medicus aequet Spondilem, secundum quod diximus.	 Then let there be an assistant standing at each device, who will turn the handle with which the device is wound; and the physician shall straighten the vertebra as we have said.
Haec est forma torni, quae sequitur.	 This is the form of the device that follows.
Deinde postquam redit Spondilis, et aequatur locus, tunc oportet, ut ponas emplastrum exiccatiuum cum albumine oui.	 Then after the vertebra has returned to its place and the area has been straightened, it is necessary to apply a drying plaster with egg white.
Deinde stuppam.	 Then add tow.
Postea pone supra emplastrum astellam ex tabula, cuius latitudo sit trium digitorum, aut circiter eos.	 Then place a splint of wood on top of the plaster, whose width is three fingers or about that.
Et longitudo eius quantitas quae capiat locum Gibbositatis, et super partem Spondilis sanae.	 And its length should be such that it can contain the swelling, and extend above a healthy part of the jawbone.
Deinde ligetur cum ligamento quod diximus.	 Then let it be tied with the ligature we mentioned.
Et utatur infirmus nutrimento subtili, donec sanetur.	 And let the patient use a light diet until healed.
Quod si remaneat quiddam eminentiae in loco in fine sanationis: tunc oportet, ut administrentur medicinae quae mollificant, et leniunt, cum administratione tabulae quam narrauimus tempore longo.	 If something of the swelling remains at the end of healing, then it is necessary to administer softening and soothing medicines along with the tablet we mentioned, over a long period of time.
Et iam administratur in illo lamina plumbi.	 And now lead is applied to that plate.
Et quandoque accidit eminentia in postremo Spondilium dorsi: et putatur per eam dislocatio, et est illud os quod iam eminet.	 And sometimes a swelling occurs at the end of the spine in the back, and it is thought to be caused by a dislocation, and that bone which now protrudes.
Quare non oportet, ut praesumptio fiat ei cum hac medicina: fortasse enim accidere faciet mortem.	 Therefore, one should not assume this with that medicine, for perhaps it will cause death.
¶ De curatione Anchae dislocatae.	 ¶ On the treatment of a dislocated ankle.
Caput XXXII.	 Chapter 32.
Scias, quod iuncturae Anchae, et iuncturae humeri, non accidit, nisi dislocatio tantum: neque accidit eis quod accidit reliquis iuncturis ex remotione parua, et concauitate.	 Know that the ankle joint and the shoulder joint do not suffer from slight displacement or indentation like other joints do.
Et iunctura quidem Anchae dislocatur secundum quatuor partes.	 And the ankle joint can be dislocated in four ways. □
Quod est, quia dislocatur ad anteriora, et ad posteriora.	 This is because it can be dislocated forward and backward.
Et plurimum quidem dislocatur ad interiora: et parum dislocatur ad anteriora, et ad posteriora.	 And indeed it is most commonly dislocated inward, and rarely dislocated forward or backward. □ □ □
Et curatio dislocationis eius ad interiora, est: quia quando tu coniungis crus infirmi sanum cum infirmo, est longius: et est genu eius eminens plus quam sani, et non potest infirmus duplicare pedem suum apud inguen: et est locus qui sequitur inguen apostematus apostemate calido, propterea, quod caput coxae iam peruenit illic.	 And the treatment for its inward dislocation is as follows: when you join the sound leg of the patient to his infirm one, it will be longer; and its knee will protrude more than that of a healthy person, and he cannot bend his foot at the groin; and the place following the groin will be swollen with a hot swelling, because the head of the thigh bone has already reached there.
Et signum eius cui accidit dislocatio ad exteriora est, quod sunt accidentia eius contraria istis accidentibus.	 And the sign of one who has suffered an outward dislocation is that its symptoms are contrary to these symptoms.
Et signum eius cui accidit dislocatio ad anteriora, est, quia expandit crus sanum secundum complementum: uerumtamen non duplicat ipsum absque dolore qui est in genu: et si conatur ad ambulandum, non potest super illud ad anteriora: et retinetur urina eius, et apostematur inguen eius, et apud ambulationem est calcatio eius super calcaneum.	 And the sign of it [the dislocated bone] is that it extends the healthy leg according to its full length; however, it does not double it without pain in the knee; and if it tries to walk, it cannot step on it with the toes; and urine retention occurs, and the groin swells, and upon walking, there is a stepping on the heel.
Et signum eius cui accidit dislocatio ad posteriora est, ut non expandat genu, neque possit duplicare ipsum antequam duplicet inguen: et est crus eius etiam breuius altero: et inguen est mollificatum, et est caput coxae apud locum ilii.	 And the sign of it [the dislocated bone] occurring to the back is that it does not extend the knee, nor can it double it before doubling the groin; and its leg is also shorter than the other; and the groin is softened, and there is a prominence at the hip joint.
Reductio uero huius dislocationis specierum est, ut consyderes tunc, si dislocatio est uetusta, quae iam antiquatur cum habente ipsam.	 The reduction of this type of dislocation is, when you consider, if the dislocation is old and has already been present for a long time with the person having it.
Deinde si tu administres reductionem eius, et remanet secundum dispositionem suam: tunc non est in ea curatio omnino.	 Then if you perform the reduction on it, and it remains in its position: then there is no treatment for it at all.
Non ergo oportet, ut praesumptio fiat ei penitus.	 Therefore, it is not right to make a complete attempt [to reduce it].
In illo autem cuius dislocatio est recens, et est ex una specierum quatuor dislocationis: tunc propera ad hoc, ut uoluas iuncturam, et extendas ipsam ad interiora et ad exteriora, et moueas eam dextra et sinistra: fortasse enim redit, et non indiget alia cura.	 But in the case of someone whose dislocation is recent and belongs to one of the four types of dislocations: then hasten to do this, so that you roll the joint and extend it towards the inside and outside, and move it from right to left; for perhaps it will return, and will not require any other treatment. 》
Si autem non redit hoc modo, tunc oportet, ut praepares ministrum fortem, et extendat crus eius ab inferiori parte: aut cum manibus suis, aut cum ligamento, quod ligetur super crus eius supra genu: et minister alius extendat manum eius desuper, ita ut intromittat manus suas sub titillicis eius.	 But if it does not return this way, then it is necessary to prepare a strong assistant, and let him extend the leg from below; either with his hands or with a ligature that is tied over the leg above the knee: and another assistant should extend his hand on top, so that he puts his hands under the armpits. 》
Deinde stringat cum ligamento leni super radicem coxae, et teneat extremitatem ligamenti alterius.	 Then let him tie it with a gentle ligature around the hip joint, and hold the end of the other ligature.
Et sit extensio eius aut ab anteriori parte inguinis ad partem furculae, aut a posteriori ad partem dorsi.	 And let the extension be either from the front part of the groin to the clavicle, or from the back part to the spine.
Et sit extensio eorum omnium uice una, donec eleuetur infirmus cum corpore suo a terra, et remaneat pendens.	 And let their extension be performed simultaneously, until the patient is raised with his body from the ground and remains hanging.
Et haec enim species extensionis est species communis specierum quatuor.	 And this kind of extension is one of the four common kinds of extension.
Si ergo redit dislocatio cum eo quod diximus, est bonum: et si non, tunc necesse est omni speciei illud quod dicam de curatione propria.	 If then the dislocation returns with what we have said, it is good; and if not, then it is necessary for every species to do that which I will say about the proper cure.
In reductione quidem eius propria quando dislocatio est ad interiora, oportet, ut resupinetur infirmus super latus suum sanum.	 In the proper reduction of it, when the dislocation is to the interior, it is necessary that the patient be turned over onto his healthy side.
Deinde ponat ligamentum super radicem coxae, in eo quod est inter caput coxae, et locum qui est sub inguine.	 Then he should place a bandage over the hip joint, between the head of the femur and the place that is under the groin.
Deinde extende ligamentum ad sursum a parte inguinis ad altiorem partem corporis, ad partem furculae.	 Then extend the bandage upward from the groin to the highest part of the body, to the collarbone area.
Deinde accipiat minister alius fortis brachia eius, et minuat locum grossum coxae infirmae, et extendat ad exteriora extensione uehementi.	 Then another strong helper should take hold of his arms and diminish the thick part of the dislocated hip, extending it outward with great force. ›
Iam enim redit ad locum suum.	 Now indeed it has returned to its place.
Et haec species est facilioris reliquis speciebus curationis, qua reducitur hoc membrum.	 And this kind is the easiest of all the kinds of cure by which this limb is reduced.
Si autem excusatur super te, et non obedit tibi ad introitum cum hac specie curationis omnino: tunc oportet, ut ligentur duo pedes infirmi simul cum ligamento forti, leni, super duos calcaneos, et super duo genua: et sit longitudo cuiusque a compare suo quantitatis quatuor digitorum: et sit crus infirmum extensum plus altero quantitate duorum digitorum.	 But if it resists you and does not obey this cure at all, then it is necessary to bind the two feet of the patient together with a strong, soft bandage over the two heels and over the two knees; and let the length of each be four finger widths from its fellow part: and let the leg of the patient be extended more than one and a half times. ›
Deinde suspendatur infirmus super caput ligni, quod sit in domo: et sit longitudo eius a terra quantitas duorum brachiorum.	 Then let the patient be suspended over the top of a beam that is in the house; and let its length from the ground be two arm lengths.
Deinde praecipe iuueni forti, ut muniat caput coxae: et suspendatur cum infirmo inuenis alius: et impellat iuuenis alius, muniens coxam cum fortitudine, nam iunctura redit ad locum suum cum uelocitate.	 Then command a strong young man to support the head of the thigh; and let another young man be suspended with the patient; and let another young man push with strength, supporting the thigh, for the joint returns to its place quickly.
In reditione autem eius propria, quando est dislocatio ad exteriora, oportet, ut iaceat infirmus super podium, secundum quod narrauimus in habente gibbositatem.	 In its own reduction, when there is a dislocation to the outside, it is necessary that the sick person lies on a bench, as we have narrated concerning those with a hump.
Et stringatur ligamentum super crus eius, infirmum proprie, et super pectus eius.	 And let a ligament be placed above his leg, specifically upon the sick person, and above his chest.
Deinde ponantur duo ligna, unum apud pedes eius, et alterum apud caput ipsius.	 Then two sticks are to be placed: one at his feet, and the other at his head.
Deinde ponatur lignum additum in medio podii, fixum bene: super quod inuoluti sint panni humidi, ut non laedat infirmum: et sit lignum inter coxas eius, ut non attrahatur ad inferiora apud extensionem.	 Then let a stick be added in the middle of the bench, fixed well; upon which moist cloths are to be wound, so that it does not harm the sick person; and let the stick be between his thighs, so that he is not pulled downward during the stretching.
Deinde extendat omnis minister ad partem suam, et medicus aequet reductionem manu sua.	 Then every assistant should stretch to their part, and the physician should balance the reduction with his hand.
Si ergo obedit ad reuersionem, erit bonum.	 If therefore it yields to reduction, all will be well.
Et si non, pone super ipsam tabulam, et preme ipsam, sicut diximus in gibbositate, aequaliter.	 And if not, place [something] upon the very table, and press it down, as we have said concerning the hump, equally.
Verumtamen oportet, ut iaceat infirmus super latus suum sanum.	 However, it is necessary that the sick person lies on his healthy side.
Et quando dislocatio est ad anteriora, tunc oportet, ut extendatur crus infirmi uelociter: et est secundum hanc eandem narrationem super podium: et ponat medicus palmam manus suae dextrae super inguen infirmum.	 And when the dislocation is to the front, then it is necessary that the sick person's leg be quickly stretched; and it is according to this same description upon the bench; and let the physician place his right hand's palm upon the sick person's groin.
Deinde coartet ipsum cum manu altera, et cum illa coartatione pone ipsum extensum ad inferiora ad partem genu.	 Then with the other hand he is to squeeze [the leg], and with that squeezing, let him extend it downward to the knee area.
Et si dislocatio est ad posteriora: tunc non oportet, ut extendatur infirmus ad inferiora, et sit eleuatus super terram: imo oportet, ut sit positus super rem duram, sicut oportet, ut fit etiam si dislocatur ancha eius ad exteriora, secundum illud quod diximus de accubitu eius super duas anchas: et est super faciem eius, et ligamenta extensa: secundum quod diximus nuper.	 And if the dislocation is to the back: then it is not necessary that the sick person be stretched downward, but rather let him be raised above the ground; indeed, it is necessary that he be placed upon a hard object, just as it is also necessary when his ankle is dislocated outward, according to what we have said concerning his lying upon two ankles: and it is with his face down, and the ligaments stretched, just as we have recently said.
Et oportet, ut administretur compressio cum tabula etiam super locum ad quem egreditur iunctura, cum completur reductio secundum quod oportet.	 And it is necessary that a bandage be applied with a board also over the place from which the joint exits, when the reduction is completed as it should be.
Et signum reditionis eius non occultatur tibi: et est, ut extendas duo crura infirmi: et quando uides ea aequalia, et infirmus stringit crus suum, et expandit ipsum absque excusatione: tunc scias, quia iam redit membrum, secundum quod oportet: tunc coniunge duas coxas, et pone emplastrum, et stringe cum imemati, id est, rota: ita, ut non moueatur ancha ad aliquam partium: et adhaereat infirmus quieti tribus diebus, aut quatuor.	 And the sign of its return is not hidden from you: and it is, that you extend the two legs of the patient; and when you see them equal, and the patient tightens his leg, and extends it without hesitation, then know that the limb has already returned as it should; then join the two thighs, and apply a plaster, and bind with imemati, that is, a bandage, so that the ankle does not move to any part; and let the patient rest quietly for three days or four.
Deinde solue ligamentum, et emplastrum, et compara crus cum altero: tunc si uides ea aequalia in statu, tunc scias, quod dislocatio iam firmata est: absolue ergo infirmum ad ambulandum.	 Then loosen the bandage and plaster, and compare the leg with the other; then if you see them equal in position, then know that the dislocation has been firmly set; therefore release the patient to walk.
Et si uides aliquid mollificationis: tunc redi, et emplastra illud, et stringe illud secundum stricturam tuam primam: et dimitte illud etiam tribus diebus.	 And if you see any softness; then return and plaster it, and bind it according to your first binding: and leave it also for three days.
Deinde solue illud et fac ipsum tardare in ambulatione super utrumque aliquot diebus, donec confortetur bene.	 Then loosen it and make the patient walk slowly on both [legs] for several days, until it is well strengthened.
¶ De dislocationis Genu.	 ¶ On the Dislocation of the Knee.
Caput XXXIII.	 Chapter XXXIII
Genu dislocatur secundum tres modos.	 The knee is dislocated in three ways.
Dislocatur ad exteriora, ad interiora, et ad inferiora, scilicet ad posteriora.	 It is dislocated to the outside, to the inside, and to the lower part, that is, to the back. 》
Et non dislocatur ad anteriora.	 And it is not dislocated to the front.
Et signum dislocationis eius, est, ut praecipias infirmo, ut applicet crus suum ad coxam suam.	 And the sign of its dislocation is, that you tell the patient to apply his leg to his thigh. 》 》 》
Si autem non adhaeret cum coxa: tunc scias, quod Genu est dislocatum.	 If it does not adhere with the thigh, then know that the knee is dislocated.
Et restauratio omnium modorum dislocationis eius est, ut facias sedere infirmum rectum, ita ut iam extendat crus suum si potest super illud, et adhaeret dorsum tuum ad faciem eius: et pone pedem eius inter pedes tuos.	 And the reduction of all kinds of dislocation is, that you make the patient sit upright, so that he can already extend his leg over it, if he is able, and let your back be against his face; and place his foot between your feet.
Deinde adhaerere fac Genu eius cum palmis tuis, et recta eas inter digitos tuos super Genu eius.	 Then make the knee adhere with your palms, and straighten them between your fingers on his knee.
Deinde applica cum palma tua duo latera Genu eius cum fortitudine.	 Then apply both sides of the knee with your palm firmly.
Et minister alius extendat pedem eius, donec redeat Genu ad locum suum.	 And another assistant should extend the foot until the knee returns to its place.
Et signum reditionis est, ut adhaereat crus cum coxa in lenitate, non laboriose.	 The sign of a successful reduction is that the leg adheres gently with the hip, not forcefully.
Deinde emplastra ipsum, et adhaerere fac crus cum coxa.	 Then apply a plaster to it, and make the leg adhere with the hip.
Deinde liga ea simul cum uitta tribus diebus, aut quatuor.	 Then bind them together with a bandage for three or four days.
Deinde solue ea.	 Then unbind them.
Et non utatur infirmus ambulatione aliquot diebus, donec sanetur.	 And the patient should not walk for some days until he is healed.
Si autem recusatur tibi reductio eius, tunc administra extensionem fortem cum ligamentis, quorum praecessit narratio in curatione anchae, donec redeat.	 But if the reduction of it is resisted, then apply strong traction with bands, as was previously described in the treatment of the ankle, until it returns to its place.
¶ De curatione dislocationis Calcanei.	 ¶ On the Treatment of Dislocation of the Heel.
Caput XXXIIII.	 Chapter XXXIV.
Calcaneus quandoque remouetur remotione parua, et quandoque dislocatur secundum complementum.	 The heel is sometimes displaced by a slight movement, and sometimes it is completely dislocated.
Et dislocatio eius fit, aut ad interiora, aut ad exteriora.	 And its dislocation occurs either to the inside or to the outside. ›
Et signum dislocationis eius est, quod uides Calcaneum inflatum, procedentem ad partem ad quam dislocatur.	 The sign of its dislocation is that you see the heel swollen and protruding towards the side to which it has been dislocated.
Curatio autem remotionis eius, est facilis reditionis: et est, ut extendatur cum facilitate cum manibus, et aequetur, donec redeat.	 The treatment of its slight displacement is easy reduction; and that is to extend it gently with the hands and equalize it until it returns.
In curatione autem eius quando dislocatur secundum complementum, oportet, ut facias sedere infirmum rectum: et teneat ipsum minister fortis ualde a posteriori parte dorsi eius, in medio ipsius.	 But the treatment of its complete dislocation requires that you make the patient sit upright, and have a strong assistant hold him firmly from behind his back in the middle of it.
Deinde tene tu cum manu tua dextra pedem eius a superiori parte eius, et cum manu tua sinistra ab inferiori parte pedis eius loco cauillae.	 Then take hold of his foot with your right hand from above it, and with your left hand from below the foot at the place of the heel. ›
Deinde trahe pedem ad tecum manu tua dextra.	 Then pull the foot towards you with your right hand.
Deinde cum sinistra duabus uicibus.	 Then with your left hand, two times.
Deinde extende cum sinistra, et impelle pectus pedis cum dextra uersus crus absque labore.	 Then extend with the left hand, and push the foot's chest with the right hand towards the leg without effort.
Fac illud bis, sicut narrauimus.	 Do this twice, as we have told you.
Deinde impelle pectus pedis ad crus in uice tertia, et tu trahis cauillam.	 Then push the foot's chest towards the leg a third time, and you will draw out the vein.
Si ergo redit in uice una, aut in duabus secundum hunc modum, et uides pedem aequatum, est bonum: et si non, tunc itera operationem super ipsum: quoniam ipse redit.	 If therefore it returns once or twice according to this method, and you see the foot is even, it is good; and if not, then repeat the operation on it, for it will return.
Si autem prohibetur tibi reductio eius cum eo quod narrauimus: tunc fac iacere infirmum super dorsum suum super terram, et fige paxillum in terra firmatum ualde, ut cadat inter coxas eius: et tu iam inuoluisti super ipsum pannum, ut non laedat infirmum.	 But if its reduction is prevented from you according to what we have told you, then make the sick person lie on his back on the ground, and fix a nail in the ground very firmly, so that it falls between his thighs; and you have already wrapped a cloth around him, so that it does not hurt the sick person.
Deinde accipiat minister coxam eius: postea extendat minister alter pedem, aut cum manibus suis, aut cum ligamento quod liget super collum pedis.	 Then let the assistant take hold of his thigh; afterwards let the other assistant stretch the foot, either with his hands or with a band that binds around the neck of the foot.
Deinde extendat omnis minister contra extensionem comparis sui: et paxillus sit stans inter duas coxas infirmi retinens eum, ut non attrahatur corpus eius ad inferiora apud extensionem.	 Then let every assistant stretch against the extension of his fellow; and let the nail stand between the two thighs of the sick person, holding him so that his body is not drawn downwards when stretched.
Deinde aequet medicus dislocationem manibus suis, et minister alter teneat crus sanum ad inferiora.	 Then let the physician equalize the dislocation with his hands, and let the other assistant hold the healthy leg downwards.
Nam dislocatio redit cum uelocitate.	 For the dislocation returns swiftly.
Quando ergo redit dislocatio, et declaratur tibi sanitas reditionis eius: tunc pone emplastrum et stuppam, et stringe ipsam cum ligamentis firmiter, et liga pedem cum ligamento ad crus.	 When therefore the dislocation returns and its healthful reduction is made clear to you, then place a plaster and wool, and bind it firmly with bandages, and bind the foot to the leg with a bandage.
Et oportet, ut caueas uel timeas de neruis, qui sunt supra calcaneum posterius, ut non sit ligamentum super eos uehemens, et laedat eos.	 And you must be careful or fearful of the nerves that are above the heel in the back, so that the bandage is not too tight on them and hurts them.
Deinde dimitte ipsum duobus diebus, aut tribus.	 Then leave him for two days, or three.
Quod si mollificatur ligamentum, stringe ipsum: deinde solue ipsum in die tertio, aut quarto: et prohibe infirmum ab ambulatione quadraginta diebus.	 But if the bandage becomes loose, bind it; then unbind it on the third day, or the fourth; and forbid the sick person from walking for forty days.
Si uero conatur ambulare ante illud spacium, non fit securitas quin dissoluatur super ipsum dislocatio, et corrumpatur, et non recipiat post illud curationem.	 If indeed he attempts to walk before that time, security is not achieved without the dislocation breaking up and becoming corrupt, and it will not receive cure afterwards.
Quod si accidat ei apostema calidum: tunc oportet, ut administres in sedatione eius illud, in quo praecessit narratio nostra in alio loco ex curatione, et embrocationem, donec remoueatur.	 If a hot abscess occurs: then it is necessary that you administer to him the treatment mentioned earlier in another section on healing, and a poultice, until it is removed.
¶ De dislocatione Digitorum pedis, et cura.	 About the dislocation of the toes and their cure.
Caput XXXV.	 Chapter XXXV.
Oportet, ut aequetur quod dislocatur ex eis cum extensione pauca absque labore: et illud quidem non est difficile, imo est facile.	 It is necessary that what is dislocated among them be put back into place with a small extension without difficulty; and indeed this is not difficult, but rather easy.
Si autem dislocatio est in quibusdam nodis dorsi pedis: tunc oportet, ut faciat sedere infirmus pedem suum super locum aequalem terrae, aut super tabulam: et est stans sicut ambulans.	 But if the dislocation is in certain nodes of the back of the foot, then it is necessary that the patient sit with his foot on an even place on the ground or on a table, and stand as if walking.
Deinde tu sta, et pone pedem tuum super illud quod eminet ex illis iuncturis.	 Then you stand, and place your foot on what protrudes from those joints. 》
Deinde calca illud cum pede tuo cum uirtute, donec redeat, et uideas ipsum iam aequatum, et non appareat in loco eminentia.	 Then press it with your foot firmly until it returns and you see it is already in place, and no prominence appears in that place.
Deinde pone sub uentre pedis eius tabulam quae capiat pedem totum, cui sint duo capita.	 Then place under the sole of his foot a board that fits the whole foot, which has two ends.
Deinde stringe ipsum strictura decenti tribus diebus.	 Then bind it with a suitable bandage for three days.
Deinde solue ipsum, et fac quiescere eum ab ambulatione diebus multis, donec stringatur et securetur a reductione.	 Then unbind him, and make him rest from walking for many days, until it is bound and secured in its place. 》
¶ De speciebus dislocationis cum uulnere uel fractura.	 About the types of dislocations with a wound or a fracture.
Caput XXXVI.	 Chapter XXXVI. 》
Quando accidit aliquid ex illo, et conaris curationem eius, et ipsius restaurationem, multotiens succedit mors: et propter illud non oportet, ut praesumat super curationem eius, quod est huiusmodi, nisi qui est prudens in arte longi usus, misericors, pius, tardus, non audax, neque praesumptuosus: et ut utatur in incaeptionce medicinis quae sedant apostemata calida tantum: et dimittat infirmum diuino iudicio.	 When something like this happens and you attempt its cure and restoration, death often follows; therefore one should not presume to undertake such a cure unless he is skilled in the art after long practice, merciful, pious, slow, not reckless or presumptuous; and that he use at the beginning of the treatment only those medicines which suppress hot abscesses: and leave the patient to divine judgment. 》 》
Nisi uideas, aut speras salutem a perditione cum lenitate aegritudinis, et in quo apparet quiddam spei.	 Unless you see or hope for safety from destruction with the mildness of the illness, and in which something of hope appears.
Conare ergo reductionem eius statim in principio rei, antequam accidat apostema calidum.	 Therefore, try to reduce it immediately at the beginning of the matter, before a hot abscess forms.
Si ergo redit membrum, secundum quod uolumus, tunc administra regimen quod sedat apostema: et cura uulnus cum eo quod conuenit ei ex unguentis desiccatiuis.	 If the member returns as we wish, then administer a treatment that calms the abscess; and care for the wound with one of the drying ointments suitable for it.
Quod si dislocatio est cum fractura, et accidunt in osse satagiae separatae, tunc conare ablationem earum, et fac in illo quod diximus in aegritudinibus simplicibus ex eo quod praecessit in locis earum.	 If the dislocation is with a fracture and separate pieces occur in the bone, then try to remove them; and do as we said in simple diseases from what precedes in their places.
Et caue secundum tuam uirtutem, et custodi teipsum ab introitu in uiam timoris: secundum quod praecessit praedicatio mea tibi.	 And be careful according to your ability, and guard yourself from entering the path of fear; as my prediction precedes for you.
Nam illud est melius tibi apud Creatorem tuum, et magis permanens ad gloriam tuam, et magis saluum tuo corpori apud illos in tuo tempore.	 For that is better for you with your Creator, and more enduring to your glory, and safer for your body among them at your time.
