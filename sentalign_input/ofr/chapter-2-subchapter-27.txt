of abscesses of the lips
In many men, hard abscesses appear inside the lips, resembling vetch grains, both smaller and larger;
then you must turn the lips, and cut into each lump, and grasp it with pincers and cut it on each side;
then fill the place after the incision with crushed vitriol, until the bleeding is stopped;
and then wash it with vinegar, and treat the area with dry things until it is healed.
