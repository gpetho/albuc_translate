Know that incising this testicle is one of the dangers that leads to death in most cases, so we recommend leaving it alone and ensuring safety from it.	You should know that cutting for this kind of hernia has an uncertain outcome and in most cases results in death; and therefore I think it better to let it be and to safeguard the patient.	0.7284491
I will mention the procedure for it and the types of swelling, and I say that many swellings may occur in the bodies in which the testicles are located, and this may happen for many reasons.	However, I shall mention the manner of operating for this and all kinds of tumour. Now I say that many tumours arise from the bodies composing the testicles; and this from several causes.	0.7686042
Either from excess sharp humor flowing to the testicles or from a blow.	It may be from an acrid superfluity running down into the testicles, or from a blow.	0.76203465
And the color of the swelling is the same as the color of the body, and it has no fluid, and the swelling is hard.	The colour of the tumour will be like that of the rest of the body and there is no water to it.	0.5732223
Perhaps the swelling is petrified, its color is like pus, and it has no sensation.	The lump will be solid and often will be stony hard, of a dark colour, and without sensation.	0.55837166
It may also be from a thickening and swelling of the arteries, as mentioned before, or from a swelling of the veins.	Sometimes also it arises from a knotting and inflation of the arteries, as has been mentioned, or from an inflation of the veins.	0.8257154
So what is from a swelling of the arteries is known by the dissipation of the swelling if you press it with your fingers, and it should not be touched at all.	The sort arising from a swelling of the arteries may be recognized by a dispersal of the lump when you press upon it with your fingers; this should not be interfered with at all.	0.798651
As for that which is from the swelling of the veins, nothing of it dissipates when pressed with the fingers.	The sort arising from a swelling of the vein will not disperse when you press upon it with your fingers.	0.72187734
This type can be incised, as well as the other flesh, and that is by incising the skin of the scrotum, then extending the testicle upwards and taking it out of the white membrane, and freeing the spermatic cord from the vessels, and tying the vessels, and cutting the spermatic cord after freeing it from every side of the testicle.	It is sometimes possible to cut down on this kind and also on the other fleshy tumours thus: make an incision in the skin of the testicles; then draw the testicle upward and out of the tunica albuginea, and free the suspensor from the vessels and tie the vessels, and cut the suspensor after you have freed it from all round the testicle.	0.79475653
If the testicle has adhered to that growing flesh, then the testicle should be taken out and cut off.	Should it happen that the testicle is adherent to the fleshy growth, you will have to cut away the testicle itself and remove it.	0.81118244
And if the adhesion is between some of the membranes or between the vessels, then all of that adhesion should be freed and cut off in a circular cut.	But should the adhesion have formed somewhere inside the membranes or in the space between the vessels, then you must free the adhesion as a whole and cut it away with a circular incision.	0.856508
If the growth of the flesh is in the place of the adhesion, which is from behind, then all of it should be cut and the testicle taken out as we said.	If the fleshy growth should be at the site of the junction which is behind, you will have to cut the whole thing away and remove the testicle as we have said.	0.9260106
So, when your work is completed, pack the wound with wool soaked in rose oil and syrup, then treat it with other treatments until it heals.	And when your operation is finished, pack the wound with wool moistened with oil of roses and wine; then dress in the usual manner until healed.	0.7614276
