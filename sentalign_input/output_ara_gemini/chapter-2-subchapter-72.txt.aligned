Atresia is when a woman's vulva is not perforated, or the opening is small, and it is either congenital, in which she is born with it, or acquired.	This condition is when a woman's pudenda have no opening or have only a tiny opening; it may be either congenital or acquired.	0.724913
So, the acquired type results from a preceding ailment, and it is either from excess protruding flesh, or a thin or thick membrane, and it is either in the depth of the uterus, or on its sides, or in its upper or lower part, and it prevents intercourse, pregnancy, and childbirth, and sometimes menstruation.	The acquired sort is due to some preceding disease; either to a fleshy growth or to a membrane, thick or thin. It may be in the fundus of the uterus or in its walls or in the upper part or in the lower part; and it prevents intercourse, conception, and delivery; it often also hinders the menses.	0.82198536
Knowing this is by the midwife's inspection, if the blockage is apparent and close, but if it is not apparent, she examines it with her fingers or a probe.	This is recognized by inspection by the midwife, if the obstruction be obvious and low. But if it be not visible she should palpate with her fingers or with a probe.	0.8787779
So, if the blockage is from a thin membrane and it is close to the labia, then immediately perforate it, which is that you place something like padding on the labia, then put both your thumbs from both hands, and the woman is on her back with her legs spread apart, then stretch the labia with force until you perforate the thin membrane and the blockage opens.	And when the obstruction is due to a thin membrane near the labia you should lose no time in breaking it down. This is done by applying some sort of pad to the labia; then put both thumbs upon it. The woman should be upon her back with her legs spread wide apart; then the labia are to be stretched strongly till the thin membrane is ruptured and the obstruction is laid open.	0.7772645
Then take wool, soak it in oil, and place it on the area, and have intercourse with the woman every day so that the area does not rejoin again.	Then take wool soaked in oil and apply to the place, and let the woman engage in coitus every day lest the place close over.	0.84463996
But if the membrane is thick and dense, it should be incised with a wide scalpel, resembling a myrtle leaf.	If the membrane be thick and strong you should incise it with a broad myrtle-leaf scalpel.	0.81951535
And if the obstruction is from protruding flesh, hang it with hooks and cut it, and have with you medications that stop bleeding without stinging, such as acacia, chebulic myrobalan, and frankincense, mixed with egg white.	But if the obstruction be due to a growth you should catch hold of it with two hooks and cut it away. And have at hand remedies for allaying haemorrhage without pain, such as acacia and dragon's blood and olibanum, all mixed with egg-white.	0.6929744
Then use a wide lead tube so that the wound does not heal quickly.	Then use a cannula of lead to prevent the wound healing up too quickly.	0.84573215
Keep it for some days, and use a wick of dry linen, then treat it with the rest of the healing treatment until it is cured.	She should keep it in position for some days and employ a bandage of dry linen. Then treat with the usual healing dressings until it heals.	0.836836
And other fleshy growths may occur in the uterus, so they should be cut in this manner, unless it is a cancerous tumor, for a cancerous tumor that is in the uterus should not be touched with iron at all.	Sometimes other growths of flesh arise in the uterus itself; you should cut away in this manner all except cancerous tumours; for a cancerous tumour arising in the uterus is under no circumstance to be treated with the knife.	0.82437277
