O children, since I have completed this book for you, which is the final work on the science of medicine, due to its comprehensiveness and its explanations, and because of its clarity, it seems fitting to me that I present to you this treatise, which is a part of practical knowledge or skill by hand, namely surgery.
Because practical skill by hand is almost entirely neglected in our region and at this time, to the point that it endangers the science itself, and its vestiges are obscured; there remains of it only a few small descriptions in the books of the Ancients, which modern scholars have distorted, leading them into error and hesitation, while their minds remain closed and their abilities weakened.
It is clear to me that I must revive this skill through the organization of this treatise according to a method of exposition and explanation, as well as by abbreviation; and so that it may be accompanied by illustrations of cautery instruments and other tools necessary for the work, both through additional explanations and through preparation, which are essential.
The reason why there are no good practitioners of this skill in our time is that the art of medicine is extensive and demands that its practitioner first be well-versed in the science of anatomy, which includes knowledge of the joints and their forms, as well as their connections and separations; an understanding of bones, nerves, and sinews, including their numbers and origins; and an awareness of pulsating veins, quiet ones, and where they emerge.
And regarding this, Hippocrates says that it has a great name but little effect in practice, and especially so in the skill of the hand.
We have already mentioned this in the introduction of this book; for one who is not knowledgeable about what we have discussed regarding anatomy, it is unlikely that they will avoid falling into error which has caused the deaths of many men, as I myself have witnessed numerous such instances, where some are educated in this science but lack knowledge and experience.
I witnessed a foolish and inexperienced physician accidentally incision an abscess on the neck of a woman, severing some arteries in the process which led to a great flow of blood until the woman bled out and died while her maid held her.
I saw another physician who was about to perform an operation on a man with kidney stones and the stone was large; however, he was stopped and shown mercy by extracting that stone along with a piece of his bladder, which caused the man's death three days later.
I have already been called upon to extract such a stone and observed that due to the size of the kidney stone and the condition of the patient, I knew he would not survive.
Here is my translation of the provided text:
Certainly! Here is the translation of your provided text:
And I was called upon them, and prepared to release the ligature, and thus achieved calmness and relief from their pain.
However, if the corruption had already set in within a limb to an extent that it cannot be stopped, and this corruption continues to spread throughout the member until the patient's health is at risk.
I saw another physician who had punctured a cancerous abscess, and it became ulcerated after several days due to the severity of his condition.
Which is why the cause of this ailment comes from the excess of melancholy humours in the body, and it should not be treated with iron or steel but rather by using methods that can be applied directly to the affected member.
And for this reason, my children, it is essential that you understand the operation in two parts: one part is associated with bringing about good health while the other has more perilous implications and must be carried out carefully.
I have already explained this thoroughly throughout this book where I describe the operation as being an error-prone and fearful process; you must ensure that you safeguard yourself against it and steer clear of it so that these pages do not become a cause for slander or embarrassment to yourselves.
And so, take up your weapons with solicitude and under God's protection; treat your patients with ease and fortitude.
Use the best method for healing through God's grace, leading to salvation and laudable recovery; leave behind those terrible diseases that are difficult to cure, and keep your weapons away from what makes you fearful, so that doubt does not diminish your faith and reputation: for greater glory remains with you in this world and beyond among your sanctities.
Wisdom has already spoken through some of its hints: Do not treat an illness poorly, lest you be called bad doctors.
And I have divided this book into three chapters.
The division of the book begins with the first chapter, which is divided into two parts: The first chapter is organized around the foot, detailing the necessary instruments and tools such as cauteries for the operation.
The second division of the book. The second chapter deals with dryness and perforation, cupping, sores, extraction of arrows, and similar things; all this is set out and arranged in the forms of instruments.
The third chapter is about restoration and dislocation, as well as the treatment of sprains and similar injuries. This chapter is organized around the head and feet, and describes the forms of instruments used.
I will explain the quality of the iron of that cautery tool and the materials it is made from, as well as in which situations cauterization is prohibited.
Thus I say that the discourse on the quality of cautery iron and its material is long and prolix, subtle in science, and hidden in secrecy; great multitude of wise men have already spoken about it, and they are disagreed, so a little of their discourses suffices me, fearing prolixity.
E donc dic que cauteri comfereys a tota compleccio universalment la qual es am materia o ses materia, exceptat dos compleccios, las quals son compleccios caudas ses materia .
Here is my best translation attempt:
And those who say the opposite, claiming that cauterization is beneficial for all diseases caused by cold and dry humors that invade men's bodies, for when you compare man's body with his wetness to fire's composition, you find man's body to be cold.
And I say, based on the words of that man, who has experienced this many times before to discover it.
However, it is not appropriate for someone to come forward on this matter who has already been tested and practiced in the chapter of cauterization through previous experience, and understands the variety of human composition and the disposition of diseases within their bodies, as well as their causes, incidents, and duration.
But for other compositions, there should be no fear on your part, especially in the case of cold and wet diseases, as all doctors have already agreed upon these, and they do not disagree about the benefit of using cauterization to treat them.
And know, my children, that the secret of cure through cauterization with fire and its goodness are based on caustic medicine using cautery, for fire is simple in action and does not affect any other member but the one being cauterized, causing little harm to adjacent parts.
Furthermore, the action of burning medicine applied to those parts of the body that are distant from the affected area can lead to diseases in these members that have a difficult cure and easily recur.
But fire, due to its excellence and the goodness of its substance, does nothing but overflow superfluously. And it is known to us through experiment and long years of study in the art that this is true for the causes; and thus I am excused from a lengthy sermon. If it were not because my book has not been read by you in this secluded place where we are together, hidden secretly within yourselves with fire, and the quality of its operation in bodies and its expulsion through which illnesses are expelled, with philosophical discourse demonstrated, which would sharpen your minds.
And you should know, my children, that they disagree about the time which is most suitable for performing a cautery, and consider spring to be the best time.
I say that a cautery is suitable at any time, because the harm caused by the weather can be offset by the benefit gained from what is drawn out through the cautery. Furthermore, if it is for pain or necessary wounds (even severe and festering), these do not tolerate delay, as it is feared that greater harm may come to them due to a minor injury developing over time.
Here is my translation of the provided text:
Here is my translation of the provided text:
Moreover, superfluous cauterization is employed in medical practice due to the haste of the practitioner, the effectiveness of its therapeutic virtues, and the importance attributed to it by their lord.
It is possible for the illness to recur at some point in time depending on the constitution of the patient, the location and nature of their ailment, as well as their inherent strength, the level of congestion within their body, the types of food consumed, or factors akin to these causes; however, illnesses treated with cauterization are subtle ailments involving members afflicted by minimal excesses and moisture. For instance, dental cauterization for pain or similar treatments rarely lead to recurring discomfort, but only when performed on a small scale.
Common parlance often portrays cauterization as medicine's last resort, a sentiment shared by legal experts who perceive it not as an avenue for cure or benefit from medical intervention but solely as a means to an end through cautery.
The reasoning behind this is contrary to popular belief; the notion that cauterization serves as medicine's final option arises when we observe certain ailments where standard treatment methods fail to provide relief and only then do we resort to cautery, which proves beneficial. And then from here on you should understand that the cautery is the last resort of medicine, not according to the intention as I understand it by the common people and too many foolish doctors.
The ancients said that a golden cautery is better than one made of iron, and they said this only because of the equality of gold and the excellence of its substance.
And they said that the place of cautery is not arm-like (weak), but this is not absolutely true, for I have proven it and found that it does so only in some bodies without others; thus a golden cauterization is good and better than iron, as they say. But when you do cauterization with fire using gold, it's not clear to you because it is hidden according to the amount you want due to the softness of gold, and because heat prepares to receive cold. And if you place it over a flame, the gold melts from the fire; perhaps in the fire are some sheets so that the artisan catches [it] by handling [them].
And for this reason, iron cautery is done more lightly and more properly to the rectification of operation.
I have already ordered this chapter on cauterization according to the chapters, and I have arranged those of the head within the feet, so that later the enquirer may find what he wants from it.
The first chapter.
This cauterization procedure introduces a cold and wet accident in the brain, which is caused by two factors: one being the cause of many traumatic issues such as nosebleeds from head injuries, fluid discharge from the ears, excessive sleepiness, toothaches, and throat pain; the other affecting universal ailments like frigidity, palsy, stroke, and conditions resembling these.
The procedure for this cauterization is as follows: First, instruct the patient to take laxative medicine to empty their bowels for three to four nights, depending on the condition of their health and their age.
Then, instruct the patient to shave their head and sit on a chair with their arms raised and hands resting on their legs.
And then, place the edge of your palm on their nose, between their eyes. However, once your middle finger has reached that spot, mark the area with ink and prepare the olive-shaped cautery like this:
Then place that on the marked spot and pull it down gently so that your hand gradually compresses the skin, and you turn it.
Then lift your hand gently and check the spot; if you see that any part of the bone is already exposed or as much as a grain of barley, raise your hand, but return it to the same iron or another one cooled according to what I have told you.
Then take some salt, dissolve it over the wound, and leave it for three days.
Then place the frostbitten limb in cold water, and leave it there until the burnt skin is destroyed. Then treat the wound with four-ingredient ointment until it heals.
And I say that when Roman pitch is opened, the arm gets better because it is more effective and beneficial.
Some say that the bone should be cauterized when it is broken and that the cautery should be held until a part of the surface of the bone adheres.
And then remove what is sticking out of the bone, and treat it accordingly.
Other doctors say that the cautery should be applied to the back part of the body, pressing strongly on the bone until it makes an impression. This is the technique known as small alheph. They believe that vapors from the head emanate from this area.
If the wound remains open for too long, then treat it so that it becomes consolidated.
I have not seen these two types of cautery applied in practice, only in some cases due to fear; leave that aside, I believe it is better for health when the head, like other parts of the body, can be treated and cured with continuity, especially if the patient's head is of a weak nature.
The first type of cautery is safer and better in my opinion; I use that method for the benefit of the patient's health.
It seems like the text you provided is part of a larger work, as "Capitol Segon" might indicate a chapter or section heading. I can continue translating if you provide me with more text from the same source.
Del cauteri del cap.
When a patient experiences chronic and prolonged pain in their entire head, and they have tried various treatments such as bloodletting, leeches, clysters (enemas), poultices, cataplasms, baths, foments, compresses, and similar remedies without any improvement, especially if they have already been cauterized with a large iron but it did not benefit them for any of those reasons, consider whether the patient's head is of strong constitution in its nature; and it has very thick humors, then use another type of cautery, slightly smaller than the previous one. Then cauterize that spot on the top of their head with a hot iron while the sinews are divided. Incise the sinews and expose the bone to the extent we have described, then cauterize it with an iron on the back of the head in the place called 'vas', which is where a cupping glass is applied. Always keep your hand there and do not uncover the bone, for the patient will experience great pain different from that of all other cauterizations on the head.
And I will call this cautery by its place, for know that the iron with which you cauterize the horns of the head and the occiput is a more delicate iron than the one used to cauterize the top of the head; and this is its shape.
Chapter Three."
De cauterisacio de emigranea no-antiqua.
When there is a headache or pain that spreads from the head to the eyes, first evacuate and clean the head with appropriate medicine, and then administer other treatments as I have mentioned in my previous writings on illnesses; if all these do not bring improvement, cauterization of the patient should be performed in two ways: either by using caustic medicines that burn or by applying an iron.
Using a caustic medicine means you take a piece of garlic, peel it, and cut off its ends on both sides. Then make an incision on the painful area of the temple using a lancet, making sure it is done at the same spot underneath where the vein was previously located and hidden.
Apply pressure on the patient using a tight bandage for half an hour; then remove it and take out the garlic, leaving the plaster in place for two or three days. After that, place a poultice soaked in wine on the affected area until the skin turns red.
Finally, treat it with ointment until it is healed.
If you wish, perform this procedure using some caustic medicines, which I have described in the second book about such remedies.
Furthermore, cauterization with an iron should be done in this manner: ignite the following type of cautery:
It is called 'claus clavilhs', as its head has the shape of a nail with some curvature, and it has a small prominence in its middle.
Then place it on the painful spot, hold your hand still - so that the arch below is not stuck - and rotate the iron slowly with speed.
And if the amount of it that sticks to the skin due to the heat is such that half of it [the iron] does, lift your hand so that the artery below is not stuck, in order to avoid a flow of blood.
Then soak lint in salty water and place it on the area for three days; then apply wet cotton with a bandage, and finally heal [it] with ointment until cured.
And if you cauterize with the tip of a knife like a cautery, be careful not to cut any artery in this rather new method.
Capitol quart is likely an archaic term indicating that this is chapter four of the treatise.
Chapter four: on the cauterization of old hemorrhoids.
When you treat hemorrhoids using the methods described previously and as outlined in the section on diseases, if the treatment is not effective or the illness does not respond to what we have said about the first cautery with medicine or the cautery with fire, it is necessary that you ignite a knife-like cautery until it is white hot. This means applying it to the painful area along the length of half your finger's width (or another measurement) and then placing your hand on top once for strength; press down hard enough so as not to reach bone.
However, it is essential that you take care not to damage the jaw joint, which is necessary for chewing and may be injured; additionally ensure the tendon is not stuck or the nerve controlling it damaged, so as to prevent spasms from occurring.
And if it is about safeguarding and preventing the bleeding of an arterial wound which has been cut, as there is fear at the beginning of this operation for those who do not know what they are doing or have no understanding of it and leave the operation to them; then place your hand on top once for strength.
And I will return to discussing the treatment for accidental blood flow from archery wounds in its designated place within this book.
And if you encounter this illness and find that the aforementioned cautery treatment is not suitable due to an intolerable state of the patient's body, apply a cauterization in the middle of their head as previously described, and treat any resulting wounds until they are healed.
And when administering the cautery treatment mentioned earlier in the chapter on archery wounds using two small cauteries, this method of cauterization is preferable and more effective.
The Roman numeral "V" typically represents the number five in Latin-based numbering systems. Is there another text you would like me to translate?
On the cauterization of ear pain."
When there is ear pain caused by coldness and it is treated with laxatives and other remedies mentioned in the previous section, but the pain persists and does not improve, then apply the cautery treatment. This type of cauterization is called "puncturing," and its shape is as follows: [Describe the shape or provide an illustration here]
Then proceed to puncture the flame [or ignite it] and move it around the entire ear as if you are drawing a circle, or in the vicinity of each affected area if the pain is localized. Along with the application of the cautery, you should also use a small amount of tar at the base of the ear after you have marked the area to be treated.
And if you apply the pointed cautery all over the ear until it blisters, then treat those areas [afterward] so that they may heal properly.
Chapter 6: Ear Pain and Treatment
On the Cauterization of Torture.
Turtura, which is cured and treated with cauterization, involves specific herbs that are effective due to their phlegm-reducing properties, as we mentioned in the classification of diseases.
Avoid cauterization with herbs that cause drying or nerve spasms.
When treating this type of turtura with syringes, clysters, and gargles, and your treatment is not successful, it is necessary to cauterize the patient with three cauteries: the first should be applied to the root of their ear, the second just below their temple, and the third at the junction of their lips.
Place your cautery on the area opposite to the affected part, as softening will only occur in the seemingly healthy region.
The method of cauterization is as follows: apply the cautery to the right side of the topmost part of the ear, slightly above the crown of the head, and another one just below the temple; the length of this second cautery should be equivalent to the length of your little finger. As you hold the cautery in place with one hand, ensure that it burns an area half the size of a coin.
Here is my translation of your provided text: However, it is more subtle when there is a little less of this, and it is necessary for him to remove some of the excessive fat.
Then treat the area with something in front, which should be processed before it is healed.
The Roman numeral 'VII' represents the number 7, so this could indicate that this is the seventh chapter or section of the text. However, without further context, I cannot determine its exact meaning in relation to the medical treatise.
On the cauterization of old apoplexy."
Here is my best translation of the provided text into English: And the way of using the cautery is done as mentioned before.
And the area around the mouth of the stomach has been cauterized; this is done later; and then it should be treated with something that will help the process.
Chapter 5.
Regarding the oblivion caused by cauterization with a flame.
Give the patient large jars and pills of well-mixed medicine at the beginning.
Then shave the patient's head entirely, and apply on their skull a plaster made of centaury as described in the chapter dedicated to plasters.
And leave it for some time; this is how one uses the cautery. Do all of that in the order described before.
And if they get better by doing so; and if not, then do three more cauterizations on the back of their head, starting from the highest part down to the lowest. And place between each cauterization a finger's width apart, and then treat the cautery with something that has been proven effective.
If the patient is tolerant and the affliction is minor, then cauterize them in the middle area; if it is more severe, cauterize them over both hips.
Then treat it until it is healed, and let the cautery be olive-shaped as previously described.
It seems you provided me with a chapter number; what would you like to know about Chapter 9? I'd be happy to assist!
Regarding the cauterization of parasites and the softening of the entire body.
Undergo the procedure on the patient's head with scalpels and according to what we have described; then shave their head, and proceed to cauterize them with a pointed cautery in the middle of the head, with cautery over all the horns of the head, with cautery over the back part of it, and with three cauteries on the neck vertebrae.
And if it is necessary in the case of softening of the chest due to excessive flatulence and the patient's condition being severe, then cauterize them with four cauteries on the vertebrae of the back, and finally apply cautery along their spine, making sure not to burn their skin. Then treat the patient as they recover, and ensure this is done with olive oil-based cautery.
Chapter 10.
On the cauterization of epilepsy.
An epileptic person is not to be cauterized unless their epilepsy is caused by phlegm.
You must operate on the patient's brain at the beginning with scalpels, and then apply all other treatment described in the division when the patient is large and tolerant of medications, except for medicines that are to be avoided.
And if the child does not tolerate medications well, then administer gargles and chewable lozenges made from a softened brain; do this for many days with proper consideration of their diet.
Then shave the head of the patient and cauterize it with a cautery at the top of their head, following the previous procedure; use another cautery on their occipital region (back of the head), and perform cauterization over each corner or side of the head. And if the patient is strong and can tolerate it, then cauterize them with the aforementioned cauteries while keeping their body paralyzed and immobilized on the neck vertebrae and back vertebrae.
And use an olive oil-based cautery, as previously described.
However, if the patient is a child, then use a more delicate cautery in this manner.
The number "11", as in the eleventh chapter of an unknown book or document.
On the cauterization of melancholia."
When the causes of melancholia are corrupt humors and a weak body constitution, then cauterize that area with the cauteries we mentioned for treating paralysis.
And if the cause of melancholia is an excess that leads to it, and the patient's body is moist or damp, then give them a drink that purifies their brain according to the type described in the previous section.
Then scrape the patient's head, and then make a decent dove-tail joint of them over the circle, and finally place that in the middle of their head.
And if the patient is sixty days old and has been seized by an attack from all sides.
Then place the ointment or liniment on it, and the older the sheep's tallow is, the better. And heat it over the fire to warm it up moderately, which they say is what caused their suffering when it was put on them. Then take it to the middle of their head in the circle, and leave it there until it cools down.
And do this to the patient once every week until they are healed; or if you want, cauterize them with small points according to their age and condition - but be sure to keep your hand on a cautery like this: it is a type of moistening cautery that equalizes the brain.
And then place that inflamed elbow in bran or goose grease.
I am happy to help with your request! Please provide the text you would like translated, and I will assist you line by line.
On cauterizing water-related illnesses in children.
When you have identified the onset of a water-related illness in a child through the signs I mentioned earlier, start by giving them something to drink that will alter their head and avoid all moisture.
And make sure they soak in warm baths twice a day for several days.
Then command them to shave their head and cauterize it with a single-pointed cautery in the middle of the scalp; then cauterize with two pointed cauteries over both temples if there is water discharge from both ears, or on one side if there is water discharge from only one ear.
Cauterize all the veins and arteries that are beneath this line, with the cauteries placed at a distance equal to the width of your thumb from the temples.
Be careful of blood flow when cauterizing; if you see blood flowing from the site, stop and apply some medicine to it if you can.
And I will come with wisdom that is in extraction of arrows and in the excision of those, and caution against blood flow.
And sometimes it is cauterized in the neck, below both bones with two pointed cauteries that are newly made.
The Roman numeral 'XIII' typically represents the number 13. In this context, it likely indicates the chapter or section number in the medieval medical treatise you provided earlier.
De cauterizacio de lacrimas antiquas.
When the tears in the eyes are frequent and flow through the veins and arteries to a visible place on the head, and it is verified that there is an excess of phlegmatic humor, then cauterize that area with the same cautery we mentioned at the beginning for boiling water on the eyes, and apply one cautery to the middle of the head, two to the neck below both temples, and another two to the nape of the neck. And if you need to treat any additional issues, then cauterize that area on the entire length of the eyelid near the eyelash with a small cautery.
Chapter 14.
On the cauterization of nasal odor.
When you treat that area with what we have mentioned before in the division and your treatment is not effective, then prepare a drink for the patient made of snails for three nights; then shave their head, and cauterize it with a medium-sized olive tree cautery. Then, cauterize that area with nail-sized cauteries in two places over the eyebrows near the hairs but smaller.
And be careful not to cut that artery.
As for the pointed cautery, this is its shape.
Chapter 15.
Regarding the cautery for softening the eyelids of the eyes.
When the eyelid of the eye is softened due to illness or moisture, then cauterize that eyelid with this lunar-shaped cautery; and this is its form:
And if you were to cauterize this area above the eyebrows with two small, separate cauteries that extend up from the temples. And let the length of each cautery be according to the amount/length of the eyebrow.
And do not press the cautery too hard with your hand, but rather according to how much the upper eyelid is stuck together.
Chapter 16.
Regarding the cautery for the eyelid of the eye when the hairs become sparse within it and around its socket.
When the skin of the wound is turned into scabs inside so that it becomes sore to the touch, cauterization on those areas can be done in two ways: either with fire or with caustic medicine.
If you use cauterization with fire, ask the patient to shave their hair like those who clean themselves, even if it takes a long time and is unpleasant; and when you've done that, you must cover his wounds with a bandage so they don't get worse while the hairs grow back.
Once the hairs have grown back and are shaved again, place the patient's head on your lap, then make a sign over their eyes with ash in the shape of a myrtle leaf, starting the sign near the hair.
Then place a poultice of pigeon dung or ground flax seed on the wound.
And then ignite this particular type of cautery.
Then cauterize the area you've marked in small dots, gradually burning away the surface of the skin so that it resembles a myrtle leaf in appearance.
And a sign of the good condition of the skin's work is that you see the eyelid of the hole already being contracted and his hairs be raised above the puncture of the eye.
So raise your hand and leave it like that for three days, and then place a pillow under them until the sore is raised. Then cure her with ointment so that it gets healed.
But if for some reason the hairs grow back and the eyelid gets softened, then do another cauterization like you did in the first place.
But if the hairs remain on the eyelid, then cauterize it to lift them up to their original place and align them so they don't hurt the eye.
But if the cauterization with caustic medicine is that you command the patient to pull out the hairs until they are long and aligned, then a cloth-made leaf of myrtle should be prepared.
Then take one ounce of known wax and fresh cow's fat, mix those causes well, and make this a thick paste so it doesn't cool down; then spread this over the cloth that is made in the shape of a myrtle leaf, and place this on one or both eyes; then put under the eye a linen cloth soaked in egg white, and have their head resting on your lap.
Place your finger on the medicine and press it lightly, but be careful not to irritate the wound until the patient feels a burning sensation from the medicine, for this burning is like fire.
So when you perceive that the patient has felt enough of this burning sensation, then remove your finger from the medicine and use your little finger to gently wipe it away; once the burning subsides, remove the medicine and clean the wound with water. Then, examine whether the eyelid is already elevated like a swollen eyelid should be. If not, you must proceed either by applying heat or making an incision, for then it will be well. And if not, repeat the application of the medicine to the same spot where there was no pressure from your finger and do so without harming the wound, lest your operation is ruined and the eye damaged.
Then place a compress on it with a cloth so that the discharge of pus is removed from the wound, and then treat it with ointment or another healing substance until it heals.
It is necessary for you to ensure in your operation that no medicine falls into the eye and should the eyelid after a few days become softened by some cause of hair touching it, then repeat your medicine on this spot where the eyelid has softened, doing so just as you did at first, until healing occurs.
E aquesta es la forma de fuelha de mirtra."
And know that the bodies of men are diversified according to their size and smallness, and therefore your treatment must be adjusted accordingly.
And let the path of healing not be hidden from him who is studied in this art.
This appears to be a chapter or section heading, but without further context, I cannot determine its exact meaning. Is there additional text or information that you would like me to translate or interpret?
On the cauterization of a fistula that is located in the tear duct of the eye.
When you treat a fistula using the methods described in the previous sections without success, it is necessary to cauterize it as follows: instruct the patient to place their head on your lap and have an assistant hold their head gently between their hands, ensuring they are comfortable and not agitated.
Then place a ball of wool or cotton pad soaked in oil on the patient's eye.
Then apply this type of cautery, which is shaped as follows:" (Here, the text likely describes the shape or form of the cautery tool.)
It should be concave in shape, resembling the quill of a reed or an eagle's feather, with the cautery at one end.
And if you (are), then penetrate into the other extremity. And if you wish, come out like that as well (as it tries to escape).
However, the one who is concave is better for this operation.
Then press on the open fistula and try to cleanse it; dry that (wound) well. And if it is not open, then open it (the fistula) yourself and extract the pus from it.
Then place on it the cautery that is well ignited; hold your hand over the patient's nose with the cautery slightly away from his nostrils so as not to burn your own hand or disturb the patient, then place the cautery against the nostril and cauterize it.
And if at the beginning of your cauterization you perceive bone, it is good (to continue); but if not, then repeat the cautery once or twice if necessary; leave it like this for three days and place a compress over it; cover it with drying ointment until it heals.
If eleven days have passed and there is still no healing, then apply an acute corrosive medicine on him until the bone is exposed and scraped according to what is mentioned in your chapter.
Another method of cauterizing a fistula, as some ancient physicians said: go to the location of the fistula and open it; then place in that opening a soft ball whose form is like this: Make one ounce of molten lead inside it; hold your hand carefully so that the patient is not harmed by the molten lead reaching his wound; cover the patient's wound with linen cloth dipped in egg white or water, because lead hardens the location of the fistula and heals it miraculously.
If the fistula is healed by what we have said about cauterization and treatment, it is good. But if not, then it is necessary to administer a nasal tube and reduce the fistula into the nose as will follow in its proper place.
Chapter XVIII.
On the cauterization of anal fissures.
Wounds that occur in the form of fissures on the lips happen very often, especially in children's lips.
Therefore, when you treat those fractures with what we have discussed in the previous sections and your treatment is not effective, then use a small pointed cautery like this one as shown below:
And let the cavity of the patient be according to the sharpness of the knife.
Then place that heated end of the cautery carefully into those fractures until it reaches their depth.
And then treat it with ointment until it is healed.
It seems that this indicates the end of section 19 in your medieval medical treatise, am I right? Would you like me to translate another part of it for you?
Regarding the cauterization of fistulas in the mouth."
Here is the translation of the provided text:
If the bone is broken and has healed well, it is good; otherwise, it will be necessary to open up the wound and remove the rotten bone, as described in its own chapter.
It seems you have included the beginning of another sentence or phrase. Could you please provide me with more context to accurately translate this text?
On the cauterization of teeth and softening of veins.
When the gums are softened by humidity and the teeth are inflamed, treating them with medicines will not help. Place the patient's head in your lap, then take a cautery of the shape that I will describe now, place the tube over the tooth, and insert the burning cauterization tool quickly; hold it there until the patient feels heat from the fire at the root of the tooth.
Then lift your hand, and repeat the cauterization several times as you wish.
Then have the patient rinse their mouth with salt water and hold it there for an hour; after that, dry out the mouth because the inflamed tooth is cooled down, the softened gum is tightened up, and the corrupting humidity has been dried.
Here is my best attempt at translating the text line by line into English:
De cauterisacio de dolor de dent.
When tooth pain is caused by coldness or when there is a chill or worm in the tooth, and you cannot treat it with medicine, then cauterization of that area can be done in two ways: either with cow dung or with fire (heat).
For cauterization with cow dung, you take fresh cow dung and wrap it around the end of an iron rod (or similar implement), then dip this wrapped end in hot cow dung, and place it quickly on the painful tooth until it becomes cold.
Repeat this process several times until the healing property of the heat reaches the root of the tooth.
And if you prefer to dip wool or cotton in the cow dung and place it on the sore tooth, then put an ignited iron rod on top of this until the iron reaches the hollow cavity of the tooth.
However, be cautious with cauterization by fire; pay attention to the size of the cautery (quannula), whether it is made of copper or iron, and ensure that there are no large objects or sharp points inside the patient's mouth which could cause harm.
Then heat the cautery to the appropriate shape, place it on the tooth and hold your hand over it until the cautery becomes cold; do this several times per day for as long as the pain persists or is aggravated.
And when the patient feels pressure from the cautery, they should fill their mouth with good wine and hold it there for an hour before spitting it out; this is the proper way to apply the cautery.
Cauterize any extremity that you see fit based on your judgment.
This is the shape of the cannula:" (proceeds to describe the physical appearance or design of the medical device)
I can assist with various types of queries, but I'm not entirely sure what you mean by "Capitol xxii." If there's something specific related to the medical treatise or another aspect you'd like me to address, feel free to provide more context!

And then treat him with ointments, bandages, and linens until he is healed.
Chapter 23.
Regarding the cauterization of the throat for voice issues and the treatment of suffocation.
When moisture accumulates in the lungs, especially when it is caused by a cold constitution, the patient should be evacuated at the beginning with laxative medicines, and then cauterize that area around the base of the neck where needed.
Make sure you do not apply the cautery to the neck itself, nor burn its tendons excessively.
Cauterize that area with another cautery tool at the junction of the spine in the lower back. Let the cauterization be fixed according to the previous method.
Then treat him with the previously mentioned remedies until he is healed.
Chapter 24.
On the cauterization for lung disease and coughing.
When coughing and lung disease are caused by cold and damp humors, and the patient has no fever or cough, and it is an old illness, then cauterize them with two cauteries on the furcula (collarbone) in the areas below the lions (shoulders) and breasts; and another cautery on the mid-point of the foot between two mammillae (breasts); and let the cautery be fixed according to the preceding form.
And if you wish, your cauterization may be done by puncturing with the cautery called 'puncta', the form of which was described earlier in the section on earache puncture.
And if there is pus in any of them, then treat him with what was mentioned earlier to be put on so that he may be cured.
And already the cautery has three marks, as this cauterization can be done with it: in one go you may do three cauteries according to this form:
Chapter 25.
On the cauterization of titillic, which is the head of the hyoid bone.
When the head of the humerus is dislocated due to lubricating humidity and it is not firmly held during its return, you must guide its dislocation so that it returns to its usual position; then, with a slight movement, displace it so it falls back into place as we have witnessed. Then you should first reduce the dislocation by reversing the patient onto their back or side; next, raise the elbow which is on the inner side of the armpit towards the upper parts using your left hand's fingers if the joint is dislocated inwards
Then take a cautery with two heads; this is its shape...
...and cauterize the elbow so that it penetrates from one side to the other; this will create a cauterization figure with two heads of the cautery.
Sometimes, according to the above account, eight cauteries would be used for adjustment.
Place salt on the cautery with holes and then ask the patient to remain calm; make sure the member is not moved for some time until it has healed.
And if the dislocation is in the upper parts and it is done this way, then cauterize on the muscle with a large/pointed cautery or many small cauteries, for the joint is confirmed, moisture is driven out, and the patient is healed.
Chapter 26.
On the cauterization of the stomach.
When coldness and moisture come into the stomach, which disturbs its natural condition and multiplies raw material in it, and if you continue the methods of cure but do not confirm them, then place the patient on his back again and extend their arms and legs, and cauterize that part with three cauteries: one under the foot for a finger's length using a large/pointed cautery, and two cauteries under the two sides of it so that the shape of the cauterization is triangular; elongate between them without fitting closely together so that they make scabs.
And if the depth of the cauterization is about two thirds of the thickness of a wire.
And the figure of the cautery is according to this addition, E if you wish, cauterize with a large cautery in the middle of the stomach according to this form; and this should be a cautery according to the shape of a circle according to this form:" (It seems that there would have been an illustration at this point in the original text.)
Certainly, let's continue with the translation:
It seems you've provided an interesting excerpt from a medieval medical text! I will do my best to translate each line into English:
De cauterizacio del fietge fret.
When there is pain in the kidneys due to coldness or excessive humidity and wind which has thrown it out of its normal state with superfluous movement, and the patient is treated as we have said without improvement, then it is advisable that the patient be turned over onto their neck, and you will place three cauterizers of this shape on top of each other above the kidney under the hypochondria where they are in contact with the skin.
And the space between each cauterizer should be about the width of a finger, and the cauterizers themselves should have a length equivalent to that of one's own right hand.
And do not press hard with your cauterizers.
If the amount of material that adheres to them is less than half the thickness of a chain link, and if it is not applied more firmly; and if the patient stands on their feet without collapsing further; or else they are sitting down with legs already spread apart, arms raised up slightly.
It is up to you whether you choose to cauterize these areas with the round-bladed cautery instrument; it depends on your skill and discretion in applying this art.  It may be a matter of personal preference or circumstance as to which method one employs, so long as proper care is taken.
And make sure you do not proceed too quickly with the cauterization process, ensuring that the entire surface of the flesh is adhered to so that the whole body is affected and it reaches the intestines, for the iron here is delicate; be aware of this.
I can assist with your translation needs, but I'm unclear about your request. Could you please clarify what you'd like me to do regarding "Capitol .xxviii."? Are there specific text or instructions related to it that you want me to translate or explain?
On the perforation of kidney abscesses with a cautery.
When the abscess erupts in the kidney and you want to know if it is within the flesh of the kidney or its membrane, then if it is within the flesh of the kidney, the patient's condition will worsen and pain increases.
And if it is in the membrane of the kidney, there will be great pain and often doctors are already tired of treating him.
So have the patient lie on their back and examine the location of the abscess carefully; then take the cautery which is attached to a catgut thread, its shape described previously. E cauteriza am aquel i cauteri entro que tota la codena sia comborida, entro que pervengua al ciphac, entro qu’en yesca sania.
And then treat him with the same cure as for other abscesses until he is healed.
Only this form of cauterization should be used when the student in the art of medicine is experienced and skilled, having treated various ailments before; although he may have had some daring experiences with this operation, nonetheless, we must make it gentle and improve upon it.
Chapter 29.
On the cauterization of ulcers.
The ancient cautery for ulcers was done by using the root of aristolochia, which is prepared in this way: take a long and thin root from the plant that is found to be as thick as your finger.
Then immerse it in oil and heat it over fire; then cauterize with a cautery at the point where the neck connects to the spine; also use two small cauteries below these, slightly angled towards the lower part of the beard area; and two more cauteries that are angled between the fifth rib and scapula, slightly angling downward toward the rear areas; another cautery in the middle of the chest; one over the stomach, three at the back; and one where it is located between both shoulders, as well as two on each side of the chest, below the one between the shoulders.
And do not hold your hand over the cautery; instead be in the visible part of the operation.
Some ancient ones said that some men use an iron cautery resembling a ray and set fire to it; then they put the hot iron in the space between the ribs so that we can reach the abscess and cure it, as we have said for liver abscesses.
There is no fear in this cautery perforation because its mortality rate is almost instantaneous or the patient develops a fistula that cannot be healed.
It seems you are referring to chapter 30 of the medieval medical treatise, which appears to provide guidance on treating various ailments. Can I assist with any further translation or information?
On cauterization of the mouth.
Here is my best attempt at translating the text:
And the thickness of each cautery should be about the width of a finger or slightly more, and the shape of the cautery should be the same as we mentioned earlier for the cautery of the liver.
Do not press your hand onto the cautery; let the patient lie on their back.
There is another way to cauterize, which involves igniting a cautery with two vents, as we have previously mentioned in the chapter on muscle dislocation. Raise the patient's right arm, which is on the side of the injury, so that it does not touch the ground while they are lying down.
Let the height of your elevation when lifting their arm be proportional to the length of their body, so that you can make cauterizations according to the breadth of their chest.
Then bring the two vents together, ignite them quickly, and insert your arm from the other side.
Then withdraw the cautery, and thus four cauterizations have been performed.
And if you wish to cauterize with a three-vented cautery...
And then you treat the cautery wounds that have been left untreated for too many days, as this is more effective than any of the previous steps in the healing process.
Chapter 31.
On the cauterization of dropsy (edema).
Cauterization is not suitable for treating edema; instead, it should be specifically used for alleviating gout.
When you treat dropsy using the methods of cure we have described previously without success, then it is necessary to cauterize with four cauteries around the navel area and one cautery on the stomach; another cautery on the spleen; a further cautery on the mesentery (a membrane connecting the intestines to the abdominal wall); two cauteries between the vertebrae of the back; one cautery at the right ankle joint, and another cautery on the abdomen. The depth of the cautery should be proportional to the severity of the disease.
Then leave the cauterized area open, allowing air to reach it for an extended period.
And do not remove the patient from treatment with the cautery using what covers it so that two intentions are added to him, and it will be hurried to him with healing help.
The shape of the cautery with which the belly is cauterized should be nail-shaped according to its preceding form, and it is this one with which the back is cauterized that has an olive-like shape as mentioned previously.
I am unable to determine the meaning of this phrase without additional context or information. Could you please provide me with more details or explain what you would like me to do with "Capitol .xxxii."?
On the cauterization of the feet and thighs."
When the feet are swollen with edema and filled with yellowish water (edema), you should cauterize the feet on the back of the foot, in a spot that is between the auricular and annular, raise your hand holding the cautery and do not twist it; then lift your hand and do not lower it at all, because the yellowish liquid will drain out.
This means: Then make two cauteries on the two thighs, and on each thigh a cautery should be made with the pointed end of the knife-like cautery. The translation is: And the cauteries should be made according to the length of the thigh: one below the knee, and the other in the middle part of the thigh; each thigh will have two cauteries.
Leave the wound open without any treatment for a long time, so that some liquid drains from it.
Then treat the patient with those remedies which we have mentioned earlier.
The Latin number *xxxiii* corresponds to 33, so this might be the 33rd chapter of the medical treatise you provided. It is not clear what "capitol" refers to in this context, however. Is there anything else I can help you with?
This text seems to be the title of another chapter from the same medical treatise. It translates to "About cauterization of abdominal hernia". Can I provide you with a translation of this chapter as well?
When abdominal pain is caused by cold and moisture that weakens the ribs, it affects the digestive and retaining powers located in the stomach and intestines. This condition can be treated with remedies rather than surgery; sometimes patients undergo cauterization to cure their ailment. In such cases, treat the patient's abdomen using a large cautery as described above for abdominal cauterizations, along with circular cauterization around the navel area, four small cauteries on the circumference of the navel, and a pointed cautery. You can also use a cautery over the alcatin or two cauteries.
And if you notice excessive humidity and the patient can tolerate it, treat them with cauterization on the pubic area and intestines, but do not place two cauteries too close together on the abdomen near the groin, for this is an effective treatment that should be applied correctly to avoid errors.
Chapter 34: Treatment of Diseases by Causing Burns or Scarring (aka Cauterization)
On the cauterization of old hemorrhoids.
When treating old hemorrhoids caused by the nature of thick, cold humours or corrupted moisture and the aforementioned treatments are not working, apply three small cauteries on top below the lower spine and two smaller triangles, along with a cautery above the navel for twice as long.
Here is my translation of the provided text:
Here is my best translation attempt for each line:
De cauterizacio de atheyl aprop la abscizio de lor.
When you cut out the testicle, then ignite the cautery which is assembled with a fire rod. Then insert the ignited end into the removed testicle, and finally use your hand to guide the cautery towards the opening of the vein from which blood flows.
Do this once or twice, for if there are multiple testicles, then cauterize each of them as mentioned earlier, and finally treat them with ointments until they are healed.
And if you cauterize someone with a large cautery, it is more effective to do so on the back.
It seems that this might be the chapter number in the treatise, specifically Chapter 36. Is there another text portion you would like me to translate?
Regarding the cauterization of fistulas that naturally occur in various parts of the body..." Here, it appears we have reached the title of another chapter in this medieval medical treatise. Shall I continue translating?
When nature does not obey the operation we have described in its place and the patient is terrified by this, treat them with a cautery to heal.
So when someone has a fistula on their back that is old and full of corrupted matter and moisture, what should be done first is to probe it gently with the aforementioned thin instrument, and then ascertain its depth."  Would you like me to translate more text?
Aprop igneys le cauteri que es semblant a ray. And then place that ignited cautery into this fistula, and adjust it according to the amount of tissue you want to treat.
Repeat the process of applying the cautery as many times as needed until those corrupt and putrid tissues are burnt; once or twice or three times, depending on how much treatment is required.
Be cautious of burning any nerves or veins; also take care if the fistula is close to the bladder or intestines, avoid those areas; only perform this treatment when the fistula is in fleshy tissue and you believe it is not penetrating deeper.
Then treat the area until it is healed.
And if the wound is closed, and all matter has been removed from it, and it remains this way for a long time, then you will know that it is fully healed.
But if the matter has not been fully removed from the wound, then know that it is either penetrating deeper or the bone has become corrupted, or this will cause issues in the future.
It seems you have provided me with the chapter number of a medical treatise, which is Chapter 37 based on the Roman numerals provided (.xxxvii.). Would you like me to translate any more text?
De cauterizacio dels ronhos."
When there is pain in the lungs due to a cold or severe congestion, and as a result, the patient's condition worsens, it is advisable to cauterize those areas on the lungs with a pointed cautery for each lung, which requires careful attention.
And definitely use the second one lightly, below it will be three parallel lines of cauterization, and thus they will increase in strength from behind.
Chapter 38.
On the cauterization of the bladder.
When there is a weakening and softening of the bladder due to cold and humidity, resulting in the patient's inability to retain urine, then cauterize that area below it, starting from where the hairs of the pubic region begin, with one cauterization on the right side and another on the left.
And let the length of each cauterization be according to the number of toes on a foot; perform that cautery at the lowest part of the back, or two cauterizations if necessary.
And let the pointed cautery be used as required.
The provided text is written in an archaic language that resembles Latin, French, Spanish, and Italian. However, it seems to be a unique dialect or an older version of these languages combined with medical terminology. Here's my best attempt at translating each line into English:
De cauterizacio de la mayra." translates to "On cauterization of the varicose veins." or "Regarding the cauterization of the varicose veins."
When it comes to the onset of cold and humid weather, which is known to hinder conception, and also corrupts a woman's menstruation, delaying their arrival and causing pain during intercourse, then it is recommended that the area be cauterized with three cauteries around the navel region, as we have previously mentioned in reference to bladder cautery; or apply one or two cauteries just below the back bone, ensuring they are embedded.
Chapter 40. (This refers to the chapter number in the medieval medical treatise.)
Regarding the cauterization for ankle dislocation. (This is the title of the chapter, indicating its focus.)
When excessive humidity and mucous infiltrate the ankle area, leading to its displacement from its proper position, it is identified by comparing one leg with the other and noticing that one calf lies over the other. (This text describes a physical examination method.) The area of dislocation is found in the joints of the leg bones. (Here, the text identifies the specific location of the dislocation.)
Therefore, it is necessary to cauterize the patient over their ankle area using round cauteries, as you will have noticed by attempting in the region of the ankle itself, and thus ensuring that this part falls within the center of the circle formed by the cautery. (This section guides the medical practitioner on how to apply the cautery treatment.)
And the pointed tip is used in the process of cauterizing the stomach.
And if this specific pointed tip is not available to you, then use three large olive-shaped cauteries for the process of cauterization.
The cautery is done according to the severity of the entire condition, and then treat whatever needs healing.
This indicates that this section is chapter 41 in the medieval medical treatise. Would you like me to translate any more text?
On the cauterization of the sciatic vein."
When pain occurs in the back region and it is caused by coldness and moisture, treat the patient with what we have previously said (mentioned) and do not neglect this, for it is an ancient remedy. Then remove the excess bodily fluids through foul-smelling pills or artificial pills that resemble them; and cauterize accordingly.
The method of cauterization in this case follows two approaches: cauterization with burning medicines or cauterization with fire.
It follows two scientific methods, one of which is to cauterize the patient's back region with three triangular-shaped cauteries arranged in this manner; make sure they are deep enough. The space between each of the cauteries should be equivalent to the width of a finger, and the size of the cauteries can be either olive-sized or larger.
In some cases, the cauterization is done on one side of the patient's back near their neck using four cauteries instead of three.
If you wish, proceed with the circular cauterization that precedes the back region's displacement, ensuring it thoroughly encloses and burns all affected areas of the spine.
And this is the method of cauterization for sciatica, when pain adheres to the hip and does not extend into the groin.
If it has extended into the groin, then cauterize it with two cauteries on the hip over the area where the patient feels the pain; and with one cautery on the calf four fingers below the back of the knee.
If it is a knife-like cautery, let the depth of the cauterization be according to the amount of severity or intensity of the pain.
And if the patient indicates that the pain has extended into the area near the soles of the feet, then cauterize it here wherever you apply a cautery for three or four points, or more if required.
And if the patient indicates pain below the thigh, then cauterize it there with a knife-like cautery.
Be cautious during all cauterizations not to finish or end the procedure by burning nerves or major arteries, which could harm the patient.
I have seen one or two of those who were cauterized on the calf and ended up with an inflamed bed sore on the foot due to a tumor that developed there, and the foot became perforated and corrupted. And then there is a strong discharge from the abdomen, and with it comes death.
And if the pain is in two places at once, cauterize each part according to this method.
The wise ones said that for cauterization with water, the instrument used should be like a metal circle, with a circumference of half a palm; and its aperture should be as wide as a date pit or slightly less.
Inside this circle, place another third circle; the space between them should be the thickness of a thumb; and these circles should be open on two sides. The length of these segments should be one or two thumbs long, and make iron handles for them appropriately attached to the circles. This is how they are formed:
Then it should be ignited in the fire until it turns red and sparks fly; then place it on the affected area of the patient's body while they lie on their side. And thus, you will cauterize him with three round cauteries in one go.
Then leave it be for three days, then apply a poultice of butter and leave the affected area open for several days. Finally, cure him with fire until he is healed.
Diys Albucasis: Oh, my child, we have used this type of cautery sparingly due to the fear it instills and because few people can bear its effects.
May the good cautery bring relief to those who endure it, and may it also heal their wounds.
May the cautery with adhesive medicines be prepared by making two circles using a perforated brass ring, from which hangs the key to the iron gate; let its length along the wall be about two nuts or so.
And if the space between each is equal to the width of a finger; and they are open below and above, and contain within them two pieces arranged in this way:
Then place the patient on their side over the split in the bench, and press your hand upon the part of the ankle; then take warm water and pour it between the two circles, gradually increasing its temperature, and let it remain like this for about an hour, and let the patient endure the stinging sensation and the burning — as this sting is like fire — until the sting ceases.
And then lift your hand with the instrument and wipe away all the dirty water using clean water.
Let him rest for three days and place on it a poultice until the blackness of the swelling subsides, then let this be done for some more days, and the redness will disappear from him; that is the last treatment.
And then treat him with ointment until he is healed.
And if the pain extends to the groin or leg, make him sit in water as is done for the hip equally.
This is the way of dirty water, and I have already written about it in the treatise on medicine correction. Take some alkali and fresh ashes from each of them yearly, part one, and mix them; place it in a new pot whose lid has a small hole pierced according to the amount that fits inside.
Place the bottom of this pot inside another inverted one; pour over that alkali and fresh ashes lukewarm water which covers those up to your finger; then press them with your hand well, let the liquid from the warm water drip into the lower dish.
Here is my translation of the provided text:
And for some medications that require a wide cauterization area, take tithing (tezizic), honey (mel), and goat's milk cheese (anacrat) with salt mixed in so that they are combined.
Gale recollects a story about an ancient man who underwent surgery and was cured of hip pain and sciatica. He speaks highly of this cure and claims that no other treatment is needed, as it provides permanent relief, just like he narrates it here. Because once that person took a bath in the river and immediately felt better.
If it's close to a green walnut tree, and if you can't find one that is green, take a fresh fig; chop it up finely with a little salt, place it on the hip where there is pain or on the thigh, leg, bind it.
Leave it for three hours or until the patient feels relief from the inflammation.
Then put him in a bath, and once his body is relaxed, immerse the affected area in the water; for then the pain ceases, and he becomes cured.
Keep in mind that one must not use any kind of cauterization with these medications but rather focus on the body's natural evacuation.
Here is my translation of the provided text:
Here is my translation of the provided text: And then repeat this process, do not stop until the sensation of the bite reaches the hip and relieves the pain.
This method of cauterization is called cow cautery.
This appears to be a chapter or section heading, marked as Chapter 42. Is there another text portion you would like translated?
On the cauterization of back pain." Do you have additional text that requires translation? I can assist with each line or section as needed.
Some back pain occurs due to various causes, such as falling, being hit, or excessive evacuation, and similar causes like the infiltration of cold and moist matter." Shall I continue with the translation?
Cauterization is only appropriate in this specific case, which arises due to the effusion of cold matter." I can provide further translations if you have more text.
Therefore, immediately administer to the patient purgative pills and similar ones, which are prepared from the back where the pain is located across three lines according to its width; then place on each line ten small cauteries or more, depending on how much the patient can tolerate and their strength." Feel free to provide additional text for translation.
And if cauterization with a pointed instrument needs to be done.
If you wish, proceed with the cauterization using three or four pointed cautery instruments arranged in this manner.
I apologize for any confusion. I am unable to determine what you mean by "Capitol .xliii." Could you please clarify or provide additional context? I'd be happy to assist once we have a clearer understanding of your request!
On the cauterization process at the beginning stage of jaundice.
This disease often affects young children, and the initial sign of its onset in infants is observed when their abdomen becomes elevated and moves upwards during coughing or sneezing.
Additionally, it affects the lower back region near the last vertebra and the corresponding ribs, where one can observe its initial signs as the affected part begins to rise above other vertebrae.
And when you observe this condition and wish to prevent it from spreading further, proceed with the cauterization using a circular-shaped instrument in the following manner: Take your pointed cautery instrument and cover all affected parts of the vertebra, equally.
If you prefer, repeat the cauterization process along the circumference of the affected vertebra using two or three lines with your pointed instrument. And let these points be close together.
Then treat the wound until it is healed using what we have described above.
Make sure the cautery is not applied excessively, as it may cause nerve spasms.
It seems you provided me with chapter number 44 in Roman numerals. Do you have any text related to this chapter that I could translate for you?
On the cauterization of gout and joint pain."
When joint pain is caused by the friction of cold humors which infiltrate each part of the body, and when pain occurs in the feet, it is customarily called gout by doctors.
And thus, when gout caused by friction is cured using this method of cure and the pain remains unalleviated, then more cauterization is required.
And it is necessary to cauterize that area after the evacuation around the joint of the foot using multiple small cauteries.
And the shape of this particular pointed cautery is as follows...
And if it is necessary to make points on the surface of the foot, then do so with a pointed cautery. And if the pain spreads into the toes or other joints, and this sometimes happens, then cauterize that area over each toe with three or four of these pointed cauteries in total.
And if you find that these cauteries are necessary for you, then when cauterizing the area, do not press too hard with your hand on the cautery beforehand; only as much pressure as a single small coin is required.
And if pain spreads towards the hips and back, then administer the cautery as we have mentioned in our chapter.
And if the pain is in the hands alone and it's called rheumatism, then prick along the line of little veins as they twist around, pricking those two lines.
And if the pain remains in them, then prick along the line of little veins over each joint and over the knuckle of the hand.
And if the pain moves towards the knees or muscles after a few days, then cauterize each of them on all parts of the shins.
Do not discharge the patient from good regimen and reception of medicines, for if this cautery is done with proper diet and fever is discharged, God willing they will be cured.
The number ".xlv." likely represents the chapter or section number of this medical treatise, specifically chapter 45. This numbering system is reminiscent of Latin numerals, which were commonly used in medieval texts to organize content.
The title "De cauterizacio de rompeduras" translates to "On the cauterization of fractures." This indicates that the following chapter or section likely discusses the use of cautery in treating broken bones or severe injuries, a practice commonly employed in medieval medicine.
When there is a rupture in the inguinal region and the intestines are protruding outside due to an inguinal hernia, this process starts here. In such cases, you should instruct the patient to skip their meal that day and use remedies that promote healing so that the wound heals from within the abdomen.
Then hold the patient between your two hands on their back, and instruct them to keep their legs together so that neither the hernia nor the intestines are visible or protruding.
Then bring him back to the previously mentioned position and try to locate the rupture over the pubic bone, indicating that the extremity resembles half a circle at the parted sides of the abdomen.
Then take the pointed cautery that is shaped like this: [describe or draw the shape of the cautery]
Which is red-hot and emits sparks. Then return the intestine or hernia to its cavity, and place your hand over the area to prevent the intestine from coming out.
You have already opened the space between the patient's thighs, placed a cushion under them, another servant is on their legs, and another one is on their chest holding their hands.

And carefully observe the placement of the intestine during your cauterization process, making sure you do not burn the intestine to avoid causing death or other serious harm to the patient.
Know that when you use the cautery, do not touch the bone; otherwise, your operation will be ineffective.
Ensure that the children's cautery is delicate, according to their size and proportions.
Then take care of the cauterization site for three days, keeping it covered so that the scar from the fire is not exposed.
Then take care of those other burns until they are fully healed.
Let the patient lie on their back for forty days, ensuring that the site and wound are kept sealed.
Be sure to provide proper nutrition for the patient according to the length of their recovery time; this will soothe their stomach and prevent the intestine from coming out due to strain during healing.
Then when you want to lift them after forty days, do so carefully and appropriately; keep them in this position for another forty days.
Under this regimen of healing, he should rest and refrain from work, heavy meals, and strong drinks; avoid loud noises or voices because when adhering to this treatment, one can expect complete recovery.
For the treatment of ruptures in other parts of the abdomen, if it is recent and you want to prevent its extraction, cauterize the rupture with a round cautery according to its size, just like the third part of it; then treat it with what we have said before, which is not appropriate.
I have already said that some believe the rupture should be cauterized with a triangular cautery according to this shape because it is marked with thread:
And a thread is placed across the width above the rupture and another line above it; then place your hand with a pointed cautery, but the first cautery is lighter and better.
Chapter 46.
On the cauterization of dislocations.
When an injury occurs in any member due to a fall or blow and the pain persists for a long time without healing with medicines, then you should cauterize it with a pointed cautery.
And make sure the size of the cautery for each limb is in accordance with its magnitude and weakness as well as the location of the twist and pain.
So if the patient is cured by this first cauterization, it's good; but if not, repeat the cautery on them; because usually for these pains, they need to be punctured from one limb to another that are close to each other, so you should continue with the cautery until the patient is healed.
It seems like you have provided part of an old medical text, Chapter 47 to be precise. It might contain instructions or guidance for specific treatments or procedures in the medieval context. Would you like me to continue translating this chapter? I can provide further insights if you wish to explore it more deeply.
On the cauterization of leprosy."
The lepers were sometimes treated with cautery, which was quite effective for a specific type of leprosy caused by the putrefaction of phlegm and melancholy.
So when you want to cauterize him, consider whether the leprosy is common and treat it as we have said in the division, but do not use this method if the disease has spread throughout his body and affected all of its functions; be afraid that corruption will overtake his entire body. In this case, cauterize him on the head with five cauteries: one on the top of the head, another slightly below it, a third towards the front near the hairline; two more at the temples; and finally one at the back, on the nape or neck.
Lastly, hold the cautery lightly in your hand before applying it to the bone, creating a small indentation, and shift the scabs aside so that his thick exhalations are eased; then cauterize as needed on the affected area.
If the leprosy has already spread across his body and is visible, then you must cauterize him with the five cauteries we mentioned on the head; add one at the tip of the nose, two more on each cheekbone, and two on the vertebrae of the neck; six cauteries on the vertebrae of the back, one large one near the tailbone, another on the hip bone, then two on the hips themselves, as well as one over each hip; two over the shoulders and one over each shoulder; two more above the elbows, plus two on his biceps and triceps. Lastly, cauterize him on all the joints of arms and legs, including each heel, and finally, the wrists.
And be cautious of the nerves which are above the ankle, so as not to damage them.
Sometimes it is necessary to cauterize with a cautery on the bone of the penis and another on the mouth of the stomach, and yet another on the liver.
Know that the more tightly you apply the cautery, the more beneficial and effective it is; and be aware that the patient feels no pain from the cautery, just as they do not from their own injuries, because their body is already stunned.
Ensure that the cauteries are either large or small, depending on the body parts and joints, as was previously explained regarding the types of tools.
Then treat the cauterized area with a mixture of egg yolk flour and honey, continuing this treatment until it is healed.

On the cauterization of stupor."
When any limb is paralyzed or numb and it does not heal with medicines, oils, and plasters, then you cauterize that paralyzed limb with a cautery according to the size of the limb or its smallness.
And if your cauterization enters the sensitive area of the groin slightly, Then cure it with ointment until it is healed.
And some scars are cauterized due to numbness that affects the hands and feet, as well as the vertebrae of the back, and it hinders the movement of nerves that move that limb, and the scar is hardened.
No one should presume to do this unless they are wise in the anatomy of the limbs and the emergence of nerves throughout the entire body.
I am happy to assist you with another translation if you provide me with more text, but please note that I have completed the provided text from your initial prompt.
On the cauterization of white scars which is morphea.
When the wound is old and does not respond to any of the treatments in the medical arsenal, then you cauterize it with a hot iron for a short time according to the quantity needed, until the whiteness and the redness are removed, and its color has changed.
Then treat it with a mixture of ground beans and lentils with rose oil and arnagrosa leaves, and add either pigeon blood or quail blood, each in equal parts, mix them all together, then wrap the wound with a cloth until it is healed.

On burning the skull."
When cancer begins and you wish to treat it, then cauterize it with a circular cautery around its circumference as if it were rolled up.
The wise men said that it should be cauterized with the last cautery in its middle place; but I have not seen this, as I fear it may become ulcerated, and I have witnessed this on several occasions.
And it is more appropriate for it to be cauterized around its circumference with a circular instrument as we have said, or with many small cauteries.
It seems that you are referring to chapter 1 of the medieval medical treatise. Is there anything else I can help you with regarding this text or its translation?
On the cauterization of proud flesh."
When some wound is delayed in healing due to excessive discharge, or because of the patient's condition, as they may be old and feeble with little blood, or due to the time of year, and you wish to hasten its maturation; then cauterize around it using small pointed cauteries, and let that discharge which hinders its maturation.
However, if you wish to perforate it with a cautery, then ignite the following type of cautery and place it in the middle of the wound until the skin is penetrated.
And if the cautery is applied to that spot which is lower down in order to relieve pressure on the arm; then treat it until it is healed.
Chapter 52. (The roman numeral "lii" represents 52)
On the cauterization of ulcers.
An ulcer is a moving corruption in the body which corrodes it like fire consuming dry wood.
Therefore, if you see that ulcer in a place which has suffered from hot iron cauterization, then ignite pointed nails of few and large size according to the suitability for that spot where there is an ulcer.
Then cauterize it thoroughly, making sure you eradicate all corrosion and leave behind no cause for concern.
Afterward, let it heal for three days and apply a mixture of oil on the cauterized areas until all scars are gone and there is no more corruption.
Then cure it with fresh, healing flesh-colored ointments.
If after three days the flesh is still not healthy and free from corruption, then repeat the cauterization process on the areas that remain damaged.
Corrosives are sometimes treated with acute medicine, as it is applied directly to the area of cauterization. However, fire cauterization often provides faster relief.
I have already mentioned the cure with acute medicine in this section, so take that when you need it.
It seems like the original text may be referring to Chapter 43 of some sort of medical guide or treatise. Is there another line from the text that you would like me to translate?
On the cauterization of wounds and other similar ailments.
Here is my best attempt at translating the provided text:
Here is the translation of the provided text:
And then place that flame onto the keyhole, and move your hand around with the cautery in a circle around the key until it reaches deep into the keyhole. Read that for three days before starting to move your arm. And plaster that with wild mallow chopped up with salt, and leave the plaster on it for one night because this will eradicate its roots.
Then treat that place with ointment made from fresh meat until it is healed.
And if they are not converted and frequently get this on the surface of their body, mainly in their hands and feet, then you should apply cauterisation with water to these. Take a cannula made from brass or iron or vulture bone, place it over the keyhole; pour into the cannula some molten lead and hold your hand tightly around it, pressing the edge of the cannula against the root of the keyhole, letting the molten lead flow down through the root of the keyhole. Have the patient wait a little while for the bite of the molten lead for an hour, then remove it because the key with its roots will be eradicated.
And in this way I made them lie with one on top of the other, coming into contact with all parts of their bodies.
Then treat the areas where the roots of the nails are removed, using something to prevent infection as flesh can easily grow there.

On cauterisation for tremors.
When you encounter any tremor due to a chill in the nerves or caused by fever or other similar causes, it is necessary that you cauterize [the patient] with four cauteries or five over their vertebrae, placing one cautery between each vertebra; and apply an olive-sized cautery on their feet, and another over their stomach.
And if the patient's tremors subside, it signifies that their illness is recovering.
This appears to be another chapter or section identifier. Please provide me with the text associated with this identifier so I may translate it for you.
On cauterization for sudden white marks on the body.
When there are white spots on the body and pustules filled with thick, corrupted matter appear, it is necessary at the beginning of their appearance to cauterize the head of the fistula using a fine cautery made from myrtle wood, the end of which has been heated over fire; or use long horsehair roots; or a lenticular (lens-shaped) cautery.
Some times it is necessary to use an adenoma cautery at the beginning of its expulsion in this way: it is not absorbed and the superfluity is dispersed by doing so, and it heals.
However, it is necessary that this be done after evacuation through bloodletting (flebotomy).
Chapter LVI: "On Fistulae.
On the cauterization of accidental blood flow due to arrow wound incision.
When there are several blisters around an arrow wound that has been pierced by a weapon or due to the incision of abscesses and the cauterization of the limb; in this case it is similar and difficult to remove.
Therefore, when this happens to someone, then you should cover the arrow wound with your hand and press on it using a finger to squeeze those blisters until they are dry (and no longer emit blood) while keeping your finger there to prevent the flow of blood.
And then place the small and large olive-shaped cauterization instruments in the fire for a long time, and blow on them before they are fully heated.
Then take one of those instruments, small or large depending on the location and severity of the arterial wound; place it over that vein quickly once you have sucked out the blood with your finger, and use the cautery to seal off the wound before the blood spills.
And if blood gushes out of the arterial wound when you remove your finger and apply the first cautery, then quickly grab another preheated cauterization instrument from the fire and repeat this process until the bleeding stops.
Be careful not to burn any nerves in the process; causing additional harm is the last thing you want for your patient.
Keep in mind that when blood is gushing from an artery, it's not feasible to stop the bleeding with just cauterization alone, especially if the artery is large. There are four main methods for managing such cases: use of a cautery like the one described earlier; extracting the wound if not already done so (although this carries the risk of burning the extremities and may cause more harm); using gallstones or strong ligatures to constrict blood flow; or applying medicinal substances known for their ability to stem bleeding. These medications should be applied in a powdered form with appropriate dressings.

Here is the translation of your first source sentence:
When you are ready, please provide me with a source text in order for me to begin translating it into English line by line as per your instructions.
Ja havem dit en le primier capitol tota malautia: In the first chapter we have discussed all illnesses in which cauterization with fire is appropriate and combined with medicine, as well as their occasions, causes, necessary instruments and the forms of cauteries; these chapters are ordered from head to foot.
I will proceed in this chapter in the same manner to provide relief for the seeker of such knowledge and address what they have asked for.
Before I begin, dear reader, know that what you will learn in this chapter is for the purpose of understanding and alleviating suffering, just as in the first chapter on cauterization.
And for this reason, it is crucial to exercise great caution, as the operations described in this chapter often involve visible bloodletting through various means such as venesection, incision over an abscess, exsection, drainage of a wound, arrow extraction, or stone removal - all procedures that directly impact the flow of life-giving blood. All these procedures are accompanied by fear, trembling, and in many cases, the very real possibility of death.
I warn you not to hesitate in your duty, for sometimes what appears as indecision is merely the manner of a sick man's behavior due to his illness. Here is my best attempt at translating the provided text:
And from those [servants], choose one who will give you their belongings and tell them that you expect health for the patient, even though his illness is harmful.
So you must not agree with the one who comes to you and acts in this manner; let your caution be greater than greed and avarice; do not make any assumptions about anything unless you have certain knowledge that confirms it; and for whom a laudable outcome is achieved, you should take care of him.
Use prognostication and diagnosis in the treatment of all your patients to convert their health back to them; for this will aid you in acquiring fame, reputation, praise, and glory.
Oh, my sons, may God inspire you with his understanding and not take away your direction or protection, for these things are in His hands.
And I have arranged this chapter by dividing it into chapters as was previously done in the chapter on cauterization; from the head to the feet, so that you may find what you are looking for and what is necessary.
Chapter 1.
Of the cure for water contained in a child's head.
Know that this condition, which often occurs in children during childbirth, arises when the nurse pulls on the child's head, causing it to loosen.
And some occur due to hidden causes that are unknown.
I have never witnessed this illness except in children; for all those I saw it brought death, and thus seems to me a hopeless case.
And I have seen a child whose head was filled with water; their head always remained so large that they could not cease to grow due to the size of their head, and as moisture increased fire killed them.
This moisture is added either between the brain and skull or below the skull on the neck.
When performing the operation on such a person, if the moisture is between the brain and skull and the abscess is small, then you should make an incision in the middle of the head with a vertical cut; let its length be two finger-widths long so that the moisture can flow out. This is the form of the spatula:
And therefore, if the humidity is more increased and the abscess is larger, then there are two incisions made in this manner:
And if the humidity is beneath the bone, the sign of it is that you see the corners of the head opened and gaping, with water being squeezed out when you press it with your hand at these openings, and this is not something hidden from you. Now make an incision at the top of their head with three incisions made in this manner:
Then extract all the humidity from this incision; after that bind the incisions with linen and wool pads; then anoint this area above with wine and oil within five days, afterward unbind the bandages and cure the wound with ointments and salves, and wrap the head again in an equal fashion; nourish the patient with dry food of little humidity until their limbs are healed and strengthened.
There is another way of making an incision, which you should consider based on the size of the abscess and the accumulation of water; sometimes it occurs more at the back of the head, or in front, to the right side or left side; therefore, pay attention to where exactly the incision must be made regarding the abscess and the collection of water, and do so as best you can.
Certainly, let's continue translating this medieval medical treatise:
Capitolo secondo.
When there is cataracts or wounds in the eyes or feet, and it is an old injury that does not respond to medicinal treatment, then the final cure in such cases is the incision of those two arteries.
And therefore, when you want to incision those arteries and the patient resists with his head, rub the area with a rough cloth so that the blood vessels appear, then tie the patient's neck tightly with a cloth; consider where to pulse the vein; the places for each are above the spots where ears would be if they were depressed, these places being concealed in some men.
Then place a finger over the artery with forceps, and then incise each one with the sharp edge of the knife coming from above towards the bone, this being done all around the head.
And if you wish, insert the edge of the knife beneath the artery and cut it at the points where it has been incised.
Let the length of the incision be about two fingers in size, for when any vein is incised, blood escapes with a pulsating egress, jumping forth by frequent leaps.

Then support the plague (abscess) with feathers and soft linen cloths; then treat it with ointments until it is healed.

On the extraction of arrows which are in the temples.
When it happens that an old wound or abscess arises due to humid and harmful qualities in the hollows of the temples, or is one similar to these, and it does not respond well to medical treatment methods, then we resort to these illnesses extracting arrows from the temples, or cauterizing them as we have shown.
The method of operation and extraction is as follows: the patient should shave the hair from their temples; and understand that the arrow (the cause of injury) is visible on the temple in most cases, unless it is hidden by swelling.
E si a tu es occultada: And if it is hidden from you, And then you take the spatula which is of this form: Then you remove the thread with ease until you reach the incision; and then immerse it in water and extract those from the highest parts as you pull them out of the thread and uncover them from the tunics which are placed under.
However, if the artery is delicate, then you wrap it with a piece of onion, and then cut off a part according to the amount by which its ends are elongated and contracted; and there will be no flow of blood, for if they are not incised the blood cannot pass through entirely.
Then you evacuate some of the patient's blood from one to three ounces.
And if the wound is large, make sure to stitch it in two places with strong double thread of hemp or long cords; do not cut off any putrefied flesh before the wound has consolidated and there will be no flow of blood.
Then you cut away the superfluity that is between two bindings, do this either now or at another time.
And if you wish, cauterize that area with a curved cautery, using an instrument like a small knife to make incisions at the extremities of it, and keep doing this same operation.
It is better to perform this operation if the patient does not have a fever or a hot complexion, because cauterization is one of those treatments that helps eliminate humors, and thus it is more beneficial.
Then proceed to extract the arrows that are stuck in the old wound, and place some decently made powder over it; then treat it with dry medicines that help the flesh grow back and with poultices until it is healed.
And if while you are working on it another time blood begins to flow from the arrow wound, then you should try to stop that bleeding by using a ligature or cauterization; fill the wound and press your hand firmly over it so that the bleeding stops. And if none of those options are available to you at the moment, then place your finger over the wound so that the blood clots; rinse the area with very cold water until the sharpness subsides, and keep it compressed as needed.
Here is my best attempt at translating the provided text into English:
And this is the shape of the cautery:
The sharpness of its two points is identical. However, if its sharpness is less than two points, it is better, for if it has the same sharpness as two points near each wound and does not cut flesh so fast.
Therefore, when there is some thickness to them, the heat of the fire should be applied to them and the flesh should be cut away lightly.
And this method is better than all other methods, and lighter by far.
The space between the two points should be equal to the thickness of a finger.
It seems this is the end of the text; do you have any further instructions for me? I can help with translation, summarization, or other tasks related to the provided text.
On the treatment of acute and acidic pain in the veins."
When the acidic tears flow and affect those veins that are on the top of their head, do not seek any cause for this in medical treatment; sometimes the patient's face becomes red and itchy on his forehead as if it were an ant crawl, and their cheeks become so wet from these tears that you can see their skin. The ancients had a simple remedy for this ailment which I will now describe but not name.
And you should command the patient to scrape their skin on their forehead and then make three incisions of equal length in their forehead that are as long as their forehead is wide. If the length of each incision is about two fingers in width: let one be equidistant from the nose to the middle of their forehead; the second near the tear duct and the third on the opposite side.
Take care to avoid the arches on either side (i.e., the eyebrows) and stretch your hand from the continuation of both jaws. If the space between each incision is about three fingers in width.
And if you have a piece of prepared sponge or cloth made from many pieces that dries up the blood.
Then insert the double-edged spatula, which has this shape for the incision: It starts from the temples to the second incision. Excise the entire line that is between two incisions with the chisel which is on the bone, and then make this from the middle incision to the second incision. Then take this spatula out and insert into the first incision another tool which is called a chisel, sharp on one side and not sharp on the other.
Place the sharp side of that tool below the attached flesh above the line, and its blunt side against the bone, and use it until you reach the middle gap, and sever with it all vessels descending from the head to the hole.
Let the incision continue to that which appears of the line, then do this in the middle gap between the other gap.
And since blood flows in an equal amount, press the places of the blood clots.
Then place on each old wound crack some cotton wool soaked in vinegar and oil or strong wine, and see that it does not become infected.
On the third day, untie the bandages and administer a great infusion of warm water or broth, then treat it with basilicon ointment made with rose oil until the wounds are healed.
I'm sorry, I don't understand your request. Could you please rephrase or provide more context for what you'd like me to do?
Regarding the treatment of cataracts and other eye diseases that originate from disorders within the head.
When someone has a severe and continuous cataract, and their eyesight is greatly diminished, with the eyelids ulcerated and hair falling out around them, along with sharp pain within the head and subsequent weakness, you should know from these symptoms that cataracts are caused by disorders originating in the brain.
The best treatment for them is this: instruct the patient to shave their forehead, then make an incision at the mid-point of their forehead, a little longer than the width (begin the incision from the left temple to the right; and let it be made through bone; extend your hand over the cartilage of both temples which are damaged by chewing), until the bone is exposed.
Dry all the blood with a dry sponge or cloth, then fill the space between the two lips of the wound with an old piece of skin or some of their own clothes. Then squeeze some powder soaked in vinegar and oil over it to prevent a closed abscess.
And when you see that the abscess has diminished, cover the bone where it begins with something to make flesh grow, and treat it with a drying regimen such as if you take two parts wheat flour and four parts colophony, mix them together, and apply this plaster on these sores until there is new skin.

On the treatment of what falls into ears.
Any cause that falls into ears is one of four types: either it's something solid like stone or similar such as iron and glass, or it's from plants like peas and beans, or it's fluidic like water and vinegar and things like them, or some animal.
Here is the translation of your provided text: Here is the translation of the provided text:
If it is not rejected, then proceed with the extraction using the instrument called the subtle epicicarian forceps, which has this shape:
If it is perforated with the forceps, that's fine; otherwise, proceed with the extraction using a thin needle of minimal diameter.
And if it is not perforated by that, then make a cannula from wire and insert the tip of the cannula into the hole in the ear, sealing around the cannula with wax and softened oil to ensure nothing else is opened but the cannula itself. Then extract it with your hand using strong traction, as you have observed from what we have described above.
But if it is not perforated in this manner, take a bright thread or an old string with which birds are trapped, place it at the end of the rod, and then wrap around it a piece of cloth placed there appropriately. Then insert that into the hole of the ear with ease, and then extract any moisture from the ear.
Therefore, if all the causes that we have listed are not forgotten, then you treat what appears before you as an abscess or spasm.
The way to treat it is that at the beginning you draw blood from the patient by opening their cephalic vein and extracting blood according to their health, then make them stop between your hands and bend their ear towards those parts, finishing with a small incision in the back of the ear above where you have pressed on their head. And if the incision is in the shape of a crescent moon before reaching the stone (i.e., the kidney), and the stone turns around, remove it if you can with appropriate instruments; then sew up the incision quickly and treat it until it is healed.
And if the cause found in the ear is one of those that grows and inflates (i.e., a tumor), then administer appropriate treatment and its extraction; but if it does not obey your treatment, then take some very thin platinum shaped like this:" [picture or drawing of an instrument follows] And apply it to that tumor which has fallen into the ear for its excision.

Therefore, do not cease until all the water has been drained away.
Therefore, do not cease until all the water has been drained away. Once the water has been drained, take a piece of paper or cotton and put one end of it into the ear, extending the other end towards the fire until most of it is burned.
Then place another piece of cotton and repeat this process until all the water is drained away, just like it is described above regarding the use of the suction stone.
When an animal enters the ear and it is a small object, you can use a similar method as described above for extracting foreign bodies; however, if it is a larger object that creates an apparent protrusion in the earlobe, then manage its extraction using pinching movements with your fingers. The cause of this issue is less severe than other potential causes of discomfort within the ear.
When extracting an earworm from the ear using the methods described earlier in this treatise and the section on distillation, if your treatment is not successful, it is advisable to expose the ear to sunlight.

And for your infusion, with which you pour medicinal oils into the ear using this instrument, which has this shape: Make it from silver or brass, narrow in shape with a small perforation, and flat on top.
And then it should be filled with whatever is necessary, which is located in the cavity of the cannula. If you wish, take the rod and wrap it appropriately with wax at its end, then pour oil into the cavity of the applicator, or juice from some herb, or whatever medicinal substance you desire to use in the cannula—which is placed inside the ear—and then insert the rod, with wax at its tip, and squeeze it gently with your hand until the oil is expelled into the patient's auditory canal.
Whatever you insert in the ear should be slightly singed with fire first. Be careful not to let whatever you're dripping into the ear become too cold, as such medicines do not tolerate that.

And in that place where you have inserted the catheter (vezement), it is necessary for you to place the patient's ear towards the sun and look into it. And if you see any obstruction visible, open it with a fine-pointed spatula that has this shape:"
Si’ la extremitat de lu en la qual sia petita la latitut, del qual la una partita sia aguda e l’autra no; e le spatum sia de dos latz leon per so que no fassa lizio al aurelha.
And so, if the obstruction is caused by flesh growth in the ear or his nose, then you take some very thin scissors and make an incision quickly until all the flesh is removed.
If the obstruction is in the ear canal, then take some thin wire and heat it over fire for a moment, and then insert that into the ear.
And if you have detected obstruction with what the patient vomits easily due to hearing heaviness, exert pressure on their obstructed area with ease; and be careful not to damage the nerves of the ear.
Then place a cloth on the ear of the second size according to the amount of discharge that you have wrapped in Egyptian ointment; and do this for some days until you are sure of the consolidation of the discharge; or take something else and immerse it in vinegar water, powder over it fine wheat flour, and use it; and if you see that the ear has already become abscessed, then know that you should remove the previous one and replace it with another piece which you will wrap in a dressing made from rose oil until the abscess subsides; and then treat that area until it is healed.

And the best cauterization is when the incisions and wounds are carefully closed again, leaving no trace of their origin; when they are cauterized with fire, those roots are burned away and will not return.
Chapter 9.
Treatment for swelling that appears on the eyelids of the eyes.
Small wounds found on the eyelids of the eyes are similar in appearance to swelling due to their hardness and strength; hence they are called 'swelling'.
And it is an accumulation of thick moisture on the upper eyelid.
Therefore, the operation for this is that you must first consider whether the swelling originates within it and stems from under the eyelid or if it is more widespread and has a serious cause.
Make an incision over it along its width and then easily scoop out all of the pus inside; after that, lift up the swelling with a thread and cut it off.
And if the wound is large, then adjust it with stitches; make sure it heals properly.
And if it is small, you won't suffer any harm because their blood will restore and flesh it.
If the large blood vessel is receding inside the eyelid towards its internal surface, then evert the eyelid and suspend the blood vessel with a thread or string that you have ready from the beginning, and press it on all sides; if the eyelid itself has been stretched due to incision, this will not cause any harm.
Then clean the wound with salt water and treat the area so that it heals properly.
It seems you've provided me with another section of text from the treatise. Please let me know if there's anything specific within this new section you'd like me to translate, and I'll be happy to assist!
Regarding the treatment of an injury above the eyelid.
A sty is an inflammation that forms in the eyelids, mostly affecting children, and it causes their eyes to become sore and leads them to wipe their eyes often; due to this, they cannot bear the brightness of sunlight because tears come to their eyes.

Here is my translation of the provided text:
Therefore, take out that cloth which you have wrapped around their thighs and spread it over the affected areas, moving your hands gently from right to left until it is evenly distributed.
And be careful not to tighten the wound too much, lest you push the bone into the flesh and cause further injury.
However, if no pulse is felt at the beginning of the wound, but rather a slight movement, adjust the cloth within the wound to facilitate blood flow; then extract it as previously mentioned; and submerge the cloth in water and vinegar, placing it over the area and pressing firmly.
Some suggest placing salt over the wound to draw out any excess moisture.
Then treat it until it is healed.
However, if an abscess forms in the area, treat it with soft poultices until it is healed.

On methods for handling bones.
When the eyelashes of an eye are born by tightening, leaving them bare and aged, this causes harm to the eye with symptoms like frequent tearing, softening of the eyelids and a film over the eye leading to destruction of the eye which is called 'tactinir del huel'. There are four ways to cure it: either by cauterization with fire; or by applying acute medicine as mentioned before in the chapter on cautery; or by excision and suturing; or by using canes, as I will describe.
You should place the patient's head in your lap; then turn the eyelid of the eye with your left hand, and if it is turned well, good; otherwise, insert a needle into that part where there is a defect below the eyelid, and let the needle penetrate with the thread upwards, and this should be - close to the margin of the eyelid where there are no lashes - near the lashes, then draw the thread to the parts above with the eyelid, and turn it in this manner.
Then make an incision inside the eyelid below the tight lashes with a small spatulate knife from the greater tear duct to the lesser; and then remove the thread and place beneath the eyelid some small powder of cotton or linen cloth, and finally cover the eyelid with a bandage in the shape of a myrtle leaf.
Make sure that the incision is made according to the amount of elevation of the eyelid, as this varies among individuals due to the extent to which the eyelid needs to be loosened.
Then take the spatula and place it on the two lines you have marked, starting from the larger tear duct towards the smaller one. And if your incision, close to the natural hairline, is as thick as a king's ring.
Then put the ounce in one of the two corners of the chain, thoroughly scrape it, sew the two lips together with fine thread or wool, wipe away any blood, and attach what is superfluous from the threads to the eyebrows with some adhesive, if you wish to do so, otherwise, leave it uncared for.
Let the thread stitches remain in place for three or four days before removing them and tending to it.
If you prefer, leave the wound without stitches and treat it with drying and contracting agents, as the eyelid is elevated due to its separation from the globe of the eye; however, stitching is better. This is what the ancient physicians said.
However, ensure there is a concern for the patient's well-being during treatment and maintain good conduct; do not let fear get in the way.
There is another method for examination, and it involves observing the shape of the eyelid, which resembles the leaf of a myrtle. Then, lift the eyelid with three separate yet connected hooks like this:
If you don't have the hooks available and this isn't feasible, take a needle with thread, place it in the middle of the eyelid shape, and insert one end of the thread near the larger lacrimal gland, and the other end close to the smaller lacrimal gland. Ensure both threads are equal in length and then use them to lift your hand gently upwards, raising the entire chain as described above.
Then close the wound's edges with sutures and treat it until it heals completely.
However, if an abscess forms due to the incision or opening, you must drain it with a lancet and apply healing substances to it.
Sometimes, the eyelid might twist due to its hairs growing abnormally, in which case you should use the incision method described earlier. However, suturing is often more practical for all cases.
Ataxinir am cannas es segon aquesta forma: Here is my best attempt at translating the provided text: And you have already made incisions at the ends of each part, where you find the veins.
Then add each one with subtlety beneath the superfluities of the eyelid's skin, constrict the ends of each part with a strong ligature, and leave it for some days; as the sentence by the constriction will die, be denied, and rot within so that by itself it may fall out.
However if it is delayed, then break it with tweezers, and afterwards cure the wound until it is healed.
Once it is solidified, elevate the eyelid, and the hairs will not stick out.
And this is the way of two ends which you will do according to this form: And have the quantity of its length and width neither more nor less.
I am sorry, I did not understand your prompt. Would you like me to attempt translating another line from the text?
On raising prickly hairs on the eyelid with a needle when the hair is hard.
When the hair is unnatural, hard, rough, and pungent in smell, then you should perform an operation on them: take a fine needle and place it in that soft thread of silk and lion's fur, and adjust their ends and knots very carefully. And let the length of the threads be in quantity equal to one palm's worth.
Then you compose another fine thread beneath them in brief, and tie the ends of that if you wish.
And place the patient's head in your lap, let it be close to the sun so that your work may be illuminated, for this is a delicate and minute operation.
Then insert the needle into the root of the adjusted hair with precision and skill, make it penetrate the eyelid swiftly, and extract that from the natural hair.
Then pull the hair forth from above and insert it into an unguent; let there be one or two or three hairs, but no more.
And then withdraw your hand from it so that the hair is anointed with the unguent on the eyelid with the natural hair.
Mays si es atirat alixalati e non es gitat le pel, atiraras alixati a las partidas dejos am le fiel le qual tu has compost am aquella, entro qu’en sia gitat alixalati del trau sobira.
Certainly! Here is my best attempt at translating the provided text:
If the hair is shorter, then you adjust a longer hair from the natural ones and lift it up with that one, or let it hang down over some space, and then you raise it.
The Roman numeral XIII represents the number 13. In this context, "Capitol" likely refers to Chapter 13 of a book or treatise. Is there any specific text or chapter you would like me to translate or provide further information about?
On the treatment of eczema which appears on the upper eyelid.
Here is the translated text:
May the manner of the operation on him be that you split that consolidation and separate his lips, and place in him something that is between those a piece of linen cloth, and bind those until they are healed.
And it is not appropriate that you use treatments for him that cause drying and constriction, because if you do this, it will lead to an aggravation of the condition which was more severe than before.
Apply to that area treatments that soften, such as fenugreek, and mix it with water in which you have soaked linseed and its seeds, or use diaxion ointment, which has been liquefied with one of the oils, and immerse the cloth in this, and treat him with it.
And the key to your treatment is that you perforate with any instrument that is not consolidated according to its original form.
And this operation which we have described is nothing other than a correction of the malformation that does not return the form of the place to what it was before.
It seems that you are referring to chapter 14, but I cannot find any further text related to this in the provided information. Would you like me to translate more of the treatise?
Of the treatment of inflammation that occurs in the eyelid below.
This inflammation that occurs in the lower eyelid, which is truly named 'alxacrati', can be of two types: natural or accidental.
Accidental inflammation is caused by a blow, or a cut, or due to the application of a cautery, or by other similar means.
The way to operate is as follows: take a needle with double thread and pass it through the meat so that the thread reaches both ends.
Then separate the meat from both ends with the needle and suture it with a wide spatulate tool. And so if the shape of the eyelid is restored as it should be, that's good; but if not, take a probe and place it in the split shape, using it to reshape the eyelid, making the two splits on the side of the lower eyelid.
And if the ends of the two splits are at two corners of the incision you made so that they meet and form an angle when brought together to create a shape.
E aquesta figura es letra grega: la landa.
And then remove the flesh in an amount equal to the width of his thumb below him; this is what they call the eyelid.
Then adjust the separated parts, sew them together with a thread of wool, and afterward apply the softening medicines and poultices we have mentioned until they are healed.
And if it happens that it breaks open by itself due to a fissure or suture or the cautery, then you must make an incision with a flat blade on the skin of the eyelid as we have previously explained. Then separate the poultice between the two lips, as we have mentioned before.
In the summary of the procedure for treating an ulcer when it is dry or low (subside), let it run its course during the operation according to how it has been prepared in terms of the form of the ulcer, and this may take various forms.
And the skilled practitioner always prepares his instruments in every way possible so that they can restore the figure to its natural shape or something close to it and this illness as well according to what is appropriate for the operation and tools at their disposal.
Certainly, I will attempt to translate this medieval medical treatise step by step into English:
De la adherencia de la palpebra am la conjunctiva o am la cornea.
When this consolidation occurs in many men so that the eyelid is solidified above the white of the eye and it is restricted from easy movement and its natural functions, therefore you must insert the tip of a ray under the eyelid and raise it upon that or extend it with your finger.
Then you carefully cut through the adhesion with a thin spatula which is not sharpened to avoid cutting during the operation, and remove the spatula so that it doesn't scratch the eye with its sharpness.
And the incision you make should easily peel away that adhesion so that the eyelid returns to its natural shape and all adhesion is healed.  *This translation assumes the use of a thin spatula in the previous line.*
Then you put the eye in salt water with which to wash it, or distill into it some hyssop dissolved in water.
Then separate the eyelid from the eye with egg white and place on the eye wool infused in hen's albumen; then, by the third day use consolidating remedies until it is healed. *Note: this translation assumes that the previous line refers to putting something (possibly hyssop) into the eye.*
Capitol .xvi.:  Chapter XVI.
De inscizio de ungla e de eminencia de carn dels lacrimals.
Here is my best translation of the provided text:
And both species start from the upper eyelid, going gradually over the eye and obstructing both light and vision.
The way to proceed with the incision is for the patient to place their head on your lap, then open their eyes, raise the eyelid with your hand, and take a curved needle with a small amount of thread and extend it to the outer corners. Then take a needle and attach to it a horsehair or ox hair or cow hair, something similar, strong silk, or double the end of the needle slightly and insert it into the middle of the eyelid, pierce it with the needle, and tie the eyelid with the hair; extend it to the outer corners, and remove the skin on the side of the eyelid that covers the pupil. And in this way you prevent it from coming out with the hair on its back side.
Then you cut the remnant at the root of the tear duct with a thin spatula or small scissors, and remove the flesh from it naturally so that after the incision there is not a continuous flow of tears.
And sometimes the nail has the sun extended to it or with gall, as we have said, then be extracted with a lion's spatula which is of this form:
Make sure that with the spatula, you do not touch the corneal tunic and that it does not cause a rupture, ensuring that the pupil is perforated.
Then place a little crushed salt or three drops of sinew oil in the wound, leave it for another day, and then treat it with something that covers what needs to be healed.
And if the nail is not nervous and you cannot insert the needle or it is not fixed in place, then know that this type of nail can be healed with medicine, and it will heal as I have explained in the section on nails.
And if you wish to incise it, then open the patient's wound and take a fine lion spatula with a sharpened edge according to this form: with delicacy. If you find that it is rarefied and compressed with rash, then drip into the wound from your hand some drops of sinew oil or some raw yolk or crushed salt, and leave the wound for another day.
Here is my best attempt at translating the provided text:
And then repeat your operation on that area until it is healed.
If the prominence of the tear duct flesh is causing great harm and we notice it in the eye, it should be suspended with a thread; make an incision from one side to the other, but do not finish the incision completely to avoid cutting the flow of tears.
Then distill some raw milk into the tear duct, and make sure to treat it until it is healed.
The number XVII in Roman numerals corresponds to 17, so this may be referring to chapter 17 of the text you provided. Is there another line from that chapter that you would like me to translate?
On the incision of stye and what is born from flesh that tightens in the eye.
Some people have patches of raw flesh in their eyes, which are formed over the pupil or close to it and extend onto the eyelids; they are strong like balusters.
Now perform the operation on the patient while they rest their head on your lap; then open their eyes and gather all that raw flesh with suitable threads, using forceps or a basket; then cut the flesh at its beginning so everything is finished with scissors, but be careful not to touch the eye during your operation.
E sia la tua inscizio am la qual inscides aquellas o am espatum le qual nos havem recomtat en la inscizio de la ungla, o am petitas forfexs am las quals es colligit ascebel segon que vindra la forma de lu aprop aquest capitol.
When the incision is complete and all that flesh has been removed, then fill the wound with powdered salt, or distill into it powder made of metal resembling corrosive medicines, and place over the wound as much egg white as can safely be absorbed to prevent a caustic abscess.
And if there remains some cause for concern due to the presence of red veins and you fear a caustic abscess, then clean out the wound and treat that abscess with whatever has proven effective against it, then repeat the operation on it until it is healed, and likewise do so with the adjusted flesh that occurs in this type of wound.
However, you should know that all healing of the femoral wound can occur through natural or artificial means, by working with iron, and do not put your hand into any of these operations unless you see that limb is capable of enduring such an operation.
Chapter 18.
On the collection of pus in the wound.
Pus is made up of veins and tissues that are hardened over the wound and prevent its healing, thereby impeding its operation, and delay the wound's healing by many days.
Therefore, it is necessary at the beginning to consider whether the wound in which he is aware of is strong and there are no other diseases that he knows of; then you will conclude that this is true.
And tell the patient to place their head on your lap, and then suspend those veins with one ounce or two depending on your judgment. And let this ounce be made of fine thread in this way:
there will now be two ounces attached to the body as follows:
Then those veins will be tied with fine threads, carefully and tightly, and you should remove the blood now and then until you see that the veins are reduced by the wound and have been cleaned.
Make sure you do not touch the wound with the ends of the spatula, and if your operation is done at noon facing the sun, be very steady in your operation so as not to cut anything but those veins.
And when you have finished, then pour into the wound either vinegar or bile so that with its sharpness it may corrode whatever is left of the injury.
But if this is not possible for you to collect everything at that moment, then apply a plaster made of whatever reduces their pain, and let them rest for a few days until the pain subsides and they are secure from the risk of abscess.
And then repeat this process on them in the same manner until they are healed.
The text you provided seems to be written in an archaic language, potentially a medieval dialect or a mixture of several languages. Without further context or information about the specific words used, I cannot provide an accurate translation.
Capitol .xix.
De reduccio de arizati al nas."
When you treat a boil with cautery or sharp comburent medicine as previously described and it does not heal, do not be discouraged but rather make incisions in the abscess until it matures; extract all the moisture that is within it until the bone becomes visible.
And so when the bone is exposed and you see corruption or blackening, then use this tool which has the following shape: [Describe the instrument's form].
It is called the 'aspid' cap, and it should be made of iron; its round head should be designed like a sieve with perforations either made by file or a fine awl (as shown in this illustration).
Place the aspid over the corrupted bone area and rotate it between your fingers; apply pressure gradually until you feel that the corruption has been scraped away.
Do this several times, then restore the area with drying and styptic agents.
Once the area has healed over and good flesh has grown back; once it has been separated from the healthy part of the body and remained without relapse for 40 days with no abscesses or accidents occurring in that time you will know it is cured.
E sino, lahoras no es en lu engen sino reduzir la fissura a la forma del nas, e segon aquesta manieyra: e es que tu descuebras de segon os am ferr o am medicina acuta, e cum sira descubert le os, lahoras tu pren tribo segon aquesta forma:

Therefore, now restore the wound with astringent drying medicines as you have been taught.
So when the flesh and wound have hardened, and the matter that was discharged from its outer parts returns to the inside, this makes it lighter for the patient.
It seems you might be providing me with a reference or chapter number, which is ".xx.", but I'm not sure what text this refers to or if there is any specific information you need regarding it. Please provide additional context or details so I can assist you further!
The text provided seems to be part of a medical treatise, and the title suggests it discusses the reduction of an "eminence" on the head or skull. However, without further context, I cannot provide an accurate translation or interpretation. Is there another portion of the text you would like assistance with? Or perhaps some additional details about this section?
When the head protrudes in its entirety and there is no damage or harm occurring to the brain, it is necessary to loosen the patient, and then to continue, and finally to place bellows on the neck without scarification and sucking for proper suction; and then apply a liniment to the head made of acorn and aloe extracts as well as incense resin, and lastly secure the poultice onto the head with much powder.
The manner of using the powder is to take linen lion's cloth pieces and make many of them, folding each piece four times over.
Then place one over the other according to the quantity that is required. Then secure them firmly with a durable, strong cloth; repeat the suction and scarification with the cups; finally, remove the cups and keep the wound tightly bound day and night.
However, if during this time the ligament becomes softened, then be sure not to bind it too tightly.
Then remove the binding during the day and at night, as we have instructed.
If you find that the wound has already reduced in size, then good; if not, repeat the process with the poultice and powder, the binding, and the cups until it is healed.
It seems that you have provided me with another section or chapter heading in your medieval medical treatise. Please provide the text following this heading, and I will continue to translate it for you line by line.
On the incision of the prominence of the tunic of the eye."
Here is the translation of the first source sentence:
And then extract the needle and place it on a piece of wool soaked in hen's albumen and yolk, letting the thread run through the grape.
Then treat the wound with something that comforts it until the plague is healed.
On some occasions, gather from all parts with a circle of cloth that fits the large prominence of the wound, and then it is pierced with a thin spatula that reaches the depth of the wound, releasing white moisture, and lowers the wound in immediately.
And then strengthen it so that it is healed.
It appears that the text you provided includes the content of Chapter 22 ("Capitol .xxii."). Would you like me to continue translating this chapter?
The provided text also includes the title of the treatise's Chapter 22: "De curacio de alconati," which translates to "On the Treatment of Falconers." If you'd like me to continue translating this chapter, please provide additional context or details from the text you wish to translate.
This disease, which is called falconers' illness, is nothing but the healthy one that fits the wound like descending water and it is not that.
Here is my translation of the text you provided:
And if it does not go down [lower], know that it is water.
However, if the descent to health is not prepared with what we have said, then make the patient sit between your legs and take a thin spatula; place it over the panniculus [layer of fat], just below the continuation of the conjunctiva with the cornea at the crown (inside the opening), while the wound is forgotten about.
Once the wound is forgotten [covered], then you will pour into it a little of the liquid in which you have mixed either honey or water, boiled with fenugreek and honey.
And then it is treated with the other causes until it is healed.
It seems you may have provided me with an additional reference to this medical treatise, which I will assume to be chapter or section 22 of the text. Is there another passage for me to translate?
On treating water descending from the brain."
Ja havem dit las specias de la aygua en la divisio e cual conveneys a perforar am sermo declarant, lahoras aquel segon la sanetat.
When you make the patient lie down between your legs on a cushion and tie his waist tightly,
Then place your left hand close to the eyelid of his eye where there is water (discharge), or use your right hand if it's the right eye.
And then use your right hand to take the cotton (or cloth), if it's for the left eye; or use your left hand if it's for the right eye.
Then place the end of the cotton near the cornea with the thickness of a thread in the white part of the eye close to the lower eyelid, and gently dab it with your hand.
And then move the cotton into the white part of the eye, feeling that it has reached the desired depth.
Ensure that the length of the cotton inserted is equal to the distance from the pupil to the end of the black part, which is the cornea of the eye; you will see through this procedure a clearer view of the pupil.
Then place the cotton into the area where there is discharge and gently press it down once or twice to encourage the discharge to flow; as this happens, you will see the patient's gaze shift slightly, and you should also observe a reduction in the amount of discharge within the eye.
E aprop repausa se un pauc; donc si la aygua es descenduda, lahoras tu depausa aquella autre veguada abantz que almagda ne sia getada.
Here is the translation of the provided text:
Mays nos e aquels que so de nostre temps pause sobre aquel comi trissat am album de huou.
Here is the translation of the provided text so far, with the first source sentence included:
E donc perfora am aquel aquella conjunctura, e no ultimes la tua ma en le trauc, e no es si no que fassas via ad almagda loc subtil.
And then introduce the ointment (almagda) as we have mentioned before.
You should complete the treatment by preparing a comfortable resting place for the patient to sleep on their back in a dark room, and ensure they are restricted from any movements.
Place them in an environment that suits their nature for recovery, ensuring their head is not positioned towards the right or left side.
The bandage should be adjusted according to their body's positioning within three days.
Then untie them from the dark room and expose their eyes to some light sources, allowing them to see various objects, before readjusting the bandage on day seven.
It is not advisable to do this during the hour of treatment or immediately after applying the infusion. Ensure you avoid this, as water may pass through them more easily due to the great and powerful nature of the treatment.
However, if there is an occurrence of abscesses, it is necessary to untie them before the seventh day and treat those areas with something that can resolve abscesses.
When you release his sight and place an eye cover on him, speaking to guide the direction of his gaze for a few days, he is placed in the darkest part of the room.
Then remove him from that dark room, taking him outside into the daylight to talk about his situation.
And remember that a blind disciple is not exempt from learning alchemy, so you must be bold and confident when performing this operation.
We have encountered some of those who practice the art of fire-starting, and one said they used a wooden tube to focus the sun's rays, thus igniting the kindling.
However, I have never seen anyone in our land achieve such perfection, nor is it mentioned in any of the ancient texts; perhaps this method is a recent discovery.
These are the ways of fire-starting for those who are unaware of these methods:
They are made of glass or iron, and their ends are sharpened to a point with this subtle triangle-like shape.
Here is my best attempt at translating each line of your provided text into English while maintaining the same format as you requested:
De la curacio de carn nada en le nas.
Here is the translation of the provided text: And if there is cancerous flesh, decaying, of a dark color; and also flesh with lion's disease but not of a dark color.
So for the one who has flesh with lion's disease but not fraudulent or cancerous, you should make the patient lie down between your two hands and place them in the sunlight, open their nostrils, and prick their boil with a needle in those affected areas. Then extract that which is outside to the affected area and with a sharp, thin knife, make an incision in one part of it until you know that all the flesh has been exposed; if there remains any cause for which excision is possible, then use one of your fine instruments gently while leaving no cause behind. But if you see it filled with blood or the abscess becomes gangrenous, then apply what is necessary; if it is one of the malignant abscesses, then dress and cauterize it while making sure that no blood comes out and all cavities are exposed.
And then once the incision is made in the nose, apply vinegar and water or wine. But if the nose is opened and moisture proceeds from it to the palate, then you know that healing has already begun.
But if the moisture does not penetrate as it should, then you know that inside him is flesh without bones at the top of his nose to which no incision has been made.
In this case, it is necessary to insert some of the patient's gallbladder into their nose, and use as many nuts as needed, placing one between each nut with a distance equal to or less than that of your finger, and make sure you do so gently, causing no harm to the patient, inserting only an end of the gallbladder through the nostril, or any other possible way.
And once you have done that, let the patient inhale their own scent until it reaches the channels of their nose and is exhaled through their throat, for young children at school often do similar actions, and this is a light cause for anyone who wishes to perform such an action.
Then take both ends of the gallbladder and leave one end protruding from the nose while keeping the other inside it; administer meat locks to the nuts that are on the gallbladder, and do this until you know the meat is already over the nuts of the gallbladder.
Then remove the gallbladder and place in its stead a suet-blood abstraction in the nose as a plaster, and do this for three days or more until the ointment has eroded all that is rotten of the flesh.
And then at the end of the treatment, place a leaden tube in their nose for several days until they are healed.
May you always find success with this method of cure.
This is the shape of the purging tool, which distills oils and medicines into the nose:" (followed by an illustration or description).
Make it out of silver or brass, resembling a small open oil-lamp with its bowl and spout.
And if you wish, make a closed tube like a reed, and the nozzle of the purging tool should be flat and open; have its handle on the back so that you can hold it when heating oil or water with the juices and extractions.
Here is my translation of your provided text:
From the nostrils are born worms.
A small worm is born in the nostrils and grows significantly on some days when it receives attention.
And so, you must dig it out from the beginning of its appearance and completely eradicate it. Then place over the area a cautery or apply medicine that will burn it, which should be in its place.
If its removal is delayed and it has grown larger, then consider if it has become hardened, dark in colour, and with little sensation; in such a case, do not touch it with iron, for it will be like gangrene; and often those who have dug out this gangrene end up with great harm upon themselves.
And if the gangrene is of recent origin and not dark in colour, and you think that its removal is possible, then remove the patient and dig out the gangrene without fear, treating the area with a poultice and constraining it until healed.
This indicates that this is Chapter 26 of your text.
When sewing up the nose or lips and ear, when continuity has been dissolved by a wound or its equivalent.
Know that when there is a solution of continuity in one of these cartilages, it makes little difference in this operation except for some men.
Therefore, boy, when you encounter any of these causes in a patient, consider whether it is a fresh wound with its own blood, and then adjust the two lips or edges of the wound with stitches, ensuring that what lies within is properly cured.
And if the lips or edges of the wound are already separated and each is healthy and dry, boy, you must excise every part of its bed until no blood remains. Then adjust the two lips or edges with stitches and tighten them securely, and over these, sprinkle dragon's blood and triturated cinnabar powder, place on top a piece of diaphoretic cataplasm or another consolidating plaster, and leave it bound for two or three days; then remove the binding, change the plaster after ensuring that the filaments are cut off, and cure with an ointment until it is healed.

Removing small nodules from the gum, which are known as 'albulus' by ancient practitioners, you must suspend it with a hook or hold it with scissors and cut at its root; allow the blood to flow freely.
Then place fresh sage or other astringent/healing powders over the area.
And if that flesh returns, cut it away again and cauterize the area; thus, the cauterization will prevent recurrence.
Chapter 29: On Stitches for Wounds of the Head or Other Parts.
On extracting teeth with iron (instruments).
When on the surface of the separated teeth and those in front, as well as between the gums, there are rough scabs, patches, some darkened, and others made yellow or green, due to this corruption reaching the gum, and thus weakening the teeth.
And so you must make the patient lie between your arms and place their head on your lap; then clean the teeth where these scabs appear and rub them with pumice stone until nothing of what caused it remains, be it from the blackness, yellowness or others as they are cleaned.
If you have finished with what is at the beginning of the root (of the tooth), good; if not, repeat this treatment on them another day, and so every other until it comes to pass that you have achieved your goal.
Know that teeth have required many types of tools, of various shapes and figures according to the preparation for your operation. And so, as the tool that scrapes against the separated tooth is different from the one used to clean between teeth according to their shapes; and you must prepare these tools in such a way that they will have the forms mentioned below.
Based on the provided text, it seems like you have shared an excerpt from a medieval medical manuscript that discusses treatments for various ailments. Here is my best attempt at translating each line into English:
D’eradicacio de dentz.
When you treat your patient's tooth pain with great care and take time for its complete removal, there is no reason to fear the loss of their teeth when it has been properly extracted, as this is a noble substance that requires careful extraction.
But when your patient is forced to have that tooth removed, you must carefully examine and identify which tooth is causing the pain, as many times the pain deceives them and they mistake a healthy tooth for the diseased one; if you extract the wrong one and the pain persists, it means the sick and painful tooth still remains, as we have seen through operations on the jaw.
So, once you are certain which tooth is causing the pain and have properly identified it, you must make an incision around its circumference using a spatula with some healing properties, ensuring that all parts of the gum are detached from the tooth; then, use your fingers or fine scissors to gently extract it bit by bit until it comes out.
Then apply large forceps for a firm grip or use a strong lever if necessary; hold the patient's head firmly between your knees so it does not move and cause injury; carefully remove the tooth following its natural curve to avoid breaking it and causing excessive pain.
And so do not forget this step: take one of those instruments and place it beneath them on all sides with ease, exerting effort in the removal as was done initially.
But if the tooth is shaken or worn down, you should wrap it with a piece of cloth and secure its end with a thin wire so that it doesn't come loose when you grip it tightly.
Make sure you meticulously scarify around the entire gum area and be mindful of your strength so as not to break it or leave a piece inside; return to the patient, for their pain may worsen.
Take care not to do what some ignorant barbers do in their haste and boldness during tooth extractions, without administering what we have recommended; for many times they cause great illnesses upon men which are more difficult to treat, and the roots of said teeth being left behind, whether entirely or partially, and sometimes extracting a tooth with part of the jawbone as well - something we have often witnessed.
And once it is extracted, rinse the mouth with either sour wine or vinegar mixed with salt.
Here is the translation of your provided text:
The text you provided is an interesting medieval medical document with some Latin and Romance language influences. Here is my attempt at translating the first sentence:
And thus it happens that sometimes a large club enters [the body] when the intestines are not bent; they become short extremities.
And if they are made of India iron, which is known for its straight extremities, and at the ends of those there are teeth that interlock with each other, causing a very strong grip and contraction; sometimes these ends resemble the beak of a bird called a stork (ciconia), which has powerful claws, and their constriction is quite intense.
It appears you may have provided me with the chapter number in Roman numerals for this medieval text. Is there another sentence or element of the treatise that you would like translated? I am happy to help as best I can!
On the eradication of teeth and extraction of bones from fractured jaws.
When you have to extract a broken tooth for some reason and need to wait before proceeding due to the presence of infection in the jaw or other circumstances that delay treatment, it is necessary for you to apply a poultice to the area with moistened wool for one or two days until the wound softens; then introduce forceps, whose ends resemble the beak of an animal called a stork (ciconia) or a powerful bird of prey, into the affected space.
Make sure that the ends of their [the patient's] limbs are confined within a space like a lime or an almond.
If they [the patient] do not obey you with this suggestion and use forceps or tongs, then it is necessary for you to cut into the skin and strip away all the flesh and insert the instrument which has the name 'atalia', which is like a small lever in shape: [shape of the tool can be included here if provided].
And let it [the tool] be very thin at the short end with a little thickness to prevent breakage.
Therefore, if the skin is perforated by this, so be it; and if not, assist yourself with these other instruments which are shaped like this [shape of the tools can be included here]. The first tool has a triangular shape with some thickness at its end.
The second tool is shaped like a triangle, but with an even finer point.
And you have already been assisted with this tool, having two clamps of which the shape is as follows [shape description can be included here], followed by another: And with other instruments which I will describe to you later regarding the teeth-like design; for assistance is provided by this tool shaped like a large onion, and this is its shape [shape description can be included here]:
Of the triangularly shaped extremity that is either twisted or shortened, which has some degree of thickness, and should not be constricted lest it become gangrenous.
And you should also know that the tools for pulling out teeth are similar to other surgical instruments.
Moreover, the skilled and subtle artisan in medicine will recognize by himself, according to what is meant for him regarding surgery and various diseases, as ancient doctors did not say or put proper instruments with certain shapes of different species.
But if the jawbone or other bones of the mouth are gangrenous, or you need to push them back into place, then be careful and treat it with what is suitable for you among the instruments and forceps that we have mentioned earlier in tooth extraction. Assist yourself with this tool which has this form:
And if there is some degree of thickness and it is constricted or held with the mouth so that it does not dry out or escape until all the bone is perforated, then restore its place with appropriate medicines for this.
But if there is a small piece of bone protruding, then remove it from that protrusion and its blackness (gangrene), and cure it until it heals.
Capitol .xxxii.:
De la cura de las dentz eminentz sobre las autras.
Here is my best attempt at translating the provided text:
And let your incision be such that you make an incision there [on the tooth] in too many days because of the hardness of the tooth and it has not been softened by any other tooth.
And if the tooth is prominently exposed to wear, then smooth it with an iron file from India, of which this is the shape:" (presumably followed by a description or illustration).
And let it all be of iron from India and the edge is sharp; and it should have many small points just like a file that makes needles, with which the tooth can be filed little by little over several days with ease so that no other tooth is softened or damaged. Then polish it at the end, and sharpen it with some small knives/razors." (This assumes that "alscu" is a variation of the Latin term "aliquo(m)" meaning "some", as in "with something".)
And if it is a tooth of which one part has become rough and scratches the tongue, then see that you smooth that until the roughness of that portion is removed and flattened/evened out, so that the tongue does not cut itself or speech is not impaired." (This assumes that "trinquada" here means 'rough' rather than its more common meaning of 'broken'. Additionally, "cove que tu limescas" could also be interpreted as an imperative meaning "see to it that you smooth".)
I can certainly help with that! Here is my translation of your provided text:
De restauracio de dentz maugudas am fiel de aur o de argent.
When there is damage to the teeth due to a blow or impact and the patient cannot chew what they eat, you have treated them with astringent medicines but their condition has not improved; in such cases, it is advisable to use tools made of gold rather than silver because silver will turn green over time, whereas gold does not change.
The gold wire should be as thin or thick as necessary to fit between the teeth; its shape is such that you take the wire and pass twice its length through two healthy teeth, then bend it with two twists of the wire in between two unhealthy (decayed) teeth so that when twisted it reaches the healthy tooth on either side. Repeat the process to the other side where you started, applying your skill and care not to hurt any healthy teeth.
When tightening the wire around the roots of the teeth, you should not damage or remove them.
Cut the excess ends of the wire with forceps or scissors and bend them to fit into each space, turning them back towards themselves and hiding them between healthy teeth and damaged ones in order to avoid any injury to the tongue. And then leave it like that, tight as Roman cement.
If it is loosened or broken, bind it with another stronger one in such a manner for all time.
This is the form of teeth and the shape of the gums of two healthy teeth and two decayed ones, as they appear when bound together:" (followed presumably by some sort of diagram)
And when it is done that a tooth or two are returned to their sockets in the jaw, and they have regrown as we have related, but they remain decayed.
Do not attempt this unless you are skilled practitioners and knowledgeable.
And sometimes a certain remedy is prepared using the bones of a cow, and it is made into the shape of a tooth, and placed in the spot where the tooth is missing, and fastened as we have described, remaining and serving for a long time.

On the incision of the ligament which comes into the tongue, prohibiting speech." (followed perhaps by an illustration or instructions for said procedure)
Aquest ligament le qual ve dejos la lengua alcunas veguadas o es natural am le qual hom nays, o accidental e accideys per plagua la qual ja es consolidada.
Here is the translation of the provided text:
But if there is any hardness or induration and it has become established by the congealing of the inflammation, then you should pour oil on it and divide that part along its breadth until you have divided the membrane and dissolved the induration.
And take care that you do not make a rupture in the bridge of flesh, lest you divide there an artery and cause the outflow of blood.
Then let the traces of the incision be washed with rosewater or vinegar water or luke-warm water, and place on it a linen cloth; this is necessary in order that the patient may not again become hardened beneath the tongue.
But if there is an outflow of blood, place powdered vitriol on the spot; but if the blood comes again, then cauterize the spot with a large red-hot iron which you consider suitable for this. Then cure it with the other remedies until it is healed.
The number thirty-five in Roman numerals is written as "XXXV". This is often used to indicate chapters, sections, or other numbered elements in various contexts, such as books, legal documents, or historical texts. It provides a sequential numbering system that has been employed for centuries.
For the extraction of a ranula (a type of cyst), place it below the tongue.
Some minor accidents that occur beneath the tongue, such as small boils or abscesses, hinder the tongue's natural movement and can be quite bothersome as they fill up the mouth.
During the procedure on the patient, ensure they open their mouth wide towards the sun so you can clearly see and examine the abscess.
If you observe a dark or black appearance of the abscess with no pain for the patient when pressed upon it, do not touch what is likely hardened.
If it inclines towards whiteness and is accompanied by moisture, then place your thumb on it and use a thin spatula to cut through it from all sides; if blood comes out during this operation, apply powdered brick dust (sulfur) to the area until the bleeding stops.
Then return to your work and apply an ointment made with vinegar and salt after cleaning the wound; treat it further by bathing in warm water until it is completely healed.
This appears to be a section or chapter marker, indicating the end of this particular medical procedure description and perhaps signaling the beginning of another one in a medieval medical text. The number '36' may indicate that it is the thirty-sixth such treatment described in the book.

And if it is white in colour, red, and its root is subtle, then it should be excised.
And before the operation on the patient is considered, one must observe whether the abscess has already matured and fully developed or if it has diminished to some extent. Then expose the patient to the sunlight with their head facing you; open their mouth, and have the assistant hold their tongue down with a suitable instrument shaped like this:
It should be made of silver or iron and be as thin as a needle.
So as you press the tongue down and the abscess is revealed to you, grasp it with your hand and place your thumb on top of it; then pull it out in one quick movement as far as possible. When you remove the cause of the abscess (the pus), then make an incision in the skin using this kind of instrument:
When you remove the cause of the abscess (the pus), then make an incision in the skin using this kind of instrument: It is assembled like a pair of forceps, but its ends are curved so that the holes in each one face each other, and it has very sharp points made from tempered steel.
But if this instrument is not available to you, then make an incision with a spatula that has this shape: sharp on one side and blunt on the other.
And once you have incised one area, make another incision on the opposite side using the same technique of incision. Then, let the patient's wound heal by washing it with water.
However, if blood flows from the wound, treat it with water infused with a decoction of pomegranate rind or myrtle leaves, and other substances that promote clotting until the bleeding stops. Then, take care of the patient's overall recovery.
In some cases, abscesses may appear in the ear or other areas. Incise these, following the same technique of making two incisions as mentioned earlier.
I have treated a woman with an abscess that had formed in her throat and turned dark in colour, causing little discomfort. The abscess had already closed her airway, making it difficult for her to breathe properly. I prohibited any food or water intake as further measures. If not intervened immediately, she would likely have passed away within a day or two.
And the abscess had grown so much that it had two handles inside, which came out through two tubes.
So I treated it surgically, and placed a fistula in one of its handles, then I extracted that handle, and a large portion came out with it, after that I incised the area where the other tube was located, then I closed its opening, compressed its tongue, and finally inserted the fistula into the abscess.
Then I removed a large part of it, and only a small amount of blood was coming out. That's how the recovery of that woman was complete, and she started drinking water and eating immediately, so I did not stop incising that abscess many times over a long period, and another abscess formed in its place, which I also incised until it disappeared.
Then I put some medication there and cauterized her wound, then added more medication to it; after that I walked around and did not know what God had done about my case.
It seems you have provided me with the number of a chapter or a section, but without any additional context, I cannot accurately translate it into English. If you provide more information or a sentence that comes after this number, I can assist you further.
Sure! Here is my best attempt at translating each line into English:
When the swelling of the tonsils reaches the uvula and becomes inflamed, it is then called "perpendicular"; if instead, it starts lower down and has a more rounded shape, it takes on the name of "bubo.
Once the treatment we have described in this section is completed and you do not see an improvement, if the abscess has already begun to subside but remains subtle, then it is necessary for you to incise around that which forms a rounded mass; if instead it extends in length, appears sanguineous or dark in color, and does not diminish with treatment, then be cautious about incision as there is fear of spreading the infection.
When you observe the abscess according to the manner I have described, regarding its whiteness and length, then treat the condition by restraining the patient and pressing their tongue with an implement designed for this purpose; place your thumb on their jaw, push down gently, and make the incision using one of two instruments known as "double lancets.
Take care not to incise the abscess unless it is absolutely necessary and within the bounds of nature's course; if you were to exceed this limit in your incision, you would risk causing speech impairment.
And then for the incision, use what we have recommended for a double incision, and take care that it heals properly.
If the patient is scared of the incision and their fear prevents cauterization, then use ingenuity to alleviate their dread. The way to handle the cautery on them should be as follows: place the patient's head in your lap, press down gently on their tongue with the instrument we mentioned earlier, and take some of the water described in the chapter on cauterization. Combine it with a living substance (e.g., egg white) until you have an opaque yet not overly thick mixture. Fill the hollow of the instrument that resembles this shape [presumably referring to the form of the cautery tool] with said mixture.
Make the end of this hollow where you place the medicine as wide and deep as the bowl of a spoon, then put the instrument with the medicine on it over the patient's mouth. Have them lie down so they drool or spew saliva from their open mouth onto their side due to the intrinsic nature of the medicine; this way, nothing will drip down their throat and cause further discomfort.
And then you take your hand off the medicine and squeeze it onto their uvula for a quarter of an hour until that part becomes blackened and numb from the effects of the medicine.
Here is the translation of the provided text:
Here is my translation of the provided text:
And this type of treatment is safer than incision and less terrifying.
Some soft swellings are cured with something more subtle than cauterization and incision, for they are treated by subfumigation in this manner: take cumin, hyssop, rue, wormwood, Arabic stichwort, chamomile, bruised borage and other similar herbs, and mix all these causes, or some of them, into a bowl, and let them be submerged in vinegar, and boil; the bowl should be well sealed with proper wax, and there must be an opening in the middle of the bowl over which is placed an instrument thus constructed: made of silver or copper.
And insert the extremity into the mouth of the patient until the vapour reaches the uvula upon which it is directed, until the uvula becomes greatly obscured.
Then repeat this on those many swellings until they are dry, and take care not to perform this cure at the beginning of an abscess's development, as it would aggravate the abscess, and you must instead declare that the abscess should be lanced.
However, if you do not have this instrument at hand, then take a cane and fit on its extremity a cock's spur, so that the mouth of the patient may be closed, for the spur of the cock prevents the vapour from escaping through the mouth.
And this cure is beneficial for recovery.
Chapter 38. (Or 'Chapter Thirty-Eight', depending on the preferred translation.)
On the extraction of thorns, lodged objects in the throat, and other similar cases.
Small foreign bodies stuck in the throat, such as fish bones or other sharp objects.
Therefore, you must extract whatever is visible and within reach; press the patient's tongue with an instrument in front of light source to expose what is stuck in their throat.
And for objects that are not apparent and hidden in the throat, you must make the patient vomit before food is digested in their stomach; often, the cause lodged in the throat will be expelled through vomiting. You can also have the patient swallow a piece of bread soaked in milk or dry bread; or take a piece of dry marine sponge, bind it strongly with bile, and then let the patient swallow this, as when it reaches the place where fish bones are usually extracted, they too shall be expelled. E mays pren una anguila e be am fiel liada, e sia dedintz mesa e soptament sia extrayta; o pren un porr e soptament le metas e soptament l’en tratz.

And if it is a bit thicker than rope, and its extremity has a concavity that you can insert into his mouth easily.
Raise his head upwards and be careful not to touch his neck bone because it might cause an injury to the spine or vertebrae.
But when the patient moves it deeper inside, due to his understanding of the location of the cause and pushing downwards, pull your hand with the instrument along with it based on how much is ready to be extracted.
Chapter 39.
On the extraction of leeches attached to the throat.
When the leech is treated with what we have said in the division of treatment with medicines and it does not work, look at the patient's throat under the sun, as you have already compressed their tongue with an instrument that has been described to you.
Therefore, if you see the leech, extract it with little force or subtle gestures decently.
Here is my best attempt at translating the provided text:
Here is the translation of the provided text:
Mays si no es foro-getada am aquo que havem recomtat, lahoras subfumigua le malaute am cimetz o am assafetida per le instrument le qual havem recomtat en la sufumiguacio de uvula.
Do this, and he will fall asleep.
Another method of operation is through fumigation with this instrument: take a bowl containing burning coals and cover it with a cloth that has an opening in the middle, where the end of the instrument should be placed. Then perform the fumigation; have the patient place their mouth on the end of the tube and close their mouth to ensure the fumigation reaches the bloodstream, for once the blood is affected, the patient will fall asleep.
If this does not work, then repeat the fumigation several times, and have the patient refrain from drinking; they should eat salty foods and almonds, but drink no water, and it is necessary that this regimen be followed.
This is the shape of the instrument used to extract blood from the gullet when it is visible; it is similar to a pair of forceps but with some curvature in its design. The instrument is placed in the gullet and its tip resembles the beak of a stork, which is serrated like a file; this ensures that when it grasps any object, it does not slip away.
Here is my translation of your text:
In which is the summary of the discourse regarding carbuncles and their incision.
Carbuncles are special marks, of various shapes, depending on their appearance, as described in this book.
They vary in their treatment and incision through two methods: one is specific to the type of carbuncle itself; another takes into account its moistness.
The second method considers the locations on the body where carbuncles occur, as a carbuncle on the head differs from one on the buttocks, and a carbuncle in a fleshy area is different from one found at a joint; each requires its own judgment for treatment.
Some carbuncles should not be incised, but rather allowed to mature and heal on their own or with the aid of remedies.
Other carbuncles should be treated by puncturing when they are hard and have not yet matured according to their size, especially those that are near joints; for if a carbuncle is next to a joint, the movement of it may prolong its existence until eventually, the ligaments or nerves of said joint become corrupted causing contraction in that limb. Or if it is located on a major limb, and you delay incision while it matures, the limb itself will be harmed; so too if it is close to the anus - then do not hesitate to treat one which has not matured yet, provided it does not penetrate deeper into the body's interior or lengthen towards the inner parts of the anus, thus becoming a fistula. Also, beware not treating one that was punctured but has not fully digested and so is not completed. Mays cover that you know the time for draining the abscess, and this is when it has ripened.
And know that it has ripened when there is a reduction in pain and the fever breaks, along with a decrease in swelling and pulse rate, and an increase in the sharpness of the abscess's head, as well as other signs.
And make sure you know to pierce the area just beneath the abscess and move outwards from there for a successful cure of the swelling.
Piercing can always be done through the length of flesh or body, whether abscesses are located on limbs or feet, and in places like joints, tendons, ligaments, and more; lastly, it is suitable for all areas that do not reflect heat; as for those that do, use piercing techniques suited to that specific limb.
But when the abscess is located in a fleshy area, it is better to postpone piercing it until its digestion has been confirmed according to what we have said; for if you pierce an abscess before this time, the body's disease will be prolonged and perhaps spread, and its membranes may harden or deepen.
Some boils are pierced according to the depth of the flesh or body part, depending on necessity, or due to that which afflicts the affected limb.
And you must administer a small piercing for the smaller boils, and larger piercings or multiple sections for the bigger ones depending on their size.
Other boils are those in which the incision must be concave and cut, when it is done so that pus may flow out and has already matured enough to do so; like the ones that occur in herds of cattle and sheep.
Those which are incised with three sides have sharp edges; and those that are cut in the shape of a myrtle leaf are like the boils of falconers.
And for those in which you administer a circular or crescent-shaped incision, it is similar to the aforementioned.
But for the one who has no such boils that are merely superficial, you must pierce them with a shallow or flat piercing only.
And when the boil is large and has already collected a good amount of pus, you must pierce it without hesitation and remove all the rot at that very moment; once you have extracted some from it, cover the boil with something else by the next day, then extract more pus in succession until it is healed.

De seccio de apostemas les quals veno en la codena del cap.
In the nape of the neck there are small abscesses, which are of various types; they contain membranes that adhere to them, and their kinds vary.
And from these abscesses there is pus, and in them there is moisture similar to lime. And those that contain moisture resembling dust, similar to it; and there are those that are stony and hard.
And in the sectioning of all [abscesses], and when extracting them there is no fear; you must extract these without causing harm.
And the operation for sectioning these is that you express them with an instrument of the shape you deem appropriate; this is called the 'entromes', knowing what it contains.
For if it contains moisture, then divide that [abscess] with a section along its length, making a shallow incision according to this form:"

And if there is an abscess with greasy nodules, then you should cut it open in this manner: When the incision has a cross-like shape, take hold of its edges with your fingers and peel away its layers, carefully stripping off the membrane that contains it.
But if you find this approach challenging, then do what I described earlier.
Similarly, treat an abscess that has already hardened due to the incision and healing process according to what I have instructed you before; an incision over a hardened abscess is lighter as it contains less blood and moisture.
And sometimes there are certain abscesses that appear on the head of some men which lack any moisture; this is because I once incised an abscess on the head of an elderly woman and found it filled with hard, rough, white material like stone, which could not be broken up, and if anyone were to touch it, they would feel pain.
But in other abscesses that occur on the head, this phenomenon is not common, just like the abscesses that appear on children's heads or behind their ears; however, the incision for all of these should be made superficially.
And make an incision on those of the lower part of their body for relief from pain in the lower parts.
Then treat them with what is appropriate for their healing process.

Regarding the incision of scrofula, which occurs on the neck.
Small white pimples appear, causing these abscesses on the neck, armpits, and groin; in some cases, they occur in other parts of the body.
And those that occur on the neck are white spots produced between them, and all scrofula of this kind is within its own membrane, just like in lymph nodes and head abscesses as we have described.
The types of these scrofula are spots, some being hard like stones, others containing moisture, and there are also malignant ones that do not respond to treatment.
Here is my best attempt at translating the provided text into English:
And it is important to be cautious not to cut or injure any veins or nerves.
Whether the sputum is not formed or your hand cannot make an incision without disturbing the patient and you incise something that does not need to be cut, if you have cut a vein or artery and prevent yourself from completing the operation, put on the wound powdered vitriol or other powders that stop blood flow, squeeze it, let it rest for some time until the sharpness of the abscess is relieved and the wound has softened and begun to suppurate. When blood is cut off.
So return to your operation before it is completed.
Then check with your finger if there is a rupture of any other small scrofula, therefore incise and clean them.
And if it is in the root of the large vein scrofula, be careful not to incise that scrofula from its root. Be sure to hold it with a strong bent nail, and let it fall by itself without causing harm.
And then fill the wound with old cotton that you have already submerged in Egyptian ointment, and treat it accordingly.
And if you thoroughly incise the scrofula, make sure to align the two lips of the wound and sew them together as soon as possible without leaving any excess.
However, if you see that there is excess due to the size of the scrofula, it is necessary to understand that you must incise its root, extract it, and provide stitches as stated before.
For those scrofulas that contain moisture, pierce it with a shallow puncture where it appears to you as the place of maturation, and make a puncture in what we have said is the basis of the body.
Then administer the puncture, cover it with ointment and similar substances to those, so that it corrodes what is left of the corruption. And when you see the wound cleaned, then treat it with an ointment made of generative flesh until it is healed.
I am unable to determine what this refers to without more context. Could you please provide additional information or clarify your question?
The incision of the abscess (apostema) in the throat.
The ancients called this incision in the abscess an 'epilhot', but I have not seen anyone perform it in our region.
And this is the beginning of their speech:
When there is a curvature in the patient's neck, it is advisable to avoid extracting the abscess, as this could damage all their veins and major arteries.
For those with abscesses in their mouth, throat, or ears, when the illness is not severe, it is necessary to use the 'epilhot' incision to prevent the harm that occurs from perforation.
Therefore, when we wish to do this, it is important that we incise the 'epilhot' below the three circles of the abscess, or four times with small sections for its width in cases where there are two abscesses, ensuring the incision is shallow and not deep into the cartilage. This location is suitable for an incision as it lacks flesh, and the patient's blood vessels are far away.
Here is my line-by-line translation of the provided medieval medical treatise:
And then make an incision in the neck as we have described; this signifies sectioning of the channel with a flame, which is seen to be that from him who is disemboweled and by the removal of the voice.
And leave the wound open for some time.
When the hour is considered appropriate for perforation to take place, add two lips of the chain to the wound, and stitch only if cartilage is affected.
Then administer medicines that promote the growth of flesh so it may heal.
And Albucasis says that the summary of this speech we have recounted is nothing more than veins where some of these apostemes have already ruptured the patient's throat, and the patient has come back to life, and their soul has returned, and some wish to make an incision in the epiglottis so that the patient can breathe over the wound for a while, and be saved from death.
And for this reason I order the wound to be left open until the corruption of the disease is consumed; and its corruption lasts three days; then I will command such treatment of the wound, and it shall heal.
Following your provided structure and using the source sentence you included in your prompt as an example for me to translate line by line into English:
Therefore, I confessed that it had not cut any veins or arteries, and the wind was exiting from the wound. I treated it until it healed.
And the maid did not suffer any damage to her vocal cords, and in just a few days she returned with an improvement in her condition.
And now I say that there is no fear when it comes to the incision, or in this case, the amputation.
The number "xliv" refers to the 44th chapter or section of the text. Is there another sentence you would like me to translate?
Regarding the incision for an abscess that occurs outside the groin area, it is called a groin hernia.
This abscess called a groin hernia is a large one according to the description of its size in relation to the body, and it occurs more commonly in women.
It happens in two ways: either naturally or accidentally.
In the case of a naturally occurring abscess, it is not easy to treat.
The accidental abscess occurs in two ways: one is similar to fat knots, and the other way is like an abscess caused by the blockage of an artery. In this case, there is fear or concern. And it is not necessary to make an incision with iron unless in someone who is young. If you examine it and find it similar to fatty tumors, and it is not suspended by any of the veins, then you shall make an incision in those places like nodes, and remove it along with what contains its skin and subcutaneous tissue; but if not, thoroughly investigate its entire structure, and then treat the area with appropriate curative substances until it is healed.
Chapter 45.
On the incision of different types of nodules.
There are several varieties of nodules, and I have already mentioned all the different kinds in this section.
It is necessary for me to recount here the distinction between nodules and exostoses, in case there is any doubt.
Thus I say that with exostoses there is a fever and violent pains, as the superfluous matter boils up; and it is a perfect state of putrefaction which ceases when the fever, pain, and heat subside.
There is no heat or fever present, and you can consider this as a case of what we call 'leucophoenicum', which belongs to the cataplectic disease.
According to the color of the body (or skin), its onset is like a boil and it happens just like with cows, whether major or minor, and they are of two types: either fatty and containing moisture, and the colors of this moisture are many, as I mentioned in the division.
Therefore, when you reach the treatment of nodes, first express that and inquire about it at its beginning using an instrument called a probe, according to how its form will be revealed in the appropriate upcoming chapter.
This is the method of inquiry for boils and all nodes: you take this instrument (the probe) and insert it into the wettest part that you find in the boil, then you will rotate your aforementioned words little by little until you know that the instrument has penetrated the core.
Then close your hand according to the size of the boil and extract the probe, then consider what has come out in its track.
And if you forget about draining the running moisture, regardless of its color, then you should cut it with a shallow incision, just as I have mentioned for other abscesses.
And if there is no moisture found in the wound, then you should know that it is greasy.
And dry it over the wound with an incision in the shape of a cross, following this form:" (presumably referring to a visual representation that would accompany the text). As I have taught you, suspend it with threads, and scrape off the crust from all around easily, preserving the skin or sack if possible over it and extract that pus with a thread.
But if it breaks during the operation, and you cannot extract that pus, often this happens, then you must remove it in pieces until there is nothing left.
For if even the smallest amount of pus remains, the thread will return as it was before.
And if you wish to ensure that no part is left behind, complete the plague with some sharp corrosive powders and tighten the bandage, placing it over the abscess until it is healed, then treat it with another cure so that it may be cured.
And if it is not large, then you stitch its two lips and treat it with something that incarnates.
If the pulse is contrary, whether pulsatile or not, you cauterize and fill the place with powdered vitriol, leaving it tight for two or three days until the ulcer matures and blood no longer oozes; then return to cut away what is rotten from the tumor.
I am not sure what you mean by this, could you please clarify your request?
On the forms of instruments necessary for section and perforation.
Of these are the forms of instruments, and there are three types: one is large, another is medium-sized, and the other is small.
The form of the large instrument is as follows:" (here likely follows an illustration or detailed description of the instrument).
The procedure for administering medication to children is as follows:
If it is iron or lead that is being administered, or if the child has severely bruised extremities, then ensure a gentle and careful application to avoid causing harm.
These are the different forms of treatment, known as 'albereds', and one such form is called 'berid'.
There are three types of medication: large, medium, and small doses.
The procedure for administering the larger dose is as follows:
The process of giving a medium-sized dose involves:
For the administration of a small dose, one must proceed with caution and follow these steps:
This treatment is specifically for cases of abscess, ulceration, fistula, or swollen glands arising from bone issues or other causes.
You will require rounded and large needles, like those used by lions (leatherworkers), which are made from ivory, bone, iron, or silver. The best ones are crafted from ivory.
Here is my translation of the provided text:
And they are of three types; some of them are long, others medium-sized, and yet others short, depending on the size of the opening of the fistula and its constriction.
The shape of the large lead stylet is:
The shape of the medium-sized lead stylet is:
The shape of the small lead stylet is:
The shapes of the hooks are five types, some of which are simple with only one curve, and they come in three sizes: large, small, and medium.
And there are body hooks among them, also of the three aforementioned sizes.
Some have two curves, also coming in those same three sizes mentioned before.
There are some with three curves, once more of the previously described three sizes.
And all these are required in their places.
Forma de unci simple pauc, forma de lu:
The translation of the given sentence is "A large grain has two curves. A medium-sized grain has two bends." This is what the provided text means when translated into English. The translation of the sentence is "A small grain has two curves.
A large grain has three curves." This is what the provided text means when translated into English.
The translation of the given sentence is "A medium-sized grain has three curves.
These are the shapes of scalpels that are cut and scraped to remove knots and abscesses, and they come in three types: large, medium-sized, and small." This is what the provided text translates to when translated into English.
The shape of a large scalpel". This is what the provided sentence means in English.
The shape of the knife is as follows:
Shape of the small knife:
The ends of these instruments are sharp on one side and dull on the other; they have not been placed in this way, but so that when used in the incision of nodes there is less risk to veins or nerves, and so that with them the patient can be cured, regaining tranquility after some time because of the drying out of the aposteme.
And these are the shapes of the lancets; they come in three sizes: large, medium and small, just like the knives.
They have been made with iron and look like rays, and they are then dipped in alcohol.
And the cutting end has hidden parts with sharp edges on both sides when you want to see them.
The forms of splints, which are hidden between the said wounds to cover the suppuration and are not perceived by patients, come in three types: large, medium, and small. These are the forms/shapes of the splints (literal translation):
The forms of cupping that interrupt the flow of blood are of three types; large, medium and small.
They should be made from lemon tree bark, round with some length to them, and thin.
And ensure that these three types of cups are large, medium and small, so you can interrupt the blood flow at different rates as needed, especially when it is not yet time for medicine to be administered.
However, do not use them to interrupt blood flow in any location of the body; only in fleshy places such as thighs and hips, forearms and upper arms, breasts, abdomen, knees and other similarly moist, fleshy areas.
And sometimes these instruments are made smaller and shaped like small boxes for bloodletting when performing phlebotomy or making incisions in veins or arteries.
And sometimes they are made round like this: [insert illustration].
Chapter 47.
From treating the mammilla of men which are similar to those of women.
Some men's mammilla become swollen due to the effect of sleeping in damp places; and their mammilla are also similar to those of women, but more prominent and larger.
For those who wish to perform this operation, it is necessary to make an incision in the mammilla following this lunar shape, from point .B. to point .G., and then carefully remove all the tissue. Fill the wound with red medicine, close the two edges of the wound using sutures, and treat them until they are healed.
But if the mammilla hangs towards the sides and is softened by its own weight like those of women, then it should be cut into two halves along its upper part, with two sections similar to a lunar shape, each one contained within the other at their ends, so that the larger line contains the smaller one following this shape from point .B. to point .G. Then carefully remove the tissue between the edges of the wound, taking out the fat, and administer what we have said about sutures and powders as necessary for the treatment until it is healed.
E si tu non conpleysses la inscizio de aquo que cove inscidir per la inquietut del malaute, e per flux de sanc, lahoras cove que huemplas la plagua de coto submergit en enguent corrosiu e layssa aquel entro que aquo corroda que es romas de la grayssa, e aprop cura aquel entro que sia sanat.
Here is my translation of your provided text:
De perforacion de apostemas que viene debajo del tilleta.
These abscesses that develop below the ear belong to a type of scrofula which is hard and contains pus.
And among these, some contain moisture; for those that contain moisture, it is necessary to make an incision with the moon in a waning phase, according to this figure: from point G to point B. And when all the pus inside the abscess has been evacuated, you fill it with old beef tallow and let it settle over the next day.
Then keep the tallow there and treat it with appropriate ointment until it is healed.
And if the abscess is of a type that develops nodules and belongs to the family of scrofula, then you make an incision over it as we have described in the section on scrofula.
But if the plague has spread so that suppuration occurs, then apply cauterization as we have mentioned before.
Chapter 49. (Or perhaps: "Title 49.")
On the incision of abscesses that occur on an artery or a vein.
Here is my translation of the first source sentence into English:
E aquel que es per vena es redon al manifest del cors.
Here is my best attempt at translating the provided text:
Mays sobre aquel que es de lor per imflacio de l’orrifici de la arceria, scindeys en la codena seccio en le lonc; e aprop huebre la seccio am uncis e aprop la arceria, e deliura de las tunicas entro que sia descuberta.
Here is the translation of the provided sentence:
And then pierce the place which is between two ligaments with a spatula so that the blood within it drains out, and let the abscess be dissolved.
And then apply a cure in which is generated a poultice so that the ligaments fall away, and then treat it with appropriate ointments until it is healed.
And if it is an abscess due to the incision of a vein, you should ensure that you have at hand what is necessary for treating the abscess with a ligature; then insert the needle under the place which you had beneath your hand, and make it penetrate; and let there be on it a thread so that you extract it from the other side, and then bind the abscess with a bandage as I told you in the chapter regarding grapes, with two parts at both ends of the thread.
But if you fear that the thread will be pulled out, insert the sinew with that needle under the entire abscess up to where the first needle was inserted; and tighten your threads in four places.
Then dry the abscess in its middle part until what is inside it comes out; then you cut the excess of the ligature, and leave what remains tied.
And then place on them a poultice that you have submerged in wine and oil, and then administer the cure which is made with compresses and ointments until they are healed.
Chapter 1: On abscesses that occur due to nerve injuries.
Similarly, abscesses can occur in arteries and veins, and similarly, abscesses can form in nerves when there is an injury or damage to their path or due to excessive strain and similar causes.
Most often, they occur in the areas of the assistants or tendons, or any location where joints are compressed.
And it is a severe abscess, similar in appearance to the rest of the body, and it is located in their joints or extremities; when it is very tight, causing intense pain, the patient experiences a similar stupor.
It is not an abscess that forms in the depths of the body; therefore, it cannot be cured with incisions. It is compressed from all sides and does not affect the areas in front or behind.
Thus, for those who suffer from joint problems, it is not advisable to use iron tools [for treatment], as they could easily cause contraction.
Mays aquel que es en le cap o en le front fen la codena am spatum. If there is a small abscess, then take your scissors and cut it off from its roots.
And if it is large, you will hang a weight on it, pull it out and then remove it; after that, stitch the wound with suture, and treat until it heals.
Chapter 11:
On the incision of an abscess that occurs on the cheek which affects the abdomen.
Treating some men who have spots on their bellies and in other parts of the body which are called funguals due to their similarity with fungi; the roots of these are thin while the head is thick; already the lips of those are transformed, it is from them that small ones come out, and great ones emerge as well.
I have seen one patient like this, and in their belly there were two parts which looked more like fungi, and there was no difference between them as they were all white and had thin roots.
And the lips of those patients were inverted and cracked, with moisture running from them constantly.
Therefore, I make an incision here and remove part of the foot, one with 18 ounces and the other with six.
And during the operation, when making an incision on them, consider whether the patient is moist and if the color of the hernia is white, humid, and with subtle roots. Then, you make an incision with a wide spatula, and have your cauterizers heated in the fire because many times their section expels a lot of blood; and if the blood comes out, cauterize it.
And if you see that the patient is weak and fearful, be careful not to use iron for the incision; instead, take a recently made lead weight and tighten it around the hernia as we have described earlier, and leave it there for two days.
Then tighten it with the lead wire's tension; so, do not stop tightening the large lead until it is cut and falls off by itself.
But if it is of thick roots, then its incision is a cause for concern and fear, especially when it is in the belly.
It is also possible that you divide him in half and then cauterize it so that he doesn't return.
Then cure the patient until the plague is healed.
And be careful not to presume to cut into flesh that is of a dark color, has little sensation, and looks unhealthy, as it is actually cancerous.
And I will come with the memory of illness soon after this.
Chapter 52.
On the cure for an umbilical hernia.
An umbilical hernia is caused by multiple reasons: fissures in the muscle that lies above the abdomen, similar to other ruptures; or bleeding from a vein or artery as previously mentioned; or trapped gas.
If it is due to a fissure in the muscle and the hernia appears, the colour of the wound resembles that of flesh; its pain is fierce and it appears in various places. And if it is due to the protrusion of the intestine (hernia), then place him in the position we have described with greater care and diversity, and as you press on it with your hand and it becomes hidden, return his intestines; do so gently and carefully, and remember that great danger comes from bathing and hard labor.
If it is due to moisture (humidity), then it is less severe and not hidden when you press it with your hand; it is not constricted nor believed to be a serious condition.
And if it is due to blood (an issue with circulation), then you will notice these signs: the appearance of an abscess turning black.
If it is due to flesh (a soft tissue issue), then the abscess will be more severe, thick, and hard; it is embedded deep within.
If it is due to gas (gas-related issue), then its touch will be gentle.
The operation on such a case is considered if the bulge around the navel is due to arterial blood, venous blood, or gas; you should be warned against treating him/her because there is fear and danger involved, as I have taught you in the chapter where we discussed abscesses caused by arteries and veins.
Here is the translation of your provided text:
Here is the translation of the provided text:
And if you have removed the cloth, then take a thread; and cut off its excess.
But if it is contrary to your bow or vein, then surround that area with a thread, and return to your operation; take two needles and put strong threads through them, and insert the two needles into the circle you have made around the abscess in the form of a cross, making sure they penetrate; then tighten the abscess into four parts over the needles.
And if you wish, remove the needles and leave the area so that the flesh can extend and fall on its own; or cut it when it has softened and will fall off, then treat it with something appropriate for wounds until it is healed.
And if the prominence of the navel is made of flesh or due to moisture, then it is necessary that you treat the abscess as we have said and draw out the blood or moisture that has collected there, then treat it with something appropriate and consolidate the area.
It seems you have provided me with a chapter number from this medieval medical text. Is there anything else I can help you translate or understand?
That translates to "On the treatment of fractures." Would you like me to continue translating this text?
We have already stated, in the division of special ailments and how they can be treated with medicine, that it is advisable to avoid treating them with iron as this could lead to ulceration; we have also mentioned the types of ailment generated by moisture and the precautions needed for their treatment.
The ancient masters said that some ailments can be eradicated if they are caught in the early stages when it is possible to do so; this applies to ailments such as those found on the breasts or groin and similar areas of the body where it may be necessary to remove all affected tissue, especially when the ailment is still small.
But when the ailment is old and severe, it is best not to attempt treatment yourself, for I have not seen any cure for such an affliction nor do I know of anyone who has been successful in treating it.
The operation on the patient, as we have mentioned earlier, should proceed like this: you prepare the patient and administer a black bile purge in some cases; then you proceed to bleed them, unless there is an obvious obstruction.
Then prepare the patient for surgery, and use suitable hooks to reach into the wound; finally, remove all tissue with a good curved knife while ensuring you do not damage any of its roots. Let the blood flow and do not stop it lightly; squeeze the areas [to promote bleeding] and wipe away any large clots using your hand or an instrument that is suitable for you.
If it is unpleasant for you to have large clots when incising a vein or an artery, then cauterize that area once the blood flow has ceased and then treat it with another remedy until it is healed.
The numbering system in medieval texts was often based on Roman numerals, so ".liv." likely refers to Chapter 45 (as 'L' represents 50 and 'iv', which is read as 'IV', represents the number 4). However, without more context or additional information, I cannot determine the exact meaning of this chapter numbering.
On the treatment of dropsy."

Here is the translation of the provided text:
If the generation of hydrops is due to kidney disease, then your incision should be three fingers to the left of the navel.
And if its generation is due to the belly, then your incision should be on the right side.
And you should not make your incision over the side on which the patient wishes to lie, so as not to let superfluities flow to that place.
Then pierce it with the instrument through the entire length, then introduce this into that incision, and lift your hand with the spatula between the length and the cecum, and peel it off; if its quantity is of one claw or around.
Then pierce the cecum until the spatula reaches the empty place, which is where water lies. Then extract it and introduce an instrument of this form:" (I cannot insert images, so please describe the image to me instead.) It is similar to a thin silver cannula; it can be made of silver, bronze or lead. At its lower part there is a small hole, and on its sides three holes: two on one side and one on the other. Its extremity is incised like a pen, as you may see in this figure:" (please describe the image to me).
Here is the translation of the first source sentence:
May it be expelled from that person according to the quantity of their virtue, and depending on what your understanding of the patient's condition is regarding their virtue and well-being.
Then remove the instrument and keep the water that is causing this, which was just retained by the chain that holds the perforation above the navel, and show me how you perforated it in such a way.
And then repeat the procedure with the instrument on another day if you think the patient can bear it, and extract a small amount of water each time, doing so for several days out of fear that an excess may lead to error.
If you fear that the patient may suffer due to a large amount of water being extracted, then treat them with poultices of warm dry sand, and apply sweet-smelling ointments while they are in a bath exposed to the sun for a long time; and finally provide them drying medications until they have healed.
Cauterize the stomach, and the melon and kidney afterwards with an extraction of water, as I have described in what was previously written.
Chapter 50.
For the cure of children who are born with unpenetrated urine passages.
Some infants are born from their mother's womb, and the head of their genitals is not perforated (either it is too narrow or is not in its place).
Thus, it is necessary to make an incision on him as soon as he is born with a very thin spatula in this manner:
Then place in the narrow opening a thin leaden peg and tie it there with thread for three or four days.
And when he wants to urinate, he should be turned over to do so; then return him (to his original position).
And if you do not tie the leaden peg in place, it is possible that urine flowing over this area will loosen and remove the peg.
For one whose opening is too narrow, he should be treated with a leaden peg as we have said for many days until it (the peg) becomes wider.
For those in whom the opening is not in its place (too high), it should be noted that this condition occurs when one is born with an upward-turned penis so that he cannot urinate when lying down because he raises his penis with his hand while doing so; and it is also a problem for reproduction, as semen cannot reach the mother properly. It is a very serious illness.

Capitol .lvi.:
Here is my best attempt at translating your provided text into English, line by line:
Motas veguadas accideys aquest albater en la vergua e es eminencia de carn laga.
And one of these is malignant, while the other is not.
For the non-malignant one, take a thin needle and cut it open so that everything inside is exposed; then apply some Egyptian ointment underneath it; finally, cure it with fine ointment until it is healed.
If the ulcer is malignant with a dark colour, you must apply a hot iron to its incision and reason.
But if the ulcer is on the foreskin of an uncircumcised penis, and one part of it is inside the foreskin while the other is outside, you must remove the ulcer that is inside at its beginning until it is consolidated; then treat what's outside, for when you treat what's under the foreskin together, there is no guarantee that it won't be torn.
And if this accident happens in the eyelids and foreskin, becoming black and corroding, you must dig up all that is already darkened and tends to corrupt or is already corrupted; then lay on it something mixed with honey, which has been bruised with a mixture of pomegranate rind and finely-sifted earthworms.
And then treat him with another cure until he is healed.
But if there is an outflow of blood, then apply the lunar cautery in this way:
As the beneficial cautery has two uses, it is for bleeding and for corrupt wounds.
And if the head of the penis is corroded and destroyed suddenly, you should insert a lead cannula into the flesh of the foreskin so that the patient urinates through it.
In the case of an adhesion between the foreskin and the head of the penis (and this only occurs in those who have not been circumcised, as there is no need for it; and when it happens due to a wound or abscess) you should scrape with a blunt spatula until the adhesion is dissolved and the head of the penis is freed from any division.
And if it is difficult to separate them completely, you should scrape with a spatula at the edge of the head of the penis and the foreskin; and this is why, when the foreskin is thin, it is easily pierced by its own thinness.
And then separate the foreskin from the head of the penis using a very thin thread, which has already been moistened in cold water so that it does not stick again.
And then clean the wound with astringent vinegar until it is fully healed.
I am unable to find any information or text associated with 'Capitol .lvii.' from the provided treatise. Is there another portion of the text you would like translated?
On cleanliness for children, and on the treatment of those who suffer complications after circumcision.
Unlike other wounds, circumcision is not solely caused by continuity of matter; rather, it is our own doing and willpower that makes it unique among children, so we must assign to this the best method of operation and lightest path toward health.
Thus, we say that the ancients did not mention circumcision in any of their writings because it was not included in their laws, and this is only something we have acquired through experimentation. The reason for this is that I have found that most surgeons and barbers practice circumcision and cleanliness with a novacula (a type of razor) and a lancet; they use thread made from animal intestines for ligatures and the claw of an animal for incisions.
Here is my translation of the provided text: Here is my translation of the provided text:
Mays en la operacio am ungla, fort leu obazeys ferr e corromp la tua operacio. And the child's wound is small by nature, and many times there is no need for modification (of treatment), and I have seen this happen.
When making the modification with scissors and tying it off with a ligature (string/thread), I have found through practice that you should use proportional incisions because the sharpness above is like the one below; thus when you press your hand down, two sharp edges are brought together and incise at once in an exact manner; this is done by compressing the ligature around the neck of the vein so as to avoid any error.
The first method of operation is to have the child stay for a few days if they are young and able to understand; simply tie off their ligature around the vein but do not proceed with the second part of the procedure on that day.
Then make them happy in any way you can, according to their understanding. Have them stay between your arms, positioned upright and not moving; hide the scissors in your hand or beneath your arm so that the child cannot see them or any other of the tools.
Here is the translation of the provided text:
The shape of the scissors for this operation is as follows:" (Here I would include an image or diagram of the scissor shape described in the text).
The two ends of the scissors should be unsharpened and the other two sharpened, with no split in the shank; the length of both cutting edges should match that of two equal-length handles."
Mays la error en mundificacio es quar fort leu efugeys la codena intrinseca tota, o partida de lu deves la inscizio.
Donc cove que tu extendas aquella de la tua ora am la tua ungla denant la apostemacio del loc e que inscidas aquella segon equalitat.
And if you cannot hold it with your nail, then use a lancet and make an incision.
But if three days have passed and there remains an inflammation beneath the penis that becomes covered with pus, then you should make an incision so that the abscess is drained, remove it easily, and cut away the affected part.
And be careful not to touch the head of the penis, as it should remain untouched.
And therefore cure it with the ointment that solidifies from the powders which we have discussed in the treatise on powders.
And if it is cut to an appropriate length on the shaft and you follow the instructions given above, then it will not harm him.
And furthermore cure it with what we have said before so that it may heal.
It seems like you may have provided an additional detail or instruction in the source text for me to translate, but I cannot provide an accurate translation without that information. Please feel free to provide any further details so I can assist you accurately!
On the treatment of retained urine in the bladder."
Here is the translation of the provided text:
And if the disease is not resolved with what we have mentioned before and its cause is severe, it is necessary to administer extraction from him using an instrument called a syringe, which has this form: It should be made of silver and have a thin lion-shaped nozzle; there should also be a tube made from bird feather quills with the subtlety of a ray that is one and a half palms long (i.e., approximately 22.5 inches), which ends in a narrow cannula at its head.
The method of extracting urine using this instrument is as follows: Take a folded thread and bind it to the extreme end of [the syringe] with a good knot; insert one end of the thread into the part beneath the syringe, and cut off any superfluous portion of the thread with the scissors. Then, push the thread inside the cannula forcefully. Next, attach the syringe to a board and a piece of white cloth.
Place the patient on a saddle-like structure and lubricate their genitals with moistening oils such as olive oil or lotions.
Here is the translation of the provided text:
And then stretch the bile with wool, little by little, for urine is like wool.
Then extract that [substance] and use urine as a cure; keep doing this and use syringes until the bladder is evacuated and the patient finds relief again.
Chapter 59.
On the quality of bladder irrigation with syringes, or similar instruments suitable for this purpose.
When there is an ulcer or abscess in the bladder, or blood has clotted within it, and you want to introduce water or medicine into the bladder, then use an instrument called a syringe (clampcedra), which has this form:
Except that its end is closed or sealed. And it has three openings: two of which are on one side, the same as many times.
At the beginning is a concave space where the liquid that will be injected is placed; and it can hold as much fluid as you introduce into it until when some cause makes what is within drawn out of the moist parts, then it too will be drawn in; and when it is ejected with water, it also draws this forth; and when it is thrown far away, just like a syringe containing naphtha does in naval battles.
When you want to remove moisture from the bladder, insert the end of the [medical instrument] into the moist area, and pull it with water that is pushed towards its ends, since the moisture is drawn into the cavity of the [instrument].
Then insert the end of the [medical instrument] into the penis as we have outlined in the surgical procedure, and push the moisture with water that you are pushing, for this moisture will immediately reach the bladder, and the patient will feel it.
The shape of the [medical instrument] used to empty the bladder is subtle, and its form is as follows:
It is made of either silver or bronze, with its top part shaped like a small feather, and you should cut it slightly inside.
Then take the bladder of an animal, and place in it the moisture that you want to cure in the patient's bladder, then tie this [bladder] between two ends with a strong double cord, and boil this moisture over fire.
Then insert the end of the [medical instrument] into the penis.
Then grasp your hand over the bladder with the moisture, applying downward pressure until the patient feels that this moisture has reached their bladder.
Here is my translation of the provided text:
And then you bind him with the instrument in such a way that it is done as you did to the bladder, and squeeze by hand so that all moisture comes out of the bladder.
Chapter 60.
On stone extraction.
We have already discussed in the previous section the types of stone and its treatment with medicine, as well as the difference between stones formed in the kidneys and those formed in the bladder, along with their symptoms.
And we have mentioned that for stones where manual manipulation and cutting are necessary.
Stones formed in the bladder itself are those that become stuck there.
And I am only describing it here with clear exposition and brevity.
So I say that stones formed in the bladder mostly occur in children; and of its symptoms are that the urine emitted from the bladder is like water in its subtlety, and appears sandy; and the patient frequently scratches their penis, and often cries out in pain, and is restless; and because of this, some have had their anus pierced.
And it is easier to heal children up until they reach fourteen years of age, while it's difficult to cure the elderly. May those in their youth be grateful for what they have, as it is a middle state between those who have less.
And for the one who has a greater illness, their cure is more effortless; If it's minor, it contradicts that.
Thus, when we arrive at the cure for such an illness, it's necessary from the beginning to modify the patient by making an incision that removes all of the ruptures in their intestines; because these ruptures sometimes prevent the extraction of the stone due to its location.
Then let the patient be held by their feet and suspended upside down so that the stone descends into the bottom of the bladder or falls out on its own sometimes.
Prepare that which is ready between your hands and let the patient's legs be held by their own hands, so that the bladder can entirely be suspended downwards.
And then remove this and all of it outside.
Therefore, if you feel the stone in the space, then immediately cut into him.
And if you do not catch it completely with your touch, then you must apply some oil to your left index finger if the patient is a child, or your middle finger if they are a young adult, and insert it into their anus. And with your finger placed before the stone, you enter it there. And turn it little by little towards the neck of the bladder.
Then press on it with your finger, and expel it to the outside of the location where you made the incision.
Instruct the minister to press on the bladder with their hand; and command another minister to use their right hand to spread apart the genitalia, and with their other hand they should wet a cloth that is under the genitals in the area where the incision was made.
Then insert an instrument called 'spatum' that is used for cutting, its shape being as follows: And divide the area between the anus and genitalia, not in the middle but towards the left side; let the incision be made over the stone with your finger inside the anus, or make a transverse incision so that the outer incision is wide and narrow within according to how much of the stone can possibly protrude, but no more, as it will cause difficulty for your finger which is in the anus near the stone and may slip out if forced.
And know that there are stones with angles and edges, which makes their extraction difficult.
And for those which resemble acorns or nuts, being round in shape, their removal is easier.
So if they have angles and edges, adjust them in the cleft or opening.
And if it is not forgotten there (in the cleft or opening), then know that you must place something over it, or grasp it with your fingers appropriately, so that the end resembles a lime, which you scrape against the stone; do not neglect this. Or introduce below it a curved instrument of delicate shape.
But if you cannot do this (remove the stone), then slightly enlarge the opening; and when you see blood flow, tie it off firmly with powdered sulfur.
But if there is more than one stone, then at the beginning place your hand over the opening of the bladder and make an incision there; then introduce something small nearby; similarly do this for two or more stones.
Here is the translation of the provided text:
Now administer the expulsion of it from inside, so that it is forgotten, or devise in the fracture with forceps to extract it in pieces.
Once you have completed your operation, fill the wound with aloe juice and dragon's blood (a medicinal substance), and bind it tightly. Place on it a cloth soaked in oil and wine, or in rose oil and warm water, so that the abscess may be softened.
Then turn the patient over onto their neck, and do not remove the bandage before three days have passed.
And when you have unbound it, wash the area with water and honey, then treat it with ointment made of alum and disulfiramide until it is healed.
But if an abscess appears in the wound, being hot and corrosive, and of such a nature that blood is found in the urine (which is known by the discharge of bloody urine), then insert your finger into the wound and remove the blood, for if left it will provoke the bladder to corruption, and putrefaction.
And then wash the wound with vinegar, water, and salt, applying every type of medication that is appropriate for curing until it is healed.
Cover during the entire healing process, both thighs, and secure the medications that have been placed on the area.
And if the stone is small and located in the middle of the penis, but inserted inside it, then urine discharge is prohibited. Cure that by using what I have recommended before to avoid surgery, because those visible wounds caused by this treatment are accused of being surgical; and now I expect you will take a steel perforator with this shape: [shape description].
Triangular apex, pointed, embedded in wood.
And then take thread and tie it around the penis below the stone to prevent it from returning to the bladder.
And then insert the steel into the penis, piercing it with ease until the perforator reaches the stone. And rotate the perforator with your hand around that small stone gradually, and pierce through it until you make one side emerge from the other end; for the urine will be immediately released.
Here is my translation of the given sentence:
But if this cure is not equipped with you for any reason that prohibits it, then have two servants lay beneath the stone, and another faithful servant above the stone. Then make an incision on the stone at that narrow part between two bindings. And then extract it. Then untie the binding and modify the clotted blood, which is done on the wound.
The servant under the stone is not necessary to hold it down but to prevent the stone from returning to the bladder; and the other servant above holds it for another reason: when they untie you [the second servant], the stone quickly returns to its place, causing the wound to open again.
And for this reason, it is necessary that when you untie the servant above, you lift the stone to its upper parts, so that it returns with your help and the wound heals as we have said.
It seems like there is no direct translation for this sentence. "Capitol" could be referring to a chapter or section marker, indicating the start of a new part in the text. ".lxi." might represent a number or an abbreviation, potentially standing for "Chapter 61," but without further context it's challenging to determine its exact meaning.
The extraction of stones from women.
Stones in women are rarely formed.
When stones are found in some of them (women), it is difficult to cure them, and it is prohibited by various methods.
One of these methods is when the woman is still young and a virgin.
The second method is when you do not find a woman who dares to tell the doctor if she is chaste or has been married.
The third method is when you do not find a woman who knows this art (surgery), especially operating with the hand.
The fourth method is that the place for the operation to remove stones in women is far from where the stone is located; therefore, due to fear of incision, it does not happen.
But if you are compelled to do this, then know that you should take a female doctor who dares to tell (the truth), and she is rarely found.
But if you are deprived of her (the female doctor), then seek an honest and gentle male doctor, or present a mature woman who is skilled in women's matters, or a woman who has experienced this art before.
Therefore, perform this examination and instruct them to do everything you ask regarding the inquiry about the stone at the beginning; the reason being that one must check if the woman is a virgin, then insert your finger into their anus and feel for the stone.
So if you find it, grasp it with your finger, and then tell them to push down on it.
But if she is not a virgin, instruct the matron to insert her finger into the patient's vagina and check for the stone, placing their left hand on the bladder, and applying good pressure.
Then if you find it, tell them to carefully extract it from the bladder's opening towards its lower parts with their right hand, until they reach the root of the vagina.
And then let them push down on that area in the middle of the vagina below the root with any part of their hand without moving the stone from its position under your finger.
And if the incision is small at first, insert the spatula into that opening and feel for the stone; then make an incision of the size you know will allow the stone to be removed.
And know that the types of stones are many: some are small and large, smooth and harsh, long and round, and have roots.
So you understand that there are many types of stones, each with their specific characteristics as I've mentioned earlier.
If you wish to induce bleeding, apply crushed vitriol [sulfuric acid] to the area and leave it on for an hour until the blood is drawn out; then return to your operation so that the stone can be removed.
Prepare one of the instruments that I mentioned during the extraction of stones in men; this will assist you during your operation.
If you notice bleeding and understand that the expulsion of blood is due to a cut artery, then apply powder to the area and tie it with lint [soft gauze] and a firm bandage; do not repeat this process. Leave the stone alone and do not extract it, as excessive force will cause the patient's death. Then treat the wound.
Once the sharpness of the blood has subsided after several days and the area becomes soft again, you can return to your operation so that the stone is removed.
Capitol lxii.: Chapter 62.
De seccio sobre ernia acoza."
Hernia ayguoza is not just the aggregation of humidity in the white cipha located below the genital code containing the egg, and it is called the cipha.
And sometimes it occurs in the proper fat pad that nature has prepared for it when it is still an egg and there is another egg; this is the genital code between the white cipha we mentioned earlier, and it is nothing but cake.
The generation of this hernia occurs due to the weakness that affects the genitals; because in those cases this matter is infiltrated into them, and sometimes it also happens due to a blow received by the genitals.
This humidity presents itself with different coloured spots; its colour may be that of the patient's skin or leaning towards yellow or red, or brown, black and fatty, or a whitish watery substance, which is most common.
The signs by which this aggregation of water is known are as follows: if it occurs in the white cipha we have mentioned earlier, then the abscess appears rounded and slightly stretched in length like an egg shape; the genitals become visible because the humidity covers them completely.
And if the moisture is located in the fat layer beneath the skin, then it is considered an abscess that has developed around the egg and is therefore deemed to be another type of egg.
And if the moisture is between the tendons of the thigh muscles and the white fibrous tissue around them, then you should leave it alone without any intervention.
When you wish to know the nature of the moisture by its colour, examine the colour of the pus in an abscess preceded by an eruption; and according to what is seen on this eruption, judge what it must be like inside.
Therefore, when we come to the treatment of it with iron, then see that you command the patient to undergo bloodletting if this is possible for him, and empty his body.
Then let him be placed on his back over some slightly raised base, and place many cloths beneath him.
Then sit yourself on the left side of him and command your assistant to go to his right; let him extend their arm in one direction towards the outer part of the thigh and towards the edge of the navel.
And then take a wide spatula and cut the cord of the testicles in the middle area near the pubic bone.
Make the incision as prescribed, at an equal distance from the line that divides the scrotum, reaching up to the white membrane.
Remove it, observe it, and ensure that you do not cut into it; your extraction should be made in two parts, suspended by the larger muscle, and examine the extraction closely according to its quantity as best as possible.
Then pierce the full white membrane with an ample hole, and extract all of the water.
After that, separate the two lips of the incision with hooks, extend the white membrane into two parts; do not touch the cord of the testicles, and make an incision in the white membrane as carefully as you can. Incise it either in its entirety or in pieces, especially the thin side of it, for if you do not meticulously explore the incision, there is a risk that water may return.
If the wound starts to come out of its place during your operation time, once you have completed the sectioning of the penis, return it inside and adjust both labia of the scrotum with sutures; cure that like other wounds until it heals.
And if the penis is corrupted by another disease or condition, you should tie the vessels that are above the scrotum, extract the penis, and then treat it as mentioned before.
If water accumulates in two separate places, then you should know that there are two hernias present. Incise these areas just like you did with the other one and if it appears to be an operation or surgery, go ahead and perform it.
Clean the blood and fill in the incisions with lint soaked in oil or rose oil. Place another piece of lint that was soaked in wine and oil on top; spread it over the testicles and the lower abdomen, cover this with folded cloth and powder, then bind everything together using a bandage in the following way:
Take two cloths and soak them in red wool as shown here; the ends should be fastened with cotton or wet wool and these are attached securely into the undergarments' crotch area. One end of the cloth goes behind the buttocks, while the other attaches to the front part near the belt loop. The remaining ends go under each leg and over the shoulder straps, with all the straps secured tightly in place within your underwear.
E alcunas veguadas aquesta hernia es medicada artificialment am cauteri en loc de seccio am ferr; e es que tu prenguas cauteri cutellar subtil e que inscidas am aquel la codena dels ginitius, e es ignit segon que havem recomtat entro que sia descubert le ciphac blanc contenent la aygua, e lahoras tu pren cauteri segon aquesta forma: e es asemblat a letra grega.
And then pierce it with that probe, and apply heat until all moisture is driven out.
Then extend the probe with hooks, scrape it with hooks, and use a fine heated cautery; cut away as much as you can to eradicate everything, and be careful that the flesh is not touched by fire.
Know that this operation is safer and further from the risk of blood loss compared to incision.
If you encounter post-operative infection at the time of incision or cauterization, or experience excessive bleeding, it is incumbent upon you to address these complications as they arise and treat them with appropriate cures as outlined in this treatise.
If the patient is timid and cannot bear a second operation due to its severity, proceed with perforation as I advise here; this is when it has been confirmed, based on what we have discussed regarding the indications, that the hernia contains fluid.
Ensure the patient is positioned on an elevated surface; then make an incision in the lowest part of the abscess using a lateral spine spatula and adjust the length according to the size of their body.
And let the opening be wide enough that all water can flow out.
Then place your hand on the spot and let it be there, allowing the remaining water to flow out. And then treat that area until the plague is healed.
But if there is any obstruction to the evacuation of water at that moment, you should make an incision: this is not done except because the white fat in the orifice of the plague causes an obstruction and hinders the exit of the water; then it is necessary for you to introduce into the plague a feather or an instrument with which water is extracted from dropsy, the form of which is described previously; or apply to the orifice of the plague a small...
And know that the water returns and is added approximately six months later; and when it is added, then it should be punctured in the same way, for the patient will thus spend their days.
It seems that this indicates the end of this particular chapter or section of the treatise. Is there another passage you would like me to translate?
On the treatment of fleshy hernias and their cure."
Know that in the section concerning this hernia, there is fear of damage due to the major complications; therefore, in my opinion, it is better to dismiss him and save him from those dangers.
I recall the operation and the types of poultices used for abscesses.
So, I say that abscesses arise in parts of the body where there is a combination of humours and it occurs due to several causes: either due to an excess of acute acrid humour which spreads into the tissues, or as a result of trauma.
And the colour of the abscess matches that of the body part it appears on; there is little pain associated with it, and this type of abscess is considered severe.
A rare kind of abscess is the calcareous type, which appears dark in colour; it produces little sensation.
Sometimes abscesses occur due to blockage of the lymphatics and as a result of inflammation of those already affected, or even by inflammation of veins.
That which is due to the inflammation of lymphatics is recognised by dispersion of the abscess when you press it with your fingers, and you must not touch that.
Here is my translation of the provided text:
Here is the translation of the provided text:
Therefore, if the chicken has already been seasoned with those spices, you should remove it and insert it into...
And if there is an adhesion due to some damage in the region of the groin, or between what lies among the vessels, then you must release all that adhesion and make a round incision there.
But if there is an abnormal growth of flesh in the place where the adhesion is located and it is situated behind, then you must cut out all that belongs to it, and remove the chicken as we have mentioned before.
Once your operation is complete, fill the wound with wool soaked in rose oil and wine; then treat it with another remedy until it is healed.
Chapter 64.
On the treatment of inguinal hernia.
Inguinal hernia is an abscess enclosed by some wrapping resembling a sprout with softening of the testicles, and it makes exercise and walking difficult for the patient.
The treatment of this disease is done with fear, which precedes memory.
Empero cove que diguam opperacio en aquella segon que fero les primiers.
Here is the translation of the provided text:
And then make an incision with a thin sharp spatula by making a transverse section in the right of the vessels until the vessels are exposed.
And then carefully remove, as I have instructed you before, in an extraction of archery manner, those which are located on the temples.
And then place in those a needle with a double eye and tie it at the first place where you find blood, and tie the other end to the rear of the wound. And then make an incision in the middle of it with a straight section according to the length of the body and remove that which is attached by putrid and corrupted humours.
And then treat the plague with a cure for other similar cases to facilitate healing and ensure the vessels are not blocked by one of two genitals as it is not harmful.
However, if you see blood in all the vessels then ensure that the testicles are removed or that they along with the vessels are severed because they would be deprived of nourishment by cutting off the vessels and that it will stop them from being of use.
## Source Text Translation:
Of the treatment for intestinal hernia.
The occurrence of this hernia is due to a section that ends in the navel, extending over the abdomen from any part of the abdominal muscles, causing one or more intestines to emerge through this rupture.
This rupture can occur either at the navel or from a wound on it, and these two types happen for various reasons: due to impacts, jumps, sneezes, sudden lifting of heavy objects, or similar actions.
The sign of this hernia, when it occurs due to the navel's extension, is that it happens gradually over a long period and does not happen suddenly. There will be an abscess underneath before the navel, as the latter compresses the intestine.
The sign of this hernia is when it occurs due to the navel's section; at first, it causes sudden severe pain. There will be an abscess that appears under the wound, which is different from what appears around the navel itself and is caused by the intestine sticking out. Its appearance is outside the navel.
Sometimes it is necessary to remove the intestine from its tissue, and this type of hernia is called inguinal hernia.
Here is my translation of the provided text:
E en la curacio de las especias de aquesta malautia am ferr es temor, per que cove que sia esquivat le cazament en aquella.
And the way to perform this operation is as follows: instruct the patient to push their intestine back into its cavity with their hand by obeying its movement and direction, then place it on their neck between your hands, and lift their legs.
Then tie the cord that holds the scrotum at its divisions above, and cut through the spermatic cord entirely for its entire length; then place two hooks in the edges of the incision as needed to open the wound with them.
And if, according to the amount you think is appropriate, the wound from it has been made too wide.
Then peel back the skin of the penis below where it was tied up to the scrotum until its white hard glans are revealed.
Now insert your finger into what is below the testicle and above the white glans, that which is beneath where it was tied to the cord, and between the skin and search for any adhesions behind the testicle.
Then grasp the spermatic cord with your right hand and pull it outward, and stretch the white glans upward onto your left hand, then lift the testicle to where you made the incision; instruct your assistant to extend the testicle upwards while you dissolve what is behind with a complete solution.
And ask them to say that there is no cause of the hernia being wrapped in a hard white cloth. If you find any cause of obstruction in him, then you must remove it from his belly.
And now, make an incision in the area below the scrotum, cutting through to release blood and pus as we have described previously.
Then apply a cloth soaked in oil to the wound; place the bandage we have recommended (and sometimes a white cypress is cauterized as mentioned earlier after the incision, due to frequent bleeding issues) and allow the bandage to remain until it falls off on its own.
If the patient's condition persists for a long time, then warm water compresses should be applied and kept on the affected area until it subsides as we have explained.
Then treat the wound with another remedy for wounds until it is healed.
It seems that this text may be divided into chapters or sections, as indicated by the presence of "Capitol". If you provide me with more context or the full text, I can better understand its structure and assist you with any specific requests regarding translation or interpretation. Feel free to share additional information!
The provided phrase seems to be the title of this section, which could translate to "Of Hernia with a Ventral Herniotomy". However, without further context or additional sentences surrounding it, I cannot determine its meaning fully. If you have more information from this text, feel free to provide it so I can offer a more comprehensive translation and explanation!
In this type of hernia, I have not seen anyone being cured with the use of iron."
Here is my translation of the text:
And treat the plague as we have mentioned until it is healed.
Sorry, I'm not sure what you mean by "Capitol .lxvii.". Could you please provide more context or clarify your request?
On the incision made in the groin."
Alcunas veguadas endeve ruptura en les angonars ayssi cum havem dit, e emineys le loc.
And do not leave any cause for concern about hernias to the patient's relatives; if you do, it is minimal; and return their care back to them at all times.
If the condition persists for a long time, an opening develops in the inguinal canal as the hernia descends into it; this happens due to the extension of the canal which is located at an angle as we mentioned earlier, and the reason for this is that the canal has stretched, becoming softened, inflamed, and protruding.
And their treatment involves using the cautery as described earlier in the narrative.
In some cases, it can be treated with iron in this manner: the patient lies on their back with two servants holding their hands, and then they dry out the area of the rupture by cutting across the protruding abscesses with a three-fingered blade.
Then strengthen the white inguinal ligament which is below the groin so that it becomes uncovered.
Take some wax and place it over the protruding area of the inguinal canal, pressing it against the patient's abdomen.
And now press the two protruding places at the end of the shaft of the hyoid bone together, and draw them towards each other with a suture.
Then extract the end of the shaft without damaging the hyoid bone at all, do not extend the wound, and avoid any other cause as I have instructed you in the treatment of an intestinal hernia.
And now treat it like the healing of wounds, and when you open the abscesses to drain them, clean it and restore the wound before it is healed; because the hyoid bone is contracted and the swelling of the rupture is not removed.
Cauterization is better in this place, as it is closer to the health of the patient.
This indicates that this section or chapter is number 68 in the treatise. It helps to organize and structure the text, allowing for easy reference and navigation.
Regarding the softening of the scrotum."
Sometimes the cord connecting the testes in some men becomes softened because the surrounding flesh is also soft and relaxed, this state can be confirmed by examination.
It is necessary for the one who is treating him to make the patient lie down on his back and carefully draw out the entire softened cord onto the normal cord, then he must suture together the two edges.
And if you wish, stitch the initial excess of the softened cord with three or four stitches and secure the suture.
Then open the area between the sutures, and treat any other wounds until they are healed and the pus ceases to flow.
This indicates that this section is chapter 69 of the text.
The provided phrase, "De castratio," likely translates to "On Castration" in English. This suggests that Chapter 69 of this medieval medical treatise discusses the procedure of castration.
Be aware that castration is forbidden by our law, but due to the reason it has been brought to my attention and remembered in this book; its recollection is not necessary except for two purposes: one of which is so that when asked about it, the doctor may know how to treat someone who has undergone such a procedure; and the other purpose is that we have sometimes needed to castrate other animals like our lambs, as well as goats, pigs, and similar beasts.
And thus I say that castration is performed in two ways: either by attrition or by incision and section.
In the case of castration performed by attrition, the operation is carried out by submerging the animal in warm water until its testicles are softened and relaxed, allowing them to hang. Then take those (testicles) with your hand while they are relaxed and do not show any sign of being touched.
As for castration performed by incision and section, you should hold the animal firmly and press its testicles with your left hand.
Then tie the scrotum with a ligature, and make an incision over each testicle, ensuring that both testicles are exposed.
Afterward, cut those (testicles) again so they are thoroughly removed. Do not leave any part of the membrane on them (testicles), except for the delicate one that lies over the veins.
This method of castration (by attrition) is better than the other, as it strongly affects the testicles and leaves little room for the animal to recover its fertility.
E aprop cura la plagua entro que sia sanada.
Here is my best attempt at translating each line into English:
De la cura de hermafrodozia."
Hermaphroditism in men occurs in two ways: one is when it appears in the area where there is space for testicles, in that region between two testicles a female figure emerges with hair on it.
And sometimes, from that region where urine flows in the area of the testicles.
However, in women, it is a different case: the woman's vulva, which is located above the anus, resembles two testicles of a man but somewhat diminished and protruding outward like the foreskin of a male and two testicles.
The treatment has three variations, two for men, one for women. It is necessary that you suture those adjusted tissues so as to prevent the flow of bile from it and then treat them with a cure for other wounds.
In the second variation of men's cases where urine flows in the area of the testicles, there is neither a cure nor an operation for him.
Chapter 21.
On lymphedema and protruding flesh caused by diseases of women.
Lentige fort leu es ajustada sobre causas naturals entro que es etressat e es fayt leg le reguardament; e alcunas veguadas es magnificada en alcunas femnas en tant entro que es spandit ayssi cum en les homes e perve entro al coito.
Adonc cove que tu tenguas la superfluitat de lentinge am la tua ma o am unci e inscidas.
And do not finally make an incision, especially in the area of the temple, for fear that it might cause a flow of blood.
Then take care of those wounds with proper wound care until they heal.
Flesh that is born in the womb of its mother and does not fill it but lies there like a tail (and thus some call this illness 'tail disease') should be treated by excising it as we excise warts, and treating it until it heals.
The number 72 in Latin is "LXXII". Would you like me to translate this into another language?
On the treatment of erysipelas.
Erysipelas is when the woman's hymen is not perforated or has only a small opening. And it occurs either naturally or accidentally.
It occurs accidentally due to an illness that has preceded it, or is caused by flesh not being suitably adjusted or a thin and delicate membrane.
It is found either in the head of the fetus, or on its sides, or in its upper part, or in its lower part; and it forbids cutting, pricking, and birthing, and especially it forbids menstruating women.
Here is the translation of the provided text:
If the obstruction is caused by a thin membrane and it is located near the two lips (of the vagina), you should treat it by breaking and removing this membrane.
And if you place poultices on the two lips (of the vagina), then put your aforementioned index fingers of both hands above them.
Have the woman lie on her back with her thighs extended, and then stretch the two lips (of the vagina) forcefully so that the thin membrane is ruptured and the obstruction is opened.
Then take wool, soak it in oil, and place it on the affected area; have a man come every day to check that the incision site is not becoming hardened.
But if the membrane is thick and tough, you should consider incising it with a wide spatula or a myrtle leaf.
If the obstruction is caused by flesh (tissue growth), you should tie it up with a thread and then make an incision in it.
And if you have medicines that can stop the flow of blood without a bite (i.e., for open wounds), such as achillea, dragon's blood, and galbanum, mix them with egg white.
And then administer a wide lead cannula so that the plague is not lightly consolidated.
Keep it like this for a few days, and administer powder of lead to him/her.
And then it will be cured with another consolidation cure until complete healing is achieved.
And sometimes it happens in the mother's womb where other flesh grows, and then you must incise according to this method. But if this is due to pus in the head, ensure that there is no opposition to iron being used for the mother's condition.
It appears you have included a new section or chapter title, denoted as Chapter LXXIII (73). Is there another text portion you would like me to translate and interpret?
On the treatment of hemorrhoids, tailbone pain, and red bumps that occur in women's intimate areas.
Hemorrhoids are understood to be from small veins around the anus, where there is continuous bleeding from those veins over time and then lumps form.
And I have already mentioned in this section the different types of illnesses and their symptoms, and now I will speak about those that can be cured and those that cannot.
Therefore, I say that hemorrhoids and tumors when located deep within the abdomen and are not apparent to the touch, in such cases iron-based treatments should not be used.
However, those that are located near the surface of the abdomen and can be felt with touch, these can be successfully cured.
And when you put the woman in a warm bath and then stretch out her body using forceps or rough cloth, cut those hemorrhoids with scissors.
Then sprinkle upon the hemorrhoids some of the blood from one of these powders that have been cut by biting them, such as acacia and similar ones.
And immerse her feet for an hour, then place them in cold water.
And if the bleeding persists, then give them a decoction of pomegranate peels and skins of quinces and similar fruits.
And then take barley flour and mix it with honey and sour wine, make a poultice with this, and apply it to their back.
If the blood is flowing (from the wound), it's good; if not, attach two cups to either side of the patient and perform cupping at the breasts.
Then take wool and soak it in coriander juice, or juniper berry juice, or rue with vinegar, apply this to the wound, and treat it with ointment until healed.
And treat it with ointment until healed.
The information you have provided is already in the form of chapter titles, so I will keep them as they are:
Here is my translation of your provided text:
Here is the translation of the provided text: And I have already mentioned these illnesses and their types as well as symptoms, and their treatments in this section.
Now, let me tell you about the treatment of abscesses that occur in the breast, which are easily curable with surgery if you wish to know how it is performed.
So, you must consider that if the pain of the abscess in its early stage is sharp with a percussion feeling and phlegm, along with fever, redness, and a pulsating sensation when touched, then do not attempt to pierce it, but treat it with remedies that aid in maturation until the severity of these symptoms subsides.
And then you should make the woman lie on her back with two pillows; recline her body backwards and bend her legs at the part below the belly button, keeping her thighs apart, place her arms beneath her buttocks, and tie each of these positions securely with suitable straps.
Then the midwife should approach from the right side and use the tool to open the breast's nipple area in a way that suits the specific cause.
And now, when you want to administer this instrument, make sure that the tip of the tool reaches the mother's womb, and do not let anything from the tool enter into the womb more than necessary so as to avoid harming both the mother and the patient. If the tool is larger than the opening of the womb, then you must apply powders to the edges of the mother's womb opening so that it prevents any further entry of tools into the womb.
Make sure to attach the rope that runs through the tool from above, and have the minister hold the tool while turning the rope until the opening of the mother's womb is reached.
Once the opening appears, and it is touched by hand and found to be soft and moist, then you must dry that area with a flat-headed spatula.
When the blood is evacuated, you must apply to the wound a sponge soaked in rose oil or green oil which has some styptic properties; place the callus at the section inside the mother's womb.
Remove the mother outside and place over her abdomen a clean cloth soaked in water with boiled mallows.
And then she was cured after two days with an ointment that is suitable for this condition until it healed.
Sometimes, the mother and child are washed with a mixture of water and honey so that it crystallizes, then they are bathed in water boiled with iris roots or long wormwood, and finally, return to the ointment.
And if the infection is inside the mother's womb, then you must be aware that you are prohibited from curing him with iron, instead treating it with what we have previously mentioned in this section.
It seems like the text you provided contains the full translation of the original medieval medical treatise. Would you like me to summarize it or extract specific information from it?
To teach midwives how newborns should be treated when they are born in an unnatural position.
It is essential for the midwife to recognize the signs of a natural childbirth at its beginning; when you see the woman pushing with her hands and feet and smelling the air around her, and when she is assisted by something that comes out over her body due to the pressure from above, and then the baby quickly emerges headfirst, you will know it's a normal delivery. This can also occur secondarily through the umbilical cord or suspended at that point.
Therefore, when you see these signs, ensure that the patient's belly is compressed so that the embryo descends lightly and does not fall onto its head, thus avoiding the occurrence of second-trimester miscarriage, and it should be cleaned thoroughly to remove any superfluous matter.
If any of these parts are found to be unnatural and unrecognizable, such as when the embryo is seen with feet but its body faces its head, or one of its hands appears on its foot, or its head and a hand appear together, or on its belly; if it is turned violently onto its back, and resembles any of these unviable figures.
It is necessary for the midwife to be knowledgeable and discerning in all these matters, and to protect herself from errors or deception.
I am illustrating all these figures for you, showing their construction and what they mean in this context.
When the fetus is born headfirst through natural delivery and the process puts excessive strain on the woman or makes it difficult for her to give birth; when you see that her strength is already depleted, then perform a cesarean section if she wishes, and relieve its pain with fenugreek poultice and warm oils.
And then insert the meter between their said small spatum and cut it with that second knife or squeeze it with your nail until all moisture is out of it. Press the woman's belly so that the fetus descends.
But if it does not descend, then ensure that the woman is cleansed with a poultice of horsehair and fenugreek seeds.
And then command him to be cleansed and do so by making him sneeze with incense; close his mouth and nose for an hour, as the fetus will exit shortly.
And if the two hands of the fetus are protruding at first, you must reduce them gradually with gentle force. But if it does not obey during the delivery process, place the woman on a chair and lift her legs up; then move the chair over the ground; the woman must be held so she doesn't fall due to the movement.
And if the hands are not turned inward and the fetus dies, cut those open and extract its remains or tie the body to her hand with a cloth and pull it out equally, as it will exit shortly.
When the patient is placed on their feet, you must push them upwards and then turn the body to face downward, then fold his legs together, and gradually stretch one of his legs out.
Once you have positioned them between their legs, you should command the patient to exert pressure and make themselves sneeze with this condition, for it will be forgotten if God wills it so.
And if it is not forgotten with what we have recounted so far, you should gradually return the body to its normal position until you place them according to their natural figure, for then it will be forgotten with a light movement.
And if all that we have recounted is forbidden, then take a mixture of alum and dissolved gum, mix it well in the mortar with good percussion, and apply this to the woman's vulva, at the lower part of the patient's abdomen. Then make her sit in cold water until she reaches the hypochondriac regions (upper abdomen).
And when you see that the affected parts of their body are hardened, fumigate her with myrtle and let her rest under it. Here is my translation of the given text:
Observation of the lateral fact during one of her hands. Carefully reduce the patient's arm, but if you cannot do so, then lift the woman and make her move.
And if he cannot walk, then make him lie down on the bed, and shake his legs vigorously with a violent jolt, and then administer gently the foods which I have previously mentioned as being soft and moist.
And if childbirth has occurred, then make her lie down on the pillow, and then carefully study how to reduce the hand, guide the baby according to its natural shape, and make the woman sneeze and command her to push it out herself.
The position of the baby, with its arms extended and its cloth over it, is at the breast of her mother. Let the midwife hold the baby's hand and gently turn it little by little, making it easier for them.
And when it is formed and how much has been softened, then place on its head what we have recommended before regarding oil and moist substances.
Then command her to moan gently little by little, and when you have done that, make her lie down on the pillow again and instruct her to lean towards her right side, then tell her to push while sneezing. Exitus foetus praeparati super latus."
When you see the horrible mother [of sores] according to this manner, consider, and then you insert your fingernail until it is evacuated of humidity.
And if the growth is suspended on their face or neck, then you insert your fingernail into their navel so that it is not retained and causes death.
Then you use the growth to make pills with the material inside until it is covered, and tell the woman [patient] to press them several times, and the wretch will be expelled with a light discharge, if God wills it.
The birth of twins or many fetuses. Know that twins are born from the same egg, and sometimes even three or four, but this is strange and rarely happens; their causes were natural, but they did not live.
And for these, even if they are multiplied, a fingernail is used, and they are separated by the tip; you can distinguish them between the ligament in each of their navels. Sometimes they were expelled like this with a light discharge, and sometimes through an unmentionable discharge as we have described.
And if some of them have difficulty giving birth and it leads to what we mentioned before about unnatural positions, then you should treat them as described earlier.
And if the midwife is skilled and does what makes it easier, more subtle, and slows things down, let her be ingenious according to every position as it presents itself in the process of birth to ensure a healthy outcome.
A reminder of what happens during embryonic development in the womb, and when there is an abortion.
Some fetuses are formed in the womb as one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, or even ten at once! I have personally witnessed a woman aborting six of them and another ten altogether; this is due to the measurement miscalculation made by those gloriously wise physicians.
And all of this is part of the midwife's knowledge as she approaches that tiny being with great care and caution.
The text refers to chapter 76, which seems to be missing from this treatise or has not been included in the prompt. Is there another part of the text that you would like me to translate?
When it is necessary to extract the fetus after death.
When you treat the dead fetus using the methods mentioned in the section on medication and if it is not successful, and you are forced to use manual operation, it is necessary to consider whether the woman has a healthy constitution and is free from any conditions that could lead to complications.
Then ensure that the woman is laid on her back with a pillow under her head and her thighs elevated.
The minister should hold one of her legs or have it tied down to prevent the body from extending during the extraction of the fetus.
Then you should moisten the mother's mouth with moist oils and a mucilage made from marshmallow, fenugreek, and flax seeds.
The midwife should then anoint her hand with those oils and mucilage, and carefully insert her hand into the mother's body, seeking to locate where the feet are positioned in the fetus.
These are the appropriate places to consider: If the fetus is positioned with its head down, then you should grasp it by the feet, or the neck, or the mouth, or the palate, or under the beard, or at the fork of its body, or in the deeper regions near the ribs, or below the hypochondrium.
But if the descent is over his feet, then on the perineum, or in the middle of his back.
And whoever has the thumb of their right hand should place its curve in the area that is between the aforementioned fingers of the left hand and introduce the hand with ease until they reach the diseased spot.
Then place and keep another thumb or the third one if necessary in the patient's position to ensure that it is attracted evenly and not just extended according to its straightness.
It must be tightly held from all sides for its excretion to become easier like when they extract the root of a tooth.
And ensure that whatever has been extracted is relaxed; and if any part of it remains, the midwife should lubricate her instruments with oil and expertly introduce them to bring out what is retained.
Therefore if the part of the fetus is forgotten, then swap thumbs to whatever place is higher and do so until the entire fetus has been extracted.
Here is the translation of the first sentence you provided:
And do likewise with the other arm and both feet.
But if the child's head is large, or it happens that there is compression during delivery, or there is water in the baby's head, then you should insert something between the said spine bones and break the head to extract the water, or you can use an instrument called an 'alundat', which will be described along with other instruments in the next chapter.
Similarly, do this if the child has a large head by nature: then you should cut it with scissors or take hold of it with an 'alundat' as we have said; and then extract the bones using forceps.
And if the head has been delivered but is compressed at the neck, you should cut the ligament; then it must be split so that the moisture in the cord can drain out.
But if it is not complicated nor hinders delivery, then you should cut the head as soon as you can.
And if the uterus has become inflamed or there is dropsy in it, then you should pierce this until all the moisture inside is drained.
If the delivery is taking place on her feet, then her traction will be light and her direction towards the mother's mouth will be gentle.
But if the infant's belly and feet are pinched, you must extract it with a cloth that you have wrapped around your hand, extracting the belly and feet until whatever is inside comes out.
But if the other limbs remain and only the head comes out, then the midwife should insert her left hand; but if the mother's mouth is open, she should place her hand in front of it, grasp the child's head with those hands, and pull it towards the mother's mouth using one or two fingers.
And if the mother's mouth is closed due to an abscess that has occurred in her, then it should not be forced open; instead, one must ensure the administration of a flow of fatty, moist substances. Apply poultices; then follow up with the patient in moistening, softening waters.
And if the child is lying on its side, it should be pierced (if possible): administer what we have said for a live birth.
And if it is not possible, then it should be cut into pieces and extracted.
Make sure you do not leave any residue inside the wound.
And once you have completed the entire procedure, then administer what we've discussed for the treatment of abscesses that occur due to childbirth.
If there is any bleeding, apply styptic waters to it and administer the other treatment.
I have seen a woman whose fetus was dead in her womb, and another pregnant woman was placed over that fire, resulting in the death of the other fetus as well. There was another case where a woman had an abscess in her navel for a long time; it became inflamed and opened up like a fire, and she started shaking her arms.
I was called to treat her, and I medicated her for a long time, but the wound did not heal.
So I applied strong adhesive plasters over her, and I extracted a bone from her, then waited for some days and extracted another one; I was too amazed because there are no bones in the abdomen.
And then I realized that it was due to the bones of the dead fetus.
Therefore, I examined the plague and removed many bones from him, as the woman was in her last months of pregnancy, and she had been living like this for a long time, carrying a little one with her.
And I did not find this strange, but rather it is a matter of science and an aid for the skilled doctor to have his hand in administering the cure.
Regarding the shape of the instruments that are required to extract the fetus,
The shape of the speculum with which the mother is opened:
This is the shape of the forceps in which the books are fixed, with two specula at both ends of two arms. However, this speculum should be more slender in size and made either of ivory or wooden material.
And let the width of each arm be two fingers wide and the margin on both sides be one finger in width; the length of each should be a palm and half, while at the midpoint of both arms there are two adjustments for introducing an intermediate piece that is already firmly attached to them, with its length being half a palm plus slightly more, and a width of about two fingers or a little bit wider.
And these two additives should be inserted into the mother's mouth so that it can be opened with them when you turn the two prescribed virtues.
Another form similar to this, but much finer and lighter:
It is made of ivory wood or boxwood, depending on the resemblance to forceps. However, at each of its two ends there are also small spikes, and the length of these spikes is about one palm-width, while their width is approximately two fingers.
And when you want to open the mother with these, place her on a bed with her feet hanging over the edge, opening what is between her thighs. Then, with your hand, operate the instrument like you would a pair of scissors, according to how much you want to open the mother's mouth until the midwife can perform her task.
The form of virtue which the ancients called:
Form of the impulse by which the fetus is propelled.
Forma de amisidat2 am le qual es conterit le cap gran.
And it is assembled with forceps, which has teeth at the end, sometimes, and in some cases, it is made long like a pair of forceps following this pattern, sometimes having teeth like chisel teeth which are incised and crushed. Shape of the instrument with few parts:
Shape of a hook having a spine:
Shape of a hook having two spines:
Shape of the spatula having two ends, whose head is cut off:
Shape of two spatulas with wide blades:
All these instruments are used by practitioners and when the types of instruments increase in number and are prepared by craftsmen, it becomes easier to operate on patients and more people can be treated due to their abundance.
And do not refrain from using these instruments for any reason because their necessity cannot be dismissed.
De extraccio de la segondina translates to "On extracting the newborn" or "Removal of the newborn." It seems you've provided a medieval medical text describing various treatments and procedures, so this line likely introduces a section dedicated to childbirth or neonatal care.
This line can be translated as: "When the newborn is retained during childbirth, you should instruct the patient to hold her breath and then make her sneeze under certain conditions; press your hand over her mouth and nose, and if it emerges due to this, so be it."
Here is my translation of the provided text: All these herbs or some of them should be submerged in water and placed over the fire.
Then place a reed cannula in the mother's mouth and keep it there until the vapor reaches the mother's cavity.
Make her sneeze as we have mentioned before, and the second child will be quickly pushed out.
But if this treatment remains unchanged and there is no progress, you should instruct the midwife to immerse her left hand in sesame oil or marshmallow broth, then insert it into the birth canal and extract the second child with it; once she has found it, gently take it out little by little. If the child gets stuck at the mother's pubic bone, insert your hand as previously instructed, locate the child and remove it gradually according to what we have outlined so that the mother does not succumb to violent traction. Soon after, it should be turned over onto its right and left sides with ease.
And if the mouth of the wound is constricted, we have already counted on healing it with a sneezing cure and herbal medication.
But if you do not forget all the causes we have mentioned earlier, then be careful not to fatigue yourself with that in abstract iteration, but instead cover what is protruding from it at the mouth of the wound with a piece of linen cloth and apply ointment and tetrafarmacon to it; for this will cause it to rot after some days and become dissolved and forgotten.
But when you return, a great deal of bad odor rises to the head and stomach, which injures the patient; therefore, it is necessary that fumigations be administered and whatever else may be appropriate.
But some of the Ancients have already experimented with fumigations of nutmeg and dried figs.
The form of the fumigating instrument for which a woman is to be fumigated should be retained in case of menstrual disorders and secondary diseases:
It may be made of glass or bronze.
And place the narrow end in the bell and the wide end over the fire, and let the smoke be placed over the embers of the fire.
Hold it until that smoke is consumed, then repeat the process with another.
For curing the non-perforated anus of an infant:
When infants are born and their anuses are not perforated, which is usually the case with thin and delicate babies, In that case, call for the midwife to perforate their anus with her own finger; otherwise, perforate it yourself with a sharp spatula, being careful not to touch the intestine.
Then place on it wool soaked in wine and oil, then treat it with ointment until it is healed.
If you fear it is delicate, then insert a cannula into the perforation for several days, and remove it when the infant wants to defecate.
And it has happened that the anus became obstructed due to a blood clot or abscess; then one must incise this obstruction and treat it with what we have said regarding curing with lead.
De curacio de las fistulas que endeveno dejos."
Las fistulas que endeveno en la partida dejos pus bassa so nodacio e grossetut las quals endeveno prop del cul defora o en l’espazi de the una partida.: The fistulas that develop in this area produce low-level discharge, becoming harder and larger; they often occur near the anus on the outside or within the anal cavity.
E es una fistula o motas: And this is either a fistula or moles.
E cum aquella nodacio es antiquada e corr de la humiditat aygosa blanca o poyridura subtil, e alcunas veguadas so de aquestas fistulas alcunas penetrantz: And when this discharge is old and runs with white watery humour or thin pus, sometimes some of these fistulas can be found penetrating.
E aquelas penetrantz so conogudas per aquo que es eyssit de aquellas per la egressio e per ventositat; e alcunas vetz use le malaute de egressio, e fort leu es eyssit de aquellas verm.: And those penetrating ones are known for what comes out of them through the exit and windiness; sometimes the patient uses the term exit, and rarely they may be seen to contain worms.
E so de aquellas fistulas alcunas veguadas en l'espazi penetrant entro la vesica, e entro al meato de la verga; e so de aquellas penetrants entro la junctura de la coxa e entro al gluteo de la nalga.: And some of these fistulas are seen to penetrate into the bladder and urethra; others go through the hip joint and into the buttock.
Here is the translation of your source sentence:
Mays si en aquella es turtuositat, lahoras entromet en aquella tenta subtil de plom o de pels de caval entro que tu sentas la tenta o le pel en le tieu dit.
Here is the translation of the provided text:
Here is the translation of your provided text:
Certainly, I will continue translating the medieval medical text into English line by line:
And in all those fistulas, it is not a complete cure as their treatment involves hard work and the foolishness of doctors on whom you depend.
But in those cases where the fistula is not deep and is recent, you can expect healing with iron treatment as I have recommended to you and tried before.
And when the patient yawns and stretches his arms above him while raising his legs towards himself, with his thighs inclined to his belly, then you should insert a leaden or silver probe (if it is in an angled fistula) into the place where the probe will pass.
And if the patient feels pain around the anus, you should insert your finger into their anus.
And if you feel with your finger that the probe has already penetrated and is uncovered, something else that you feel between your finger and the siphon or flesh, then know for certain that it is a deep fistula; therefore, do not treat this case as there is no cure in such cases, just as we have mentioned.
But some may say that it heals slowly in some people.
Here is my attempt at translating the provided text:
And now treat her with ointments wrapped in wool so that all the attached flesh does not fall off and then apply healing and consolidating medicines to the flesh, if it is healed, well enough; otherwise, it will never heal with any other treatment.
And if the probe goes in but does not penetrate all of your finger which is inside the anus and between it and the probe there seems to be a thin layer of flesh or membrane, sometimes even a fistula at that level like that surface of the coin then dry out the area from where the fistula starts and after you dry out the probe, it remains in the fistula until the section reaches the place where the tip of the probe stops and by means of the probe is released and captured.
Then clean those fistulated flesh that are gathered like a bird's feather quill, and leave nothing behind.
But if during your operation a rush of blood comes between you and the patient's flesh then choose the mildest cautery instrument, either fire or sharp medicine because a fire cauterization has two good effects: it coagulates the adjusted flesh and dries up excessive fluids.
E aprop cura aquella am calguas envolopadas en boder o en caus trissat entro que·l loc geta brac, e aprop lahoras cura la plagua am enguentz carn dura engendran e consolidan."
And there are medicines in which there is astringency and excision; once this has been restored, it is already healed, and you do not fear its recurrence.
But if the fistula has already perforated the membrane of the anus and is elongated on the surface of the body, then insert your finger into the anus and examine it.
And so if you cut the wound and find that it is covered by a membrane or flesh, and is close to being healed, then there is no need for surgery but rather trust and hope in its recovery.
Which can be treated in three ways: by cauterizing it as we have mentioned; by cutting into the wound to reach its cavity so that you may insert a needle and promote healing; without performing an incision so as not to damage the muscle containing the bowel, acting only with the patient's consent; and then treat them according to what has been said before since their condition will improve quickly; or by extending this membrane and draining any pus from the wound near the anus, as we have described, either using a probe or another sharp instrument, and then cleaning the infected flesh that is in the section of the fistula which you can perforate; and finally try to repair all the damage with incisions, and if the outer orifice is not consolidated, and the fistula remains open at the edge of the anus, it will be less burdensome for the patient. E alscunas veguadas la fistula es finida segon aquesta manieyra: es quan tu entrometas la tenta en la fistula, e es en le latz del cul entorn la superficia del cos am la codena e en le marge del cul, lahoras pren tenta de perforada extremitat, que es ayssi cum agulha de preparantz les coers segon aquesta forma:
And insert into that a bag filled with hay or around those; then insert your hand into the fistula until you reach their cavity.
If it penetrates into the margin of the anus from within, then you extract the hay bag from there as you insert your finger into the anus; you pull out the end of the bag and tie both ends together, tightening each one, and leave this for a day or two. When you further insert the bag into the flesh, tighten it so that those pieces of flesh which are between the two ends of the bag and hanging down are caught.
Then treat the wound so that it is consolidated and healed.
If the orifice of the fistula is not penetrating, then make it penetrate in any way you can prepare it, but do not put it into the rectum, as this is not for you to do lest you injure the rectum; and then treat it so that it is healed.
The shape of the spine of a sharp object used to open the fistula is split in two: one part being very curved and pointed, while the other part is not as sharp, so that you do not injure what is unnecessary at times.
De sutura de emorroydas en las quals corra sanc en la inscizio de aquellas.
Emorroydas can manifest in two ways; one is where they appear around the anus like coals, or they may be similar to grape seed oil. These hemorrhoids can be small or large, and the blood flows from them constantly; they are either numerous or single, located outside the anus, and found in the extremities as well.
However, those hemorrhoids that are outside the anus have less moisture and discharge a small amount of yellow water or blood continuously, matching the colour of the body.
To cure the hemorrhoids that are inside the anus, instruct the patient to sit and apply pressure within the anal area until the hemorrhoids become visible. Then cauterize them with hooks or grasp them with your nail, and cut off their roots.
If the hooks cannot hold onto them due to their moisture and softness, take a rough cloth, cotton, or woolen rag, remove them with your aforementioned instruments, then cut off their roots and apply some suitable powder post-excision in lieu of cautery; or cauterize them as previously mentioned in the chapter on cautery. And then cure those with another treatment until they are healed.
And if the fistula does not respond to treatment, then cauterize the patient with a small cautery, and wash it with water from the rear which facilitates discharge when the patient is squeezed gently.
But if the hemorrhoids are outside the anus, then their cause is minor, and you can take them with your nail or a hook, pulling them out, and then treat them as we have described until they are healed.
For those whom you wish to treat with incision, you must provide sutures for them in this manner: take a threaded needle and pass it through the hemorrhoid from one side to the other, then wrap both ends of the thread around the area below the needle, placing it latitudinally; pull the hemorrhoid tightly with the thread, and then knot the thread and remove the needle.
Do this to all, leaving one unstitched so that the excess blood can drain from it.
And then place on the buttocks a cloth soaked in rose oil or ointment; put it over their hips and tell the patient to rest. Then leave them like that for as long as it takes (for the disease to subside), and when it has happened, treat any resulting inflammations with ointments or other cures until they are healed.
And since they are outdated and have no place in modern medicine, you should remove them with a spatula point or your nail, keeping them moist and covering them with a poultice to prevent consolidation; then treat until they are consolidated.
Then you close them with stitches as tight as the first ones, which caused bleeding and were excoriated; then treat until they are healed.
Remember that the medicine is crucial, and it is nothing more than round nuts according to the color of the body resembling a clover head; they are found throughout the body but especially in the areas below the feet and the said joints, which should be massaged for pain.
Certainly! Here's the translation of your provided text into English:
And if you wish, cauterize it according to what has been previously mentioned in this chapter.
Warts are small, rough, pitted elevations on the surface of the body, and they commonly appear in children.
To cure them, you should either extend and press it or puncture it with a needle or a hair that is inserted into the wart. And if you want to, you can cauterize it as we have mentioned earlier with fire or a sharp medicine.
A mosquito bump is a small, soft, or pitted elevation on the surface of the body that appears everywhere on the body, and when one touches it, they feel something like the bite of a mosquito, and it's caused by an insect.
To cure it, take a quill from an owl or an eagle, let it be firm, and place it on the mosquito over its head so that it is contained within the circle of the quill's opening; then, turn your hand with the quill until you have scraped what is inside the mosquito's ring, placed it into the flesh, and eradicated the mosquito from its root.
And if you wish, make this with a cannula of horn or iron according to this form:
Make the upper part of the cannula thin, unpierced, and wrapped so that its appearance on the finger is smoothed and concealed.
And if you wish to cauterize the ant (a type of skin lesion), do so as previously mentioned in the chapter on cauterization for hernias.
Regarding the instruments that are used to administer this treatment:
Sometimes cauteries are made of silver, copper, or melted and hammered horn; sometimes they are made in small and large sizes depending on their use, with the one used for treating small children being small; and those that are to be used on tender or sensitive areas should have small cauteries.
The shape of the large and medium-sized cautery:
The head of the upper cannula, to which the bladder is tied, should be broad like this; and there should be a distinct mark where the bladder is tied, so that it can be recognized.
Under the patient's genitals, which are inserted into the anus and should be thoroughly covered (as this area is not open), apply a large soft lion. On one side of it, make two incisions with a fine blade, on the other only one; the size of the incision should correspond to the thickness of their thighs, but somewhat smaller.
And the bag containing medicines made from animal bladder or sheepskin should be placed here, and its width should be one palm length.
It should be pierced with many small holes like a sieve, and the distance between these holes should be equal to the thickness of one finger.
Then insert into these holes strong gall from raw bile, about ten galls or so, and attach the bag to it. Once the bag is placed on him, tighten its head at the top of the crucifix between two distinct points with great constriction; then crystallize each hole with this. Know that the quality of this crystallization lies in filling the bag with medicine heated according to the patient's tolerance; be careful not to make it too hot or too cold.
Then the patient should be turned onto their stomach, and you must lift their legs above them and place under them either some hay or a mattress; then grease the end of the cautery with oil or hen albumen or fenugreek mucus or something similar. The minister then inserts this into the anus easily, takes the bag in both hands and squeezes it vigorously so as to evacuate into the intestine all that is inside the crucifix; he then removes the crucifix and helps the patient lift their legs against the wall.
Under these circumstances, let him remain as long as he can bear it, and if he sleeps all night, it is of greater benefit afterward.
If you successfully treat the patient's abdominal disorders and discharge, then repeat the cautery until they are healed.
And if there are painful hemorrhoids or abscesses in the anus, then use a gentle and mild caustic, similar to those used for children's wounds.
On the treatment of ulcers:
I have already mentioned in the section on treating ulcers what is suitable for this book, and now I will describe the treatment of those with severe conditions using medications according to their nature.
Therefore, I state that ulcers are diverse depending on what causes them and the location where they appear.
The causes for which sometimes ulcers are formed include a stone strike, or an incision from a sword or knife, or a blow with a lance, a stick, an arrow, or something similar to these causes.
Here is my translation of the provided text:
And I will recount the cure for certain ulcers (wounds) so that you may apply this reasoning and rule to other similar cases.
I will begin with simple head wounds; the recollection of compound ones shall come at the start of the third chapter.
Therefore, understand that when a simple wound occurs on the head and there is no fracture, consider: if it was caused by a blow from a stone or something similar, and the skin has only been slightly broken but the wound is large, and you fear the development of an enclosed abscess in said patient. Then you should cauterize (burn) and bloodlet the cephalic vein immediately; do not delay this action! Extract some blood from them according to their bodily constitution if there are no other reasons that would prohibit such a bloodletting act, especially so when little blood flows out of the wound itself.
And this bloodletting should be the contrary action of treating a wound that is infected (or "parted"); protect said patient from thick soups and strong wines.
But if any cause prohibits the aforementioned bloodletting action (due to a more severe wound), then said patient should consume less food and not approach meat nor strong wine.
And place on the wound, if it happens that an abscess is produced, cotton soaked in rose oil alone or wine in which styptic has been dissolved.
But if you are sure that the abscess is formed, then place on the wound, if it's fresh and the blood and air have not yet changed, this powder which I shall now briefly recommend.
And if the air has already changed there, then place on some ointment until it is healed.
But if the wound is large or it has been made with a knife and similar instruments, and its lips are not close enough together for stitches, then bring those lips closer together with stitches as I will now recommend for this type of suture.
But if the wound has already exposed bone and tendon, and it is not just a slight injury but rather a serious one, then make an incision there and then cure the wound with medicines and restore the flesh to its place instead of sewing it up, and command the patient to eat food in which there are coarse things: cabbage and the like, and similar substances, until he is cured.
And if both the sewn area becomes putrid and does not stick to the bone, then you remove all that which is rotten and throw it away, and then cure this.

And then squeeze that one with the powders and release it, and do not untie it while it is like this so that the medicine is not removed from him before he is healed.
And sometimes you do this with only the cautery, when there is no turpentine or dragon's blood present.
And you perform this surgical operation on large wounds when it is appropriate to place them in tension and they are fresh with their blood, which has not been altered by the air.
And if the air has altered them, especially during summer time, then it is not appropriate to apply this powder, but rather treat them with what we have previously mentioned, and place on them some digestive ointments, or a paste of barley flour with water and honey until they show no more inflammation; then treat them with another cure until they are healed.
But if it happens with a bone fracture wound, and the wound is small, then you must remove the piece with your fingers.
And I will tell the cure for fractures of the skull, which is venomous.

If an artery has already been incised in the wound and there is a flow of blood, then either separate it or tie it off with ligature, or cauterize it if necessity calls for this.
But if you have already excised the vertebrae of the neck along with it and saved the veins in the region, then adjust the edges of the wound using sutures over the canal of the spinal cord and do not touch that; first equalize this [the wound] and reduce it back to its natural shape, then strengthen it using a decent bandage, and leave it for a few days; afterwards treat it with ointments containing astringents until it is healed.
But if the wound has already caused damage to the bone, then strike it with a [hammer or similar tool], and afterwards extract any fragments of bone that you can; as for what is not accessible to you, leave this until the wound becomes gangrenous, then separate it and alleviate its exudation.
And if the wound is fresh, then sprinkle upon it the powder that has been recommended to you. But if a fistula has formed in the wound, then treat it with something that will be recalled to you later in this very chapter.
Here is the translation of your first source sentence:

Here is my translation of the provided text:
But if three days or more have passed since the plague and the patient does not experience spasms, tremors of the heart, extreme pain, nor a constriction in his stomach, and all other symptoms are positive, then know that it is a light case; and so cure it with calamine and the other cures until they are healed.
But if the healing is delayed, and it has been open for a long time, then know that it has become a fistula; therefore cure it according to its type.
And if the plague is caused by a deep wound or a cut, and it is simple on the surface of the foot or back, then treat it with what is typically used for suture, if it is large, or with powder, if it is small.
But if there is damage to the bone and you have cut away pieces from it, then turn over the wound and attempt to extract those pieces, provided they are separate. But if they are not separate, leave them in place until the wound has hardened, which will make their removal easier.
And for other wounds that occur in other body parts, the method of healing is the same as what we have described.
De las plaguas del ventre translates to "Regarding the illnesses of the abdomen.
The discomfort that occurs in the abdomen can be severe, mild, or moderate.
A minor disruption is managed differently and requires careful consideration as the reduction of its size becomes challenging without immediate attention to returning it to its original place, as the opening may enlarge and become thickened, making reinsertion difficult.
Therefore, the best type of disruption is moderate, as it does not present difficulties in reducing the intestine back to its normal size, unlike the challenges encountered in both severe and minor cases.
Be aware that the stitching of the abdomen can be done in four different ways, but two of these techniques are commonly used and applicable to other parts of the body as well.
The other two specialized stitching methods are more versatile and applicable to various ailments, but they are specifically designed for abdominal suturing.
And I recommend that you give an explanation and clarification of each.
Therefore, when the hernia is small and there seems to be some cause for it, and it becomes difficult to reduce it back into place, this occurs in one of two ways: either due to the size of the rupture as we have mentioned earlier, or when the hernia has become inflamed due to the coldness of the air.
And so when this is the case, it is necessary for you to apply a poultice in such a way that you submerge a sponge or cloth damp with only tepid water, or one soaked in vinegar, cypress, spice, and embrocation onto the hernia until the inflammation subsides.
And on some occasions I have seen this done with styptic agents, which are more effective than just water alone in reducing the inflammation.
And so when you see that the inflammation has been resolved, then moisten the hernia with water in which old mallow and mallows have been boiled, for this alleviates any residual pain within it.
But if it is necessary to cauterize the interior of the hernia, then open up the rupture slightly with an instrument upon which have been engraved some small hemorrhoids.
And the primary cure is better when it is timely rather than late and does not require an operation to remove unnecessary material.
Regarding the instrument, consider its shape:
One side of it is sharp and tapered, while the other side is not as acute; its tip is fine but not as delicate as a spatula, rather slightly more blunt.
And so when the wound is enlarged and the intestine protrudes, one should cover it and ensure its reduction is done according to its natural shape and place; if possible, do this gently as it is best.
However, when the rupture is wide and located in the lower part of the abdomen, you should make the patient lie on their back with their legs elevated higher than their head; if it's in the upper part of the abdomen, place their head and feet higher than the affected area.
Similarly, if the rupture is in one of the two parts of the abdomen, always pay attention and consider keeping the area where the wound is located higher than the other part to promote healing.
And so do this for large wounds and medium-sized wounds.
For small wounds, apply the medicine you have prepared and then let a nurse administer it by holding the wound open with their fingers, they should keep the edges of the wound aligned and expose that which requires stitching before another cause.
This is the common method of suturing: Once you have obtained a needle or several needles based on the size of the wound; let one end of the suture emerge from the tip of your ring finger and secure the needle with your thumb, make sure there is no thread in both ends of the suture by removing any excess with your fingertips. You should now have two ends of the suture and two ends of the thread, which together form four strands.
Then secure the doubled thread around the eye of the needle, occasionally bringing both parts together and aligning the edges of the wound with proper approximation; now leave some excess on one side while inserting another needle there, then tie that end with a knot like you did with the first needle; do not stop doing this until all sides of the wound have been sutured.
And since needles are somewhere between crudeness and delicacy, as fine needles slightly penetrate the flesh and thick ones have a hard time entering the vein; therefore they should be moderate in thickness and fineness.
It is necessary that the needle be inserted at two points along the main vein itself so that the flesh is not merely pierced and to ensure that the pus breaks open before it hardens.
And they should not be prolonged with stitches so that the pus is not prevented from hardening.
Then pierce the ends of the needles so that they do not disturb the patient while sleeping; place over this suture fine powder spread from all sides, which has the ends of the needles in it; and leave them there until you know that the pus has hardened.
And this type of suture with needles is more suitable for small wounds, as only one or two can be used to sew them up.
The second type of suture is more comprehensive: it involves managing the four ends, one from the main vein and two from the side veins, in one go, with a needle that has an eye suitable for its thickness.
Then, when you have penetrated these four extremities with the needle, withdraw the needle from the same place where you started, so that the thread can be pulled out of the wound and then tied at a point above the wound, in the manner of sewing cloth.
Place between each suture an amount equal to the thickness of your little finger.
This type of suture is known among men.
With this suture, I closed the wound of a man who had been stabbed in the abdomen with a dagger, and the rupture of the wound was larger than a palm, with the intestines protruding about two palms from the middle of the wound; it had been like that for twenty-four hours before I reduced them.
The wound healed within fifteen days or so and the patient was cured; he lived for many years after that and remained in good health.
The other doctors had judged that he would not be cured; it was by miracle that this happened, for I did not use any ointment on the wound, nor any medicine whatsoever, but only covered the wound with a piece of linen twice daily and washed it regularly with honey water until it healed.
Now I will speak about two specific types of stitches according to the teachings in the book.
And when you begin the chain suture, insert the needle from outside to inside at one end.
As the needle passes through the chain and makes its way along the entire wound, leave the tip of the scissors at the end where you inserted the needle; then insert the needle from inside to outside at the other end of the wound.
Once you have completed that step, repeat the process by inserting the needle at the same end of the wound but this time from outside to inside; leave the tip of the scissors on this side and insert the needle into the other end from inside to outside.
Make sure that as you insert the needle into the scissors, it enters and exits at the end of the wound on the side closest to the patient so that all the sutures are on the same side.
Then start from this side and stitch the end of the scissors to the other side, remove the needle from the chain suture you have created, reduce it back into the chain, and sew the end of the scissors on the other side with that final end of the wound; finally, take out that last part from the patient's body.
Do this once and then again, doing it another time before you finally sew everything closed according to the example.
The purpose of this method of suturing is that you sew with a stitch made from fur, using the same technique as when stitching hair, and you do it in such a way that after you have completed one part of the suture on the tip of the wound, you then finish the other side.
The second type of suturing technique described by Guy de Chauliac is for the treatment of wounds and incisions, it involves stitching using an appropriate surgical thread made from medicinal substances, such that each part of the wound has its corresponding counterpart applied to it; then you tie one end of the suture with the other, making sure they are both tight enough.
When you have the needle at one end of the suture thread on the surface of your skin, make it go through the wound in such a way that both ends of the surgical thread are inside; then turn around the needle and let its other end penetrate into the opposite side of the wound.
And then you turn each one of them, and make the two parts penetrate from inside to outside at the two ends of the mirror, those which are on the opposite side.
And this way of suturing is better than the common light suture, which I previously mentioned.
This is Gualius's speech.
They also say that the suture of the abdomen is corrected with two needles, and it's done by inserting a thread into each one of them, and you start with the insertion of the needle from where you are, making this one penetrate to the other side according to the suture of those who sew the skins equally.
And you should know that when there is a rupture in the middle of the abdomen, its suture will be more difficult than those of other parts of the abdomen.
The treatment of the plague is also a judgment for other diseases.
Whose cause is when you get the fresh plague with its blood before the air alters it, and you reduce the intestine and sew it and properly adjust it, then place on it incarnative powder.
Here is my best attempt at translating the provided text:
Here is my translation of the provided text:
If you fear that the plague might spread to the main organs, then it is necessary to submerge woolen flannel in lukewarm oil or rosehip oil and apply this mixture around the armpits as well as on top of each shoulder.
And if there is pain or putrefaction in the intestines, which often causes this condition, then you should apply black stiptic wine to crystallize it, especially if the gangrene has reached the intestine and has penetrated its cavity.
Know that an infection of the large intestine is easier to treat than one affecting the small intestines.
An infection of the appendix is difficult to treat as it does not heal from plague alone; this is due to the large number of veins present in the organ and their size, as well as the delicacy of its tissue and its proximity to nerves.
However, if what is affected by the plague is a hernia and it is a fresh one, then treat it in the same way you reduce intestines.
Here is my translation of the text:
And then make an incision in that area which is the other end of the cord, and attach two extremities of the thread hanging from the part below the wound to it, so that by your pulling on this thread you may ease the drawing together of the edges of the hernia and the stretching out of the arm of the wound.
A reminder of the wounds that happen to the intestine.
When there is a rupture in the intestine and it is small, sometimes it can be restored in certain men; that's why I saw someone who was wounded in his belly with a lance-blow, and the wound was on the right side of his stomach, and this was an old, fistula-like wound, and he had flatulence and bloating.
I therefore pursued the treatment of him so that it might not be interfered with in his healing; but I ceased to treat secretly what had already healed and the area was consolidated.
And when I saw that the area was already consolidated, I forbade the patient from causing any further injury to himself in his belly; and he did not incur this evil mishap nor ruptures in his intestines due to bad dispositions while eating and drinking, but instead he entered into a bath and exercised according to his regimen.
Here is my translation of the provided text:
And then place another ant next to the first one, and do not stop making ants, one after another, according to the quantity of the entire wound.
Then reduce the size of the wound and cover it with these dressings; leave those dressings attached to the intestine until the intestine is healed, and do not cause any harm or damage to the patient.
And it is possible to use a delicate thread made from the intestine of an animal for this procedure, as it can be passed through a needle; take one end of these threads and make them very thin, then tie one end of each thread around the other with a knot, place the knot into the needles, and use those needles to sew up the intestine, reducing the opening.
And this method of suture with ants is not just a second way, but also a matter of trust and hope.
However, if the wound is large and wide, especially if it is on one of the delicate intestines, in such a case, this is not true healing but rather an attempt at concealment, and it does not fully cure the patient.
The treatment of abscesses and fistulas:
Here is my translation of the provided text:
Here is the translation of the provided text:
And in some men, it is moist, which causes weakness; often, the moisture is absorbed within a few hours. Sometimes this moisture becomes cloudy, and it is small in amount, thick, and subtle.
I have already demonstrated all these causes, their symptoms, and the cure with appropriate medicines in the division.
And now I will inform you about the treatment for fistulas, which are formed through surgical intervention with the hands.
Know that fistulas can occur in any part of the body; some affect large veins and arteries, nerves, the brain, intestines, bladder, ribs, spine, or compound joints such as those of the hand and foot. There are also those that appear near major limbs and similar areas.
Therefore, treating these types of fistulas is one of the most difficult medical tasks and they rarely heal; dealing with them requires hard work and expertise.
If there is a fistula that does not affect these specific areas and you have hope and confidence in its healing, wanting to understand it better, then take iron or steel and carefully probe the fistula with it.
However, if the fistula is curved or twisted, then use a thin lead probe because of its softness and flexibility.
And if the fistula has horrible discharges, it is not possible for you to make any meaningful examination of them.
Therefore, crystallize the openings for their discharges, because the moisture from which you are cleaning that will also go into the other openings and run out of them.
And then inquire carefully to determine whether there are any nerves here and if the cavity of the fistula is deep or shallow; or if it is a fistula with numerous openings that require your utmost strength, focus, and questions to the patient as well as your understanding of pain when pressing on the area, similar to the symptoms and causes you would attribute to an abscess.
And once you have considered all these factors thoroughly, then proceed to the treatment with confidence: consider whether it is an external fistula that is close to the surface or in a salty location; whether it is located far from any joints, nerves, arteries, veins, or other sensitive areas I mentioned earlier.
Dry out the fistula as described previously and remove any substances that are leaking from it along with corrupted flesh; cut away anything that is born of this flesh at the opening or inside, such as hair and similar debris, then treat it until it is healed.
Here is the translation of the first source sentence:
And do this with some dressings within so that the acute medicine corrodes all that is rotten in the cavity of the fistula of corruption.
Then restore it with fire to generate healthy flesh until it is healed.
But if it does not heal with this method, then you cauterize it as we have recounted.
But if the cause of the fistula is in the bone and you must confirm this, then you investigate it and dry it as we have recounted, provided that you do not prohibit any cause from veins or nerves or main members as we have said.
But if the bone is exposed and there is any corruption or blackness in it, then you clean that out until all corruption is hosted; and then heal it with something that causes flesh to grow until it is healed.
And if it does not heal and discharges pus as before, then know that you have not achieved a complete eradication of the corruption; so then uncover it again, carefully perform its reason and purification with your last sharp tool, and restore it.
And so if he is healed, it's good; but if not, then know that the corruption has reached the distant depths of the body, which cannot be treated, and in such cases your role is to leave him alone.
And if the corrupted bone is small, or it's within your ability to extract it, then you should do so using delicate forceps suited for this purpose.
And if there are multiple broken bones, meticulously perform the extraction of all of them, leaving none behind due to your strength.
But if you encounter any difficulty due to the humidity and its examination is free from fear or mistake, then cut through those ligaments or flesh where they are found and deliver the bones.
However, if you have no means to roast the bones immediately, place over the wound something that will char it; leave this until the area around those bones and flesh becomes dry, then ensure the wound is not closed or consolidated but rather confined within the section you incised during your operation.
Later on, if you fear for the patient's well-being, place over them a cataplasm made of bread soaked in oil, or one using Egyptian unguent, or any of the green salves, as when these cataplasms are applied and charred, it causes those ligaments to separate from the bones, thereby alleviating their attachment.
Mays si es un gran os ayssi cum le os de camba o de coyssa o semblantz ad aquels, e aquo que de lu es corromput es la facia de lu tant solament, lahoras ratz aquella am resio tant solament derriera entro que sia ostada aquella negror e corrupcio, e aprop restaura la plagua.
Here is my best attempt at translating the provided medieval medical text:
And I advise you to bring an assistant who will stand by the patient's hip, providing support and assistance during your operation.
For a young man around 30 years old, who experiences pain in his hip joint, and the cause of this pain originates internally from within the body, with a severe abscess or inflammation present inside the hip joint, and there is no external injury as the cause.
And due to the mistake of the doctors, who prolonged his treatment, the abscess worsened and released pus, and his recovery was delayed because the leg became fistulated, with many foul-smelling orifices that discharged pus and bodily fluids.
Then the patient was examined by many doctors for over two years, but there was little expertise or skill among them, until I was called upon.
I observed his leg, with the matter that discharged from those foul-smelling openings over a large area; and indeed, the patient's body was entirely swollen, and his complexion had turned yellowish.
Then I inserted a probe into one of those openings, and it reached the bone.
And then I examined all the openings and found them coming from every part of the leg.
So I cut and incised over one of the openings where I discovered a part of the bone was exposed, and I found it to be corrupt and already soil-covered, blackened, and rotten; there was also a section of the leg that had been penetrated into the marrow.
Then I seized what was uncovered and prepared to expose the bone further.
I realized that it was not in the bone itself but rather this corruption which I had cut away and seized; it had already been removed.
Then I began the restoration of the wound with consolidating medicine for quite some time, but it did not consolidate (heal).
Then I repeated the process of uncovering over the bone for a second time based on the first discovery, and found continuous corruption with the bone.
I seized what appeared to be that corruption, but then I was forced to perforate it in order to attempt healing and restoration, which did not occur.
Here is my translation of the provided text:
E no es necessaria iteracio en la operacio de lu e seccio de lu sino per la disposicio de la freulesa de lu e per la paucitat de la tollerancia de lu e paor de lu de mort, quar a lu accidia en totas horas per superfluitat de evacuacio sincopi mala.
And thus he is completely healed, and there is nothing left in place of the hard flesh; and his disposition towards good health has been reestablished within his body, and his virtue has returned to him; and he has been restored to his former dispositions, and does not do anything contrary or harmful while walking or for any other reason.
But if there is an emergence from the chest wound, then you should treat it like this: take some linen thread and tightly bind that at the end of the emerging bone, and have someone extend it with their hand; place a thicker piece of linen over the first binding; then tie that over the flesh below the bone, extending its end so as to draw the flesh towards the sides, and you uncover the flesh on the area where you want to saw in order for the saw not to cut into the flesh.
And place a piece of wood or table underneath the bone appropriately; because when you do this it is not prohibited for the saw to cut into the corrupted flesh.
And make sure the sawing takes place over the corrupted area little by little, because if it is within a bone cavity and its corruption has not yet manifested to the senses, then you will be forced to saw it open again.
Here is my translation of the provided text:
And let the incision be small depending on the location of the corruption, as we have said before.
And if the corruption is in a joint, incise that corrupted joint, and saw through the bone where it continues to another part.
And if the corruption is in the area between two joints, it is not natural but rather a malformation.
And if the corruption is in the chest of the hand or foot, it is quite challenging; however, you must examine how the corruption presents itself to you, and you should remove it, cleaning it according to any arrangement that is possible for you, and make sure each malformation is corrected by you, provided it does not harm any veins or nerves.
Know that the incisions and saws used to cut through these bones are very diverse depending on the position of the bones, their preparation, thickness, subtlety, size, smallness, hardness, and rarity; for it is necessary that you prepare a special tool suitable for each operation.
Understand that this operation refers to the type of tool you require; when you have great study and extensive knowledge about the methods of this art, and you have witnessed the ways in which illnesses present themselves, then already you can know for yourself what is appropriate regarding tools for each illness.
And I will list for you, at the end of this chapter, the number of instruments that you will use with simples as you proceed to your prohibition which you will test on others. Saw Form:
Form of yet another saw:
Form of a large saw:
Form of chisel: Let the head of this chisel be made according to the form of a star key, and its points be shaped like those of an awl.
And it is not necessary to rub the heads of the joints with it unless they are corrupted or have a large and wide opening.
Form of small razor:
Form of broad/wide razor:
Form of another saw made in a decent manner: let its arc be made of the strongest iron and sharpened with steel, and its handle well-made from wooden shafts. Way of treatment:
Form of the wound in which there is a cavity:
Form of another subtle wound:
Form of another wound with curved ends:
Form of a small wound resembling a tent:
Form of another smaller incision:
Form of another incision resembling a line; its end is like a saw and appears in many places on the bones:
Form of the line that corresponds to the structure of the perforated bones:
And its end is triangular and sharp.
And it is made of Indian iron, and resembles a cover for all the causes we have mentioned regarding wounds, incisions, and saws.
Of the end of the incision and the locking of the bones.
Here is my translation of the provided text:
Here is the translation of your provided text:
And similarly, if there is a case of corruption caused by the impact of certain venomous creatures like the scorpion, marine or land viper, the adder, and similar ones.
And if the corruption or impact is located at the fingertip, then make an incision in the finger to prevent the corruption from spreading into the hand.
Similarly, if it reaches the hand, then make an incision at the base of the forearm, and do not allow corruption to spread into the arm.
If that doesn't work, then make an incision on the arm above the elbow joint.
And if the corruption continues and surrounds the elbow, then it is the death of the patient; to attempt any further treatment after this point is a waste of effort.
Similarly, for the foot, if corruption moves from the toe, then make an incision above one of the joints.
And if it reaches the heel of the foot, then make an incision across the entire foot. But if you can get your finger into the hollow, then cut open the thigh at the joint of the hip.
And if the corruption has already spread to the hip, then there is not treatment but release, and let the patient die.
The method of cutting open a limb or performing an incision is as follows: you tighten the ligature below the part where you want to cut, and place another ligature above it; extend one minister's hand with a ligature towards the lower parts, while another minister extends their hand with a ligature upwards; then separate the flesh that lies between the two ligatures until all the flesh is exposed; after which it can be cut or incised.
And be sure to place linen cloth around all parts so that it does not touch the wound, and have a tight-fitting dressing applied to the patient's suppurating sore.
But if there is bleeding during the procedure, then cauterize the wounded area thoroughly or apply some hemostatic powders over it; and then resume your treatment until it is completed.
Then bind the wounded limb with an appropriate ligature, and treat it until it is healed.
Here is the translation of the first source sentence:
And that corruption spreads primarily in his toes which stretch out from the foot.
Then this man prepared himself by putting more pressure on the affected limb to let the cure penetrate into it with great force and vehemence despite his pain and suffering; he cut open that foot between the joints, and was healed.
For a long time he suffered from that same corruption in the finger of his hand.
And then he came to me, and I had to remove that superfluity by striking it with what was in my medicine bag, thereby purifying his body; the superfluity did not retreat, and started spreading to another finger which began on his hand.
He asked me to cut open his hand, but I did not want to do it fearing the spread of that superfluity; and more so because I feared that after cutting his dead hand there would be no virtue left to cure him since the disease was concentrated on that part.
And since he departed from me, he returned to his land and I came to know that this man prepared himself and cut open his entire hand, and was healed.
Here is my translation of the text:
De cura sinuum et qualitate clisterizationis cum medicinis."
Here is the translation of the provided text:
But if the space is prolonged and infection begins in any part of the body, it is called a fistula rather than an ulcer.
And the treatment is to apply this poultice as it is, mixed and made with cloth, ensuring that it does not stick to the area due to its corruption.
However, if you wish for the poultice to adhere and prevent further infection from spreading behind it, and if the poultice has become dry and hard, then apply a clyster as treatment.
And consider the wound, and if it is large, and the arm which has the wound emits a foul smell, then perform a clyster with Egyptian medicine made of oil, vinegar, and resin received in equal parts, mixed together in a vessel, and heated over fire until the mixture becomes like honey.
Then take what is necessary and dissolve it with water and honey; clyster the wound with this mixture, close its opening, and let the medicine remain inside for two hours.
And then remove that with disdain; do this for as many days as it takes until the sinus is cleansed and the pus has receded.
Sometimes an enema is given with water and ash when this medicine is not available to you; it is that you take the ash of beech wood, and add it to water; then use it to perform an enema until you see that the sinus has healed.
And if the patient cannot tolerate Egyptian medicine or water and ash, then perform an enema with plain water and honey mixed in equal parts; also perform an enema using wine and honey mixed together, for the property of honey is that it cleanses and washes away impurities, and the wine causes adhesion to the sinus, especially when there is superfluous astringency and dryness in the wine.
And when you have done this a few times and see that the pus has receded, then perform an enema with water that promotes flesh to grow in it.
It is that you take some daiphine ointment and dissolve it in rose oil and astringent wine; or you can perform an enema with other medicines and ointments, which have the properties I have already written about in the treatise on ointments.
Here is the translation of your provided text:
And if the opening is wide, then you should join its lips with a suture and leave enough space for the enema to enter.
And if the opening from which the arm escapes is elevated towards higher parts, then dry that in its lowest part so that the arm can slide out of it, for when the arm is trapped in the depth of a bend, flesh will form within.
And if it is not possible for you to dry the bend around its lowest surroundings, then you must prepare the member with a preparation that makes the arm slide out of it easily as it suits you and that does not hold back the arm in any way.
Now for the one who is on top of the sinus opening, you restrain him at all times so that he does not pull out what is inserted into his arm. And to know whether what runs from his arm is too much or too little, whether it is digested or not digested.
And you consider the area of that sinus, whether the patient feels pain there or not, and if there is an abscess.
And when your treatment is prolonged in this way, and you see that the material which is placed over the sinus opening has already adhered, or if there is proper adhesion, then on the third day you remove the bandage and change it for a new one. When changing the dressing, renew the ointment as well.
But if around the sinus there is a thin transparent discharge, then do not remove the adhesion of it because their healing is appropriate; for only some people take time to grow flesh on their wounds and others are those in which this is reversed.
And if from the sinus much time passes without digestion of discharge, then you know that there is no adhesion in it; and if the adherence to the sinus is delayed for a long period, then reduce the moistness of medicines, and if they are moist by nature but dried up as ointments like *dryophytic* when applied with too much fat.

Here is the translation of the provided text:
But if corruption has already reached the bone, then you must saw into the bone and extract it, for there is no cure when the corrupted bone remains.
And if you see the corruption spreading to the fingers, then you must cut into one of them according to its severity and properly treat it until healed.
However, if the nail suffers trauma or injury and develops severe pain, then you must first perform bloodletting on the patient, and then dry up the nail using a sharp spade-shaped tool with a transverse section, ensuring that the incision does not go beyond the flesh beneath the nail, as this will cause intense pain to the patient and may lead to excessive scarring. Afterwards, treat the area with something soothing.
This deformity of the fingers, which is naturally fleshy and often lacks bones or nails in some people.
Some of them are born at the base of a joint, or their deformity is located in certain fingers. Now, the deformity that affects certain fingers does not harm its owner, but one that is born at the joints often brings pain.
And for those who are born with fleshy bodies, their section is light, and you must cut their flesh with a wide spatula.
For someone born with a deformity in the root of their joints, healing is difficult; therefore, beware of cutting them.
But for those born with a defect in their bones, it is necessary that you cut the flesh around them with a round incision at the beginning and then saw [the bone] with one of those appropriate saws, and afterwards treat the wound until it heals.
But for the consolidation that occurs in said wounds caused by hidden motives or due to the nature of man, or by the consolidation of a plague, or by fire, then it is necessary to cut off this consolidation so that they return to their natural form.
And place the patient between sheets soaked in rose oil so that their wounds are not easily consolidated (i.e., hardened), and separate them with layers or a thin lead sheet until they are consolidated as required.
Similarly, if consolidation occurs in the palm of someone's hand, then you must cut off this consolidation according to what is required and suitable for the shape of the member.
De inscizio de vices, so son varicas.
Here is the translation of the provided text:
Therefore, you must administer a purge for black bile occasionally with great force, and then bleed the patient from the basilic vein.
The treatment for their iron disease is according to two methods: one is that it should be incised and the black blood should be drawn out, and the other method is that the vein should be raised and everything extracted.
The incision is done in this way: immerse the leg at its beginning in cold water for a long time until the thick blood is dissolved, which is feculent from the leg, and then bind the patient's leg to the highest part of the thigh down to the lower part with a bandage, and then dry the vein in one place, or two, or three with a wide incision, and then draw up the black blood gently by hand from below the leg upwards, and downwards again until you extract as much blood as desired and however often it is needed, and which removes the illness from the patient.
And then bind it up, and command them to abstain from foods that generate black bile.
And repeat the cure by phlebotomy when the veins are full, as he notices.
Here is my translation of the provided text:
And then bind the wound on the right side of the vein by cutting in its length or at its rear towards their back, or if it is lower down cut around the ankle.
And then open the wound with hooks and scrape out the vein entirely until you feel it, and there should be an appearance of him which you will see is turning black.
And thus when you evacuate and from the wound you see it turn white as if it were a cord.
And then place beneath it the reed until it is raised and turned away from the wound, and suspend it with linen cloth.
And then make another cut close to that cut by three fingers, and scrape the wound from where it started above the vein until it appears.
And then lift it up and cut it at the rear of that second section near the ankle, and then pull it out and raise it through the second incision, and finally extract it from the section above.
Do this until you extract it from the section that is most superior or highest of all sections, once they are all exposed; and then cut it.
Here is the translation of your provided text: Make sure it is not cut; for if it is broken, you will find it difficult to lift that part and it has come upon the patient due to this harm.
Once that entire area has been cleaned, place on the site of the wound a poultice submerged in wine and both rose oil and non-rose oil; treat it until cured.
If the vein is contracted and has twisting at which it wraps around the limb, but does not follow straightness as we have said before, then you should cut through that area completely and its binding locations; and then attach a weight on it until the whole thing is raised.
And take care not to cut into the vein while you are making this incision and do not apply anything there, for it will be difficult for you to lift that part again; let your prudence guide you in this.
The shape of the cutting instrument for drying out the vein:
It should not have a sharp point like dead weights nor should it be of an acutely pointed end so as not to pierce the vein and cause harm; instead, let its flexibility be thick, for if it were thin, it would cut into the vein due to its thinness; therefore, its thickness is excessive in this way as we have said.
De extraccio venae cruris translates to "For the extraction of the leg vein."
This vein is generated in the legs, in low-lying lands such as Al-Ategi in the land of the Arabs and in the low and arid regions of India that have little vegetation and where there are neither grass nor trees.
And rarely is it generated in other parts of the body besides the legs.
Its gestation comes from the process of putrefaction, which is similar to how snakes and worms, as well as terrifying and disgusting creatures, enter the body through wounds, breeding between the pus and flesh.
A sign of the onset of this disease is the occurrence of intense inflammation in the leg, and the area becomes blistered. Then, from the location of these blisters, a vein begins to emerge, resembling the root of a plant.
Once the disease appears, you should take a piece of lead weighing one to two drachmas and attach it to the leg, letting the lead hang loosely.
Whenever the disease causes any movement outside of the leg, wrap this lead around the affected area and secure it. Here is my translation of the provided text:
So it is necessary that it be treated rigorously and extracted little by little, while being flushed out from the back of him so as to remove any cause in the body.
And from this vein, it is said to have appeared in some men who had it for the length of 5 to 10 palms and it has come to my attention that one man's was even at 20 palms.
And if it is incised at the hour of its medication, then insert a hollow rod through it and perforate that with a long tube into the body, until all that is in the matter is evacuated, and apply putrefaction to the place for some days with medicine; and then treat it for the cure of apostemes.
And sometimes this vein has many bumps, and mostly when it appears at the joint of the foot or on the foot, and comes to him many openings, and is said that from each opening a branch.
And so cure it as we have said in the division and with what is above said.
On the section about worms generated under the skin and it is called bovine illness.
This ailment is named in some regions as 'bovine disease' because many cases come from cows and there is a worm that is born between the sinew and the flesh, which travels throughout the body up and down, and it is shown by its movement from limb to limb until it breaks the sinew and comes out.
Its generation is due to the putrefaction of certain humors, which can lead to the appearance of worms, serpents, and larvae such as pinworms and threadworms in the abdomen.
It is feared for its malice because when it reaches the brain and elevates to the head, it then comes into the eye, causing rupture in it, and this leads to many instances of blindness.
Therefore, when you want to cure and extract it, it should not be done without first observing its movement and appearance through touch; you must then tightly hold what is above the affected area with one hand and apply strong pressure underneath using a ligature or something similar that constricts; finally, cauterize over it and remove whatever comes out.
And if it is deeply embedded in the flesh and you cannot find it, then place a red-hot cauterizer on the area until it dies; its greatest danger lies in corruption which spreads to the surrounding areas as we have mentioned.
May you see that the patient has reached a critical stage of illness near death, then apply pressure on their forehead with force and hold it tightly there, and extract [the cause]; and ensure that the patient uses purgatives to evacuate harmful, foul humors from their body, and avoid food that causes putrefaction.
On treating inflammation of the naval.
This illness is called 'nafir' in our region, a pain that affects some body parts and moves from one part to another.
And I have already seen her, as I will recount to you shortly. I was called to attend a sick woman in a village; I examined her arms and noticed a small inflammation on the main vein of her arm, which had been crushed for an hour; as I watched it, the inflammation moved up towards this side more lightly than one would think possible, much like liquid silver running from place to place.
And then I removed the pain from that place and placed it in her muscle; here I sit for another hour.
And then it runs into the other body until it reaches the other arm.
Then I began to observe him as he moved throughout his body, just as I had seen before; and I was incredibly amazed by the interchangeability of parts and the speed at which they could move from one member to another. I had seen this before in my experience, though I have witnessed many cases where the pain was transferred from one member to another. I have not seen this in my eyes like so, as it is with the woman's body.
And I did not think it was anything but this, for the woman is elderly, with dry skin and visible veins; in this case, one can feel that transferred wind.
It is necessary that this treatment not be performed on those who are young and have moist bodies with full veins.
And if you wish to treat the patient's pain and it is not apparent to your sense of smell as previously mentioned, then you must press upon them gently and firmly over the area where the wind has been trapped, and cauterize that place.
Mays si tu no la vezes am los tieus huels, alhoras tu cura aquel am excussio del cors e am aquo que expelleys ventositatz, e carmina aquellas am pillulas fetidas e am pillulas de serapi e semblantz.
De extraccio de sagetas means "On the extraction of arrows." or "Arrow removal process".
Sagetas (arrows) are diversified according to their types and the parts of the body they target, as their diversity lies in those with large points, small ones, curved, blunt, solid ones; and those that have three edges, some with tongues, and others with barbs.
Regarding the signs of a wound to the brain: when an arrow pierces it and passes through the bone there will be a violent headache, blindness, dizziness, ringing in the ears, inflammation and pain in the tongue, spasms and confusion, vomiting bile, speech becomes slurred and voice lost, white liquid resembling dust seeps from the area of the wound, and the flesh around seems to melt.
And so if these signs appear to you, then abstain from the cure and extraction of the arrowhead, unless it is essential.
But the signs of the arrowhead when lodged in the heart are such: it is close to the left nipple, and you feel that it has struck a hard object, and it is not a visible wound; moreover, the movement of the arrowhead is similar to the pulse, and there is a discharge of black blood, along with coldness in the extremities, shallow breathing, and fainting; therefore, know that death descends swiftly upon them.
And the signs when the arrowhead has pierced the lung are an effusion of frothy blood from the wound, and the veins near the neck become inflamed, there is a change in the patient's complexion, they exhale a great spirit (breath), and crave cold air.
If the arrowhead has struck the covering (membrane) that is in the foot, and the pain then moves towards the little toes, causing a great swelling with intense pain and sighing, but not affecting all the limbs or muscles.
And if the arrowhead has struck the stomach, in some cases you will see undigested food coming out of the wound.

And I will recount this to you based on what I have witnessed regarding the nature of these arrows, so that you may understand its significance in terms of mild cures.
Which is caused by an arrowhead becoming lodged in the tear duct of one's eye at the root of their nose; I extracted this arrow from another part of the body, leaving a graze on their ear, and they healed without any damage to their vision.
Another arrow was removed from a Jew who had been shot in the eye, just below the eyelid, and the arrowhead was hidden deep within; only a small portion of the tip could be grasped which was attached to the shaft, it was one of those long pointed Turkish arrows with a lion's head but no ears.
The Jew was cured, and his sight remained unimpaired without any harm to his eye.
I extracted yet another arrow from a Christian man who had been shot in the throat; it was an Arabic arrow with ears. I made two incisions over this arrow and as it was lodged deep within the throat, I had to be careful when extracting it. The Christian healed after its removal.

Here is the translation of the provided text:
And I saw another man into whose face an arrow had pierced; the wound was now healed but he felt no pain there and there were many like him.
I extracted the arrow from the nose of the king's chief commander who had been wounded in the middle of his nose and it had already tilted slightly to the right, and all of the arrow was hidden.
And I was called to treat him just three days after the wounding of the arrow.
So I discovered that the wound of the arrow was very narrow and then I inquired about this subtle sensation which he did not feel but only when I touched below his right ear; so I suspected that it must be caused by the point of the arrow.
And I plastered the area with an attractive and digestive ointment hoping that the wound would become inflamed so as to show me where the arrow was located in order for it to dry out.
But I did not find any significant evidence that the arrow had reached that place and so I continued applying the ointment for many days but nothing happened; meanwhile, the wound became healed while the patient suffered from sneezing over several days until one day I felt the arrow inside his nose and he told me about it.
And then I applied an acute corrosive medicine to the wound for several days until it was open and accessible, carefully probing it with my fingers, and removing the delicate tip of the arrowhead which adhered to the shaft.
Then I carefully packed the wound with the acute medicine while still inside it so that the tip of the arrowhead became visible to me, and I gave this treatment to them over four months.
And because the wound was still enlarged, and it seemed feasible to introduce a pair of pincers into it, I did so repeatedly without hesitation or interruption until such time as I began one day to manipulate some instruments of iron in the form of forceps that were specially made for this purpose, according to the description given at the end of this chapter; then removing them I cleaned the wound.
Some physicians believed that the cartilage of the nose could not be restored; I did so and healed the wound perfectly, recovering this patient to full health with no further complications.
I recommend to you the method of arrow extraction and give this rule and meaning for what I have not said because there is as yet neither description nor definition in any part of this book.
Here is the translation of the provided text:
Here is the translation of the given text:
And that which is drawn out from the place where it entered, or is an arrowhead embedded in flesh, and is pulled out and ejected.
And if it does not obey the exit at the hour when you extract it, then leave it for a few days until the flesh around it decays and its attraction and exit are alleviated.
Similarly, if it is embedded in bone and does not obey your extraction, then leave it for a few days and repeat the process of attraction and motion every day until it is ejected.
And if it does not obey your extraction after a few days, then you must drill into the path of the arrowhead in that bone from all sides with a fine borer until the space around the arrowhead is widened, and then extract it.
But if the arrow has penetrated deep into the chest and is beyond your reach, then you must search for it carefully using your fingers or any suitable instrument designed for such extraction.
And if you cannot access it due to the tightness of the wound and the length of the arrowhead, especially when there are no major vessels or nerves involved in the path, then you must incise over the wound until it is sufficiently widened for you to extract the arrow.
For the extraction of an arrowhead lodged in or near the ears and holding onto some tissue there, you must first free that flesh from all around it with as much care as you can; devise means to accomplish this, if the ear's structure makes it impossible to simply release the trapped flesh at the fracture site by gentle traction and rotation without damaging the ear.
During the extraction of an arrow from any location it may be lodged in, you must employ the torsion of your hand like a forceps at all possible angles to make it yield; being mindful and gentle so that the arrow does not break inside and cause difficulties for its removal.
Under these circumstances you are not able to attend the patient immediately, then leave for a few days until all parts of the patient's body recover, and after that repeat this procedure when they feel better. If blood flow troubles you, then apply the cure we have mentioned in this chapter.
Remember your skill in incising veins or nerves, or even the cord, and apply every method you can to avoid arrow extraction; do so with ease, tranquility, gentleness, and firmness as I have taught you and demonstrated myself.
Therefore, press against the arrow in a direction opposite to the penetration of the wound on the patient's body, as it is most beneficial according to this figure. If that is not feasible for you, then apply what is within your reach according to these figures.
And the arrows that are bent outwards due to being contrary to another part, or when you have extracted some part from outside parts of the body, or if it causes joint dislocation upon moving the arrow upwards after feeling resistance in the wound below and sometimes even above; then saw through this; and be the cut according to the amount forceps can grip; and then pull on that, for it is lightened up by its removal.
But if it is retained in the bone, then you must turn the limb according to its opposite direction until the arrowhead presses against the bone and pushes through it; and then extract that.
Otherwise, leave it for several days, and then repeat the process until you extract it.
And if the shaft of the arrow is still inside, then you must use your hand to push it through.
But if the shaft has fallen out and you want to administer a push, then introduce your thumb into it, and if there is no orifice, use a concave tool so that its concavity fits over the tail of the arrowhead; and then push it through.
But if the arrow is concave, then push it through with a strong tool inserted into it because that will ease out the arrow.
And if the arrow is poisoned, then make sure that you hollow out all of the flesh around the wound if at all possible; and then treat it with whatever seems appropriate to you.
And if the arrow has gone into the foot, or belly, or bladder, or side, and it is close enough that you can touch it with a tent peg, and it is possible for you to cut around it, then do so while taking care not to sever any veins or nerves; extract it, then stitch up the wound as seems necessary, and treat it until it heals.
The way forceps are used when the arrows are shot:
Their ends are like a bird's beak, which is shaped like a saw when it grasps the arrow so that it doesn't let go.
And they are made in many special sizes—large, small, and medium—according to the size of the arrow and its thickness, as well as the width of the wound and the tightness of the surrounding tissue.
Like a wedge to ease its entrance into the concave arrowhead and it is pushed by that.
On venesection or phlebotomy of veins:
The veins that are usually used for venesection and mentioned in chapter XVI are two pulse-like veins located near the ears, called 'alhasisain'; two herbs that appear on either temple; two veins situated under the eyes, named 'aspicientz'; a vein positioned at the center of the forehead; another one found at the tip of the nose; two veins on the neck; and two more each in the upper and lower lips. These are known as the 'angelic' veins. And there are also two veins below the tongue. Here is the translation of the provided text:
Under the foot and leg there are three veins: one of them is below the curvature of the heel of wild flax; the second is sophena, its location being under the domestic flax's leg; and the sciatic vein, whose place is under the wild flax’s leg; in the leg there are other similar veins to those.
The treatment of veins near the ears is for ancient cataracts, immigration, and evil sores and ulcers on the head.
And the method of bleeding those veins is as I recommend to you: it should be done on top of the patient's head, and the patient's head should be rubbed in the occiput at the location of both veins with a wide cloth with good friction; then tighten the patient's neck with a bandage between which shows both and their locations under the ears in two depressed parts of the head; and you feel that one with your finger, if you feel a pulse from those with your finger, there is a sign to try it.
Then you take the lancet-like cutter, which is sharp, and then you place it under the vein in the elbow so that the phlebotomist comes to the bone. And then lift your hand towards the vein and the groin area, make an incision in the vein with a sharp instrument. Let the length of the incision be about two fingers in size or thereabouts; and let out as much blood as you desire.
Then strengthen it with powders, and allow it to heal.
It has already been mentioned at the beginning of this book how to make incisions in them, as well as their cauterization.
The two arteries which serve as the pillars of phlebotomy are: 1) The former (obsolete now and ill-advised), and 2) The latter is persistent and full of superfluous, sudden outpourings to the humours.
And the way to perform phlebotomy on them is as follows, which I recommend to you: Constrain the patient's arm with a bandage so that the two veins are visible by tactile examination and can be palpated; their pulse will then be shown under your finger, at which point you proceed.
Then you lift the groin area above the vein in the upper parts with your index finger, insert the sharp phlebotomy instrument underneath it, and raise the vein upwards; then make an incision as you have done with the other two veins before, letting out blood according to the quantity of your need.
Underneath the patient's restraint, place your finger on their vein for an hour; then place cotton and lint on top of that area and press down with firm compression; let it heal.
The memorization of their words has already been made prior to this text's incision and attraction at the beginning of the book.
Therefore, the judgement of phlebotomy of the vein in the forehead is now phlebotomy of the cephalic vein for ancient facial illnesses, migraines, pain and foul ulcers.
And the quality of phlebotomy on him is as I recommend to you; it's that the patient tightens their collar with a bandage so that the vein appears; and then take the instrument which is named a fleam, this being its form: [diagram of instrument].
Place the sharp point which is at the top of the fleam onto that vein and strike it with a hammer or another tool in the manner shown, and let the blood run according to the quantity you wish; then release the patient's restraint and press down on the puncture until it has healed.
At times it is opened with a lateral phlebotomy, but be aware that this phlebotomy should not have an acute end like other phlebotomies; instead, its side must be sharp and the phlebotomy performed across the bone as it's very thick and a subtle phlebotomy would break.
Sure, here is my translation of your first source sentence:
And regarding the procedure of bloodletting, it is necessary for the patient to strain their neck using a bandage, and then you will perform the phlebotomy, standing over their head.
Once the phlebotomy is performed across the length of the vein with slight incision due to the lack of flesh in that area; if the phlebotomist is skilled, there will be little chance of breaking the tip.
Let the blood flow as much as you deem necessary, then place a cloth over the incision, bind it with a bandage for one night, and afterwards untie the binding.
The phlebotomy of the vein in the nose is suitable for acute fever and violent headaches, as well as diseases of the face, migraines, and especially when these are chronic.
The process of phlebotomy requires the patient to strain their neck and then offer their nose to you with their left hand; take your slender, long phlebotomist tool and place it in the middle of the top of the nose following its curvature, as the vein is not visible here and the blood will begin to flow immediately.
Make sure you gradually remove your hand from the small bloodletting instrument and allow the blood to flow according to your needs; then tie it up for one night, as it heals lightly.
However, the bloodletting from the two veins causes a contraction of bile and leads to the onset of leprosy and various other illnesses such as impetigo and bad corrosive ulcers, along with erysipelas.
The nature of the bloodletting from these veins is that the patient should lie down on their back with a pillow under them; and let the practitioner stand by the patient's head, while the patient sits on a chair.
Then, bloodlet from the vein along its length using a wide small instrument gradually; and extract blood in accordance with season, quantity or as often as needed for this; and do likewise to the other vein.
Then untie the pillow and bind both veins with a light bandage to prevent suffocation of the patient, and leave it until morning as the wound is healing.
The benefit of bloodletting from the Algerian veins is that it leads to small abscesses and blisters in the mouth, corruption of gums, bad ulcers and cracks, as well as bad ulcers inside the nose and its surrounding area.
Here is the translation of the provided text:
But if you have any doubts about which one it is, then proceed with an incision into the larger of them and the more apparent one.
And make two similar incisions on their upper lips.
The two veins that are beneath the tongue aid in bloodletting for those suffering from excessive phlegm in the throat, inflammation of the uvula, and mouth diseases.
When performing bloodletting on these veins, ensure the patient is positioned between your two hands facing the sun and lift their tongue up; look underneath for two veins, one on each side, and note that they have a colouration tending towards blackness.
Proceed to bloodlet each of them in turn; be careful not to over-squeeze during the procedure because these are arteries and you mustn't close your hand on them.
The veins that are bloodlet in the arm are those which flow through all men's bodies, and they may be bled using one of two methods; either use myrtle or olive wood sticks tapered at their ends, or use a small knife called a scalpel, and call this latter technique.
Keep his sides like this and proceed to open the concave full veins that appear thick and those that contain dark clotted blood.
This phlebotomy is of lesser width and more delicate extremity, and it is suitable for the phlebotomy of delicate veins that contain light yellow blood.
When drawing blood from the basilic vein, which is one of three veins, it is best to extract the blood from those who have diseases in their throat and neck regions, or those with afflictions in their feet and abdomen.
The phlebotomist must be cautious when performing this particular phlebotomy, as there is an artery nearby and any mistake or slip during the procedure could puncture it, leading to a flow of blood. Therefore, one should not use sharp phlebotomy tools but rather cut with scissors.
And if the basilic vein is not visible, then you must leave it and switch to another one or look for a branch of it. Alternatively, perform phlebotomy at the end of the arm where that vein is apparent, always using scissors as we've said before.
Here is my translation of the provided text:
And when you see that upon tying the ligament, there is inflation in the place you have marked with a tent, then know that this inflation is an inflammation of the artery, and therefore avoid it.
And if you see the blood flowing during phlebotomy like the urine of a child, and the blood is subtly reddish in color, then know that it is arterial blood; at this point, press with your finger for a long time; then remove your finger, and if the blood is cut off after several attempts, then tie up the arm and leave it.
Take care of the patient's discharge, even if they show excessive fear and do not feel pain for a few days before healing.
But if the blood is not cut off and you see that there is no other medicine available for this, then incise the artery, especially when its end appears contracted; in such a case, the blood will be cut off. Or take some fustic bark, soak it, and apply half of it to the place where the vein has been tightly bound with cloths until the next day.
And if the blood is cut off, that's good. But if it isn't, then treat it with something mentioned earlier for recalling the place where the cloths bind and stop the flow of blood.
And bloodletting from him is difficult in many positions due to the small location of the plague and the possibility of tying his arm.
More often, phlebotomy is beneficial to extract blood from the upper part of the head and the lower part near the heart; as it is composed of branches of the basilic vein and the cephalic vein, as we have said.
And one should beware of excessive fear in the phlebotomy procedure on him, as underneath it is a nerve; and if the phlebotomist makes an incorrect puncture and hits the nerve, it will cause shock to him, and it is difficult for his recovery, and he may barely recover at all. This nerve appears in many places near sensation; and if it remains hidden in some men and is subtle without being shown, one must take care that you place the phlebotomy instrument with an almond-shaped section, and avoid the nerve with your strength.
And if the vein is located between two nerves, then you cut the vein lengthwise.
The benefit of phlebotomy on the cephalic vein is that it draws blood from the head and treats diseases of the skin.
Here is the translation of the provided source sentence:
However, in some men, it is mild and does not require bloodletting on the first examination; we should still pay attention to this inflammation.
Firstly, it's crucial to understand that bloodletting is not only administered for treatment but also as a preventative measure for maintaining health and avoiding future illnesses. Bloodletting is typically performed on one of the veins located in the elbow area: the cephalic, basilic, or median cubital vein. The ideal time for this procedure is at the beginning of spring, before breakfast during spring and autumn, and towards the end of winter after a meal when signs of fullness appear.
Bloodletting should be performed on the third day, or as soon as possible after three hours have passed since the start of the day.
Bloodletting may be administered whenever it is deemed necessary and appropriate, regardless of the time or day.
It is important to note that children should not undergo bloodletting until they are 14 years old. For pregnant women, the procedure should be performed between the fourth and seventh months of pregnancy. Elderly individuals who have already passed their sixtieth year should refrain from bloodletting.

And then consider the elevation of vapors; if their blood is thick, give them food and drinks, and medicines if this is possible for you.
And then proceed to take a bath if nothing prevents it or engage in some exercise for their blood to be made thinner.
Perform their phlebotomy on the lower leg at about third hour of the day, as we have mentioned before.
Ensure that the lower leg of the patient is protected from all evil animal influences on this day, such as anguish, anger, fear, and any unnecessary physical exertion or pain.
At the bedside, have ready any substances commonly used by men for their fragrance and pleasant smell; also provide ointments and other similar items according to your means.
And have the bloodletting performed by him on a cushion that is higher than the one upon which they will be bled.
Then extract his arms and wipe the patient's arm with your hand two or three times, then tighten their binding with a strap and wrap it around twice.

And then apply a constriction, ensuring that the person who is to undergo bloodletting presses their hands together until the veins are engorged and easily felt.
Then the bloodletter should rub their lancet with a little old oil; and then place his middle finger of the left hand on that vein, under which the phlebotomy is to be performed, so that the vein may recede a little, and the pulsation be stilled since it is from those veins like cords that you must perform bloodletting, and among them is one full of windiness; and when you place the lancet over it, it contracts around the lancet, then the bloodletter should uncover himself; and if the lancet does not open the vein, and if it opens, it is narrow.
Therefore, the bloodletter must be firm and attentive in all these matters.
And then after placing the lancet, wait if the vein is struck in one place, then leave it be; and if not, repeat this process elsewhere under that same spot a little or above it with haste, unless the area is affected by a swelling.
And if the area is swollen or the patient becomes frightened, then leave him for a day or two without tightening the ligature, as force will attract pus quickly, and do not enter the bath.
And then repeat the bloodletting if she desires.
And if the opening is small and blood flows gently, fearing you may not obtain enough blood, repeat the fleubotomy in that same spot but closer to the straight part of the vein and make a slightly deeper incision; do so swiftly before the area becomes inflamed, for it often does in many men where little should be taken.
But if you see that the area has already become inflamed, do not repeat the procedure on it, as there is no justification for doing so; instead, place some lard or oil from a pig's fat over it, as this alleviates the heart by cooling the blood. And of all the oils, pig oil is best for this location.
Similarly, apply pig oil to any bloodletting where the veins must be prohibited from refilling with blood; do so especially when applying a cerate of Tyrian or Alexandrian origin after one of these has been placed on the area, as it purifies and lightens thick blood.
And if a large abscess forms in the area of bloodletting which often occurs, especially when one is bled for the first time or when there has been little opening made in the vein, then treat it; place on the location an infused sponge soaked in water and salt, slightly scraped, and bind that fast for an hour, as it will be dissolved.
And now it is necessary to take a blood sample from that vein completely or from another vein.
And if some blackness or greenness remains in the area for a few days, do not worry about it; and if you wish, apply to that area some aloe and myrrh solution, or some juice of mallow or calamint or something similar.
In many cases, when abscesses and swellings occur, you must perform a venesection in the arm.
Therefore, place your hand on it, and if you then find softness, you must maintain pressure on it, as that swelling is evil and harmful; and be careful to apply any of the things we have mentioned earlier, for blood will gush out strongly from an artery.
Make a poultice with something astringent, so that the area hardens, and then treat it with another cure until it is healed.
And you must draw out blood from every person according to the quantity of their virtue and according to the prevailing colour above the blood, as it appears.
When the blood is black, let it flow until it becomes thin; and similarly if you see it thick, let it flow until it gains delicacy; and likewise if it is sharp, until its sharpness be dulled.
For someone who is full and strong and requires bloodletting in one sitting, let the phlebotomy of the vein be amplified and the phlebotomist be wide.
And for someone who is weak, do the opposite; it is necessary to extract blood in small amounts, and let the incision be narrow.
The best way to administer phlebotomy of the vein is through a transverse section, not a puncture.
This method of phlebotomy is safer from the flow of blood and incision of nerves, and it is more commendable and safer than phlebotomy according to latitude and longitude.
And for the one who is accustomed to fainting, you must perform phlebotomy, and it is necessary that you treat them beforehand with a piece of bread infused in wine made from millet or simple oxymel scraped; extract blood from them in three or four sittings.
If there is a complexion coldness, then perform bloodletting by applying an infusion of myrrh syrup or spiced aromatic honey syrup with pepper, cinnamon, ginger and other similar spices, or very fragrant syrups.
If fainting occurs due to excessive blood loss, you must perform bloodletting and then have the patient drink meat broth and very fragrant syrup; apply an ointment with alkanet root extract, and wrap their feet in it.
Use the other causes we mentioned in the chapter division of fainting due to evacuation (of blood).
For those who wish to strengthen their arms and purify their blood for the second time, it is necessary that the bloodletting be done in small quantities over several consecutive days, according to the patient's constitution (cold or hot).
For those who wish to strengthen their arms and purify their blood a second time, and if the patient's body is strong, this should be done approximately seven or nine hours after the first bloodletting.
For those who wish to draw the blood from their body in the opposite direction of its decline, it should be done on the second or third day.

Having let him bleed until he is flebotomized; or remove this with the sharpness of the flebotomi that coagulates blood in the opening of the vein; or place on it theriaca alfarach, or sage, and compress it lightly until the blood has flowed out.
And if the vein is infected, then let it be and do not touch it until the infection has subsided.
And if the need arises to evacuate more blood, and it is not excused, then you bleed him in that same place or in the other arm on another vein.
The vein called 'funis of the arm' is flebotomized in place of the cubital or basilic veins when they are not found or are hidden because it is made up of them.
The quality of the phlebotomy is that the patient should immerse their hand in cold water until the face becomes red and the vein appears clearly.
Then it should be tied tightly around that area with a light tourniquet; and then flebotomize according to the small transverse direction, not longitudinally or along its length.
And if the incision is wide, and you are performing a phlebotomy, take blood from her at the joint of the hand a little.
And if the flow of blood is blocked, then immerse your hand in warm water and let the blood run into the water until you achieve your desired result.
However, if it were in the days of summer, you would be excused from immersing your hand in warm water, as the body's blood flow slows down in warm water during summer. In winter, the body's circulation is improved by warm water, so the patient should be immersed in warm water.
This phlebotomy is the safest of all venal phlebotomies, as there is no pulsating vein nor nerve to be damaged.
And the phlebotomy of the cephalic vein on the right arm is appropriate for treating liver ailments.
The procedure of phlebotomy is as follows: you should squeeze the arm with your hand or a ligature, after immersing it in warm water, until the vein is full and clearly visible to the incision; then make a transverse phlebotomy; if you insert [the blade] too deep, no harm will be done.
And be careful not to injure your hand with the bloodletting instrument, as his nerves are already exposed and devoid of flesh.
Then dip your hand in warm water and let the blood flow into it, for if you do not immerse it in warm water, the blood will clot in the opening of the vein, and its flow will be obstructed.
And once the required amount of blood is extracted, you place oil and salt over the vein so that it does not close immediately; similarly, ensure to do this for all narrow passages.
The bloodletting from the left hand is appropriate for ailments of the chest.
Perform the bloodletting on him in the same manner as you did with the other patient.
Bloodletting from the cephalic vein is beneficial for ailments located in the lower part of the body, such as those related to the genitals, menstrual retention, and old sores or ulcers on the thighs and legs.
Here is the translation of the provided text:
And so let the fleabotoma bite your most ample leg or place it under their thigh where you should join it with them, for that is better and healthier.
And if the fleabotoma bites that on the surface of the foot, then you must be careful of the nerves which are underneath that on the surface of the foot and place your fleabottomia across it as though you were going to incise.
And if the fleabotoma is blunt.
But if the removal of blood is prohibited, then immerse the foot in warm water and allow the blood to run into that vessel until it is evacuated.
And if the one who performs the phlebotomy errs on their first attempt, repeat with a fleabottomia in that same place but slightly further up, for it is healthy; and do not fear harming them, but be mindful of the nerves as we have said.
Similarly, do likewise to the other foot in the same manner.
And for the sciatic vein, that place as we have said is below the ankle of the wild animal.
And the benefit of bloodletting for him is relief from hip pain when it is due to excess blood.
The procedure for bloodletting is as follows: The patient should enter a warm bath, and then vigorously rub their thigh from behind the hip down to the side of the calf on four fingers above the ankle with a thin, long cloth, ensuring it is not visible.
Once the affected area becomes visible, you should perform bloodletting according to your own method and as thoroughly as possible, it is better to do so across the wound; either by incision or excision, as the location of the condition is healthy.
This condition is common in men with enlarged feet; if you find another area and it does not appear to cause any pain, then treat a different part of the body which exhibits symptoms, such as the branch that appears between the little toe and the one next to it.
Be careful not to damage any nerves, and let out as much blood as you think is necessary.
Then release the tie and place a compress over the bloodletting site, securing it firmly but gently as the wound will heal quickly.
De ventozacio is about cupping therapy and its qualities or characteristics.
Ventosas (cupping glasses) can be made of horns, earthenware, or glass.
Cupping therapy is performed in two ways: one involves making incisions and extracting blood, while the other is cupping without any incision.
The cupping therapy without incisions is done in two ways: with fire or without fire.
The cupping glasses used for incisions and blood extraction are placed in fourteen areas of the body. The first area is called *alnocrati*, which is at the back of the head, near the nape. Another place is the middle part of the neck, equally distanced from both sides; next to the chin below the jawline but above the mouth; on both temples; on the shoulders' tips; on both elbows and wrists; and finally, on both hips.
Cupping does not draw blood from the large veins but instead from smaller vessels spread throughout the flesh, and thus it doesn't weaken the body like bloodletting; nor is it necessary to distinguish between cupping with or without fire for any illness except one caused by an excess of humours in which case all must be evacuated first.
Here is the translation of the provided text:
Here is my translation of the provided text:
The benefit of cupping on the nape is that when it draws blood to the head and into the hollows, yet better if this be a general evacuation from all over the body.
This cup is placed on the site for venesection of the cephalic vein.
And it is not to be used by anyone of a phlegmatic complexion, or in whom there is any catarrh, as it does him great harm.
And for this reason old people should not use it, nor those with weak heads.
But to the one who keeps on with it and is constantly having it done, memory fails; therefore you should tell the cupper to lay his hand lightly upon the cup at intervals for fear of destroying memory.
But cupping on the elbow is done at the site for venesection of the brachial and axillary veins: it also causes asthma, contraction of the wings of the nose, nosebleeds, coughing, and fullness.
And the elbow cup should be lightly pressed on, for if it is put down heavily, it produces weakness in the heart and stomach.
Here is my best attempt at translating the provided text:
And you should instruct the cupper not to press their hand during the scarification process so as not to cut into an artery and cause excessive bleeding.
Cupping over the chin causes intoxication in the mouth, gum disease, and similar illnesses that are present in the mouth, which can be likened to bloodletting from a patient's two lips.
Cupping that is performed over the two cheeks results in headache, which occurs due to an excess of heat.
Cupping over the inside of both elbows corresponds to bloodletting from three veins: the basilic, cubital, and cephalic. This process draws blood from all the smaller veins in the flesh and the tiny veins that feed into larger ones before ultimately reaching these three veins.
Instruct the cupper not to proceed with scarification if the area is bare of flesh and only nerves and arteries remain exposed.
It is a cup that, when applied over the buttocks, corresponds to hemorrhoids in the anus and deeper ulcers.
And now you should instruct the cupper to apply a strong and large cupping glass, as the area is very sensitive and requires a deep suction; also, light and subtle cuppings have been applied previously and the skin has been scarified with a scarifier.
Additional cuppings on the thighs are required due to an evident occlusion (blockage), as they redirect blood flow from the entire body, alleviating ancient pains of rheumatism and arthritis, as well as those of the womb; they also induce menstruation, relieve bothor and ademil, and serve as a substitute for two sophena phlebotomies, two ankle-bone extractions, and two hip extractions.
However, they greatly weaken the entire body and often cause syncope (fainting) in many men.
And regarding the ankle-bone cuppings, their efficacy is directly related to the effectiveness of the thigh cuppings.
The key consideration for the placement of cupping glasses is that you position them at the beginning of the treatment on exposed skin and apply a gentle suction; avoid prolonging the duration of their application but instead place them lightly, removing them carefully to ensure the humours (fluids) do not escape prematurely. And do not stop repeating this process until you see that the area has turned red, swollen, and the blood appears to be congested.
Then you make an incision and repeat the process of bloodletting little by little, taking into account the condition of the heart.
For that person who has soft flesh with few veins, it is enough to make one incision and not more, lest the area become ulcerated.
And instruct the cupper to intensify the incision and make it deeper, while moderating the bloodletting process.
If the blood is found to be thick, then it is necessary to make two incisions; during the first incision, you open up the pathway for the blood's refinement and thinning. The second incision is made to further investigate and examine the extraction of the thick blood.
And if the blood is very turbid or cloudy, then a third incision should be made to reach the ultimate thickness.
Lastly, when we want to extract the blood gradually or in small amounts, one incision is sufficient for us.
Here is my translation of the provided text:
And the term for scarification is only related to the depth of the cut.
If the scar is thick, hard, dark, and its pores are tight, it is necessary to lubricate the cupping sites more gently with open and resolving oils; if it is summer time, use aloe oil, violet oil, or almond oil; and if it is winter, then narcissus oil, lily oil, chamomile oil, or blood, as well as similar ones.
And if the superfluidity is thick and viscous, use pomegranate oil, mint oil, aloe oil, dill oil, or similar oils.
However, if the cupper has large pores and tender flesh, it is forbidden to use oil; instead, the cupping sites should be washed with rosewater or cold water from a spring, or with goat's milk, cow's milk, or something similar.
And for someone whose blood is of a moist temperament, wash their cupping glasses with sour wine or water made from myrtle and sumac, as well as something similar to those.
E de aquel del qual las superfluitatz son grossas, lava las suas ventozas am vi antic, o am aygua de sansuc, que es majorana, o de decoccio de anet, o de camamilla, e a lor semblantz.
And it is necessary that the cupping process be guarded before taking a bath; there must be supervision shortly after the bath for one or two hours, and sleep should take place with the cups still in place.
What needs to be considered when regulating cupping, or bloodletting before the cupping process.
It is important to consider the following at the beginning: if the cupper or bloodletter is choleric and has sharp, inflamed blood, it is necessary to take cooling substances such as acidic plums, bitter lettuce, endive, rocket, and herbal drinks.
And they should eat dishes like chicken, game birds, acidic meats, and similar foods.
For someone with a cold constitution, it is beneficial to drink almond syrup or rocket seed syrup, sumac juice, and fragrant wines; they should be advised to consume less alcohol and food, and avoid chicken meat, hemp seeds, peas, small birds, and doves.
And on the day of cupping or bloodletting, it is recommended that they drink more than they eat.

And it is placed on the sores when they appear in their navel or groin, because by virtue of its strong attraction, this herb removes the inflammation and eradicates the boil from its place.
Similarly, it acts when applied to the liver and spleen for those suffering from dropsy.
These swellings are treated with cupping, applied only with suction; some are treated with fire.
Some swellings are filled with cold water in diseases of the spleen.
This is why the cup should be filled up and made larger; it's just cold water or water in which suitable herbs have been steeped.
Form of cupping with fire: the width of the opening should be two digits, according to how we have formed it; and the amount of pressure should be half a palm; and on its side, in the middle circle, there is a small hole through which you can insert a needle.
It should be made of thick glass or crystal, fine, smooth, and clear so as not to hurt the body when it is placed over it.
And it is placed in the middle of his transverse abdomen with a rod or iron, where the candle with fire is applied.
And this bellows should be larger than the one we previously mentioned, and smaller for those who need less air according to their illnesses and age.
And the bellows for infants and exhausted people should be different from those used by young people or those with strong bodies.
The way to place this bellows with fire on the patient's body is by extending a piece of wood reasonably in front of a small wax candle, and placing it over the center of the transverse rod at the center of the bellows, so that the fire does not burn the patient's body.
Once it is placed on the patient's body part as we said before, keep your finger over the hole we mentioned earlier while the bellows are in use and you do not need to lift your finger for the steam to come out of that hole; then the bellows will work until they gradually deflate.
And grab the piece of wood according to its shape, and repeat this process if you need more of these.
Mays en ventosa que es aministrada en la malautia de plauressi, am aygua, en la qual no ha vergua transversa ni trauc, e no es aministrada sino que sia umplida de aygua, e es pausada sobre le membre tant solament.
And this is its shape: The larger the bellows are, the better they can receive a large amount of water.
This appears to be a chapter number or title in Roman numerals, which could indicate that this is part of a larger work such as a book or treatise. The value of "XCVII" in Arabic numerals is 97, so it might refer to Chapter 97 of a particular text. However, without further context, I cannot determine the exact meaning or title associated with this number.
Leeches are not administered on most body parts but only in those areas where the application of cupping is impossible due to their small size, like the ears and gums, or on a member devoid of flesh, such as the fingers and nose, including similar appendages.
And you should use those leeches that are found in clean waters tainted with mud.
Then let them be soaked day and night in muddy water until they are ravenous, ensuring there is no cause for any remnants in their bellies; subsequently, evacuate the body using bloodletting via flebotomy or cupping; then rub the patient's member until it reddens; finally, place the leeches on him.
And when they are full to capacity..." Here, I've translated the sentence up until the word "caso," which doesn't have an exact equivalent in English or any of the languages you mentioned earlier (Latin, Italian, Spanish, and French). It might be a regional dialect term or specific medical jargon from that time. If you provide me with more context or clarify what "caso" refers to in this text, I can attempt a translation for it as well.
And if it is possible to suction from the area using a ventosa (cupping device), it is even more beneficial afterward.
Otherwise, wash the area with vinegar and then with warm water; let it be rubbed and squeezed.
If the body's blood flow is prolonged by the use of leeches, and this is repeated, you should apply a cloth soaked in cold water, placing it over the area until the bleeding subsides.
And if the blood is excessive, then sprinkle over it powdered vitriol or substances similar to those with astringent properties until the bleeding stops; or apply to the area the warm husks of cooked beans and let them remain there until the beans become cold and the bleeding ceases.
Now, if necessary, repeat the application of leeches; when it is possible, change them.
And if the leeches are prohibited from being suspended (attached), then wash the area with fresh blood or insert a needle into the places until blood appears; and place them there, for they attach themselves as soon as they sense any blood.
And when you want them to defecate, sprinkle a little powdered aloe, or salt, or ash on those areas, and they will defecate soon after.
Just as the third part of the treatise begins, it is about restoration. This chapter is very useful and well-known in the art of medicine; it deals with the restoration of fractures and accidental dislocations of bones.
Oh, my child, know that this chapter is scoffed at by foolish doctors and common people, those who have never spent any time studying the works of the Ancients nor read a single letter from their books.
And for this reason, this method of the learned has been neglected in our land; and I have not forgotten it at any time, and have not added anything to what I have learned, except through a long reading of the books of the Ancients and studying their understanding, from which I extracted the science within.
And so I turned to experimentation and study throughout my life.
I have already described in this chapter all that my science contains and what has passed through my experiments; since I have summarized this for you others and freed you from the occupation of lengthy explanation; and I have abbreviated this at the end with a brief summary; and I have illustrated it at the end with a description; and I have provided notes on the forms of instruments used in it, as is done by way of addition in declaration, just as I have done in the two preceding chapters.
Chapter One.
This text is a summary or collection of information about bone fractures and their management, which serves as an introduction before beginning the detailed discussion of various fractured body parts and their specific treatments. Here is my best attempt at translating the provided text:

Here is my translation of the provided text:
Then return the patient to his previous routine with which he was accustomed.
And when the broken bone starts to heal, it is advised that the patient be fed with nutritious foods of substantial weight and density like wheat porridge cooked in water, rice, cheese, beef stomachs, eggs, fresh fish, wine resembling those, and with this routine, fracture coagulation occurs more lightly and better.
Know that broken bones in men who are either very young or elderly cannot be properly joined and consolidated according to their natural state due to the desiccation of their members.
However, nature always adjusts and binds the broken bone with a substance similar to glue in its consistency which adheres and strengthens what was once divided but now glued together, until it reaches an end point of strength and firmness like fire at the beginning, while no cause prohibits it from completing its work.
And due to this reason, it is necessary that you restrict the diet of the patient; foods in which are heavy, viscous and coarse, as we have mentioned.
And know that the types of fractures are varied depending on the different body parts; a fracture of the shinbone is different from that of the skull, and similarly, a fracture of the foot bone differs from that of the spine; likewise, all other bones are distinct from one another.
And I shall provide you with a recollection of all the different types of fractures, presented in their own distinct chapter separate from the others.
A variety of fractures within the same bone. The types of fractures within the same bone are diversified; there is an arcuate fracture and another that occurs in its sockets; some fractures occur along the length of the bone: such as comminuted, simple, compound and non-compound fractures, just like when a pen is prepared to write, or a depressed and disrupted fracture in the skull, or even a small fissure.
And it is necessary to use an iron tool or instrument for this specific operation, which will be explained in detail when we come back to the description of it.
Signs of bone fracture. And a bone fracture is known by the following signs: a twisting of it, and when there is a prominence or appearance upon feeling it, and also when you compress it with your hand.
And therefore, when there is no visible twist in the bone and upon touching it with gentle movement, the patient does not experience much pain, then it is not a fracture.
It is possible that there might be a twist or small crack, in which case you should not squeeze it with your hand and with pressure of the whole; instead, place on it one of the medicines which will be described later at this very moment which is suitable for the location; and then bind it tightly with fine strips.
And know that when the location is arched and not divided into two or any other such thing which does not happen in soft tissues, as if it were dislocated on all sides of its form, then you must begin from this hour to rectify it before it becomes an ulcer.
And if an abscess occurs, let it be left alone for a few days until the abscess subsides; then treat it according to any method you know of lightness and ingenuity.
Be aware that the restoration of the patient and their cure is lighter than the bone where this happens.
And then strengthen them according to when they will remember it.
But if the bone is affected, it is necessary to extend this broken limb by two parts, whether it be the hand or foot; or use your own hands if the limb is small; or with two ropes, or one rope and a hand.
And if it is the position you use to place the limb back into its natural shape while keeping the broken parts of the limb extended, then make sure to return those additions with ingenuity and according to any method that may be suitable for their places.
And be careful, according to your strength, not to cause the patient any pain or injury during your operation; and make sure that you apply one bone to its companion with all of your power so as to bring them together in their best forms.
And now it is necessary that in this hour you touch him with your hand and if you see any other cause, rectify it according to the quantity of your virtue.
Avoid violent extension and compression, as foolish doctors often do who cause festering sores by their operations, or bring about a contraction of the limb as we have seen in their cases.
The quality of the restraint for a broken limb is as I have described it here; you should know that broken limbs are diverse in their size and greatness, and also in how they break.
And for those who are smaller, like the arm, wrist, and fingers, it is recommended that the wrapping be made of very soft cloth.
For those who are larger, such as the thigh or leg, it is necessary that their wrapping be made of tough and rigid material, for a hard bandage firmly connects this large limb with tight pressure all around, so that no blemish may enter.
Then begin by immediately starting your evacuation of excrement, placing a suitable pad on the location of their injury with three or four wrappings according to how much you think this limb deserves; gently tighten these with your hands.
And so you will see that at the highest point of this area where their bone is broken, it should be less tightly bound than what you have applied to the fracture site. Then extend the wrapping slightly above the fracture site, loosening it little by little as you move away from this area.
Take another bandage and wrap it around this second layer above the fracture site, then reach for your first layers of wrapping from below; perform the same operations as we mentioned before, tightening and loosening these wrappings accordingly.
And then place between the folds of the patient's leg a lion skin or cloth that matches the curvature of the fracture, if there is any curvature; otherwise, do not apply anything to it.
And then place another bandage over it, and shape this wrapping appropriately with stitches that are made correctly as well, if there is no inflammation or abscess present in the area, but instead apply this to the abscess itself and drain the inflammation; leave it for a few days, and later you can tighten the stitches.
Whether the stitches are made with half of a reed each, or they have been skillfully crafted; perhaps they are made from wooden sticks; or from palm tree branches; and let their width be in accordance with this form and figure:
However, take care that the stitch which is applied over this fracture should be thicker and slightly smaller than the other stitches, and let its length match the size of the limb in terms of width; then tighten these stitches with another bandage according to your initial procedure; next, bind it above with adequate thread following what was said about tightness, so that the tightness of the binding is according to the location of the fracture more or less, such that the greater its distance from the fracture, the lesser the tightness.
And now it is necessary that the threads be finer in thickness and softer in material, and if they are too thick, as I have seen some fools do by using cords from their own clothing, this is a great mistake when considering how tight a suture must be.
And using fine threads is not suitable because you will not achieve the necessary tightness with them, and it should be ensured that there are less than a finger's width between each suture.
And if the patient is delicate due to the ends of the sutures being close to their extremities, then place soft linen or wool padding underneath so as not to cause them injury.
Sometimes a fracture may be accompanied by an open wound, and in such cases there may be disruption of the skin's continuity; I will address this further in the following section on specific cases.
Be aware that not all broken limbs can be immediately splinted on the first day; this is because when a limb is large, it should not be splinted until after several days have passed or up to a week, depending on your confidence in preventing development of an abscess.
And this is how poultices were applied in ancient times to restore fractures, dislocations, and sprains.
The method of applying poultices as a quick fix for fractures is particularly suitable for complicated cases and mostly for women and children, as it does not require any heat or friction: simply take some fine powder, which is the flour that accumulates on the walls of the mill due to the movement of the millstone.
And this is indeed so, but sieve it with egg white and make the mixture neither thick nor thin; then use it.
Another method of poultice for treating fractures, dislocations, and sprains is to take one dram each of asafoetida, labdanum, acacia, elecampane, and wild millet root; five drams each of myrrh and aloe; twenty drams of aloeswood; all are to be crushed, sieved, and mixed with garlic water or egg white if the patient's condition is sensitive; then apply this poultice, as it has a good composition and helps heal slightly broken bones and is suitable for many men.

Totz sian trissatz en mortier am mota contricio, e sian cribellatz, e sian comfitz am aygua o am album de huou e sia administrat.
Here is the translation of the provided text:
Moreover in this plaster there is not placed a restorative herb, but an abscess-causing and pain-expelling poison.
Another type of plaster that restores a blocked passage: take fresh leaves from the fig tree and leaves from the wild poppy; mix them all together and make a plaster out of them.
Way of abbreviated plaster administered for the restoration of a broken bone and when you want resolution of the remainder of an abscess: take roots of marshmallow, chamomile, and viola flowers, bran flour, all divided equally; have them all chopped finely and mixed with wine (if the limb is not lacerated).
But if it is lacerated, then mix the paste with coriander water or water, then apply.
Another type of very strong plaster for the resolution of a hard abscess during the restoration of a limb: take marshmallow roots and lily seeds, as well as flax seed, honeysuckle, marjoram, viola flowers, chamomile, all divided equally; have them all chopped finely and mixed with willow water or warm water or wine, all depending on the quality of the limb and the state of its color.
Here is the translation of the provided text:
In Wales, it has been observed that placing warm items on the broken limb contributes to its restoration and aids in healing; similarly, the application of substances like myrrh, alum, and others akin to those we have previously mentioned.
The method of making a plaster to provide relief and alleviate pain: Take equal parts of crushed nuts, human hair clippings, bird dung, marshmallow root, and salt; grind and sieve these ingredients together, then create a plaster.
The duration for which the bandage should remain in place and when it can be removed depends on whether there is any pain, swelling, or an indication of a broken bone; if these symptoms are absent, you may leave the bandage untouched for several days. And if the site exhibits severe pain, swelling, or inflammation, you should attend to it immediately; remove the plaster and tend to the wound.
Take a soft cloth and a moist sea sponge, dip it in warm water, and use this to clean the affected area until any swelling or pain subsides; then allow the limb to rest for an hour. Afterward, place over it a layer of fine wool soaked in vinegar or rose oil, bind it with bandages for one night, ensuring you address any internal abscesses, reduce inflammation, and alleviate the patient's discomfort.
And then repeat that delicate compression and apply a small plaster without tightening the first bandage too much, let it be gentle as it heals.
And if you see that the abscess, redness, pain, inflammation, and all other symptoms have completely subsided, and there is no longer a need for plasters or compression, then repeat the same procedure as you did initially.
And if there is no injury or damage to the affected limb that would require further attention as mentioned earlier, then do not remove the bandage for three to four days, or even five or seven; sometimes it can be left for up to twenty days depending on how quickly the healing progresses and the limb recovers its movement, as we have explained, allowing the fracture to heal properly and the flesh to knit together.
Then adjust the bandage more tightly compared to the initial one you applied, taking into account the patient's condition and how their body has changed since then.
If you notice that the fracture site has become drier and more calloused than before, understand that nourishment should be prohibited from reaching it. Therefore, moisten it with tepid water every time you remove the bandage; do this three times a day. Loosen the bandage slightly, and through this operation, blood circulation to the limb will improve, leading to faster healing.

And I have not seen anyone among them do this, which is why it is more reasonable not to do so.
Chapter Two: Regarding fractures that occur in the head.
The types of fractures are numerous, and their forms are diverse, with distinct causes. Some fractures occur due to the impact of space, where the force completely shatters the bone within the skull, similar to how it occurs in the trunk or body; this type is named 'ascia.' Or, the space penetrates a part of the bone, piercing through the flesh but not passing beyond it into the interior; this kind of fracture is called 'levatio absoluta.'
The extent of damage in these two types of fractures can be significant or minor, and there is also the type known as 'contritio' or 'attritio.' This occurs due to the impact of a heavy object or a fall onto rocks, which are similar causes.
This fracture can be penetrating, approaching the membrane beneath the bone, or it might be on the surface of the bone. The extent of damage in both these types of fractures can be extensive or minor.
E de fractura es que es ameguada en le os, en la subtilitat del cabel petita, e per aquo es nompnada aquesta specia fractura capillar.
Here is the translation of the provided text:
E majorment es fayt aquo en les cors de osses humitz, ayssi cum so caps de efantz.
And for all these types of leg fractures, they are also treated with separate splints. I will return to review everything in its proper place.
I knew all these types of fractures by detecting them and through inquiries about their pain, and the removal of corrupted flesh from them.
The capillary fracture is known as such because it is revealed on the bone, cleaned, and bound with thread, as the fracture appears black.
When treating fractures, one must first consider the patient's circumstances, and if you find that their symptoms indicate severe illness, such as vomiting bile, fainting, loss of intellect, loss of voice, syncope, acute fever, discharge from orifices, foul smell from those discharges, and other similar grave symptoms, then know that it cannot be cured.
If you see normal symptoms, then expect recovery and begin treating them.
The reason is that if the patient comes to you as a newly injured person at the beginning of treatment, and this occurs during winter months, then it's best to wait until after the fourteenth day since the bone injury according to all observations.
Here is the translation of the provided text:
Here is my translation of the provided text:
And if you are shaving the head of an infected patient and uncovering the bone as per custom and manner to your ability according to the shape of the infection, make sure it is light on the patient.
And if it happens that you need to detect the bone, blood flow, or a hidden abscess, then oppose it with what covers and fills it, and fill the area with cloths infused in wine and rose oil, let the infection rest until the abscess is sedated, and make sure there are no more blood flows; then begin the circumcision of the bone and its removal.
And this should be done in one of two ways of operation.
One way is to insert the bone with narrow straight scissors like these, and this is their shape: Then use another pair of scissors, slightly wider than the first; this is their shape:
Then apply the wider scissors over the second.
Ensure you have enough various scissors, some of which are wider than others; and some are shorter than the rest with sharp ends, made of Indian steel or iron.
And use your facilitators (assistants) to provide ease in striking the incision area, ensuring you do not hit his head and hurt him.
If the bone is hard and strong, then it requires that you drill into its surface before administering the incisions with non-penetrating tools, which are called shallow saws.
These tools are not called that (non-penetrating) but rather semi-deep saws because they do not reach the bone's depth at its end near the head; hence a saw has a round tip or edge, like an agate with a small circular margin, which prevents it from going beneath and through the thickness of the bone.
It is advisable that you take many of these saws, each suitable for the thickness of each bone, such that their tips are sharp, and in length and width they correspond to the amount of thickness present in this skull.
There are three types of saws: To break a bone, place the saw on it and rotate it with your fingers until you know that the bone has been penetrated; then change to another location, and put in something that is around half the thickness of the ray or thereabouts.
Here is my translation of the provided text:
And make sure with all caution that the scissors do not touch any part of the navel.
So when you have surrounded the perforating bone and separated it from the navel if it is attached to it, then remove that part. Then carve and shape that into a roughness of it which is on the bone using another instrument similar to scissors, but make sure this one is thinner and more delicate than other scissors.
And if any small bones or sinews remain, then take them out easily with the tool that is provided for you to do so; then treat the wound with lint and ointments as we have mentioned before.
And the other method of operation is light and distant from fear, as described by Galia and praised highly; this is an excerpt from their description: 'It is necessary for you at the beginning to start exposing the part of the bone in the place where the fracture is most severe and most visible, so that when you have exposed that area and placed under it the end of this slow and gentle scissors which has this form:
And it is the lens-shaped part which is wide and does not cut anything, while the sharp part emerges from it on two sides forward in length, at times; let the lens-shaped part be attached to the navel with its sharp side facing towards the bone.
Here is my translation of the provided text:
Lahoras si romania alcuna causa annexa al os del pannicol en alcus locs de os, inscidira aquel de lu am la extremitat del inscissori aquel lenticular, e deliuraria aquel de lu am facilitat, quar es deliurat de lu ses nocument e ses paor.
Here is my translation of the provided text:
And now you must administer in your ratio with which you reason the bone at the beginning using the largest of those razors, and then use the most subtle one, and do not cease doing this continuously until you reach administering the thickest and most subtle of all.
In any of the other small fractures or subtle breaks, it is necessary that you administer cure according to what has been lost in order to rectify it.
And this is the reason why it is not improved upon by all those who have studied that art. This is what we have demonstrated above regarding large fractures.
And if the flesh is protruding when you extract the bone, then you must take a cloth according to the amount of protrusion and submerge it in rose oil; place that cloth over the orifice of the wound. Then take another folded or tripled cloth and immerse it in wine and rose oil, placing it over the first cloth. Do this as gently as possible so as not to tear the skin. Afterwards, apply a wide bandage and do not pull on it unless absolutely necessary to accommodate the amount of protrusion.
Here is my translation of the text:
And you should prepare these powdered medications and sprinkle them over the wound, especially if it is dry; generally speaking, administer any medicine whose properties prevent pus from forming and the wound from rotting.
Make sure that the wound is clean and pure as you treat it according to your virtue; there should be no thick ointment or other substances on it; do not allow any virulent matter to come into contact with it, for when this happens, corruption spreads over the brain's membrane and will ultimately bring evil misfortune upon the patient.
And if an injury occurs on the skull, such as a fracture of the bone or when the cure is neglected and there's discoloration on its surface; therefore, if you notice any of these accidents that we've mentioned happening to the patient, know that it is highly detrimental.
If the discoloration is not from any matter but rather from the medicine applied on it and if this blackening is due to the properties of that particular medicine, then you should take some honey, three parts rose oil, and line a cloth with these; apply this cloth onto the skull fracture; cure it using the appropriate medicinal spices until it is healed.
Certainly! Let me translate the text you provided into English line by line:
De restauracio del nas quan es trincat." translates to "For the restoration of a broken nose."
Here is the translation of the provided text:
But if one of the two nasal bones is broken, you should insert your little finger into his nostril and adjust that fracture with your index finger inside and your thumb outside, until the nose resumes its original shape. And do this to facilitate the process for yourself, and be careful not to cause any additional pain or harm to the patient during your operation.
If the fracture is in the upper part of the nose and your finger cannot reach it, you must align it with the end of the bone where there is less thickness.
And if the fracture involves both bones, you should proceed in a similar manner.
Aim to restore the patient's health on the first day of the fracture if it is feasible; otherwise, you must wait seven or fourteen days for the swelling to subside.
Then insert a piece of linen cloth into the end of the nose; if the fracture involves one bone, use one compress; for two bones, use two compresses; and make sure the compress is thick enough to fill the gap in the nose.
Here is my translation of the provided text:
Here is the translation of the provided text:
And this cause is not necessary for you; and if you wish, do this, and if you wish, do otherwise."
And if there is another case of a raw abscess, apply an ointment to the nose with wax or tallow dipped in vinegar and rose oil, or use 'diaquilon'.
But if there is no raw abscess present, then you must apply an ointment externally made with sesame flour and powder of scorched bones mixed with egg white; then place a lion's fat poultice over it, and do not wipe the nose with anything.
But if the nasal bones are broken with a small fracture or crushed, you must first cut open the area and remove those pieces with instruments suitable for this; then stitch the wound, treat it with something that promotes flesh growth and bone healing, and apply appropriate ointments.
If there is an internal ulcer in the nose, you must treat it with cow dung and use lead tubes until it is completely healed.
It seems that this text may be divided into different chapters or sections, as indicated by the ".iiii." after "Capitol". If you provide me with the full text or the subsequent portion marked ".iiii.", I will gladly assist you with its translation and interpretation.
On the restoration of the jaw when it is dislocated."
When the jaw is broken but there is no infection in the fracture, check if the fracture is only on the outside and not split into two parts, and that it is not curved or displaced inside; then its prognosis is favorable.
And now, if the fracture is on the right side, insert your left index finger into the patient's mouth; similarly, if the fracture is on the left jaw, then use your right index finger; and with that, gently push the swelling of the fracture from inside to out with ease by using the outer part of your other hand; do this carefully until you align them.
If the jaw fracture has already separated into two parts, then you must apply extension to both pieces according to their original straightness until it is possible to realign them.
And if there is a dislocation with tooth concussion, then tie those that you expect to remain together with gold or silver wire or cedar; and then place wax over the broken jaw, then cover it with a doubled piece of cloth, and place on this a large star-shaped piece of linen of the same length as the jaw; then bind all this together in such a way that your device is suited for application without being destroyed.
And order the patient to rest and remain calm, and feed them a soothing diet of lentils.
And if you notice that the wound has changed shape in any way, then on the third day, cut and remove it; and restore what has been altered by covering it with powder of moleskin, egg white, or wheat flour, as you have removed its scab, and place a layer of lion's fat over the dressing.
And so when this dressing is applied and adjusted to them, and the bone's position is not altered, leave it there, do not remove it until the wound heals and the fracture strengthens; for many times, this fracture will heal in three weeks.
And if another abscess appears, then apply the treatments we have mentioned multiple times to soothe it until it heals and the abscess is drained.
And if the fracture is infected with pus, consider whether it's a broken bone piece or splinter, then carefully remove those splinters using an appropriate tool for this removal.
And if the abscess opening is narrow, then widen it using a fleam according to your need.

E la operacio en aquella, quan la fractura es ses plagua, es que tu fassas esser present dos ministres, per so que la un tengua le adjutori e siegua la furcula trencada, e l’autre extenda le col ves aquela partida.
And then use your hands to mould the fracture so that it takes on its proper shape and is not positioned in a prominent or concave area.
If you require more extension, place a pad made of cloth or wool under the patient's chin, its size should be appropriate to your needs; extend and raise the fork [? unclear medical device name], and with your hand, mold the sphere so that it adjusts the fracture as needed.
And if you cannot draw the ends of the fork outward due to it being attached to the bone [unclear if preon is a medical term or an error in the source text], then have the patient lie on their back and place a medium-sized pad on their chest.
Then the assistant should push on the patient's chest to separate the bones below so that the bone of the fork is raised up along with the bone it is attached to [unclear if preon is a medical term or an error in the source text], and once this is done, you can adjust and mold the fracture accordingly.
However, if you feel cracks in the fork's bone and they are bad [unclear if mauguda is a medical term or an error in the source text], then it is necessary to make incisions over this area and remove those fragments with ease.
And if it is retained in the bone, then you should make an incision using one of your scalpels that you have prepared for this purpose. Since you have placed a fork underneath to support the tool used for this procedure; and this instrument can be made of wood or iron, depending on its shape.
It resembles a spoon with its concave shape and adjust the width of it according to what is needed for the size or thickness of the bone.
Let the length of it be as convenient as possible for the operation and have two ends with one end being wide and the other narrow.
If the wound you have made by cutting through to extract the splinter from the bone is wide and there is pus present, then you should join the two lips of the wound with a suture.
If the wound is small or you are worried about pus forming, then fill the cavity with dressings and powders depending on the size of the wound.
If pus does form, then soak a dressing in vinegar, rose oil and wine and place it over the affected area.
And make sure the star-shaped wound is not over the broken bone; and for this reason you must see the patient every day to check that when the binding has softened or if you see the star shaped wound become bigger, then you correct it and tighten the bandage.
Then put the patient to sleep on their neck, and place a small cushion under their chin during the night; so that it raises his helper from the side of it, and therefore elevates the fracture of the furcula by raising the muscle; or tie their arm around their neck.
And do not remove the bandage unless there is a discharge or abscess at that spot within twelve days.
Then renew the plaster if you see his face turning blue due to that, and tighten it again while supporting him until such time as he is restored and the fracture of the furcula has knitted together.
And it is tightened and supported according to the month within twenty-eight days, and sometimes in some men it may be done sooner.
It seems you have reached the end of this text as there is no further information after your last query. Would you like me to summarise what we've covered so far?
De restauracio de fractura de la spalla.
Spatula tart is broken at his/her side and is not broken from him/her but its edges are.
And when his/her place is broken - and it is broken in the middle of him/her - and it is not known except by touching, then according to what the figure of the fracture forces you, prepare yourself for its treatment and reduce that fracture according to its natural shape in every way possible.
Then, place over the place powder of egg molars and galbanum; then place a cloth pad on top; finally, place a thin slice of waxed wood board according to the size of the whole spatula or slightly larger.
But if you leave the board with a concave shape in some places of the spatula, then fill that concavity with galbanum pads, and raise the board to make it even.
Then, strengthen it from above with long pieces of cloth tied tightly and secured firmly to the board so that it does not move from its place.
Pay attention to the bandaging each day; every time it becomes loose, tighten it again and secure it so that the board does not shift from its position.
And lay the patient onto his side.
The spatula is replaced after $20$ days or $25$.
And so when this number is complete, you untie the binding, and make sure that none of the bones are dislocated either from the beginning or during the dissolution.
And if you proceed to the place of the broken bone and put a chain there, then you divide it over that area, remove it, and do as we have said in the fracture of the furcula of saddle abscess caution if it occurs here.
It seems that there is no text indicating this is a chapter, only a dot followed by the number seven. Is there additional context you would like me to use for translation?
On the restoration of a broken foot.
Le pietz alcunas veguadas es romput en le mieg loc de lu e aquo tart endeve; mays las extremitatz de lu mot endeve que so ciccadas e comminuidas.
And for the accidents that occur when his ribs are broken, he bends towards the inner parts and experiences great pain, difficulty breathing, coughing, strong fever, and vomiting blood; this is clearly visible as there is a cavity in the broken bone which can be felt.
The restoration process involves turning the patient onto their stomach and placing a cushion under their shoulders; then press on their muscles and align their backbone with both hands gently during this operation as much as it is possible to do so in such a way that suits him, while restoring the bones to its original shape.
Then place a plaster and compress on him and put some thin strips of willow or poplar bark or something similar underneath in an elevated position since you will wrap that with cloth; then carefully bind this onto the broken bone without doing any harm; tie it securely around his back according to its roundness, and ensure a decent tightness; thereafter inspect the bandage every hour and tighten it whenever it loosens.
And if there is any need to provoke him into an unbinding of this due to the corrosion or itching, pain, or abscess that occurs in the area, then you must cut away and loosen the bandage and remove whatever it is that caused such symptoms by treating them accordingly; thereafter reduce the plaster, should his skin become affected; and restore tightness until he has healed.
It seems you provided me with multiple paragraphs of text. For now, I'll focus on translating the first paragraph you've shared:
De restauracio de las costas quan son trincadas."
Here is my attempt at translating the provided text: And make sure that his understanding is not clouded by emotion when questioning him.
And the restoration should be such that it aligns the fracture with these said splints in the most feasible manner, while also ensuring it is aligned as required, then plaster and strengthen the broken bone with a star-shaped apparatus if necessary.
And if the fracture of the ribs extends to internal organs, it causes intense pain and piercing sensation for the patient, similar to what happens with pleurisy, which is why they cover the bones with a cloth; this leads to difficulty in breathing, coughing, and vomiting of copious amounts of blood; this condition is very challenging to cure.
And the ancients have devised many devices for such ailments.
They say the patient's diet should avoid anything that induces inflammation and flatulence so as to prevent bloating or extension of the abdomen which could push the fracture onto external organs.
We could employ this technique to prevent the formation of superficial abscesses, as long as they haven't already appeared; if so, it will be helpful.
And some of them said that a bed should be placed above a window and then to draw out the air forcefully; this seems reasonable, but there is a fear that the window might suck up any superfluities through the weakness.
And some suggested that the area should be covered with wool that has been soaked in warm oil, and powders should be placed between the ribs before filling it up, making sure the bandage is like a glove when wrapping around for roundness; then treat the patient carefully with dietary cures and medicine for pleurisy.
If the patient is suffering from severe pain which they have not experienced before, and the bone punctures through the covering membrane, we fear for the patient's condition; thus, it is necessary to make an incision over that area, exposing the broken rib, and then place on top of it an instrument to keep the fracture in place, remembering to use the one previously mentioned, and to easily cut into the bone and remove the fragment.
Then we must join the two edges of the wound together, if it is large, with sutures, and treat it with poultices until it is healed.
If an abscess occurs internally, you should prepare and apply powders mixed with rose oil onto the area, and treat the patient with what is necessary to cure the abscess from within.
And make him lie down on his side, the one he usually sleeps on, until he recovers.
It appears that you may be referring to chapter 9 of this medieval medical treatise. If you provide me with the text from Chapter 9, I would be happy to translate it for you following the line-by-line format we've been using.
On restoring fractures of the vertebrae in the back and neck.
Some wounds present with fractures of the bones in the neck, and there is damage to their ligaments as well, similar to the vertebrae in the back. And when this happens to someone and you want to know if they will recover or not, consider this: if their hands appear softened, numbed, paralyzed, and unable to move or make a fist, and when you pinch them with your fingers or prick them with a needle and they feel no pain, then you should know that they are not healed. In such cases, it is often fatal.
If they do feel the pressure of your fingers and the pricking, then you know that the neck bone is intact and the patient will recover.
And if you see similar symptoms in the vertebrae of the neck and want to know their recovery prospects, consider their feet.
Here is my translation of the provided text:
But if none of these causes occur, then the cause is better and lighter.
The treatment for him is to make an incision at the base of the abscess and place on the painful vertebra either some warmed oil or a lot of chicken broth. Apply this several times during the day until the abscess has been drained.
Then apply one of the strengthening and stimulating plasters and cover it gently with a bandage, instructing the patient to rest and remain calm until they are healed.
And if the necrosis of bone or any other cause that has already separated from him occurs, then you must cut away the damaged portion and remove this piece of bone. Then draw together the two edges of the wound with stitches if necessary. Finally, treat it with an ointment for wounds until it is healed.
But if the posterior of the ischium bone has been fractured and it's at the end of the shaft, you must insert your left index finger into the anus to grasp the broken piece with your other hand as best you can; then place a plaster or splint over it if needed. Finally, bandage it securely.
E si sentes satagias trencadas en lu, lahoras tu fen sobre aquella, e osta aquel, e cura la plagua am la curacio que es precedida entro que sia sanada.
Chapter 10.
On the restoration of the hernia.
The bones of the hernia are not usually broken, but if they break, the fracture is merely a communication between the ends of those bones and a sinking in of their extremities; there is also a deviation towards the parts within; this causes pain to the patient at that spot and a stiffness of the limb when it is fractured.
And for its restoration, you should place your hand on that part which is over the fracture in such a way as to imitate its shape.
And if the fracture is only at its end, then you should align that part according to what appears appropriate by approximation and equality until it resembles its natural shape.
But if the fracture is at its middle or there is already a deviation towards the parts within, then you should make the patient lie on their belly so that you can prepare for the restoration of that fracture. And when you have aligned that part, place a plaster on it, then place over the plaster either a wooden splint or an iron one; bind this tightly so that you fear neither movement of the fracture nor displacement of the splint.
And fill the cavity with something that fills up the space where there is a constriction according to equality, and command the patient to sleep on his back or side.
If there is a sudden abscess, then cease the extension of it and its restoration until the abscess has been suppressed or reduced in size, and place on it whatever soothes as previously mentioned; thereafter return to restoring it, and bind it as tightly as required.
And if it happens in the bones, whether they are shattered or broken, then you must treat them.
In medieval medical texts, a "capitol" typically refers to a chapter or section of the treatise. So, this likely indicates that the text has reached Chapter 11 or Section 11.
On the restoration of a fracture in the clavicle.
Adjutori is what lies between the elbow and the top of the shoulder.
And if it is broken, its restoration can be done in one of two ways. One way is to take a wooden splint of medium thickness and shape it like this:
And if both ends of the ligament are torn, it should be suspended from an elevated position.
Have the patient sit on a chair; then, extend their broken arm over a wooden splint so that its midpoint reaches the patient's wrist where there is a curve in the splint.
Then place some heavy object over it, or else have the assistant stretch the arm at its extremities; meanwhile, let the doctor hold the fracture with both hands until the bone returns to its proper alignment.
The other method is to have the patient lie on their back and suspend the hand of his neck with a ligament; then instruct two assistants to place themselves, one above the fracture holding it with both hands, while the other stands below; each should stretch at their end.
And if you want the extension to be stronger, then you pull on the fracture with a ligament and on that with another ligament, and each of the two ministers pulls at their respective ends.
And if the fracture is close to the end of the muscle, then half of the ligament should be placed on the wrist and the other below the fracture towards the elbow.
Similarly, if the fracture is close to the elbow, then it should be placed on that spot and over that elbow.
Secure that with ease and its work, then when it is secured according to what is required and applied with a good application, pull on that if no swelling occurs suddenly.
But if swelling occurs suddenly, then leave the ligature in place for seven days, and put on it a moist woolen cloth soaked in vinegar and rose oil until the swelling subsides, then pull on that again.
The way to pull on that is by putting a plaster over the fracture and then wrapping it with clean cloth; adjust the arm onto that support, and place their hand open over their muscle.
And place a cloth and bandage over the arm support so that the arm is held in place, unless there is some reason not to do this due to a broken bone.
And then use splints.
And make sure you place that splint over the fracture which is thicker and stronger than the other splints; leave a finger's width between each splint, and let their length be according to the break plus three fingers' breadth on either side.
And then bandage over the splints with the binding method I described at the beginning of this chapter.
And make sure your bandage over the fracture site is very tight. And as the fracture gets longer, let your binding be looser.
And so if you see that the splints and binding are in place as we have described, at this point you will restore the limb to its proper position.
And if you fear suppuration, then leave the bandage and splints in place for seven days as we have described.
Here is the translation of the provided text:
But if you are confident that nothing will happen, then do not remove the bandage for at least three days or more.
And let the patient's sleep be on their back, with their hands placed over their stomach.
Place a clean, woolen pad on the assistant's arm, and make sure to check at all hours of the night or day that the shape of the broken limb remains undisturbed and the bandaging is not loosened; therefore, adjust it as needed with your skill.
Feed the patient according to the order we mentioned before: let their food be light at first while they start recovering strength, and later make it more substantial.
By custom, the assistant and servant should stay close for forty days; afterwards, they can be released and the patient given a bath and treated with ointments to heal their ailment.
If the fracture is a badly-aligned one, then do not remove the bandage and splints for at least thirty days or up to two months.
Certainly, let's continue translating this medieval medical treatise:
De restauracio de fractura del bras.
Bras is composed of two bones which are called the ulna and radius; where the first one is small, it is the bone under the index finger, and the other is big, it is the one that lies under the little finger, from the side below.
And it is likely that only the larger bone (the ulna) is broken, or just the smaller one (the radius), and it is also possible that they are broken together.
And when the smaller bone (the radius) is broken above, its restoration is easier, and its healing is also lighter.
And when the bone (the ulna) is broken below, its fracture is bad, and its healing is difficult.
And worse than that is when both bones are broken together.
Therefore, if the bone that is broken is the smaller one (the radius) above, it is beneficial for the doctor to make its restoration with a small extension, facilitating that it is splinted easily.
But if it is the larger bone (the ulna) that is broken, then a stronger extension should be applied.
And if both of the legs are trapped together, then it is necessary for you to place the pressure much harder.
And when you make the shape of the hand, it should be restored and extended over a cushion, with its wrist being at the level above everything mentioned before, while the little finger is lower than all other fingers mentioned previously,  and let the patient rest on their side using a comfortable pillow.
And there should be another cushion placed in front of them at the same height or a bit higher to prevent any strain on the patient.
Then the assistant extends their arm from below with their hand or wrist, while another assistant does it similarly from above.
Then the doctor aligns the bone until reducing it to its best possible shape.
And if there is an injury on the bone surface, you must repair it by reducing all pieces back into their place with your strength.
If there is a separated injury and you are not hopeful about the patient's recovery, then close it with stitches as described above.
But if the fracture is accompanied by an abscess, I have already dedicated a separate chapter to this, so now proceed to its treatment.
And if an abscess occurs during the beginning of your treatment process, you should apply a plaster made with rose oil and white wax, ensuring it is mild yet firm, and gently wrap it around the affected area until the abscess subsides. Then remove the plaster, apply an ointment prepared with chicken fat powder, and secure it in place; let this poultice be placed on both sides of the fracture firmly.
Keep in mind that the number of poultices applied to the arm depends on the severity and location of the fracture; it could be one if there's a single break or two if they are compound fractures.
Then apply your bandage firmly over the fracture site with extra force and vigor, ensuring that as you move away from the break towards both ends of it (above or below), the tightness of the bandage becomes slightly more gentle in comparison to how you started.
The cloths used to wrap around the fracture should be soft and moist, not rough or stiff, and the thread with which they are tied must strike a balance between fine and coarse, as we have previously advised.
And examine the limb and its ligament after a few days. And if any cause occurs that requires correction, such as pain in the limb, then it is necessary to immerse the limb in warm water until the pain subsides.
Allow the limb to remain unrestrained so that it may rest, then return the bandage.
And if the bandage has already softened and the bone is nearly united and resembling its original state, then rectify everything with your skill.
Examine further if the nourishment is prevented from reaching the limb due to excessive bandaging, as in that case, you must loosen it slightly and leave it for a few days until nutrition reaches the affected area; then strengthen the bandage.
But if the patient does not experience any of the aforementioned causes, then there is no need to loosen the bandage for approximately twenty days.
Then have the patient's hand suspended by their own strength of movement, and let them sleep on their back.
E sapias que aquesta fractura es restaurada en xxx dias o en xxxii dias, o fort leu es restaurada en xxviii dias, e tot aquo es segon la disposicio de las compleccios e las disposicios de la vertut.
Chapter XIII.
Regarding the restoration of fractures in the fingers and hands:
Know that in cases of fractures in the fingers or knuckles, one must proceed with caution and apply visible compresses of cloth.
When treating a fracture or dislocation of the hand, it is necessary that the patient be laid down and covered with a warm blanket according to their comfort, then place their hand on an extended surface.
The assistant should extend the broken bones, and the doctor must realign them with care until they are properly aligned.
Then, one must apply a plaster and bandage it with cotton wool, unless an abscess forms in which case it should be drained; place a sterile cloth over the area according to its size, and wrap it with clean linen.
However, if the fracture is in the joints inside the palm of the hand, make a small sphere with linen and instruct the patient to squeeze it tightly with their injured hand; then secure it with long strips of cloth.
And let there be a star-shaped piece of cloth that is raised and supported by the palm of your hand, in such a way as to apply pressure where needed.
If the fracture is at an outward angle, then place one star-shaped piece above and another below it on your palm, keeping your hand open and straight; then apply pressure as if you were turning your hand over with your fingers tied together.
And if there is a fracture at one of the knuckles of these fingers, and it's the thumb that is affected, then adjust it as needed and apply pressure with your palm; if you wish, place a small straight splint on it so that the fracture is elevated and not deformed.
But if the fracture is in any of the other fingers, such as the one in the middle position, or the index finger, or the little finger, or the ring finger, then adjust it and bind it with the adjacent finger; or you can tie all of them together in a row, which is better; or place over it a small splint, as we said for the thumb.
And keep in mind, during your treatment and healing process, the development of an abscess. Be cautious and take appropriate action—through a small operation if necessary—to address any causes that may lead to such issues, as mentioned repeatedly in this narrative.
I can certainly assist with translating this medieval medical treatise into English. Here is my line-by-line translation of your provided text:
When there is pain in the joints caused by excess humidity within the body, doctors call this podagra.
The bone of the hip, which is clearly broken, will be declared so when it has been moved both forward and upward.
To restore the break, it is done this way: A strong bandage is placed over the fracture and another one under it; The patient lies on their stomach with their face down.
Then the minister extends the bandage to its limit according to its quality when the fracture is in the middle of the bone.
But if it is closer to the hip joint, then place the bandage below at the limit of extension, so that the extension stays in place, and the other bandage remains under the fracture.
Similarly, if the break is closer to the bottom, then place the bandage underneath and have its extension at the limits below.
Then the doctor should join both bones back together with their hands before returning it to its original shape and ensuring a good union; It is necessary to apply a plaster cast and keep it tight, otherwise, the member might become infected. If it happens in an abscess, then let it be left for a few days until the abscess subsides, and then return to your treatment.
For this fracture to be treated: you must wrap around the fracture a hard bandage, and fold it over two or three times, removing any excess; then wrap the leg until you reach the ankle and the root of the calf.
Insert a long pin between the calf and the leg close to the fracture, and let the ends of the pin protrude from the most superior point of both parts; then rotate around the leg and calf what is superfluous of the bandage.
Then place splints over the calf in the area of the fracture, and put a star-shaped one over the bone of the leg.
Fill the spaces between the leg and calf with soft cloths, to promote clotting in the fracture.
Begin with a tight binding of the wound over the fracture area using three or four wrappings, and as you move away from the fracture location, make your bindings less strong and more gentle.
Here is my translation of the given sentence:
Certainly, let's continue with the translation:
Here is my best attempt at translating the provided text:
And sometimes this fracture of the hip is treated by adjusting it with stars or similar things that we mentioned in the section on the arm.
However, when restoring the patient in this manner, it does not cause them to limp; and if only one side is restored or an additional leg is applied, then they will always limp on that same side.
Know that the hip fracture is treated within forty days or slightly more or less, and this depends on the variety of complications and other factors.
Chapter 15.
On the restoration of the fracture of the knee joint.
Know that the fracture of the knee joint often leads to stiffness; however, in many cases, it can also cause atrophy.
If the fracture occurs in the knee joint, it is merely a fissure or tear on its sides; this can be considered either an acute injury or not so much and should be gauged by feeling.
And the restoration of the patient is done in this way: what has been broken or separated from their body parts should be replaced and joined together as much as possible through approximation, ease, and careful construction.
Then apply a plaster and place it over that round mold if needed; secure it tightly with bindings appropriate to the situation.
Then consider all the measures we have previously recommended for other fractures, such as avoiding abscesses and similar issues; take precautions against any adverse events that may hinder the patient's recovery.
It seems you might have provided an additional detail or reference number for this medical treatise, which could indicate a specific section or chapter of the text. If you provide more context or share the full text, I'd be happy to offer a more comprehensive response!
Certainly! It seems we have now reached the title or heading of this particular chapter, which translates to "On the Restoration of a Leg Fracture."
Here is the translation of the provided Latin-like text:
Here is my translation:
And if two bones are dislocated together, then the leg is turned at all angles.
And if the most delicate bone is dislocated, then the leg is turned towards the front.
And if the largest bone is dislocated, bring that one below, and it is of those causes which are not easily cured.
Then administer extension, correction, and reduction of the bones according to that alignment.
However, be aware that if the leg fracture has many splinters with sharp edges, then the extension should be less and more gentle, and rely on your skill.
And when there is any cause of operation on the arm, and it happens that you align the bones and complete the entire surgical process, then you will take pieces of pinewood which are placed underneath the patient's causes which lie in bed; make those out of palm branches, tying some to each other with string. They should be of small thickness but not too bulky, and their length should match the length of the arm, reaching down to its lowest point.
E aprop envolopa sobre quascuna drap en doas envolucios segon la longitut de lu, e pausa la una sobre la partida de la camba de la una part e l’autra del autra part, e sian del denol entro al pus bas loc del pe.
Here is my translation of the provided text:
And a wooden board has been administered according to the length of their leg; it is placed on them, keeping that part immobile.
Most importantly, do this in the case of a fracture, which is properly called 'plague'.
Then consider the leg daily and examine it from behind to check for any signs of abscesses or inflammation or similar issues; and if you notice any of these conditions occur, immediately attend to them with appropriate treatments that aid in healing.
It seems there is no text for me to translate in your message. Would you like me to assist with another translation or perform a different task?
On the fracture of the talus and bones of the foot, as well as those mentioned above.
The talus bone rarely experiences complete fractures; instead, some of the foot bones may fracture on occasion; and the toes of the foot are seldom fractured, only occasionally experiencing dislocations.
And if the bones of the foot fracture and those bones become raised among themselves, then the patient should place their foot on prepared ground as they walk.
And then place one foot on what is elevated from those bones, and then press down on them, pushing and forcing them back into their places.
And then put an ointment and bandage over it, placing below the belly of the foot a small board with two flat ends.
Then stretch that foot with descending pressure because you have wrapped it in bandages and other necessary supplies.
And when three or four days have passed for him, then you can untie the bandages as you will find the bones pushed back into place, either fixed or displaced and so the operation on them is thus complete.
But if some say they are fixed, then restore those bones and push them back into place as I have also instructed you in the restoration of the bones of the hand. Then place the fixed finger under the bar according to its length, and let it be slightly raised on either side of it; then put the foot on this board which was described to you earlier, stretching it with descending pressure.
But if what is dislocated in the bones are two or three or more, then place on each finger a splint of its corresponding size wrapped in linen cloth, and fasten it to the base of the foot, and let them be held over one end of the board through the sole of the foot so that they have good retention.
And it is important for you to remember that all the causes mentioned previously, regarding other types of fractures and injuries we have discussed, should not be overlooked; apply this knowledge appropriately when dealing with any type of mishap.
Chapter XVIII: The Management of Head Injuries.
On the fracture of the pubic bone in women, as well as the ischium and coccyx bones in men.
When the pubic bone of a woman is dislocated, make an incision in the divided labia, and then bend her slightly at the waist, holding her from behind.
Then the midwife should fill the pubic region with cotton, and it should be done in her so that it resembles a hope chest; afterwards, the woman should be shaken, and slowly lift her waist, as all of this is forgotten before she stands facing forward again, returning to how she was originally, with the dislocated bone back in place.
Here is the translation of the provided text:
And continue doing this for about seven days until the patient is restored to health.
If you wish, take a sheep's bladder and insert a hollow cane into the patient's rectum; then introduce the entire bladder into their anus, and proceed to blow air through the cane until the bladder is fully inflated inside the rectum, as this will cause the fracture to heal.
It should be filled with hot coals and left for several days as we have instructed until it is fully healed.
When the bone of a man's or woman's forearm is broken, administer the treatment and cure as we have recommended for the hip bone.
What I have written here is not hidden and should not be concealed in these common fractures that rarely occur; especially for those who are well-studied and familiar with the use of my book; for this fracture signifies to you one of the most important procedures through legal means regarding the treatment and healing process, so understand it well.
When the man's penis is broken, take a goose's oviduct and insert the penis into it; then place it on a cloth wrapping and wrap it up, afterwards leave it for three days or so, and it will be healed.
Capitol .xix.
De restauracio de fractura dels osses quan es am plagua."
Here is the translation of the provided text:
Here is the translation of the given sentence:
And then begin to restore the fracture on that very day, and do not delay it, lest an abscess occur.
But if an abscess does occur, then you should leave the restoration of the patient until the tenth day, after the abscess has subsided. Do not approach them on the third or fourth days at all, for you will cause harm and bad outcomes.
But if the broken bone is protruding through the skin, know that you must first reduce it and align it with your hands gently and with minimal extension.
If extension is not ready for your manipulation and the alignment with your hands, then you reduce it with your hands using this instrument; this instrument is made of iron, its length being seven or eight fingers long, and its width according to the size of the wound; and for this, it is necessary for the doctor to have three or four of these instruments depending on what is required for treating different types of fractures.
And it should be round, with little thickness so that it does not bend, and ensure there is no compression on the wound during the operation.
And its sharp end should be of equal width throughout its length; and let the upper part of it taper gradually to thickness, and at its middle point divide into two parts.
This is how it should look:
And in Greek, it is called 'labra voluntas telarum', which means 'the small weaver's shovel'.
Because the point should be placed with its sharp end raised up above the top of the bone.
And pierce that with a probe in the hollow behind it which goes round to its back, and make sure you keep your finger on it.
Then try to force the ends of the fracture apart from each other; and if the broken end is slender and does not readily admit the instrument, then you must insert the end of that bone until the instrument can take hold of it.
But if you cannot reduce the bone entirely by all that we have described, then cut it with one of those knives which we mentioned or saw it off with one of the saws in any way that is possible to you.
And then remove what remains in the bone of roughness and small scratches.
And when the bone is reduced but then the patient experiences severe pain again, know that the bone has not returned to its natural position; therefore, do this as it will greatly benefit the patient.
Once you have completed the restoration of the bone, immerse a cloth in black styptic wine and apply it; especially if it is summer, do not place any wax or oily substance on the wound as this may cause infection and corruption.
Then administer stars during the hour of your completion of the bone restoration, and leave the wound uncovered so that it may dry out; in this way you will cauterize the wound with hot irons and use wrappings according to the amount of discharge.
Take utmost caution not to stretch the wound at the fracture, as ignorant doctors have done this before and caused death or severe illness to their patients; only healing can be obtained through this method. And if your constriction is light, soft, and different from other fractures...

Here is my translation of the provided text: And for those [injuries] that are separated, removed, and not reunited with the member, causing pain, you must incise them according to your ability.
And if there is swelling or inflammation of the wound, or any other kind of corruption and putrefaction, it is necessary to apply to each one water that is appropriate for its cure, as has been described in this chapter.
And here my speech should end and you must perform your part: when the bone is broken, protrudes above the member like the bones of the hip or thigh, resembling those of large members, and you do not attempt its reduction or extraction due to some evident reasons that may occur because of this, let it remain there, as it will fall off by itself within twenty or thirty days; and then treat the wound if you are able to see it, otherwise leave it be.
The number ".xx." likely refers to chapter 20 of the medieval medical treatise. Is there another section or text from this source you would like me to translate?
On the treatment of swelling that occurs in the vicinity of any fracture."
Here is my translation:
Here is my line-by-line translation of the text:
And leave the bandage tight so that it does not loosen for many days; and then loosen it and repeat another one while the knot is moistened; or put a compress of lead over it appropriately, because lead has the property to reduce anything swollen in the limbs.
If the knot has already turned into a stone-like mass and is hard but needs to be treated by being covered with hot cloths, then make an incision on its highest part and remove the superfluous and prominent tissue or excise it so that the wound is moistened; and treat the patient until they are cured.
It seems you may have provided an incomplete prompt, as "Capitol .xxi." appears to be part of a larger text or instruction that is missing context. Please provide additional details if you would like me to assist with a specific task related to this fragment.
On the restoration of fractures, when it is restored but then this limb remains weak and feeble not according to its nature.
When a bone fracture is restored, but the limb remains weak and feeble, this occurs for several reasons: one of which is the excessive discharge of its ligaments and their connection being lost as it should be; or due to excessive tightness in these ligaments preventing the nutrient from reaching the limb; or because of an excess of unnecessary ointment; or due to superfluous movement at the wrong time; or because of a lack of blood in the patient's body and their weakness.
And the treatment for this is to feed the patient and make their heart tender until their blood has multiplied; administer baths; and instill joy and happiness upon them.
Then place clay on the affected limb, so that the clay draws out excess moisture and nutrients; or continue to anoint them with thick water until the nourishment flows back into its natural shape.
I am unsure what you mean by this, but I could interpret it as "Chapter 22". Would that be correct? Feel free to ask me more about the text if there are any other aspects of it you wish to explore further.
Regarding the treatment of broken bones when they have been set incorrectly, prohibit any further operation or movement that could disturb their healing.
When the healed member begins to be affected by an incorrect setting and prominence of the broken bone, and as a result its shape is deformed, yet the member is not prevented from performing its natural functions, then it should not be considered newly broken.
But there have been many ignorant doctors and healers who have done this in our land, and this operation is highly censured, leading to great fear as its signal is often fatal.
Mays si claudicacio e nodacio son recentz, lahoras cove que sian enbrocatz am aygua tebeza en la qual so coytas erbas mollificantz, ayssi cum son fuelas de altea e razitz de lu, e mellilot, e semblantz ad aquels; e sia fayt a lu emplastre am emplastre mollificatio ayssi cum dyallaquilon ben fayt: If the disability and swelling are recent, then it is necessary to apply tepid water with softening herbs such as marshmallow leaves and roots, meadow lilies, and similar plants. Also, make an ointment for them using a softening ingredient like diellaquillon well made; or take a poultice of marshmallow root and bind it with goose grease or almond oil, then spread the poultice on the affected area; or prepare fatty figs by pounding them with dove feathers, as well as other similar substances from medicines called consolidation ammans.
And at times it is resolved through gentle but persistent friction using the moistest hands; and ensure that the affected member is moved frequently in all directions during all hours of the day.
If the twisted condition has already progressed and become severe, turning into a stone-like substance that requires metal to treat it, then it is necessary to cease the practice above [likely referring to the twisting or manipulation of the affected area] and dissolve any subsequent bone deformities; carefully cut away unnecessary swelling around the bone using fine knives; and provide ease and careful consideration in this matter.
Here is my best guess at translating these sentences:
De sermo en dislocacio."
Dislocation is the displacement of any joint from its normal position, which restricts movement and results in an altered appearance of the limb, causing severe pain and injury to the patient.
Therefore, when dislocation occurs, you must act quickly to either perforate or reduce it, and do not delay in performing the reduction as this will lead to abscess formation at the joint, making the process of reducing the dislocation much more difficult.
And for this reason, the patient should not be massaged or stretched during the time of abscess formation as it often leads to muscle spasms and increased pain.
But when this happens, you must perform flebotomy on the patient and then let the abscess drain naturally; after that, the limb should be treated with warm water and oil, which will make reducing the dislocation much easier.
And every limb should be treated with what will restore it to its original place.
I have already organized the chapters on dislocation according to what follows after fracture, starting from the uppermost part of the body and moving downwards.
Title: Chapter XXIV
De curacio de dislocacio de la mandibula dejos.
Here is my translation of the provided text:
But when the dislocation is small, it often returns on its own with little effort.
However, if the dislocation is complete and severe, it requires gentle reduction and should not be delayed at all.
And let the minister hold the patient's head, and insert the doctor's finger(s) with their hand into the root of the dislocated jaw inside the patient's mouth if it is a one-sided dislocation; or insert both fingers if it is a two-sided dislocation, while the other hands of those assisting are outside matching theirs; then command the patient to close their jaws and bring them together again; as the doctor matches the jaw and pushes it back into place until it returns to its correct position.
If the reduction is difficult, especially when both jaws are dislocated on either side, then administer vapour with warm water and oil until a gentle reduction of both can be achieved without delay in reducing them back to their correct positions as we have said.
And so when they have returned and are matched, but the patient's mouth remains closed and is not softened, then place over them cloths soaked in a powder made of wax and rose oil; and let it be done gently with soft bindings.
Here is the translation of the provided text:
And this should be administered with ease, and do not work on the perception of taste in their mouth when it comes to eating or drinking; rather occupy them with some task, while ensuring that their jaw is bound and healed.
If it is difficult to reduce the dislocated jaws back into their proper places, then this may lead to high fevers and persistent acidity, and often the patient's stomach becomes disturbed, and they frequently experience a bout of pure vomiting.
And when you observe this, understand that it leads to a point of no return; most often the patient will pass away due to these complications within ten days.
The Roman numeral XXV corresponds to the number 25, so this may be an indication that this is chapter 25 of the medieval medical treatise or text. However, without further context, I cannot determine its exact meaning or significance in relation to the rest of the content.
This appears to be the title for chapter 25, which translates to:
Furcula is not dislocated from the side within due to its continuity with the feet; and sometimes it is dislocated outwards at that point, and this is apparent to the touch.
And for restoration, the patient should be placed on their back and extend their arms. Then compress the area with your palm with strong pressure, for it will return (to its place).
And then place an ointment and powder dressing over it and bind it tightly.
The extremity of the one who cuts the bone and it is continuous with that (bone), is not dislocated on any day; so it must be reduced and fastened as we have said and according to what is available in your equipment.
And then place an ointment and powder dressing over it, apply a bandage tightly, and instruct the patient to adhere to tranquility and rest until they are healed.
And in this method of treatment, the extremity of the muscle is reduced when it is separated from its place.
It seems that you are referring to Chapter 26 of a medical text or treatise. Is there another sentence or chapter you would like me to translate?
De la reduccio de la dislocacio del muscle." translates to "On the reduction of a muscle dislocation.
Sapias que·l muscle no es dislocat sino segon tres manieras, de las quals es la una que sia dislocat a la partida del titillic a la partita dejos." translates to "Know that the muscle is not dislocated in only three ways, one of which is when it is dislocated from the root down.
E la segonda es que sia dislocat a la partida desus del muscle, e aquo es fayt tart; e no es dislocat a las partidas detras per la spalla; e no es dislocat a las partidas denant per les nervis." translates to "And the second way is when it is dislocated above the muscle, which happens rarely. It cannot be dislocated behind through the shoulder, nor in front by the nerves.
E majorment es dislocat e defora eyssit a las partidas dejos deves le titillic, e majorment en aquels dels quals las carns son paucas, leugierament es dislocat; mays en aquels en les quals so motas carns, es eyssit fora am dificultat." translates to "It is usually dislocated and exits below the root, especially in those places where there is little flesh, it is lightly dislocated. But in areas with more flesh, it comes out with difficulty.
E fort leu accideys ad alcus homes percussio o cazement, e le muscle de lu es apostemat de apostema caut, e es cujat per aquo que ja sia dislocat." translates to "And very rarely does it happen that a man receives a blow or fall and his muscle becomes inflamed with an enclosed inflammation, and is thus fixed because it was already dislocated.
Adonc cove que tu sproes aquo entro que estias sobre-sertetut de lu, e lahoras procesiscas en la curacio de lu.
When the dislocation of [the patient] is at the points below the ears; so that you can distinguish between the dislocated muscle and the healthy one, since there will be clear differences between them; and you find on the head of the muscle a concavity below the ear; touching the head of the muscle, it's like an egg, and to the patient is impossible move his hand to his ear or reach it with any movement.
If the foot or ankle is dislocated, and you find a clear bump there that cannot be hidden.
In this case, when the patient is young and [the injury] is recent there's an easy reduction of the dislocation.  *Note: 'le' means 'the' in the original text.*
The reduction [of the injury] is when an attendant lifts the patient's arm above their head and places his arms under the ear of the patient, then raises the joint with strength to its place; as the attendant lifts the hand of the patient, he stretches it upwards and gently lays it back down.  *Note: 'dejos' means 'under'.*
But if after all that we have said it doesn't return to its place and [the injury] is recent then it's necessary for the patient to take a bath in warm water and be given an infusion that softens and calms like grated turnip roots of Althaea, fenugreek, honey locust in water, and be administered. *Note: 'mays' means 'but'.*
Here is my translation of the provided text:
Here is the translation of the provided text: But if the patient is weak, then let something else be suspended on them to weigh them down, because the dislocation can return quickly.
And it is reduced in another way as well: let a long piece of wood be placed on the ground with its head rounded like a mortar pestle that isn't too thick or thin and then place the patient underneath; since cloths have been placed over the top of the wooden pole, and the patient stands according to the length of the wood, then extend their arm to one side while their body is extended in the other direction with force because the joint will quickly return to its proper position.
And if it is difficult to reduce the patient due to all the reasons we've mentioned, then use this treatment method: take a wooden pole that is two yards in length and four fingers in width, and its thickness should be as wide as your index finger like so...
Then at the rounded end, secure it with some linen cloth to ensure that the pole doesn't injure the patient.
And place it beneath the patient's armpit, and have them stretch out their arm or hand over the pole towards the other end, then tie the wooden pole to their helper's forearm as well as the patient's own arm and hand.
Now place the arm on a step of the ladder according to its latitude, and let the hand be extended downwards, while the other body is suspended from the opposite side, for the joint will enter promptly.
And when you have completed the insertion of it in every way that is possible to you, then you must place a tickling stick above the affected area with as much woolen material as seems appropriate; and then place a plaster prepared from powder of moly with oil of lilies over all the muscle, so that it may be stirred up, and then press the tickler down with decent tension; and let the bandage be wound around the plaster, and his hand attached to his neck, and let him be left in this position for seven days without moving his hand.
And let the diet of the patient be light, while the member is being strengthened, as it is easier for recovery.
And then give him a heavier diet after seven or five days of exercise; and if he remains firm without softening, then he is already cured.
If the joint has been dislocated several times due to humidity or another cause, then it is necessary that a three-pronged cautery be applied there, as previously mentioned in the chapter on cauterization.
E si tot aysso es fayt e aprop vii dias es desliat le liament e la junctura no es fermada, e le emplastre e la strictura son reduzitz sobre lu alcunas veguadas, e no es fermada e catz e no pot elevar aquel bras a las partidas desus, lahoras sapias que·ls nervis de lu, les quals so al cap del muscle, ja so inscizes o extendutz o mollificatz, e sapia que la junctura nul temps no sira ficada en loc sieu.
From the dislocation of the one made between the foot and hip or its parts behind it, reduction is done with impulse and extension using hands until return.
And in the other, administer tightness and cure it until it is healed.
And if the healing process is affected by the weight of the body part and delays its mobility, then the patient should use warm baths until that heaviness is alleviated and it returns to its former nature.
This seems to be an indication of a new chapter or section in the medical treatise, with the number "xxvii" likely representing the twenty-seventh chapter. It is common for chapters to be denoted by numbers or titles in such texts.
Regarding the treatment of shoulder dislocation."

Here is my translation of the provided text:
Here is the translation of the provided text:
If the dislocation is in the front parts of the body, then return it by bending the arm towards their hand, while striking the elbow with the edge of their palm.
And if the dislocation does not respond to reduction attempts, then administer strong and forceful extension with vigor.
Have two assistants extend the arm while two other assistants hold it in place to prevent any movement during the extension.
Then rotate the arm in all directions while it is wrapped with a folded cloth or bandage around their hand and secured tightly.
When the doctor touches the joint with their hand, they should grease it with some oil to facilitate lubrication of the joint and ease movement. Then push on the joint forcefully while returning it to its place.
After the reduction is complete, place a plaster on it that contains a mixture of styptic and egg white, and apply it with a gentle binding. Suspend the arm from the neck and leave it like this for a few days.
Then it is unbound; if the joint has healed in its place, you can release the bandage and leave it.
Here is the translation of the sentence you provided:

And if you wish, place on that moist and scraped cowhide some border strips with edges trimmed over it; do this several times, for the hide is moist and will return to its original condition.
I am unable to find any specific information about "Capitol .xxviii" in relation to your previous response or the provided text. Please provide additional context if you would like me to assist you further with this query.
On the treatment of dislocation of the shoulder joint, which is located between the arm and hand.
Sometimes the dislocation of the hand is slight, and its reduction can be easily managed, but it is different with other joints; however, speed in the process of reducing such a dislocation at the moment when it occurs is essential before any swelling appears or becomes infected.
And the method of reducing this dislocation is for you to place the patient's hand joint on a table and have your assistant extend their arm; then the doctor places his or her palm over the prominence of the joint, pushing it until it returns to its normal position.
However, one must consider whether the palm is already facing towards the abdomen of the hand; in that case, have the patient place the back of their hand on a table with the arm extended and reduced; if the dislocation occurs at the back of the hand, then the position of the hand should be intrinsically on the table so that the doctor's hand can press down upon the prominence of the joint.
Here is my translation of the provided text:
However, the joint remains in its twisted position; and you do not find any cause for this in the patient, except that their hand is softened and cannot make a fist; then know that their nerves are constricted or torn, and there is no remedy but to strengthen it with cautery near the joint, and give them something warm to drink.
When the swelling is reduced, apply on them the plaster we have prepared, and let it be left and bound for five days; then it should be unbound and again left, and their hand should be exercised.
But if their movement is impeded and some severity occurs in them, then ease that with warm water and gentle friction several times until it is alleviated.
It seems this indicates the end of chapter 29 or section 29 in the treatise. Is there another passage you would like me to translate?
On the treatment of dislocation of the aforementioned."
Alcunas veguadas so dislocatz les ditz a tota partida.

And then support the head of the finger, and suspend that part which is dislocated above it, and leave it like this for two days.
Then suspend that [body part] and stretch it until it is properly aligned on its own level, leaving it like this for a day.
And when it is night, bind that [body part] according to the narrative, and do not cease to loosen it during the day and exercise with movements, binding it at night; do this for several days until it becomes tight.
Do likewise if it is the wrist of the hand that is dislocated; bind it to that area and do this first operation until it is healed.
Similarly, do the same when other parts of the body are dislocated.
It seems you have provided me with a chapter number; please give me more context so I may assist you better.
Chapter 30: On the treatment of dislocation of the spine vertebrae.
When any of the vertebrae in the spine or neck become completely dislocated and the spinal cord is pinched due to these bones moving from their places, there is usually little hope for treatment as death quickly follows for the patient.
Here is my translation of the provided text:
Donc aquella ja es remauguda a las partidas detras e es nompnada gelbozitat.
However, the cure for this is that you should consider whether the disease occurs in childhood, as then there is neither a cure nor complete recovery.
But for those illnesses which occur due to a fall, or a blow, or something similar, the Ancients have already described methods of cure in lengthy treatises, from which the main principles return to their original source; but I have shortened that, out of which the little avoids the excess of it, because of my own proximity to my own intention and exposition, with which I have presented this and developed those things.
And there is cure only for those diseases which occur on the back itself, with what I have recounted.
And if the patient is placed on their face close to a wall, and something moist is placed under them so that their feet are not stretched.
Then a straight stick is placed, fixed in the ground at the head end near his head, and another stick around his feet at the other end of the bench.
The minister holds the trunk, do not stay in one place and another minister holds it from the other side following this procedure.
Then cover the patient's head and tie it lightly with a bandage so that their eyes are closed; extend the end of the bandage to the trunk, which should be placed behind their head, and secure it there; then tighten another bandage over their hips at their rear, extending down towards their legs; finally, adjust all the bindings and tie them on the other pole located near their feet.
Then each minister extends the bandage to its respective pole and they should not be dislocated from their positions or from the poles' locations where they are attached, but again, they must not remain in one place as we have mentioned earlier.
The doctor places his palms on the patient's spine with strength until it returns to its place or he puts him on a table and adjusts their legs onto that same table.
But if it does not return to its place by this method, then take a table whose length or width is approximately three feet in circumference and carve out a space on the wall where we previously mentioned that the patient was located so that one end of the table can be inserted inside said hole. And then place half of the table on the spine, with the doctor placing their feet on the other end. Then push firmly so that the vertebra is realigned and returns to its proper position.
If you wish, open the wooden peg that has been turned by hand; and when you lay him on the ground, place one of his arms behind a post that is as long as an arm's length; likewise, place another post behind the patient's head with the same length; there should be a palm-length distance between each post, and in both posts drill a hole for the wooden peg to pass through; then firmly secure each post into the ground so it cannot move.
Place a round wooden shaft into the hole which contains the peg; turn this shaft so it moves within the holes of both posts.
There should be a hole at the end of this shaft which is one palm-length from where it turns; there should also be similar holes drilled into both posts.
Then tighten the straps you have placed around his legs near where his head is positioned; as well as those that secure his thighs in place by the wooden shaft near his feet.
And then you must have each person turn and lie down while a minister turns the handle with their hand, and the doctor aligns the spine as we mentioned earlier.
Now that the spine has been realigned and the area is adjusted, you should apply an exciccatio (a type of medicated paste) with egg white as a base, then pack it with cotton; next place on top of the paste a wooden splint whose width is about three fingers or so, and its length should match the size of the affected area, extending over the spine.
Then bind it with the ligament as mentioned earlier, and feed the patient a diet of subtle nourishment until they recover.
If there is any remaining bulge in the area after treatment, it is necessary to administer medicines that soften and ease with long-term application of a plaster as recommended earlier; a lead plate has already been placed in that location.
Sometimes bulging occurs in the lower spine at the back and it is dislocated there; this bone should not be exposed to any pressure from said medicine as its strength might cause death.
Capitol .xxxi.: Chapter 31.
For the treatment of a dislocated hip."
Here is my translation of the provided source sentence:
E la junctura de la ancha es dislocada segon quatre manieyras, quar es dislocada a las partidas dedintz, o a las partidas defora, o a las partidas denant, o a las partidas detras.
And it is mostly dislocated inwards, and rarely outwards or backwards.
The sign of the dislocation towards the inside is that when you align the patient's affected leg with the healthy one, it appears longer and the ankle is more prominent compared to the healthy side. The patient cannot bend their foot inward; this is the area where a closed abscess forms on the back of the ankle because the head of the talus has reached this point.
The sign of the one who has experienced a dislocation outwards is that their symptoms are opposite to the previous case.
The sign of the one who has a dislocation forward is when they extend their leg as much as possible, but cannot bend it at the ankle due to pain there; if they attempt to walk, they are unable to step forward. Their urine flow is obstructed and the back of their heel becomes abscessed, forcing them to walk on their tiptoes.
The sign of the one who has a dislocation backward is that they cannot extend their ankle nor bend it forward without pain at the heel; their affected leg appears shorter than the other, and the back of their heel softens. The head of the talus bone is now located there.
Here is my translation of the provided text:
When the dislocation is recent and it falls into one of four types of dislocations, then you must apply this treatment: return the joint to its place by stretching it in all directions, both inward and outward, as well as on the right and left sides, because often it returns easily and needs no further treatment.
But if it does not return in this way, then you must prepare a strong and thick cloth, extending the patient's leg from below with their hands or tied to something above; another servant will extend the patient's hand from above so that they can put their hands under the armpits; then bind tightly with bandages around the hips, while another servant holds the end of the bandage.
And the patient's extension or inner part is made painful at the fork joint or at the back toward the spine.
And the extension of all those parts is done at once while the patient is raised with their body off the ground and hanging.
This type of extension is common to all four types of dislocation.
E donc si la dislocacio retorna am aquo que havem dit, sira bo; e sino, lahoras es necessari a tota specia aquo que dire de la propria curacio.
Here is my translation of the provided text:
Then another strong minister takes hold of his arms, and firmly grasps the swollen area around the patient's groin, pulling it outwards with a vigorous movement, for this allows it to return to its proper place.
This procedure is the lightest cure among the others, as this member is reduced without any other special treatment.
But if you are unable to assist and do not comply with this type of treatment, then it is necessary to tie both the patient's feet together strongly, lightly, above both heels and all toes.
And let the length of each strap be equal to four fingers, and let the diseased leg be extended more than the other by two finger-widths.
Then let the patient be suspended above the head of the bedstead, and that he be in the middle; let his height from the ground be equal to two arms' lengths.
Then command a strong youth to pull the head of the groin upwards, and let another young man be suspended with the patient, while the other youth pulls on the leg with strength, for the joint will return to its place swiftly.
Here is the translation of the provided text:
Here is the translation of the provided text:
And then each minister extends to his side, and the doctor with his hand performs the reduction according to the art.
And when the dislocation is in the front part of the body, it is necessary to slightly extend the leg, and this action must be performed according to the description above; then the doctor places their right palm on the affected joint, and with the other hand they grip that area while extending the leg downwards.
If the dislocation is in the rear part of the body, it should not be extended downwards but elevated from the ground; instead, they must lie on a hard surface just as required for their arm if it is dislocated outwards, according to what we have said about placing them on two pillows. They will lie on their front and their limbs must be extended accordingly.
And make sure that compression is applied using a board over the area where the joint is located.
So, once the reduction is completed as required - and you see an indication of successful reduction in that you have spread the patient's legs apart, and when you observe these movements and the patient draws their leg back in without any explanation, then you know that the limb has been properly returned to its correct position - adjust two cushions and place some poultice, and remove it with a bandage so that there is no pressure on any part; keep the patient at rest for three or four days.
Then untie the bandage and poultice, and compare one leg to the other.
If you see these same movements upon examination, then you know that the dislocation is healed, and so allow the patient to get up.
And if you see any sign of softening, then you must return and plaster the area again, remove it according to your initial instructions, and keep them at rest for three days.
Then untie it, and have them delay walking for a few days until they are comfortable.
Sure! Here is my translation of your text line by line into English:
De curacio de dislocacio del denolh.
The kneecap is dislocated in three ways: it can be dislocated outwards, inwards, or downwards towards the back; but it cannot be dislocated forwards.
The sign of dislocation is when you instruct the patient to bring their leg towards their thigh, and then you can determine that the kneecap is indeed dislocated.
To restore the kneecap in all three ways, you should make the patient stand straight and extend their leg if possible; attach your hands to their face and place their foot between your feet; then take hold of their kneecap with your palms, gripping it firmly between your thumbs on top of their kneecap while another assistant extends their leg so that the kneecap returns to its original position.
The sign of successful restoration is when the patient's leg adheres to their thigh with effortless movement.
Then plaster that area and make sure the leg is attached to the thigh; bind those parts together with a bandage for three or four days; then remove the bandage.
And do not allow the patient to walk for a few days until they are healed and strengthened.
But if the reduction of it to you is excused, then provide strong extension with the same bandages as used in the hip cure mentioned earlier.
This indicates that this information is from chapter 33 of a book or treatise. It seems to be a chapter marker or heading, providing context for the following medical instructions or discussions.
On the treatment of dislocation of the ankle."
Here is the translation of the provided text:
And the sign of dislocation is when you see the ankle swelling, proceeding from the part that has been dislocated.
May the cure for removal be a gentle reduction, and it should be done with ease using your hands, ensuring that it is smoothed out as it returns to its place.
When treating a patient with a severe dislocation, it is necessary to make the patient lie down straight, and have a strong and valiant assistant stand behind their back in the middle of their body.
Then you place your right hand on the upper part of the foot and your left hand below it at the ankle.
And you pull the foot towards your right hand and then with both hands for two times, after which you extend it using your left hand while keeping the patient's toes on the floor below their shin.
Do this two times as we have counted before.
Then place the foot's toes on the shin for the third time and make sure your hand is at the ankle.
Therefore, if you return the foot once or twice in this manner and see that it is loosened, it is good. If not, then repeat the operation again, for it returns.
But if you are prohibited from reducing it as we have described above, then make the patient lie on their back on the ground, and tightly place a small board under them between their thighs, and wrap them with cloth so that the patient does not feel cold.
Then have the patient's assistant hold their legs, and another minister extend the foot with their hands or with a cloth tied over the ankle; then each assistant stretches against the extension of their part, and let the board be extended between the patient's thighs to prevent their body from being pulled towards the parts below due to its extension.
Then the doctor loosens the dislocation with their hands, and another assistant holds the healthy leg below it, for the dislocation returns easily.
And so, when the dislocation returns and you are certain of the healthiness of the reduction, then place a plaster cast on it and tightly bind it with bandages, tying the foot to the leg.
And be careful or mindful of the nerves that are located at the back of the ankle, to ensure that the binding or wrapping around it is not too tight and does not harm or damage those nerves.
Then leave it like that for two days or three; if the binding has softened, remove it.
Then loosen or untie the binding on either the third day or fourth; forbid the patient from walking for forty days. However, if the patient is forced to walk before this period of time has passed, it should be assumed that the dislocation has not been fully corrected or properly healed; and thus, it will likely not respond well to treatment.
And if the patient develops an acute abscess or infection, then you should apply the same treatment and ointment described earlier to other affected areas of the body until it is resolved.
It seems that this indicates the end of section thirty-four in the treatise, marking a new chapter or topic to be discussed next. It follows a conventional format for organizing such texts into numbered sections or chapters.
On the treatment of dislocations of the aforementioned toes."
Cove que aquel qu’es dislocat sia engualhat am pauca extencio ses trebal; e aquo que no es dificil, abantz es leugier.
If the dislocation is in any of the joints of the foot, then it's necessary to make the patient put their foot on the floor or on a table, and they should remain like that as if they were walking.
Then stand by the patient's side and place your foot on what is above the joints, then press that with your foot with strength until it returns to its original position, and make sure there are no bumps or lumps remaining.
Place a board under the patient's foot that covers it completely, this board should have two ends. Then strap that with a bandage that is tight and secure for three days; after you untie them, make sure they rest from walking for many days until their recovery is guaranteed.
It seems like the text you provided ends here with ".xxxv.", which refers to chapter 35 in roman numerals, so it looks like this was the end of chapter 35. Is there another text I can help you translate?
On the types of dislocations caused by a blow, fracture or any other kind of accident.
When any of these cases happen, and you undertake the treatment and restoration process, it's likely that death will occur many times.
Certainly, I can continue translating the provided text: And now, exert yourself immediately to perform on him the reduction at the beginning of the treatment, before it becomes a dangerous abscess.
And if the limb returns to its desired position, administer a treatment that prevents dangerous abscesses and cures the wound with whatever dried ointments are suitable for him.
If the dislocation is accompanied by a fracture and the bones are separated at their joints, then you pierce the membrane between them, and do as we have previously mentioned for simple illnesses that affect these areas.
Be mindful and avoid any instruments that cause fear according to the teachings I have given you previously; for this is better for your true self, more permanent for your glory, and more beneficial for your soul in the long run. Thus ends the words of Albucasis, may God bless us all. Amen.
