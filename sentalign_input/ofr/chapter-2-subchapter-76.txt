of the dead child
When you treat a woman with a dead child in the womb, as I have said in the division, and it does not come out, and you are compelled to work by hand;
you must know if the woman is of sound health, and has no condition where she is afraid of death;
the woman should be lying on her back, with her head inclined downwards and her legs raised;
and the assistant should hold her from both sides, or she should be tied to the bed so that she is not pulled down with the descent of the child;
then rub the vulva of the mother with moist oils with mucilage of marshmallow and fenugreek and linseed, then have the midwife anoint her hands with these oils and mucilages;
then insert them gently into the vulva, then find a place where she inserts the hooks that are suitable for this, and take care if the child is positioned to descend head first;
insert the hooks into its eyes or its neck or its mouth or its palate or under the chin or in the fontanelle or near the temples, and if the descent is feet first, insert them in the heel and in the middle of the sides;
and he should hold the hook in his right hand, and place the curvature between the fingers of his left hand, and insert it with his whole hand gently, and insert the hook in any of these places that we have mentioned, until it comes to the empty space;
and this is the shape of the hook:
then insert another hook opposite it, or a third if you need it, so that the extraction is even;
and then pull it evenly, moving from one side to the other, to cause it to come out, and the hook should be toothed to hold it, as is the shape here:
And if a part of it remains, then let the surgeon anoint some of his fingers with oil, and insert them into that part, and pull out the other part;
and if any of it still remains, then place this hook in a higher place, and do this until it all comes out.
And if one hand comes before the other, and he cannot pull it back due to the tightness, then you must wrap a cloth around it, until it comes all the way out;
then cut it at the joint of the sole or at the heel, and so you must do with the other hand, and with both feet.
And if the child's head is large and the birth canal is narrow, or if there is a pointed gathering on the head, you must place the pointed spatula between your fingers, and split the head and extract the fluid;
or you break it with the instrument called "almidach", whose form comes with the instruments in the chapter which is after this one;
and do the same if the child has a naturally large head;
and then pull out the bones with the forceps, and if the head jumps out and is caught in the vulva, let it be split, so that the fluid that is in the worst place comes out;
and if it cannot come out, cut it in pieces as best you can;
and if it is swollen in the belly or below the ribs, then you must pierce it so that the fluid flows.
And if the child is on its feet, the extraction is easy, and the straightening at the opening of the womb is easy.
And if it is narrow in the belly or the chest, you must extract it with a cloth wrapped around your hand;
and cut the belly or the chest so the fluid within can flow out;
And if the other limbs are removed, and the head remains, then the midwife should put her hand deep into the womb and pull it down to the opening of the womb;
then insert one or two hooks, and pull it out forcefully; 
And if the opening of the womb is constricted because of a hot abscess that has developed there, do not work on it, but rather administer moist and oily things;
and apply poultices, and sitz baths with softening and moistening water.
And if the child is on its side, and you can straighten it, apply what we have said for a live child;
and if one cannot, then pull it out piece by piece, and leave nothing of the afterbirth.
And when you have done this, apply what we have said for hot abscesses that occur in the womb;
and if bleeding occurs, she should be placed in astringent water, and administer other treatments.
And I saw a woman in whose womb a child had died, then another was conceived over that one, and the second also died.
After a long time, she developed an abscess in the buttock, and it swelled until it opened, and began to suppurate heavily.
I was called for the treatment, and I considered it for a long time, and the wound would not heal.
I applied a plaster of strong attraction, and a bone came out, and after a few days another one.
I was very surprised, because there are no bones in the belly.
So I thought that they were the bones of a dead child.
I searched the wound, and drew out many bones, until the woman was in better condition;
and the woman lived a long time like this, and a little bit of pus always came out of the place;
and I would not have recalled this chapter except for the fact that, when the physician encounters a strange case, he should know how to provide help.
