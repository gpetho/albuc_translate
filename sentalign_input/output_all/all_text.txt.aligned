O, sons, since I have completed for you this book, which is the last of the science of medicine, through its completion reaching its end, and through its expositions and its explanations, it seems to me that I should complement it for you with this treatise, which is about the operation by hand, that is, surgery.	AFTER finishing for you, my sons, this book which is the part of knowledge dealing with medicine in its entirety; and having made it as clear and explicit as possible, I thought it well to complete it for you by adding this treatise which concerns surgical operating.	0.81577176
Because the operation by hand is laid low in our region and in our time, completely deprived, until the science of it is greatly endangered, and the trace of it is removed; and only a few small descriptions remain in the books of the Ancients, which mostly changed and turned into errors and doubts, so that their understandings are closed and the strength and art of it is extended away.	For the skilled practitioner of operative surgery is totally lacking in our land and time; so that the knowledge of it is on the point of being blotted out and its remains lost; and there is nothing left of it except a few traces in the books of the Ancients; where, however, it has been so corrupted by the hands of scribes, and subjected to error and confusion, that its meaning has become obscured and its value diminished.	0.8392079
And it seems to me that I should revive it with the organization of this treatise in that way through exposition and explanation and abbreviation; and so that it comes with the forms of the cautery tools and other instruments of the work as well as with the addition of explanation, and with preparation of it, which is necessary.	Therefore I decided to revive this art by expounding, elucidating, and epitomizing it in this treatise; and to present the forms of the cauterizing irons and other operative instruments, since this is an adjunct to explanation and a vital necessity.	0.7892623
But the reason why no good practitioner is found with his hand in our time is because the art of medicine is long, and it requires its practitioner first to be trained in the science of anatomy, which Gualia recounted, so that he knows the arrangement of the limbs and their forms, and their joining and separation; and has knowledge of the bones, the nerves and the muscles, and their number, and their exit points; and of the pulsating veins and the still veins, and the locations of their origin.	Now this is the reason why there is no skilful operator in our day: the art of medicine is long and it is necessary for its exponent, before he exercises it, to be trained in anatomy as Galen has described it, so that he may be fully acquainted with the uses, forms, and temperament of the limbs; also how they are jointed, and how they may be separated; that he should understand fully also the bones, tendons, and muscles, their numbers and their attachments; and also the bloodvessels, both arteries and veins, with their relations.	0.836589
And therefore, Hippocrates says that with one name it is great, but in practice small, and especially in the art of the hand.	And so Hippocrates said: 'Though many are doctors in name, few are in reality, particularly on the surgical side.'	0.72613466
But we have already spoken of that in the introduction of this book; for he who is not knowledgeable in what we have said about anatomy, cannot avoid falling into error, by which men will die, as I have seen too many of those, for some are trained in this science and throw themselves into it without knowledge and without experience.	We have already spoken of this in the introduction to this book. For he who is not skilled in as much anatomy as we have mentioned is bound to fall into error that is destructive of life. Thus I have seen many laying claim to this knowledge and boasting of it, but having neither knowledge nor experience.	0.85660744
For I saw a foolish and inexperienced doctor who had incised a scrofulous abscess in the neck of a woman, and cut some arteries of the neck so that much blood flowed and the woman fell dead in his hands.	I saw an ignorant doctor incise a scrofulous tumour in a woman's neck; and he cut certain arteries in the neck so that the woman bled until she fell dead before him.	0.8614969
And I saw another doctor who attempted to remove a stone from a man who had advanced in age, and the stone was large, and he came to it and removed that stone with a piece of the bladder, for which that man died on the third day.	And I saw another doctor presume to take out a stone from a man of advanced age. The stone was large; he rushed blindly at the task and extracted the stone and with it a piece of the bladder itself; and the man was dead in about three days.	0.88327575
And I was already called to remove it, and I saw that because of the size of the stone and the condition of the patient, I recognized he would die from it.	I had myself been previously called in to extract the stone but from what I saw of the size of it and the condition of the patient I judged that the outcome would be so.	0.7112801
And I saw another doctor who took a stipend from a duke of our land for surgery, and came upon a black eunuch who had a fracture in his thigh; and the doctor, with his ignorance, set the fracture over the wound with cushions and splints with tight bandaging, and did not leave any breathing room for the wound.	I saw another doctor who had a regular salary from one of the high officers of our country for medical treatment. There had occurred to a negro boy of his a fracture of the leg near the heel, together with a wound; the doctor rushed in, in his ignorance, and bound up the fracture, over the wound, very tightly, with pads and splints, not allowing the wound to breathe.	0.86813474
And after some days he loosened it according to his wishes, and rebandaged it, and left it for some days and commanded that the binding not be loosened; and so it remained until the thigh and foot were abscessed and reached destruction.	He then let him go as he wished and then dismissed him for some days bidding him not to loose the bandage. Eventually his leg and foot swelled and he was close to death.	0.8030683
And I was called to him, and I prepared to loosen the binding, and he achieved calm and thus relieved his pains.	I was called in and made haste to loose the bandage, upon which some ease and reduction of the pain followed.	0.7212139
But however, the corruption was already established in the limb, so I could not stop it, and the corruption continued in the limb until the patient perished.	Nevertheless, gangrene had already taken hold on the limb and I could not hinder its progress; it. continued to extend in the limb until he perished.	0.7529254
And I saw another doctor who pierced a cancerous abscess, and it was ulcerated for some days, until its malignancy was increased by its master (host).	And I saw another doctor incise a malignant tumour; after some days the place broke out in open ulceration, thereby adding to the misery of the patient.	0.7228931
The reason being that the cancerous ulcer is full of melancholic humor, thus it should not be completely removed by iron (surgery), but should be in a limb that can completely tolerate being removed.	For a cancer that arises from a melancholic humour should never be touched by the knife unless it should happen to be in a part of the body which may be removed thoroughly and in its entirety.	0.5990653
And therefore, sons, it is necessary for you that the operation by hand be divided into two parts: one is the operation associated with health, and the other is work with which there is danger in the major conditions.	Wherefore you must know, my sons, that operative surgery is divided into two parts, namely, where operation is associated with the health of the patient, and, on the other hand, where it is for the most part fraught with danger.	0.8037493
And I have already mentioned this in every part of this book where there is an operation in which there is error and fear; so it is necessary for you to observe this and leave that, so that the foolish do not find a way to speak and dishonor you.	Throughout the following book I point out wherever I have described an operation that is accompanied by fear and danger. It behoves you to be wary and to shun such, lest the ignorant have an opportunity to reproach and slander you.	0.8002635
And so take your tools with diligence and with the protection of God, and your patients with happiness and firmness.	Show, then, caution and care for yourselves and gentleness and perseverance for your patients.	0.63841456
And use the best way by the grace of God leading to health and praiseworthy success, and leave the terrible diseases of difficult healing, and put away your tools from what makes you fear, so that doubt in your faith and in your name does not evade you: for more remains for your glory, and higher in the world and ultimately for your sanctity.	Take the best road that leads to health and a happy outcome. Illnesses that are very threatening or difficult to cure, leave alone. Purify yourselves of anything which you fear may cause doubt as to your religious life and your secular life; for this will perpetuate your good name and will elevate your fortunes in this world and the next.	0.72531056
Gualia has already said in some of his admonitions: "Do not treat bad diseases, so that you are not called bad doctors."	For Galen once said in certain of his admonitions: 'Do not treat mischievous maladies lest you get the name of mischievous doctors.'	0.7924367
And I have already divided this book into three chapters.	I have divided this treatise into three books:	0.7714647
The division of the book begins, and first of the first part. The first chapter arranged from head to foot, in the forms of the instruments and the tools of the cauteries, and what is necessary in the operation.	BOOK ONE. Concerning the actual cautery; and cauterization by caustics. It is divided into chapters set in order from the head to the feet. The shapes of the instruments are shown and the iron cauteries and all things necessary for operating.	0.7515497
The division of the second part. The second chapter, on cutting and piercing, and on cupping, and on wounds, and on extracting arrows and similar things, all categorized and arranged by the forms of the instruments.	BOOK TWO. Concerning incision and perforation; blood-letting and cupping; wounds and the extraction of arrows and the like. The whole is divided into chapters in order; and illustrations of instruments are given.	0.83035743
The third chapter, on restoration and dislocation, and on the healing of twists and similar things; a chapter arranged from head to foot, and on the forms of the instruments.	BOOK THREE. Concerning the setting of bones; dislocations; the treatment of sprains and the like. This is similarly divided into chapters set in order from head to feet, with illustrations of instruments.	0.79188395
It is necessary for me to speak about the qualities of the benefits of that cauterization and its harms, and in which constitution cauterization is prohibited.	Before we expatiate on the actual operation of cautery it is necessary to mention its advantages and disadvantages and the temperament upon which it is to be used.	0.5954306
Thus I say that the discourse on the quality of the benefits of cauterization and its harms is a long and detailed discussion, subtle through science, and a hidden secret; and many wise men have spoken about it, and they have disagreed on it, and for me, a small portion of their discourses suffices, fearing prolongation.	I say that a discourse on the advantage and disadvantage of cautery is a long one, a subtle learning, a hidden secret. A great number of wise men have spoken on the subject with differing opinions. Lest I should be over long I have reduced their opinions to a summary.	0.8043833
Therefore I say that cauterization benefits any constitution universally which has or lacks matter, except for two constitutions, which are hot constitutions without matter.	Now I say that the cautery has universal application for every ill constitution, whether organic or functional, with the exception of two: the functional hot temperament and the functional dry temperament.	0.5980452
In the hot and dry constitution with matter they disagreed; for some said that cauterization is beneficial for it, while others said the opposite, that cauterization is not suitable for an illness which is by heat and dryness, because the nature of fire is heat and dryness, and it is unsuitable for a hot and dry illness to be healed by something that is hot and dry.	About the organic dry temperament the Ancients differed, some saying that cautery helps in a constitution of this kind, while others said the opposite: that cautery is of no use in a disease caused by heat or dryness; for fire is naturally hot and dry and it is obviously absurd to treat a hot dry sickness with a hot dry remedy.	0.87560064
And he who said the opposite of that said that by cauterization benefit is made in any hot and dry illness that comes in the bodies of men, because when you compare the body of man and its moistures to the constitution of fire, you find the body of man cold.	But he who holds the opposite view says that actual cautery may help in the case of such hot dry illnesses as arise in the human body; for when you compare the human body, humid as it is, with the nature of fire you find the human body cold.	0.80912435
And I say through the discourse of that one, that I have already discovered this in some experiments.	I myself from much experience agree with this last opinion.	0.46701583
However, it is not appropriate for someone who is not already experienced and practiced in the chapter of cauterization through thorough exercise to come upon this, and who has not known the diversity of the constitutions of men and the disposition of the diseases in themselves, and their causes, and their accidents, and the time span of those.	However, no one should attempt this operation unless he has had long training and practice in the use of the cautery, and is fully acquainted with the various human temperaments, and the character of the complaints in themselves; their causes, symptoms, and duration.	0.801147
But in the other constitutions, there is no fear for you, especially in cold and moist illnesses, for all the doctors have agreed on those, and have not disagreed on the benefit of cauterization in those.	Concerning the rest of the temperaments there is no reason for fear, particularly the cold and humid distempers; all medical men are agreed and none differs concerning the utility of the cautery in such cases.	0.74186933
And know, sons, that the secret of healing by cauterization with fire and its goodness, as opposed to cauterization with burning medicine, is that fire is simple, whose action does not reach beyond the member which is cauterized and does not harm the other member adjacent to it except with little harm.	Now you should know, my sons, that the actual cautery and its superiority over cauterization with chemical caustics is one of the secrets of medicine. For fire is a simple substance having no action except upon the actual part cauterized; nor does it do more than slightly harm any adjacent part.	0.8122664
But the action of burning medicine reaches that in the members which are distant from it, and very quickly brings to the member a disease of difficult healing and very quickly seen.	But the effect of cauterization with caustic may spread to parts at a distance from that burnt; and also in the part cauterized it may give rise to a disease difficult to cure or even fatal.	0.71452844
And know, sons, that they disagree on the time in which it is suitable to do cauterization and they place the best time in spring.	Know also, my sons, that the Ancients disagreed also as to the fit time for cautery, affirming that spring was the best.	0.72291577
And I say that cauterization is suitable at all times, because the harm from the accidental time is submerged in the benefit of that which is achieved with cauterization, and especially if the cauterization is for pains or necessary pains, strong and urgent, which do not suffer delay because it is feared that from those will come a malignancy, which is greater than the small harm entering from the time.	Myself, I say that the cautery is suitable at all times; for whatever harm may arise from the season of the operation is utterly outdone by the benefit deriving from the cauterization itself; especially if the cautery is applied to pains that are severe, grievous, and swift, brooking no delay, because of the fear that the consequences may be more grave than the slight harm from the season.	0.88110435
And this does not fall into your minds, oh sons, this is not thought by anyone except the common people and foolish doctors, that is, that the disease healed by cauterization does not recur all the time, and they place that as a result.	Nor let enter your minds, my sons, the groundless notion of the laity and of ignorant doctors, that the complaint cured by the cautery never comes back later; do not cleave to this opinion.	0.707338
And the cause is not as they think because of this, because cauterization is only in place of medicine which alters the constitution and dries the moistures which are the cause for the pains to come.	The fact is not as they think; for the cautery is homologous to the drug which alters the constitution and dries up the humidities that give rise to disorders.	0.8226948
But cauterization surpasses medicine by the swiftness of its power and virtue of its operation and the greatness of its lord.	But the cautery excels the drug by the rapidity of its success, the strength of its action, and the potency of its powers.	0.85019743
And it is possible that the disease will return at some hour of the time, according to the constitution of the patient and the location of his disease, and the strength of it, and that which is prepared in his body from the accumulation of excesses in it, and that which has come to it in his acquisition of foods and similar causes; unless the disease in which cauterization is administered is a subtle disease in a member with few excesses and moistures, like the cauterization of a tooth for pain and similar to that, it is possible that in it that pain will not return, but this happens rarely.	It may be that the disease will return at some time according to the temperament of the patient, and the persistence and virulence of the disease; and from the formation of a mass of superfluities in the body; from his neglect of himself in acquiring them from food; and from causes of a similar nature. Of course, if the disease to which the cautery is applied be a slight one, and in a part only slightly liable to superfluities and humidities, as, for example, the cauterization of a molar tooth for toothache, and the like, then it may happen that the pain does not return; but that happens rarely.	0.89789504
And the common saying is that cauterization is the last remedy of medicine, and it is a true saying, not for what they understand in it, because they believe that it is not a cure that benefits with medicine nor with another cause except cauterization.	Another common saying is that the cautery is the final remedy; which is true, but not in the way which they mean. For they believe that after cauterization no treatment, either with or without medicine, will help.	0.8335638
And the cause is contrary to that; and the intention that cauterization is the last remedy of medicine is not except when we administer the methods of healing in some diseases, and those medicines do not confer, and near the end of the cause one administers cauterization, and it benefits that. And then from here it falls that cauterization is the last remedy of medicine, not according to the intention which the common people and the many foolish doctors understand.	It means something precisely the opposite: after various treatments have been applied to a certain disorder without success, then last of all we apply cauterization and this proves effective; whence comes about the saying that the cautery is the final remedy—not in that sense in which it is popularly held by the laity and by many ignorant medical men.	0.79660594
And the ancients said that cauterization with gold is better than cauterization with iron, and they did not say this except for the equality of gold and the sublimity of its substance.	The Ancients have stated that cauterization by gold is more effective than by iron. Now they said that on account of the temperateness of gold and its noble character.	0.76622486
And therefore cauterization with iron is done by us more easily and more suitably to the correctness of the operation.	Therefore in our own opinion cauterization is swifter and more successful with iron.	0.71220386
And I have already arranged this chapter on cauterization according to chapters, and I have arranged them from the head to the feet, so that I might alleviate the demand by giving what is needed.	Now I have arranged this book on cauterization by chapters, set in order from the head to the foot, to make it easy for the seeker to find what he wants.	0.7354044
The first chapter.	CHAPTER ONE.	0.7483104
This cauterization helps with humidity and coldness on the brain, which are due to two causes, namely soda and the abundance of rheumatic flow called catarrh, from the head to the parts of the eyes and ears, excessive sleep, and pain of the teeth and throat, and generally any disease that comes from coldness, such as paralysis, sudden stroke, and similar diseases.	This cauterization helps against excessive humidity and coldness on the brain, which cause headache, abundance of defluxions from the head to the regions of the eyes and ears, excess of sleep, toothache, sore throat, and in general any sort of disorder arising from frigidity, such as palsy, fits, apoplexy, and diseases similar to these.	0.7599435
The method of this cauterization is this: firstly, you command the patient to evacuate the head with purgative medicine, cleaning it for three or four nights, according to the patient's strength, age, and habits.	The manner of performing this operation is first to bid the patient open the bowels with an evacuant which will also clear his head, for three or four nights, according to the strength, age, and habits of the patient.	0.8431839
And then command him to shave his head with a razor, and then make him sit between your hands on a square bench and place his hands on his chest.	Then tell him to have his head shaved; then seat him cross-legged before you, with his hands on his breast.	0.7762604
Then place the edge of your palm near the well above the bridge of the nose between his eyes. However, when the middle of your finger locates the spot, mark that place with a probe, and then ignite the olive cautery iron, the form of which is:	Then place the lower part of your palm upon the root of his nose between his eyes; and where your middle finger reaches mark that place with ink. Then heat an olivary cautery.	0.84269965
And then place it on the marked spot with the probe, in such a way that it descends, with your hand gradually applying pressure, and you rotate it.	Then bring it down upon the marked place with one downward stroke with gentle pressure, revolving the cautery; then quickly take your hand away while observing the place.	0.77860093
Then lightly lift your hand and check the spot, and if you see any part of the bone exposed, as much as a grain of wheat, then lift your hand, and if not, return with the iron or another iron, if it has cooled, until the bone is visible as I have told you.	If you see that some bone is exposed, the size of the head of a skewer or a grain of vetch, then take your hand away; otherwise repeat with the same iron, or, if that has got cold, with another, till the amount of bone I have mentioned is exposed.	0.7465401
Then take a little salt and dissolve it on the spot and leave it for three days.	Then take a little salt dissolved in water; soak some cotton in it, apply to the place and leave for three days.	0.8339376
Then place cotton soaked in vinegar over it and leave it until the scab from the burn is destroyed. Then treat the spot with tetraderm ointment until it is healed.	Then apply some cotton soaked in butter and leave it on till the eschar falls off; then dress with Tetrapharmacum ointment till healed.	0.8232113
And some have said that as long as the wound remains open, it expels the humor better, making it more beneficial.	The Ancients said that the more a wound is kept open, discharging pus, the better and more efficacious.	0.6825502
And some of them have said that the skin should be cauterized down to the bone, and the cautery should be held until some part of the bone's surface is burnt.	Some said the skin was to be cauterized through to the bone and the cautery held until some of the thickness of the bone was burnt.	0.85710645
Then scrape off the burnt part of the bone and treat it.	Then the burnt bone was to be scraped out, then dressed.	0.6738231
Others have said that with the cautery, it should reach the marrow, pressing strongly on the bone until it falls, and this is the form of the minor alphecati: And they believe that from that spot the vapors of the head are expelled.	Others said that the cautery should be carried through to burn a deep impression in the bone so that there should come out of the bone a piece shaped like a grain of a carob tree or a small spindle-whorl; they asserted that the vapours of the head would be exhaled through this place.	0.691499
The wound should be kept open for a long time, and then be treated until it is consolidated.	The wound should be kept open a long while, then dressed until healed.	0.92190886
But to me, these two kinds of cauterization have not been seen at all, except in some men as a means of precaution; and leave that, in my view, it is better for health, as it is; because the head is weakened by the breaking of its continuity as we have testified in other members, especially when the patient's head is of fragile nature.	But these two methods of cauterization I do not consider right except on certain men; and I regard them as risky. In my opinion, to let the patient alone is preferable and safer, if it is to be. For the head is weakened when its natural continuity is broken, as we see in other parts, and particularly when the patient's head is weak by nature.	0.8599604
And the first type of cauterization is safer and better in my view; use that one and work with that for health.	In my opinion the first type of cauterization is safer and better; therefore use that and be safe.	0.8638792
Second chapter.	CHAPTER TWO.	0.80715764
Of the cauterization of the head.	On cauterization of the head (continued).	0.6146507
And I will tell this cautery in its place, because the cautery with which the horns of the head and the occiput are cauterized is a more subtle cautery than that with which the middle of the head is cauterized; and this is its form.	I shall describe this cauterization in its own place. The cautery for the frontal prominences and occiput must be more slender than that for the middle part.	0.71196866
Third chapter.	CHAPTER THREE.	0.8320424
Of the cauterization of recent migraine.	On the cauterization of non-chronic migraine.	0.6872401
When sudden pain arises in the part of the head, or pain is extended into the eye, evacuate the head with cleansing medicines, and administer the other treatment which I have mentioned in the divisions of diseases; and if all that does not help, then cauterization in that place is done in two ways: either with acute burning medicine or with iron.	When there occurs pain with headache in one side of the head and the pain extends to the eye; and the patient has cleared his head with purging drugs and there has been applied the other treatment that I have mentioned in the sections on diseases, but to no avail; in this disorder cauterization is of two sorts, either with caustic or with the actual cautery.	0.82176155
But cauterization with burning medicine is that you take a clove of garlic, peel it, and cut off the ends of both heads. Then incise the spot of the pain in the temple with a broad lancet until a space is made beneath the skin, until it is hidden.	This is the manner of cauterization with caustic: take one clove of garlic; peel it and cut both ends off; then cut open the site of the pain in the temple with a broad scalpel till there is room to contain the clove under the skin; then introduce it under the skin till it lies completely hidden.	0.7659551
Then press on it with a stopper for gradual constriction, and leave it for three hours; then untie it and remove the garlic, and leave the wound for two or three days, then place cotton soaked in vinegar over it until the spot makes a scab.	Then bind up the wound tightly over it with pads and leave for fifteen hours; then unbind it, remove the garlic, and leave the wound open for two or three days; then apply cotton wool soaked in butter till it suppurates.	0.851924
Then treat it with ointment until it is healed.	Then dress with ointment till it heals.	0.9150573
And if you wish, do this with some burning medicines which I have written about in the twelfth treatise of burning medicines.	If you would rather, you may carry it out with one of the caustic drugs that I have included in the eighteenth treatise, on caustics.	0.7791809
But cauterization with iron in this manner: ignite the cautery iron of which this is the form:	The actual cauterization with iron should be done in this way: heat a cautery of this shape.	0.74660647
It is called "clavis clavis", because its head is like the shape of a nail in which there is some curvature, and in the middle of it there is a small eminence.	It is called the claviform; the head is nailshaped in that there is a slight curvature with a small protuberance in the middle.	0.76172066
Then place it on the spot of the pain, and hold your hand — so that the artery beneath it is not burnt — and rotate the iron little by little with speed.	Apply it then to the site of the pain, hold your hand steady and revolve it little by little.	0.69082826
And if the amount that is burnt is approximately half the thickness of the skin, lift your hand so that the artery beneath is not burnt, so that no blood flow comes.	Let the thickness of skin burnt be about half; then remove your hand so as not to burn a subjacent artery, for thus a haemorrhage arises.	0.7916932
Then soak cotton in salt water and place it on the spot, and leave it for three days; then place cotton soaked in vinegar, and then treat with ointment until it is healed.	Then soak some cotton wool in saline, apply to the place, and leave three days; then apply cotton wool with butter; then treat with ointment till it heals.	0.9370961
And if you wish, cauterize with the tip of the surgical knife according to the cautery, and beware of incision of the artery in this recent migraine.	Or if you prefer you can cauterize this migraine with the knife-edge that juts out from the cautery; but be careful not to cut an artery, specially in this kind of migraine that is non-chronic.	0.69399047
Chapter Four:	CHAPTER FOUR.	0.67906916
On the Cauterization of Chronic Migraine	On the cauterization of chronic migraine.	0.8711916
When you treat chronic migraine with the remedies we have previously described and those outlined in the sections on diseases, and if the treatment does not work, and you see that it is necessary to go beyond what was described in the initial cautery with medicine or cautery with fire, then you must ignite the cautery iron until it is white-hot. Mark the spot of the pain with a line about half the length of a finger, or nearly so; place your hand firmly once and press it until you cut through the skin and reach the bone.	When you have treated a migraine in the way we have described and with what we have mentioned in the sections on diseases, and the treatment is ineffective, and you perceive that the malady is such that the cauterization we have mentioned before does not suffice for it, either with caustic or with the actual cautery, you should heat an edged cautery to white heat after you have marked the place with a line half a finger's breadth long or thereabouts; and impress your hand once and maintain the pressure till you cut down upon the artery and reach the bone.	0.91015166
However, it is necessary to avoid the continuation of the jaw, which moves during mastication, and to ensure that the muscle is not burned and the nerve that controls it is not damaged, to prevent spasms.	You must be careful of the mandibular joint which moves in chewing, that you do not cut the muscle or tendon that moves it, causing spasm.	0.71199036
And it is crucial to be cautious about the blood flow from the artery that may be cut, as there is fear in cutting it, especially for those who are inexperienced and not diligent or trained; leave the operation at that initial stage.	Have the utmost care of haemorrhage from the artery you have cut, for the occurrence of that is dangerous, specially with one who does not know what to do, having no experience or practice; it is better to refrain from operating.	0.77994263
I will come back with a reminder about the management of accidental bleeding from the artery in its proper place in this book.	We shall later on mention a treatment for accidental haemorrhage of the artery, in due detail, in its proper place in this book.	0.7533904
And if you see that this disease is not addressed by this cautery and the patient's body is strong enough, cauterize in the middle of the head as we have described, and treat the wound until it is healed.	But if you see that this cautery is not enough for this disorder and you see that the patient is of bodily fitness for it, cauterize him in the middle of the head as we have described, and treat the wound till healed.	0.87721306
And if you wish, use the cautery method mentioned in the chapter on arterial constriction with a cautery with two blades; this is a better and more effective cauterization.	If you prefer, employ that cauterization which we have described in the chapter on the extraction of an artery, with the cautery of two blades; for that is a cauterization better and more effective than this.	0.88092256

On the Cauterization of Ear Pain	On cauterization of pain in the ears.	0.83238655
When pain occurs in the ear due to cold and is treated with laxative measures and other treatments described in the section, and the pain persists, then ignite the cautery iron, which is called "puncta", of which this is the form:	When the ear gets a pain from the cold and is treated with laxatives and other medicine as mentioned in its section and the pain nevertheless persists, heat the cautery termed 'punctate'.	0.8286321
Then mark close to the ignition, and move it around the entire ear as if revolving a wheel, or in the circuit of each segment if the pain is in each one. Extend yourself with the cautery from the root of the ear little by little after marking the spot with a probe.	Then after it has been heated prick with it in a circle right round the ear, or around both if there is pain in both, after the place has been marked with ink; the cauterizations being a little away from the ear.	0.77603894
If the cautery has ten points in the entire ear, or nearly so, treat the spots until they are healed.	Let the cauterization be of ten punctures or thereabouts round each. Then dress the places till healed.	0.6511048
Chapter Six:	CHAPTER six.	0.75782055
On the Cauterization of Torticollis	Cauterization of the twisted mouth.	0.42608717
Torticollis which is cured with cauterization is only of the types caused by phlegm, as we have said in the sections on diseases.	The twisting of the mouth which is curable with the cautery is of that nature which arises from phlegm, as we have already noticed in the sections on sicknesses.	0.70100975
Avoid cauterization of the type that arises from dryness or from nerve spasm.	But cauterization is to be carefully avoided in that type which is due to dryness or spasm of the tendon.	0.7129215
When you treat that type of torticollis with cups, head purges, and other treatments, and it does not improve, then you must cauterize the patient with three cauteries: one near the root of the ear, the second a little below the temple, and the third near the junction of the two lips.	When this kind of deformity has been treated with electuaries, errhines, and gargles, and your treatment is ineffective, you should use three cauterizations: one at the root of the ear; the second a little below the temple; and the third at the junction of the lips.	0.7572374
And place your cautery on the opposite side of the affected part, because softening only occurs in the part that appears healthy.	Let your cauterization be on the opposite side to the affected side, for the relaxation will arise in the side which seems normal.	0.7587313
The method of cauterization is to cauterize with the cautery iron at the right of the uppermost part of the ear, a little above the horn of the head, and at the temple on the other side, the length of which is about the length of a thumb, and apply your hand with the cautery iron until it burns about half the thickness of the skin.	The form taken by the cauterization is that you burn him a little below the frontal prominence, on a level with the upper tip of the ear, and also on the temple the length of the thumb; carry the burning to a depth of about half the thickness of the skin.	0.7991519
This is the form of the cautery iron, and it is a type of surgical knife, the form of which is set out beforehand. However, it is more subtle when it is slightly like this; and the knife should be slightly thicker than usual.	The shape of the cautery. It is a variety of the bladed cautery such as has already been described, but is rather more slender as you see. Its blade should have a certain thickness.	0.7181637

When apoplexy is chronic and you treat it with the remedies we have mentioned and the medication does not help and the patient does not have a fever, then cauterize with four cauteries: on all the horns of the head; with a cautery iron in the middle of the head as we have described; and with a cautery on the nape of the neck. The method of cauterization is done as previously described.	When an apoplexy has lasted a long while and has been treated by those methods we have given and your treatment has been ineffective but the patient has no fever, then burn him with four cauterizations: one on each frontal prominence; one in the middle of his head as we have described; and one at the back of the head as has been said.	0.8602016
And it is also cauterized on the pit of the stomach; and this is more posterior; then treat with what has been previously mentioned.	The shape of the cauteries to be as before.

Then shave the patient's entire head and place a cedar plaster on the nape of the neck, as described in the treatise on plasters.	Then let his whole head be shaved and apply a mustard plaster to the hinder part as described in the treatise on plasters.	0.79307586
Apply it several times, as it acts in a similar manner to cauterization. Do this according to the same order already described.	That should be applied several times as it is a kind of cauterization; do it in the very way described there.	0.8134994
If the patient is healed by these methods, that is good; if not, then make three cauteries on the back of the head, descending from the uppermost part of the head to the lowest part of the neck. Place the cauteries about a finger's width apart, and treat them with the previously mentioned remedies.	If he is cured, well and good; but if not, burn him with three cauterizations on the back of the head, arranging them in a row downward from the upper part of the head to the base of the neck; and make an interval between each pair of one finger's breadth. Then treat as aforesaid.	0.8764242
But if you want to add more and the patient can tolerate it, then make a cautery in the middle of the head; and if you want to add even more, then cauterize over the two horns.	If you wish to add to these cauterizations and the patient be fit to bear it, give him a burn in the middle; and if still more, then burn him on the two frontal prominences.	0.8071741
Then treat the area until it is healed; and let the cautery be olive-shaped as previously described.	Then dress till healed. Let the cautery be an olivary as described before.	0.7910828

You should proceed with cleansing the head with jars and the remedies we have mentioned; then shave the patient's head, and cauterize with a cautery iron in the middle of the head, on all the horns of the head, on the nape of the neck, and with three cauteries on the vertebrae of the neck.	Purgation of the head should come first, with electuaries and the other things we have mentioned. Then shave the patient's head; and then burn him with one cauterization in the middle of the head and one on either frontal prominence and one on the occiput, and three on the vertebrae of the neck.	0.85504115
If necessary, in the case of softening of the body, if the disease is severe and the patient can tolerate it, then make four cauteries on the vertebrae of the back, and finally cauterize until the skin is deeply burned, and then lift your hand.	And if the malady of flaccidity of the body require still more and the patient be fit to bear it, and his disease be severe and have a strong hold on him, burn him with four more cauterizations on his dorsal vertebrae and carry the cautery to burn almost through the thickness of the skin; then remove your hand and treat him in the aforesaid manner till he is healed.	0.764902

Initially, you should cleanse their brain with cups and other treatments mentioned in the division if the patient is an adult and can tolerate the use of medicines.	When the patient is an adult and can stand taking the drugs, he should first purify his brain by great electuaries and the rest of the treatment mentioned in that section.	0.74997115
If it is a child who cannot endure the medicines, administer fumigations and chewing substances that cleanse the brain for several days before the procedure, combined with suitable food.	But if it be a boy unable to tolerate the drugs he should employ gargles and medicaments to chew, to clear his brain, for several days beforehand, with an improvement in his diet.	0.76738477
Then shave the patient's head and cauterize the middle of the head following the previously described method, and another cautery on the back of the head, and on each horn of the head. If the patient is strong and can endure it, cauterize them as described for paralysis and softening of the body, on the cervical and dorsal vertebrae.	Then let his head be shaved and burn him with the single cauterization on the middle of the head in the manner described before, and with one cauterization on the occiput, and one on each frontal prominence; and, if the patient be fit and able to bear it, add those additional cauterizations on the cervical and dorsal vertebrae that we have already described for paralysis and for flaccidity.	0.8359866

Do this once a week with other suitable regimens until cured. Or, if preferred, cauterize the patient with small points in the same manner, ensuring you hold the cautery appropriately. This type of cautery moistens the brain evenly.	Do this once a week with other efficacious treatment till he is cured. If you wish, burn him with multiple small puncture cauterizations; nor press long on the cautery but let this cauterization be only just punctured.

If additional cautery is needed, cauterize on each side of the eye’s tail at the end of the eyebrow with a small cautery.	When tears are constantly in the eye and arise on account of the arteries and veins visible on the outside of the head, and you are sure that they are from cold thick phlegmatic superfluities, burn him with the very cautery that I taught for the beginning of cataract, namely, a cauterization in the middle of the head and two on the temples, and two on the back of the neck below the two bones; and, if you are compelled to add more, one cauterization on the side of the outer corner of each eye at the end of the eyebrow, with a small cautery.	0.8688212

On the Cauterization of the Eyelid When Hairs Grow Inward and Hurt the Eye.	On cauterization of the eyelid when the eyelashes are turned inwards, irritating the eye.	0.75879204
When the hairs of the eye grow inward and hurt the eye, cauterization can be done in two ways: either with fire or with a caustic medicine.	The cauterization is of two kinds, by fire and by caustic.	0.62184525
If using fire, instruct the patient beforehand to let their hairs grow long and straight; and if it hurts them at the root, bind their eyes with a bandage so that they are not hurt until the hairs have grown.	Cauterization by fire will be thus: tell the patient previously, if he is one of those who pluck the lashes, to let them grow till they are long and straight; and if during growth they irritate him, bind the eyes with a fillet so as not to move till they have grown.	0.7508972
When the hairs have grown long and straight, place the patient's head on your knee, and mark the eyelid with a marking rod in the shape of a myrtle leaf, starting the mark near the hairs.	When they have grown and are straight, put the patient's head in your lap and mark upon the eyelid with ink the shape of a myrtle leaf, beginning near the lashes.	0.8938261
Then place cotton soaked in egg white or ptilli mucilage over the eye.	Then apply cotton wool soaked in egg-white or mucilage of psyllium seeds.	0.8111042
Then heat the cautery, which has this shape.	Then heat a cautery of this form.	0.7983039
Then cauterize over the marked figure bit by bit, many times, until the surface of the skin, marked like a myrtle leaf, is properly burned.	Then burn over the shape marked out, slowly, with many small strokes, till the whole surface of the skin marked out to the shape of the myrtle leaf be cauterized, specially the outer part of it.	0.7951573
A sign of the success of your work is when you see the eyelid is contracted and the hairs are elevated away from the eye.	It will show the correctness of your work if you see the eyelid contracted and the lashes risen away from the white of the eye.	0.7642834
Then lift your hand and leave it for three days, and then apply cotton soaked in butter until the scab is removed. Then treat it with ointment until it is healed.	Then remove your hand and let him be for three days. Then apply cotton wool soaked in butter till the scab falls off; then treat the place with ointment till healed.	0.9529989
But if the condition returns due to the hairs at their root and the eyelid is softened, cauterize it again as you did the first time.	But if after an interval there be a return of the same condition of the eyelash and of drooping of the eyelid, repeat the cauterization in the same place just as you did before.	0.7557459
If the hairs are on the lower eyelid, cauterize it until it is raised to its natural position and straightened so that the hairs do not hurt the eye.	And if it be in the lower lid cauterize this also till it falls back to its normal position and the hairs do not irritate the eye.	0.8044634
The cauterization with caustic medicine involves instructing the patient to let the hairs grow long and straight, then preparing a piece of cloth in the shape of a myrtle leaf.	This is the method of burning with caustic: bid the patient let the lashes grow long and straight; then make the shape of a myrtle leaf out of paper.	0.74658406
Then take known soap and an ounce of quicklime, mix them well, and do this quickly so it does not cool. Then spread the mixture on the cloth shaped like a myrtle leaf, and place it on one or both eyes; place cotton soaked in egg white under the eye, and position the patient's head on your knee.	Then take of common soap and of quicklime of each the weight of a drachm or thereabouts and beat them well together rapidly lest the mass get cold; then spread this on the paper shaped like a myrtle leaf and apply to the eyelid of one or both eyes; place also under the eye cotton wool soaked in egg-white; the patient's head being in your lap.	0.900298
Press the medicine slightly, but do not move it until the patient feels a biting sensation from the medicine, as if it were fire.	Place your forefinger on the caustic and press it down a little and move it about according as the patient feels the bite of the caustic; for he will feel it sting like fire.	0.7069399
When the patient feels the biting sensation, remove the medicine and rub the area with your finger; when the sensation stops, remove the medicine and wash the eye with water; then see if the eyelid is already raised as it would be by fire or incision, and if not, apply the medicine again on the area where it was not effective, until the operation is complete and the eye is contracted.	While the stinging lasts, let the caustic remain on and move it about with your finger; and when the stinging dies down take away the caustic and wash the eye with water; then look, and if you see the eyelid raised up as by a blepharoplasty, either by fire or by incision, good. If not, repeat the caustic application in the place that the drug has not affected and which has not gone black, until your operation is complete and the eyelid draws together.	0.81047493
Then apply cotton soaked in butter until the burn scab is removed, and treat it with ointment until healed.	Then apply cotton wool with butter till the crust of the burn falls away; then treat with Palm ointment or the like till it be healed.	0.81250745
You must be vigilant that no medicine falls into the eye during the operation, and if the eyelid softens again and the hairs cause pain, repeat the medicine on the softened area of the eyelid as you did initially, and treat it until it is healed.	But in your operative procedure take the utmost care lest the least bit of caustic get into the eye. And if, after some days, the eyelid be relaxed and some eyelash irritate the eye, then repeat the application, particularly in that part of the lid that has dropped, in the same manner as before; and treat till cured.	0.75242645

On the Cauterization of a Fistula in the Lacrimal Duct of the Eye.	On cauterization of a fistula in the angle of the eye.	0.75582635
When treating a fistula according to the previous divisions of diseases and your treatment does not succeed, it is necessary to cauterize in the following manner: instruct the patient to rest their head on your knee, and have an assistant hold the patient's head steady so it does not move or shake.	When you have treated a fistula in those ways mentioned in the sections on diseases, without success, it should be cauterized after this manner. Bid the patient put his head in your lap; and let an assistant hold his head in front of you without moving or stirring.	0.8379431
Then place cotton soaked in egg white or ptilli mucilage over the patient's eye.	Then place on his eyes cotton wool damped with egg-white or mucilage of psyllium seeds.	0.8169027
Next, heat the cautery,	Then heat a cautery shaped thus.	0.4964431
which should be concave in shape, similar to a reed or vulture's feather, with one end suitable for the cautery.	It should be hollow and in shape like a fine tube, like an eagle's quill, at the one end that is used as a cautery.	0.75110465
If desired, it can be penetrating to the other end. And if you prefer, it can be a rod shape.	And if you wish it may be perforated to the other extremity; or it can be solid like a probe.	0.8077595
However, the concave one is better for your work.	But this hollow instrument will be better for your operation.	0.7015595
Then press the fistula if it is open, extract the pus, and dry it. If it is not open, then open it and remove the pus.	Then press on the fistula if it be open and get the matter out of it and wipe it away; or if it is not open, then open it.	0.8685444
Then place the well-heated cautery on the fistula, holding it from the eye to the nose to avoid errors or disturbing the patient, and apply the cautery to the tissue to cauterize it.	Then apply to it the cautery, which should be very hot, and press it in with your hand till it reaches the bone. While you are burning keep the hand away from the eye slightly toward the nasal side, lest your hand slip or the patient draw away so that you put the cautery into the ball of the eye and destroy it.	0.6628684
If the initial cauterization reaches the bone, that is good; if not, repeat the cauterization once or twice if necessary; then leave it for three days, and apply cotton soaked in butter and cover it with a drying ointment until healed.	And if you reach the bone at the first cauterization, good; if not, repeat the cauterization if necessary. Leave it a few days, then put on cotton wool with butter and treat with hygroscopic ointment till it heals.	0.83073026
But if after ten days it is not healed, then apply a strong corrosive medicine until the bone is exposed and treat it as described in the appropriate chapter.	And should forty days have passed and it does not heal, apply a sharp corrosive ointment so as to expose the bone, and strip it as will be explained in the appropriate chapter.	0.74780226
Another method of cauterizing a fistula as suggested by some early practitioners is: locate the fistula and place a fine wick in it. Then pour a small amount (one ounce) of melted lead into the fissure; hold your hand steady with the wick to ensure the molten lead does not reach the patient's eye. Place cotton soaked in egg white or water over the patient's eye, as the lead will cauterize the fistula and heal it miraculously.	Another method of cauterizing a fistula is that which some of the Ancients mentioned: apply yourself to the site of the fistula and incise it; then insert into the incision a fine funnel, this being the figure of it, and pour into it a drachm of molten lead; and keep your hand on the funnel, holding it firm all the time, and do not let the patient move at all, lest the molten lead run into his eyes. Then you should put cotton wool soaked in egg-white or water upon the patient's eye.	0.8684788
If the fistula heals with the cauterization and treatment mentioned, that is good; if not, it is necessary to create a nasal passage and redirect the fistula to the nasal cavity as described in its appropriate section.	If the fistula heals by the cauterization and medication we have described, well and good; otherwise perforation of the nose will undoubtedly have to be undertaken to lead the fistula into the meatus of the nose, by the technique that will come in its own place.	0.84205836

The concavity of the cautery should match the fineness of a knife.	The hollow should be as sharp as a knife.	0.61871314
Carefully place the heated cautery in the fissures until it reaches the base of the fissures.	Then quickly place it, hot, right on the fissure till the burning has reached the depth of the lip.	0.6011917

When an abscess forms in the root of the uvula, palate, or tooth roots, and it breaks and becomes chronic, forming a fistula, and your treatment is ineffective, it is necessary to use a cautery. Heat the cautery to fit the fistula and insert it into the fistula, holding it until the hot iron reaches the base; repeat this once or twice if needed, and then treat it as previously described until it heals.	When there comes a tumour in the base of the gums or in the palate or in the roots of the molar teeth, and it becomes purulent and breaks out and a fistula comes from the flow of pus, and you have treated this without effect, you should heat a cautery of a size to fit the fistula; then introduce it hot into the fistula opening; and continue the pressure with it hot until the iron, still hot, reaches the hollow and the extremity of it. Do this once or twice over. Then afterwards treat as we have mentioned until it heals.	0.8874495
If the pus is removed and it heals, that is good; if not, it is necessary to expose the area and remove the decayed bone as described in the relevant chapter.	If the matter stops and it heals, well and good; otherwise it is impossible to avoid opening up the place and removing the diseased bone in the manner we shall speak of in its proper chapter.	0.78290737

When the gums are softened by moisture and the teeth are loose, and treatment with medicine does not help, rest the patient's head on your knee, and heat the cautery. The form of the cautery should be such that you place the cannula over the tooth and insert the heated cautery quickly, holding it until the patient feels the heat reach the root of the tooth.	When the gums are relaxed on account of humidity and the teeth are loose, and you treat this with drugs, and your treatment is ineffectual, then place the patient's head in your lap; then heat the cautery whose picture will come later. Put a cannula upon his tooth and quickly introduce the glowing cautery into it and press a little until the patient can feel the heat of the fire reaching the root of the tooth; then remove your hand.	0.866501
Then remove your hand and repeat the cauterization a few times as needed.	Then repeat the cauterization as many times as you may desire.	0.73614764
Then the patient should fill their mouth with salt water, hold it for an hour, and then spit it out. This will firm the loose tooth, tighten the softened gums, and dry out the moisture.

On the Cauterization for Tooth Pain.	On cauterization for toothache.	0.8946125
When tooth pain is caused by cold, frost, or worms, and treatment with medicine is ineffective, cauterization can be done in two ways: with cow's butter or with fire.	When the toothache arises on account of cold, or if there be a worm in the tooth, and medical treatment does not avail, then cauterization should be undertaken. There are two ways of doing this, one with butter, the other with the cautery.	0.75136137
Cauterization with butter involves boiling cow's butter in an iron ladle, wrapping cotton around the end of a stick, dipping it in the boiled butter, and quickly placing it on the painful tooth until it cools.	Cauterization with butter is done thus: take cows' butter and let it boil in an iron ladle or pan; then take cotton wool, wind it round the top of a probe, and dip it in the boiling butter and quickly apply it to the aching tooth and hold it there till cold.	0.7703538
Repeat this several times until the heat penetrates the root of the tooth.	Repeat this a number of times till the power of the fire reaches the root of the tooth.	0.8965294
If you prefer, soak wool or cotton in the butter, place it on the painful tooth, and apply a hot iron on top until the heat reaches the base of the tooth cavity.	If you prefer, dip wool or cotton in cold butter and put it on the aching tooth, then on top of that apply the hot iron until the heat of the fire reaches the root of the tooth.	0.94986
However, cauterization with fire involves using a brass or iron cannula with some thickness to ensure the heat does not reach the patient's mouth.	The actual cautery is administered thus: take a tube of bronze or iron with some thickness in the body of it so that the intensity of the fire does not reach the patient's mouth.	0.6817452
Then heat the cautery, apply it to the tooth, and hold it until it cools; repeat this a few times as needed to relieve the pain, either the same day or the next day.	Then heat a cautery whose figure will be given shortly, and apply it to the tooth itself and hold your hand until the cautery gets cold. Do this several times over; the pain will certainly depart the same day or the next.	0.84900457
The patient should fill their mouth with good butter, hold it for an hour, and then spit it out. This is the form of the cautery.	After this cauterization the patient is to fill his mouth with good butter and keep it in for a while, then spit it out. This is the figure of the cautery.	0.81149614
Use whichever extremity you find most suitable for cauterization.	Cauterize with whichever end you prefer according to circumstances.	0.56355613

When extrophulos are caused by phlegm and cold humors and do not respond to digestive medicines, and you want to digest them quickly, heat the concave cautery, which should have two open ends for smoke to escape. Apply the heated cautery to the abscess once, or as needed, until it reaches the base of the abscess.	When the tumours arise from phlegm and cold humidities and are not to be dispersed with medicines and you wish for a rapid dispersal, then heat the hollow cautery of which this is the figure. It is open at both ends to give exit for the fumes of burning from the other end. Place it hot, right on the tumour, once, or twice if need be, till you reach the bottom of the tumour.	0.7492802
If the abscess is small, apply the cautery according to the size of the abscess, leave it for three days, and apply cotton soaked in butter until the burnt tissue is removed.	If the tumour be small, suit the cautery to the size of the tumour. Then let be for three days and apply cotton wool soaked in butter until the eschar has disappeared.	0.8934215

When cough and lung disease are due to cold humidity and the patient has no fever or tuberculosis and it is an old illness, then cauterize them with two cauteries on the furcula (collarbone) in the depressed places, lion-like and bulbous; and with another cautery in the middle of the chest between the two nipples; and let the cautery be a pointed type according to the previous form.	When the cough and pulmonary disease arise from cold humidities and the patient suffers from no fever or wasting but the disease is chronic, sear him with two cauterizations over the two clavicles, in the soft depressions ; and with another cauterization in the mid-line of the chest between the breasts. Let the cautery be claviform as described above.	0.8331383
And if you wish, let your cauterization be point-like with the cautery called puncta, the form of which is described earlier in the section on ear pain.	And if you prefer, make punctate cauterizations with the cautery called 'punctate'; its shape has already been described under pricking for earache.	0.82444423
And let there be points among them; and then treat them with the same method as before until healed.	Then treat as aforesaid until healed.	0.5711082
And if the cautery has three branches for the cauterization: in one session, you can make three cauteries in this form:	Sometimes also a trident cautery is prepared, in this manner, with which you can burn more speedily; for with this you can apply three cauterizations at once.	0.5135643

When the head of the shoulder is dislocated due to slippery humidity and it is not fixed at the time of its return to its usual position, and with a small movement it dislocates again, as we have observed, then you must first reduce the dislocation, and then the patient should be laid on their back or on their healthy side; and then raise the tendon that is in the inner part of the shoulder to the upper parts with the fingers of your left hand, if the joint is dislocated inward.	When the head of the humerus is dislocated on account of the synovial fluid or when it does not remain in the correct position after the dislocation has been set, so that this becomes a regular occurrence—it is set and then dislocates with the least movement, as we have ourselves seen; you must first set the luxation, then make the patient lie down on his back or on his sound side; then with the fingers of the left hand lift up the skin of the axilla if the joint has dislocated downwards.	0.848174
And then heat the cautery with two heads; and this is the form:	Then heat a cautery provided with two spits in this manner.	0.6396269
And then cauterize the tendon until it penetrates into the other side; and the figure of the cauterization will then have four heads of the cauteries.	Then with that burn through the fold of skin till you have perforated to the other side, getting four cauterizations. The cautery may be of three prongs and then the form of the cauterization will be six burns.	0.7722122
And sometimes it is adjusted according to this calculation and therefore there are eight cauteries.	Sometimes there is added yet one more so there will be eight burns.	0.5902384
And then place cooked salt on the cautery, and then make the patient rest in tranquility, and the limb should not be moved for some time until it is strengthened.	Put on the burns leeks well pounded with salt; then keep the patient absolutely quiet so as not to move the joint for a time till it gains strength.	0.8023475
And if the dislocation is in the upper parts and this is done later, then cauterize on the muscle with a pointed cautery or with many pointed cauteries, because the joint is confirmed and the humidity is removed and the patient is healed.	If the dislocation has gone upwards, which very rarely happens, then cauterize him above the shoulder with one good claviform cautery or with multiple punctured cauterizations. Thus the joint will gain strength and the humidity will disappear and the patient will be cured.	0.7604908

When cold and much humidity come to the stomach, causing it to deviate from its usual condition and this leads to a thickening of the tissues, and if you continue the usual treatments without success, then the patient should lie on their back, extending their arms and legs, and then cauterize with three cauteries: one below the chest the width of a finger with a pointed cautery, and two cauteries below on both sides of the first cautery, forming a triangular shape; and space them so they are not too close together to avoid causing putrefaction.	When cold and many humidities get into the stomach, so that its constitution is disturbed and much fluxion has come to it, and a variety of treatment has been tried to no effect, the patient must be put on his back with legs and arms outstretched; then give him a threefold cauterization: one a finger's breadth below the hollow of the chest with the claviform cautery; and two below and to the sides of the first cauterization, so that it has a triangular appearance; but there should be some distance between each lest they run together when suppuration sets in.	0.8676421
And the depth of the cautery should be two-thirds the thickness of the tendon.	Let the depth of the burning be two-thirds of the depth of the skin.	0.71735674
And let the figure of the cautery be in this form without addition. If you prefer, cauterize with a large cautery in the middle of the stomach in this form; and let this be a circular cautery in this form:	Let the shape of the cauterizations be thus and of no more than this size. If you wish, make a single large cauterization in the middle of the stomach, thus. The cautery for this single cauterization is circular, thus.	0.81943536
And let the stomach be cauterized with pointed cautery for those afraid of this cautery: mark points on the stomach according to the amount needed, and then cauterize with the pointed cautery; and then treat it with the previously described method until healed.	The stomach may be cauterized with punctures in the case of a person who fears this operation. You will have marked the points with ink on the stomach, as many as you wish; then sear with a punctate cautery. Then treat as previously described until he be healed.	0.8153225

When there is pain in the liver due to coldness or humidity or large amounts of gas, causing it to deviate from its normal state due to the expulsion of excesses, and the patient is not cured with the previously mentioned treatments, then the patient should lie on their back, and mark three cauteries in this form and this same amount on the liver below the hypochondria, where the human decubitus is.	When there is pain in the liver from cold and humidity or from thick vapour, so there is a severe disturbance of its natural constitution, and the patient has been treated as prescribed in the appropriate section but with no effect, the patient should lie back, and you should mark with ink the places of three cauterizations, in this form and exactly of this size below the costal cartilages, where the elbow reaches.	0.7246683
And let the space between each cautery be the thickness of a finger, and let the cautery be along the length of the body straight.	Let there be a finger's breadth between each pair of cauterizations and let the burning be straight along the length of the body.	0.8096676
And do not compress the area too much with the cautery.	Do not press the cautery hard with your hand.	0.5728314
And if the amount that is burned is the size of half the thickness of the tendon, and it should not be too tight; and if the patient is standing, then let them stand on their feet; if they are not standing, then they should lie down, with their legs extended and their arms raised.	Let the thickness of the skin you burn be half its thickness, not more; and let the patient be standing on his feet during the cauterization. Alternatively he may be recumbent with legs outstretched and arms raised. Figure of the cautery.	0.76309276
And it is possible for you to cauterize these cauteries with a knife cautery if you have the skill and prudence in the art.	You will also be able to do these cauterizations with the edged cautery when you have craft and facility in the art.	0.8120021
And be careful not to proceed too much in the cauterization, and let the whole thickness of the tendon be burned so that the entire body is burned and it reaches the intestines, because the tendon here is delicate; and know this.	Be careful lest you go too deep with the cautery and burn the whole thickness of the skin and the abdomen and penetrate to the intestine, for the skin there is thin; bear this in mind.	0.80601263

On the perforation of a liver abscess with a cautery.	On incising a tumour of the liver with the cautery.	0.8657419
When an abscess forms in the liver and you want to know if the abscess is in the liver tissue or in its covering, if it is in the liver tissue, the patient feels heaviness and pain without sharpness.	When there is an abscess in the liver and you are anxious to know if the tumour is in the body of the liver or in its capsule: if it is in the substance of the liver, the patient will be suffering from a feeling of heaviness and no very acute pain.	0.82426536
And if it is in the covering of the liver, the pain is sharp and sometimes the doctors are already exhausted by treating it.	But if it is in the capsule of the liver there will be the sharpest intensity of pain and you will see that it has baffled the doctors.	0.6664299
So the patient should be turned onto their back; then mark the place of the abscess with ink; and then heat the cautery which is shaped like a needle, the form of which was described on the previous page. And cauterize with that cautery until the entire tendon is burned, until it reaches the covering, so that pus may escape.	Then the patient should lie back on his neck; then mark the place of the swelling with ink. Then heat the cautery in the fire, this being the cautery resembling a probe, of this form, and with that make one cauterization till the whole thickness of the skin is burnt through, finishing up at the capsule so that all the purulent matter comes out.	0.900442
And then treat it as with other abscesses until it is healed.	Then apply the treatment for wounds.	0.4673736
And it is not suitable to use this form of cautery except by someone whose study in the art of medicine is advanced and who has treated many illnesses; this operation should only be attempted by experienced practitioners, but it is best to leave it to us.	This kind of cauterization should not be employed except by one who has a long experience of the medical art and who has frequent practice at dealing with this kind of disease. Then he can undertake this kind of operation. But in my opinion it would be better to pass it by.	0.8083432

The ancients said that the cautery made from the roots of aristologia for cold pleurisy is done in this way: take a long dry root of aristologia that is found and is the thickness of a finger.	The Ancients mentioned a cauterization for cold pleurisy by means of the roots of the long birthwort, in this fashion: you take the longest you can find of the roots of the long dry birthwort, and of the thickness of one finger; dip this in oil and light it at the fire; then burn the patient with one cauterization in the space between the junction of the neck with the clavicle; and two small cauterizations below the jugular veins, inclining slightly toward the region below the beard.	0.6311651
Then submerge it in oil and heat it in the fire, and then cauterize with one cautery in the place between the continuation of the furcula (collarbone) and the neck; and with two small cauteries below the clavicles, slightly inclined to the area below the chin, and with two cauteries between the fifth and sixth ribs, slightly inclined to the back; and with another cautery in the middle of the chest; and another on the stomach, and three cauteries on the back; and one cautery in the place between the two shoulders, and two cauteries on both sides of the chest, below the cautery between the two shoulders.	And two big cauterizations above the nipples in the space between the third and fourth ribs; and two more between the fifth and sixth ribs, tending slightly toward the back; and another in the middle of the chest; and another above the stomach; and three more behind, namely, one between the scapulae and two on either side of the dorsal spine below the one between the scapulae.	0.75077224
And it is not necessary to press too much with the cautery, but it should be evident in the tendon during the procedure.	It is not necessary to cauterize deeply, but let it be a mere hint, in the outer skin.	0.49218127
Some ancients also said that some people use a cautery of iron similar to a rod and heat it, placing it in the location between the ribs, until it reaches the abscess and pus is expelled, as we have said for the liver abscess.	Now one of the Ancients mentioned that there were some people who used an iron cautery shaped like a probe, and introduced it red hot into the intercostal space until it reached the abscess itself and evacuated the pus, as we have mentioned under tumour of the liver.	0.84226215
But in this perforation with cautery, there is no fear, because one can die immediately or it can cause a fistula that cannot be healed.	But in this perforation with the cautery there is a danger either that the patient may die on the spot or that an incurable fistula may arise at the place.	0.7891818

On the cauterization of the spleen.	On cauterization of the spleen.	0.9932649
When you treat the disease of the spleen using the method we have mentioned in the previous section and your treatment does not work, then cauterize it in one of three ways, all of which are correct. One way is to make three or four linear cauterizations along the length of the spleen, similar to the cauterizations for the liver, as previously described.	When you have treated disease of the spleen by the means that we have mentioned in the section and your treatment is ineffectual, there will be three ways of cauterization, each of which will be correct. One is to make three or four cauterizations in a row over the long axis of the spleen like the cauterization of the liver, a figure of which has been given above.	0.9437518
There should be a space the width of a finger or a little more between each cauterization, and the manner of cauterization should be the same as described for the liver.	Let there be between each pair of burns a finger's breadth or a little more. Let the cautery be of the same shape as described above under cauterization of the liver.	0.78934795
Do not press too hard with the cautery; the patient should lie on their back.	Do not put pressure on the cautery. Have the patient's body supine.	0.7465946
Another method of cauterization is to heat a cautery with two edges, as mentioned in the chapter on muscle dislocation, and lift the tendon located in the area of the spleen where the patient lies on their left side.	The second method is to heat the cautery provided with two prongs, described in the chapter on dislocation of the shoulder.	0.7415224
And your lifting should be along the length of the body, so that the cauterizations are made along the width of the body.	Lift up the skin over the spleen at the level of the patient's left elbow; and let the fold of skin lie across the patient's body so that the cauterizations will fall longitudinally.	0.4991773
Then insert the two heated edges into the area to penetrate the tendon from the other side.	Then push in the two prongs, well heated, till you have pierced the skin from side to side.	0.706926
Then remove the cautery; now four cauterizations are made.	Then take out the cautery; and there are four cauterizations.	0.8671702
If you prefer, cauterize with a cautery that has three edges.	Or if you prefer you can burn with the other cautery, of three prongs.	0.6778101
Then treat the cauterization wound until it stops discharging pus after a few days, as this is more effective than previous treatments.	Then dress the site of cauterization after you have allowed pus to run therefrom for many days. This is more effective than any of the preceding treatments.	0.83720386

Cauterization is not normally used for dropsy except in specific cases.	The cautery is particularly effective in ascites.	0.5143167
When treating dropsy using the methods described previously, if your treatment does not work, then you should cauterize with four cauterizations around the navel, one on the stomach, one on the liver, one on the spleen, two between the vertebrae of the back, one on the right side of the chest, and one more on the stomach. The depth of the cauterization should be close to the thickness of the tendon.	When you have, without effect, treated a dropsical person with the various measures mentioned in the section on diseases, you should sear with four cauterizations around the umbilicus, and one over the stomach, another over the liver, and another over the spleen, and two behind his back between the vertebrae, one at the level of the breast and one at the level of the stomach; and let the burn be almost skin-deep.	0.778023
Then leave the cauterized area open so that it discharges pus for a long time.	Then keep the burn open so that it suppurates for a long while.	0.7774004
Do not stop the patient's treatment after cauterization until it is clear that the two intended purposes are achieved, which will hasten their recovery.	Do not let the patient, after cauterization, be without the necessary treatment, so that you combine both methods for him, and a cure will speedily come to him.	0.7001613
The shape of the cautery used for the abdomen should be like a nail, as previously described, and the one used for the back should be like an olive, as described before.	The cautery with which his belly is cauterized should be claviform like the figure previously given; while the one with which his back is cauterized should be olivary.	0.7901125

On the cauterization of the feet and thighs.	On cauterization of the legs and feet.	0.9800135
When the feet are swollen with dropsy and filled with yellow water, you should cauterize the feet on the top between the little toe and the ring toe, lift your hand with the cautery without twisting it; then lift your hand and do not completely return it, because the yellow water will discharge.	When, in the sufferer from dropsy, these swell and become full of yellowish fluid, you should cauterize the upper surface of the feet in the depression between the little and fourth toes; hold your hand upright with the cautery; do not let it slant. Then remove your hand and do no more cauterization whatever; for the yellowish fluid will exude.	0.8168514
The cauterization is done in this way: make two cauterizations on both thighs, and on each thigh, the cauterization should be done with the tip of the knife-shaped cautery. The cauterizations should be along the length of the thigh: one below the knee and the other in the middle of the thigh; and make two cauterizations on each thigh.	The cautery should be of this type. Then sear the legs with two cauterizations on each leg; cauterize with the bladed end of the cautery, and let it be along the length of the leg: one under the knee, the other lower than that, about the middle of the leg; and two more cauterizations over each femur.	0.87915266
Leave the wound open without treatment for a long time so that some of the water can discharge from it.	Leave the burns open without treatment for a long while during which the fluid will exude from them.	0.813239

When the abdomen is affected by cold and humidity, weakening the digestive and retentive functions of the stomach and intestines, and it is treated using conventional methods without success, sometimes the patient may require cauterization for beneficial results. Then cauterize with a large cautery on the stomach as previously described for stomach cauterization, with a circular cautery, and four subtle cauterizations around the navel, using a thin nail-like cautery; and cauterize on the prominent part with one large cautery, or two cauterizations.	When the diarrhoea is due to frigidity and humidities so that the capacity of the stomach and intestines to hold and to digest is impaired, and this has been treated by various methods and is not cured; if you see that the patient is able to endure the cautery and is of unimpaired strength, make a big cauterization on his stomach according to the preceding instructions for cauterization of the stomach with a circular cautery; and four narrow cauterizations round his navel with the thin claviform cautery; and one or two big cauterizations in the lumbar region over the coccyx.	0.85905993
If the excess humidity persists and the patient can tolerate it, then cauterize the lower abdomen and intestines, adding two more cauterizations on the stomach and near the groin, as this treatment is highly effective.	And if you see that the humidities are superabundant, and the patient fit to tolerate it, then make one cauterization over the groin and one over the hypochondrium. You may also add two small ones over the stomach near the big one. This is an effective treatment that does not fail to help.	0.72352916

When old hemorrhoids are present, or there are thick, cold humors or corrupted humidities, and they are treated as previously described without success, then cauterize with three cauterizations on the lower vertebrae of the small triangular back, and one cauterization above the navel, two finger-widths apart.	When there are one or more chronic haemorrhoids in the anus arising from thick and cold humours or corrupt humidities, and they have been treated by those measures mentioned in the section, without effect, then sear the patient with three cauterizations over the lowest dorsal vertebra a little below the flat part of the back, triangularly; and one about two fingers' breadth below the navel.	0.8264862
If you suspect that the patient's stomach is cold and the food is not digested, and their face appears swollen, then cauterize the stomach with a large cautery as previously described; also cauterize once on the liver, and once on the spleen with a nail-like cautery, leaving the cauterized area open for a while, and treat it until it is healed.	And if you consider that his stomach has become chilled and his food not being digested, and you see his face swollen, then do one big cauterization over the stomach as previously described; and one over his liver; and another over the spleen; with the claviform cautery. Keep the burn open a long while; then dress till healed.	0.8594472

On the cauterization of atheyl near their removal.	On cauterization of warts after excision.	0.5735965
When you remove atheyl, heat the cautery that resembles a ray. Then insert the heated cautery into the removed atheyl, moving your hand until the cautery reaches the opening of the vein from which the blood flows.	When you excise warts, heat a spike-shaped cautery and bring it, hot, to the site of the excised wart, and press down till the cautery reaches the mouth of the vessel whence the blood comes.	0.7727295
Do this once or twice, because if there are many atheyl, then cauterize each one as described, and then treat them with the appropriate ointments until they are healed.	Do this once or twice over. If the warts be more than one, sear each one separately as we have described ; then dress with suitable ointments till healed.	0.81182766
If you cauterize with a large cautery on the prominent part, it is more effective.	And if you burn the patient with one big cauterization over the lumbar region that will add to the effect.	0.5918044

On the cauterization of fistulas that form naturally in certain parts.	On the cauterization of fistulae in the anal and peri-anal regions.	0.53844655
When nature does not respond to the treatment we have described, and the patient is frightened by it, they should be treated with cauterization.	When the patient will not submit to the cutting operation we have described in its own place, and is afraid of it, he may perhaps be cured with the cautery.	0.70665705
Therefore, when a person has a fistula in a natural area, and it is old, oozing pus and corrupted humidities, the best approach is to probe it with a thin probe, and then measure the depth of it with the same probe.	So when somebody gets a fistula, and pus and foul humidities have for a long while been running from it, you must first explore it with a fine probe and judge of its depth by the probe.	0.763636
Then heat the cautery that resembles a ray. Then insert the heated cautery into the fistula, according to the depth measured by the probe.	Then heat a spike-shaped cautery and introduce it, hot, into the fistula, in the direction of the bottom of the fistula and to the depth to which the probe entered.	0.76527834
Repeat the cauterization on it until the corrupted tissues are burned away, once, twice, or three times, as needed.	And repeat the cauterization till all those corrupt bodies are burnt away; once or twice or three times over, as you have need.	0.7569186
Be careful not to burn nerves or veins; if the fistula reaches the bladder or intestines, avoid those areas; only perform this procedure when the fistula is in a fleshy area and you believe it is not deep.	But beware of burning a nerve should one be there, or a big blood-vessel. If the fistula penetrates to the urinary bladder or the intestine, beware of all these parts. Do this only when the fistula is in a fleshy part and you judge that it does not open into any other part.	0.76989067
Then treat the area until it is healed.	Afterwards dress the place till healed.	0.79582226
If the area is sealed and the material has been removed, and it remains this way for a long time, then know that it is completely healed.	If the place cicatrizes and the flux of humours ceases and it remains so for a long while, you may know that it is perfectly healed.	0.7326801
If the materials are not removed, then know that it is deep or in the cavity of corrupted bone, or due to other causes that will be mentioned in their place.	But if the flux of humours from it is not stopped, understand that it has perforated or that at the bottom there is a piece of diseased bone or the like; which will be mentioned in its proper place.	0.6743964

When abscesses cause pain due to cold or thick wind, and the patient's suffering is worsened, then you should cauterize the abscesses with a nail-like cautery, as previously mentioned.	When pain strikes the kidneys from chill or heavy vapour, and the patient's sexual vigour is impaired thereby, you should burn him right over the kidneys, once on each kidney, with the claviform cautery mentioned before.	0.6086581
Then quickly cauterize them a little below, resulting in three lined-up cauterizations, which will be more effective.	I have often burnt him with a third cauterization on the flat of the back, making three cauterizations in a line, which is most effective.	0.5923472

When the bladder becomes weak and softened due to cold and humidity, causing the patient to be unable to hold their urine, then cauterize the lower part of the bladder, where the pubic hair starts, with one cauterization on the right side and another on the left side.	When there occurs in the urinary bladder a weakness and relaxation due to chill and humidities, so that the patient cannot retain his water, sear him once below his navel, on the bladder, where the pubic hair begins; burn him once also on the right side and once on the left side of the navel; and let the distance of the burn from either side be the length of the joint of the thumb.	0.799412
The length of each cauterization should be the size of the joints of the fingers; also cauterize the lowest part of the back, or with two cauterizations if necessary.	Cauterize him also once on the lower part of the back, or twice if you need.	0.5811677
The cautery should be nail-like, as previously described.	The cautery should be claviform, as described.	0.83497334

When cold and humidity affect the uterus, preventing conception and corrupting menstrual flow, causing delayed onset and painful menstruation, then cauterize the area with three cauterizations around the navel as described for the bladder; and also cauterize the lower back with one or two nail-like cauterizations.	When matter arises in the womb from chill or humidities and she is thereby prevented from conceiving and her menses are upset; their flow fails or, as they pass, pain accompanies them; then you must cauterize her three times around the navel, as we have mentioned in cauterization of the bladder; and once or twice in the lumbar region in the lower part of the back over the hips. The cautery should be claviform.	0.76423043

On the cauterization of hip dislocation.	On cauterization of a dislocated hip.	0.90271616
When mucous-like humidity is deposited in the hip area, causing dislocation, and a sign of this is that one thigh is longer than the other when compared. And the location of the dislocation is found in the hollow area.	Sometimes harmful humidities reach the hip joint and result in its coming out of its place. The symptom of this is that one leg is longer than the other when one is measured against the other; and a hollow is found there [i.e. at the hip].	0.6944843
Then you should cauterize the patient on the hip area with a circular cauterization, after marking with a probe around the affected part so that the area falls in the middle of the circle.	Then you should cauterize the patient over the hip joint itself with a circular burn, after you have marked with ink a circle round the femoral joint, so that the joint falls in the middle of the circle.	0.8484088
The cautery should have the same form as described in the cauterization of the stomach.	The cautery should be the one whose description has already been given in cauterization of the stomach.	0.7882389
If this cautery is not available, then cauterize with three large olive-like cauterizations.	But if you have not this cautery by you, give him three cauterizations with the larger size olivary cautery.	0.76350534
The cauterization should be done to the depth of the entire scab; and then treat the area until it heals.	The burn should be to the depth of the whole thickness of the skin. Then dress till healed.	0.7724699

On the cauterization of the sciatic vein.	On cauterization for sciatica.	0.7935668
When pain occurs in the hip area due to cold and humidity, and the patient is not cured by previous treatments, then the patient should be purged of thick humors with fetid pills or similar remedies; and then cauterize.	When pain occurs in the hip joint and is due to cold and humidities, and the patient has been treated by those means mentioned in the section, and the treatment is ineffectual, and the pain becomes chronic, the patient should be purged of the heavy humours with foetid pills or pills of tamarind or the like; then cauterize him.	0.8151052
The method of cauterization can be of two types: cauterization with burning medicines or cauterization with fire.	The means of cauterization in this case is twofold: either with caustic chemicals or with fire.	0.82532954
There are two known methods, one of which involves cauterizing the hip area with three triangular cauterizations; and make them deep. The space between each cauterization should be the width of a finger, and the cauteries should be olive or large.	The actual cautery will serve for several methods. One of them is to make three cauterizations over the femoral joint itself in a triangular manner ; and let them be of a fair depth; and the space between them a finger's breadth. The cautery should be an olivary one.	0.8379807
Sometimes the cauterization should be on the middle spot on the hip joint, resulting in four cauterizations.	Sometimes there will also be one cauterization in the middle over the actual head of the femur, making four cauterizations in all.	0.77725905
If you prefer, cauterize with a circular cautery as described for hip dislocation, ensuring it burns through the entire scab.	The burning may be done with the circular cautery which has been mentioned under cauterization of a dislocated hip; a single cauterization so that the circle embrace the whole joint.	0.62973225
This is the method for cauterizing sciatica when the pain is in the hip and not extending into the thigh.	This is the form of cauterization for sciatica when the pain is localized in the hip joint and does not extend to the femur and the leg.	0.8571897
But if the pain extends into the thigh, then cauterize with two cauterizations on the thigh where the pain is located; and with one cauterization on the ankle, four fingers from the outer side.	But if it extends to the femur and the leg, cauterize him over the thigh with two burns at the place where the patient indicates the pain to be; and one burn four fingers above the great tendon of the heel, a little to the outer side.	0.81342673
If the cautery is knife-like, the depth should match the thickness of the scab.	The cautery should be edged, and the depth of the burn only to the thickness of the skin.	0.60239697
If the pain extends to the toes, then cauterize at the point of pain with three or four cauterizations, or more if necessary.	But if the patient points out that the pain reaches to the toes, then cauterize where he has indicated to you, with a punctate cautery, three or four or more perforations if he needs it.	0.7580562
If the pain is below the knee towards the thigh, then cauterize there with one knife-like cautery.	If he indicates that the pain is under the knee towards the shank, give him one burn there with the edged cautery.	0.7526955
Be careful in all cauterizations not to burn nerves or large arteries, as this can cause harm or contraction in the patient.	Be careful in all your cauterizing not to carry the cautery so far as to burn a nerve or a large artery; for thence arises grave harm, or crippling, to the patient.	0.85874414
I have seen cases where cauterization on the ankle resulted in severe swelling extending to the foot, causing perforation and corruption of the entire foot. This often led to severe diarrhea and eventually death.	I myself have seen more than one person cauterizing over the tendon of Achilles, the cauterization being excessive, and the leg was affected with a defluxion of humours which eventually reached the foot and the whole was riddled; after that came diarrhoea, and, after that, death.	0.69084466
If the pain is in two places simultaneously, cauterize each area in the same manner.	If there is pain in two places, cauterize both in this way.	0.84680194
Some experts describe a hip cautery shaped like a circular iron, half a palm in circumference, with an opening the size of a date stone or slightly smaller.	Certain learned doctors have mentioned a cauterization applicable to the hip in this manner: make a bowl of iron with a diameter of half a span; the thickness of the edge of its mouth should be that of a date-stone or a little less.	0.7407033
Inside this circle, there is another third; the space between them is the size of a walnut; these circles are open on both sides; their length is one or two nuts; these are well-made iron rings; this is their form:	Another bowl is introduced into this, and a third into that; and there is a distance between the bowls of a thumb-joint. The bowls are open on both sides; and the depth of them should be a thumb-joint or two. Make an iron handle for them firmly fitted to the bowls. Here is the figure.	0.7784099
Then, heat in the fire until it is red and sparkles, and then place it on the hip area, with the patient lying on their healthy side. Then cauterize with three round cauterizations at once.	Then heat this cautery in the fire until it is hot and sends out sparks; and so let it be applied to the hip, the patient lying on his sound side; and thus three circular cauterizations will be produced at a time.	0.81259763
Leave it for three days; then apply a poultice and leave the wound open for several days; and treat with ointments until healed.	Afterwards let it be for three days; then smear with butter and leave the wound open for a while; then treat with ointment till it heals.	0.9132507
Albucasis says: "Oh, sons, we rarely use this type of cauterization due to the fear of its effects and because few patients can withstand it."	The author of this book says that we very rarely employ this method of cauterization on account of the ugliness and dread appearance of it, and because we find few patients who will endure it.	0.65796256
But it is effective for those who endure it and locate the source of the pain.	Nevertheless, it is one of the best cauteries for him who can endure it and is correctly treated by it.	0.5264626
Another type of cautery involves using two circles with perforated armules through which iron pins are inserted; their length should be two nuts or close to it.	Cauterization with caustics is thus: make two bowls like the ring into which a door-hinge descends, either of bronze or iron.	0.6036866
The space between each should be the width of a finger; they should be open on the top and bottom, fitting together in this manner:	The height of their sides should be two thumb-joints or thereabouts, and they should be separated about a finger's breadth; they should be open above and below, and joined one to another thus.	0.7892066
Place on the hip area, with the patient lying on the healthy side, and press your hand on the hip area; then pour hot water between the two circles, gradually heating it with a small fire, keeping it for an hour, and the patient should endure the biting and burning sensation — which feels like fire — until the biting stops.	Then place them over the capsule of the hip joint, the patient lying upon his sound side, and press down hard; then pour caustic fluid between the two rings—it should have been heated slightly—and keep it there for the space of one hour by the sand-clock. The patient must endure the sting and heat of it (for he will find it stings like fire) till the causticity diminishes.	0.8314837
Then remove your hand with the instrument and wash off the hot water from the entire hip area with fresh water.	Then remove your hand with the instrument and wash away the caustic from the whole capsule with pure water.	0.8216003
Leave it for three days and apply a poultice until the burn's blackness disappears, leave it for a few days, and pus will drain; this is the final aid.	Let be for three days and apply butter to it till the eschar comes away; and let the pus flow from it for a few days, for that will be more conducive to healing.	0.7207986
Then treat it with ointments until it heals.	Then treat with ointment till it heals.	0.9780515
If the pain extends to the thigh or leg, use the same method as for the hip.	If the pain extends to the hip joint or the leg, make a form in some material that will hold the fluid for that, just as you did for the capsule of the femur.	0.66168386
This is the hot water method, which I have already described in the treatise on medicine correction. Prepare alkali and unslaked lime in equal parts, grind them and place them in a new pot with a small hole in the bottom, enough to fit a drop.	Now this is the description of the caustic; I have already put it in my treatise on the improvement of drugs: take of the salt of potash and quicklime, equal parts, and beat them both up well and put them into a new earthen pot, in the bottom of which you have made a small hole of a size to take a probe.	0.7092414
Place an enameled pot beneath the first, and pour fresh water over the alkali and lime to cover them by a finger's width, then press firmly with your hand, and let the water drip through the hole into the enameled pot below.	Place under that pot another one, glazed. Pour enough water on the quicklime and potash to cover them to a finger's breadth after you have pressed them well together with your hand; and leave the pot until the caustic fluid has passed down into the bottom of the glazed pot. Then collect all that fluid and pour it upon a fresh lot of lime and potash.	0.7356428
Collect this water, pour it over more fresh lime and alkali, making it very strong, useful in many medical operations and in cauterizing other body parts, as it acts like fire.	Then collect all that fluid and pour it upon a fresh lot of lime and potash. Thus will the water be very caustic indeed. This is used for many medical procedures and for the cauterization of all members, as it has the very same action as fire itself.	0.742968
This is one of the medicines used for hip cauterization, such as vinegar and honey mixed with lime and soap.	There are other drugs too with which the capsule of the femur is cauterized, such as Thapsia and Mel Anacardinum and inunction of lime with soap.	0.5683528
Gualia recounts an ancient remedy and cure for hip and sciatic vein pain, highly praising it, saying it requires no other treatment, and that it heals in one application as he described, quickly entering the bath and emerging cured.	Galen, quoting one of the men of old, mentions a treatment for pain in the thigh and sciatica and he makes much of it, asserting that no other treatment was necessary, and that it would heal on one application, so much so that the patient would be carried into the bath and would go out completely cured.	0.75784546
Take fresh rue, or if unavailable, fresh figs; crush them well with a bit of fat and place on the painful hip, thigh, or leg, and bind it.	The method is as follows: take fresh green water-cress or new dry water-cress if fresh is not to be had; beat it up well with some fat and apply it to the hip where it hurts, or to the leg or thigh, and bind up.	0.7205376
Leave it for three hours or until the patient feels relief from the burning.	Then let be for three hours or until the patient feels a diminishing of the caustic; and then let him be taken to the bath.	0.7546034
Then bathe the patient, and when the body is warm, expose it to the sun, as the pain will cease and healing will occur.	When his body is bedewed with sweat, get him into the pool; then the pain will vanish and he will be cured.	0.6197923
Be aware that cauterization with these medicines should only be used after body evacuation.	But you must know that no one should have cauterization with these drugs except after evacuation of the bowel.	0.75265634
However, Escorides said that cauterizing the sciatic vein with goat fat is beneficial; do this by soaking wool in old oil, placing it between the foot's bones and the ankle.	Dioscorides has said that cauterization with goats' dung is beneficial for sciatica. The cauterization is carried out in this manner: take wool soaked in old oil and put it into the cleft which is between the thumb and the forearm but nearer to the forearm.	0.75106466
Then take dry goat fat, burn it to charcoal, place it on the wool, and leave it until it is extinguished.	Then take the dried dung of a goat and expose it to fire until it glows like a coal.	0.73311067
Repeat this process until the biting sensation reaches the hip, alleviating the pain.	Place it on the piece of wool, and leave till it cools, then replace it with another, and so on until the sensation has reached the hip joint by way of the forearm, and the pain stops.	0.46890712
This method of cauterization is called cow cautery.	This kind of cautery is called 'the dung cautery'.	0.68421656

On the cauterization for back pain.	On cauterization for pain in the back.	0.9745884
Sometimes pain is in the back due to various causes, such as a fall, an impact, excessive evacuation, and similar reasons, due to the infusion of cold and humid matter.	Many different causes give pain in the back. Sometimes it happens from a fall or a blow, or from excessive evacuation or the like. It may also be due to an influx of humid matter.	0.8230382
And cauterization is only applicable in this specific type caused by the infusion of cold matter.	Cauterization is only to be employed in this last case, which arises from an influx of cold matter.	0.7687894
Therefore, it is necessary, after evacuating the patient with purging pills or similar, to make three lines on the painful back area according to its width, marking with ink five or more cauteries on each line, depending on the patient's tolerance and the strength of the cautery.	When the patient has been purged with foetid pills or the like, he should be cauterized in his back where the pain is, over the breadth of the flat of the back, after the place has been marked with ink, with three rows of cauterizations, five in each, or more, in proportion to what you see of the patient's endurance and strength.	0.7803479
The cauterization should be done with a pointed cautery.	Use the punctate cautery.	0.52651405
And if you want, cauterize with three or four cauteries with a medium-sized cautery in this manner:	If you like, you may give him three or four cauterizations with the middle-sized claviform cautery.	0.7303603

This disease often occurs in young children; the sign of its onset in children is a swelling and movement on their back.	This disease often occurs in small children.	0.6926714
You will find that the last vertebra of the back and its surrounding areas start to rise above the other vertebrae.	The sign of the beginning of the disease in a child is that he suffers shortness of breath when standing or moving, and you will find that at the end of his dorsal vertebrae there is one visibly projecting above the other vertebrae.	0.5097313
And when you see this and want to prevent it, then cauterize it with a circular cautery in this manner: That the cautery covers the entire area of the vertebra equally.	So when you see this and you wish to stop it, cauterize him with a cautery that should be circular so that the cauterization takes in equally all sides of the vertebra.	0.7791153
And if you want, cauterize around the vertebra with a pointed cautery in two or three lines. And the points should be close to each other.	If you wish, you can cauterize two or three lines around the vertebra with the punctate cautery; let the punctures be close to one another.	0.82550406
Then treat the area until it heals with what we have mentioned.	Then dress the place with those remedies we have mentioned, till healed.	0.8285856
But be careful not to use cauterization on humps caused by nerve spasms.	But beware of using the cautery in the deformity arising from a nervous spasm.	0.8669416

On the cauterization for gout and joint pain.	On cauterization of gout and pain in the joints.	0.9414781
When joint pain is caused by cold humors that infiltrate each part of the body, and pain occurs in the feet, it is customarily called gout by doctors.	When there are pains in the joints from cold humidities flowing into whatever part of the body it may be, and specially when there are pains in the feet, doctors are in the habit of calling that 'gout'.	0.7897265
And so, when gout caused by cold is treated with a method of care and the pain is not removed, then cauterization is used.	When gout due to chill has been treated with the various treatments mentioned in its section, and the pains remain, the cautery will remove them.	0.59229124
And you cauterize it after evacuation around the joint of the foot with many cauteries.	That is, you cauterize the patient with multiple burns around the joint of the foot, after he has been purged.	0.659456
And it should be olive-shaped cauterization, which is as follows:	The cautery should be a middle-sized olivary one, thus.	0.5107281
And if it is necessary to make points on the surface of the foot, then do so with a pointed cautery. And if the pain moves to the knees or other joints, which often happens, then cauterize each knee with three or four cauteries, covering the entire area with this olive-shaped cautery.	If you need to make punctate cauterizations round the front of the foot, use the punctate cautery; and if the pains go up to the knee or other joints, which often happens, burn each knee with three or four cauterizations on every side with the same olivary cautery.	0.85924774
And if many cauteries are necessary, then cauterize and do not press too hard with the cautery, just around the thickness of the skin.	And if you require to cauterize him more than this, do it, but do not go deeply but only about the thickness of the skin.	0.6906221
And if the pain moves to the knee and back, then apply the cautery we have mentioned in its chapter.	If the pains go up to the hip joints or the back, employ those cauterizations that we have mentioned in their own chapter.	0.79210997
And if the pain is only in the hands, called chiragra, then puncture around the joints, making two lines.	And if the pains are in the hands only, pierce a double line all around the wrists.	0.5895845
And if pain remains in the fingers, then puncture around the joints on each knuckle and on the thumb of the hand.	If the pains remain in the fingers, pierce them once over each joint and once on the metacarpus.	0.7185329
And if the pain moves to the elbows or muscles after a few days, then cauterize each part of the arms.	And if after some days the pains go up to the elbows or shoulders then cauterize both on each side.	0.8591084
And do not evacuate the patient from a good regimen and the reception of medicines, for if a good regimen is followed and phlegm is evacuated with this cautery, they will be healed, God willing.	And keep the patient to good habits and taking of medicine; for if his regimen be good and the phlegm got rid of, he will be cured with this cautery.	0.817033
Chapter Forty-Five:	CHAPTER FORTY-FIVE.	0.71300054
On the cauterization for ruptures.	On the cauterization of hernia.	0.7930666
When a rupture occurs in the groin and the intestines protrude before the hernia, and this is just beginning, it is necessary to tell the patient to stop eating on that day and use gentle substances to help the hernia descend from the abdomen.	When a rupture occurs in the groin, and part of the intestine and omentum comes down into the scrotum, being the onset of the disease, forbid the patient to take food for one day and have him use laxatives to empty the bowel.	0.7215569
Then place the patient on their back between your hands, and instruct them to hold their breath until the hernia or intestines appear.	Then let him lie on his back in front of you and bid him hold his breath till the intestine or omentum comes out; then put it back with your finger.	0.7097498
Then return it with your fingers and mark with ink the rupture over the bone of the groin with a sign whose end resembles half a circle in the upper parts of the body.	Then, below the hernia over the pubic bone, mark a semicircle whose extremities point upward.	0.66740143
Then heat the cautery, which is shaped like this:	Then heat a cautery of this type.	0.6484072
Until it is very red and emits sparks. Then return the intestine or hernia to its cavity, and place your hand over the area to prevent the intestine from coming out.	When it is white hot and emits sparks then return the intestine or omentum into his abdominal cavity, and have an assistant put his hand over the place to prevent the exit of the intestine.	0.6668548
You have already opened the space between the patient's thighs, placed a cushion under them, another servant on their legs, and another on their chest, holding their hands.	You should first have parted his legs and put a pillow under him; let another assistant sit on his legs and another on his chest, holding his hands.	0.74490714
Then place the cautery on the mark with your hand, holding the cautery straight, and keep it there until you reach the bone of the groin, and repeat if you haven't reached the bone the first time.	Then apply the cautery to the mark, keeping the cautery upright, and hold it till it reaches the bone; or apply the cautery again a second time if it does not reach the bone the first time.	0.856767
And wisely observe the emergence of the intestine during the cauterization, so as not to burn the intestine and cause death or other serious harm to the patient.	You must take the greatest care that the intestine does not come out while you are cauterizing, lest you burn it and it result in death or grave injury to the patient.	0.7541619
And know that if you do not reach the bone with the cautery, your operation will not be effective.	You must understand that if you do not bring the cauterization down to the bone your operation will not be successful.	0.7832666
And the cautery for children should be delicate according to their size and measurement.	For boys the cautery should be slender according to their proportions, and for adults according to theirs.	0.65587014
Then treat the cautery site for three days with butter until the scar from the burn is removed.	Then dress the site of the cauterization till it heals. After three days, treat the site of cauterization with butter until the eschar from the burn departs.	0.88215864
Then treat it with other ointments until it heals.	Then treat with the usual ointments till healed.	0.7769191
And the patient should lie on their back for forty days until the wound and the place are sealed.	The patient should lie on his back for forty days so that the wound may cicatrize.	0.8325218
And it is necessary to adjust their nutrition according to the length of their healing time to support their abdomen, and to prevent the intestine from protruding during the recovery effort.	Throughout the course of his treatment you must make his diet such as will be gentle with his inside, so that the intestine should not come down during the effort of defaecation.	0.5804603
And when they want to get up after forty days, provide them with decent support, and keep them under observation for another forty days.	Then when he wants to get up after the forty days, employ a tight bandage and keep this on another forty days.	0.7654011
And they should refrain from labor, overeating, drinking, and loud voices, for if they follow this regimen of complete healing, they will be cured.	He should be moderate in his exertion, his eating, drinking, and shouting. Thus under these rules he will be completely cured.	0.68598545
And I will describe the treatment for ruptures in other parts of the abdomen. If you want to prevent them from protruding at the beginning, cauterize the rupture with a round cautery according to its size, ensuring that about a third of the skin is removed. Then treat it with what we have mentioned, and it will not be retracted.	I shall speak of the treatment of rupture by scission in the appropriate chapter. When a rupture occurs elsewhere in the belly and is at its inception and you wish it not to grow, cauterize the rupture with a round cautery in proportion to its size; burn about two-thirds through the thickness of the skin and treat as we have said; he will be cured and the rupture will not grow.	0.80192435
Some earlier practitioners have said that a rupture should be cauterized with a triangular cautery in this shape, as it is marked with a probe:	One of the Ancients said that ruptures were to be cauterized with a three-armed cautery like this.	0.6293094
A line is placed horizontally on the upper side of the rupture, and another line above; then place your hand with a nail-like cautery, but the first cautery is lighter and better.	First mark the rupture with ink; put the transverse line on the upper margin of the rupture and the other towards the lower, and apply a single claviform cautery in the middle. But the first cauterization is easier and better.	0.80027765
Chapter Forty-Six:	CHAPTER FORTY-SIX.	0.6907016
On the cauterization for twists.	On cauterization for contusion.	0.8567989
When pain occurs in some members due to a fall or an impact, and that pain persists for a long time and does not respond to medication, it is necessary to cauterize with a pointed cautery.	When pain occurs in some limb due to a fall or a blow and the pain becomes chronic and medical treatment has no effect upon it, you should cauterize it with the punctate cautery.	0.8088243
And the cautery should be done according to the size and strength of the member, and the location of the twist and pain.	In each case the cauterization should be in proportion to the size of the limb, its strength or weakness, and the chronicity of the pain and contusion in it.	0.61721337
Therefore, if it heals with the first cautery, it is good; if not, then repeat the cautery. For the custom of these pains is that they are punctured from one member to the next, and it is necessary to continue with cauterization until the patient is healed.	If it is cured at the first cauterization, good; otherwise repeat the cauterization. For it is customary for these pains to move from one part to a neighbouring part, and you must follow them with the cautery till the patient is cured.	0.877951
Chapter Forty-Seven:	CHAPTER FORTY-SEVEN.	0.70405495
On the cauterization for leprosy.	On cauterization for elephantiasis.	0.80337375
Leprosy sometimes benefits greatly from cauterization, especially if the type of leprosy is caused by the putrefaction of phlegm and melancholy.	Those suffering from elephantiasis are sometimes greatly helped by the cautery; especially that kind that arises from corruption of the phlegm and black bile.	0.7246959
And so, when you want to cauterize it, consider if the leprosy is starting and you have treated it with what we have mentioned, and if it is not stopping, and you fear the disease will spread throughout the patient's body, then cauterize the head with five cauteries: one in the middle of the head, a second lower down, near the forehead at the hairline, two on the horns, and one at the back, on the nape or neck.	When you wish to use the cautery, first look, and if the elephantiasis be in the early stage and you treat it with those remedies advised in the section but it does not abate and is not arrested, and you fear lest the corruption spread over the patient's whole constitution, then give him five cauterizations on the head: the well-known one in the middle of the head; the second one lower than that, toward the forehead, about the edge of the hair; and two at the temples; and one behind, on the nape of the neck.	0.814906
And press your hand with the cautery slightly until it imprints a small mark on the bone, and the scabs are removed, so that the release of thick vapors is facilitated; and cauterize the spleen as previously described.	And maintain the application of the cautery a little while till a slight mark is impressed on the bone and the outer table is removed from it, that there be an easy exit for the thick vapours. Burn him also one cauterization over the spleen itself in the manner described earlier.	0.80637646
And be careful not to burn the nerves over the heel.	Be careful not to burn the posterior tendons of his heels.	0.64106387
And sometimes it is cauterized with a cautery on the bone of the groin, another on the mouth of the stomach, and another on the liver.	He may also be cauterized once on the pubic bone; another on the cardia of the stomach; and another on the liver.	0.78310204
And know that the more cauteries you apply, the more beneficial and effective it is; and know that the patient does not feel pain in the cautery as healthy people do, because their body is already numb.	You should know that the more you cauterize the more beneficial and effective it will be. You should know also that the patient will not find the cautery painful as a sound man would, since his body is benumbed.	0.858093
And the cauteries should be large or small depending on the members and joints as previously described for the types of instruments.	The cauteries should be of the types of instrument mentioned earlier, larger or smaller in proportion to the size of the limb or joint.	0.7522509
Then treat the cautery with cooked barley flour with honey and other treatments until it heals.	Then treat the cauterization with powder of bitter vetch with honey, together with the other treatments, till healed.	0.89954996

On the cauterization for stupor.	On cauterization for numbness.	0.84674394
When any limb is numb or asleep and has been treated with medicines, oils, and plasters but is not healed, then you must cauterize the numb limb with cauteries according to its size and importance.	When some limb is affected with numbness and it is treated with drugs and ointments and plasters, but is not cured, burn the benumbed limb itself with cauterizations proportionate to its bigness or smallness.	0.852535
And let your cautery penetrate the thickness of the skin a little. Then treat it with ointment until it heals.	Let the cauterization somewhat penetrate the thickness of the skin; then dress with ointments till healed.	0.8410587
Sometimes numbness that affects the hands and feet, the vertebrae of the back, and the emergence of the nerves that move the limb is cauterized, and the numbness is removed.	For numbness that occurs in the hand or foot it is possible to cauterize over the dorsal vertebrae at the exit of the nerve activating that part; and the numbness will go.	0.6235366
But only someone knowledgeable in the anatomy of the limbs and the emergence of the nerves moving the whole body should perform this.	This should not be attempted except by one who has a good knowledge of the anatomy of the limbs and of the exits of the nerves that move the body.	0.7567737
Chapter Forty-Nine:	CHAPTER FORTY-NINE.	0.69852996
When albaras is old and does not respond to any medical ointment, then cauterize it with a deep cautery slightly, according to the thickness of the skin, until the whiteness and color are removed and the color is changed.	When leprosy is of long standing and no device of medicine has any effect upon it, make a cauterization over it to a slight depth according to the thickness of the skin, until the whiteness has gone and the colour of the skin altered.	0.76049024
Then treat it with barley and lentil flour mixed with rose oil, leaves of arnagrosa, and blood of a pigeon or swallow. Each should be in equal parts, all mixed together, and then spread on a cloth and placed on the area until it heals.	Then treat with lentil flour, oil of roses, arnoglossa leaves, and pigeons' or swallows' blood, of each equal parts mixed all together and spread on lint; let this stick to the place till healed.	0.9242633

When cancer is beginning and you want to remove it, then cauterize it with a circular cautery around its perimeter.	When the cancer is in its initial stage and you wish to arrest it, burn all round the circumference of the cancer with the circular cautery.	0.85984445
Wise men say it should be cauterized with a final cautery in the center, but I have not seen this done, as I fear it might ulcerate, and I have seen this happen sometimes.	Some doctors have said that it may be cauterized with one extensive cauterization in the middle. This hardly seems right to me, for I should expect it to ulcerate out; which I have several times seen.	0.69145584
It is better to cauterize around it in a circle as we have said, or with multiple cauteries.	So it is correct to burn around the circumference with a circular cautery as we have said, or with multiple cauterizations.	0.8273242
Chapter Fifty-One:	CHAPTER FIFTY-ONE.	0.6389206
On the cauterization of abscesses.	On cauterization of boils.	0.90123165
When any abscess is slow to mature, either because of excess causing it, the patient's old age, their decrepit state, low blood, or the weather, and you want to hasten its maturation, then cauterize around it with many small puncturing cauteries; then leave it as it will hasten the maturation.	When a person gets a boil which is slow in coming to a head, either because of the superfluity causing it, or because of the patient's age if he be an elderly man lacking in blood, or because of the season, and you wish to hasten the ripening of the boil, then make a punctate burn around it with multiple small cauterizations, and then let be; it will speedily come to a head.	0.81228656
But if you want to pierce it with a cautery, then heat the cautery in this shape: place it in the middle of the abscess until it penetrates the skin.	If you wish to perforate it with cauterization, heat the cautery of this type. Apply it to the middle of the boil till it has pierced the skin.	0.71176213
Chapter Fifty-Two:	CHAPTER FIFTY-TWO.	0.65619004
On the cauterization of corrodent ulcers.	On cauterization of gangrene.	0.68734324
Corrodent is a moving corruption in the limb, which eats it away like fire consuming dry wood.	Gangrene is a creeping corruption of a limb, consuming it as fire consumes dry wood.	0.7396432
So if you see this corrodent in a place that can tolerate fire cautery, then heat several small nail-like cauteries, making them large as needed for the location of the corrodent.	If you see gangrene in a part which can tolerate the actual cautery, heat a number of claviform cauteries, small or large to suit the site of the gangrene.	0.66452
Then cauterize all around it until you eradicate all the corrosion and no trace of it remains.	Then cauterize it all over till the whole corruption is eradicated and none remains.	0.8618015
Then leave it for three days, and apply a mixture of ground alum and oil on the cauterized areas until all the scabs are removed and all the corruption is gone.	Then let be for three days, applying to the cauterized site sulphur beaten up with oil, until the whole eschar comes away, and all the corruption.	0.85102504
Then treat it with ointments that promote flesh growth.	Then treat with stimulating ointments.	0.7013738
But if after three days you see that the flesh is growing healthily without corruption, it is good; otherwise, repeat the cautery on what remains in the corrupted places.	If after three days you see the flesh growing healthily and no corruption in it, good. Otherwise repeat the cauterization over whatever corrupt parts are left.	0.88696134
Corrodent is sometimes treated with sharp medicine, which is applied in place of cautery. However, fire cautery is usually more effective.	Gangrene is also sometimes cured with caustic, for that takes the place of fire; but the actual cautery acts more speedily.	0.6919575
I have already discussed the treatment with sharp medicine in another section, so use that when necessary.	I have already spoken of the treatment of it by caustic in its section, so take it from there when you have need of it.	0.7545264
Chapter Fifty-Three:	CHAPTER FIFTY-THREE.	0.64122367
On the cauterization of calluses and similar conditions.	On the cauterization of corns, inverted and otherwise.	0.58704674
Often, a disease called "clau" (callus) appears on the lower parts of the foot, causing thick, painful skin that injures the foot; cautery for these can be done in two ways: with fire or with hot water.	This disease, which is something hard paining the foot, very often occurs in the soles of the feet. The cauterization in this case is twofold, actual or caustic.	0.6211225
Fire cautery involves heating a concave cautery tool resembling a vulture's claw, made of iron, matching the size of the callus, with thin edges.	The actual cautery is to heat a hollow cautery like a vulture's quill, made of iron, narrow of edge, of such a size as to surround the corn all round.	0.7208817
Then place the heated tool on the callus and move it around the callus until the cautery penetrates the callus completely. Leave it for three days until it starts to throw off the callus. Then plaster it with crushed wild mallows mixed with salt, and leave the plaster on overnight, as it will eradicate the callus from its roots.	Then put it, hot, on the corn and rotate it till the cautery reaches the root of the corn; and let be for three days to draw the pus; then apply a plaster of wild mallows ground up with salt, and leave the plaster on one night; then it may be drawn out with its root.	0.82991195
Then treat the area with a flesh-generating ointment until it heals.	Then treat the site of the wound with stimulating salve till it heals.	0.8507773
If this doesn't work, and this often happens on the skin surface, especially on the hands and feet, then you need to apply hot water cautery. Take a cannula made of brass, iron, or a vulture's feather, and place it on the callus; pour a small amount of hot water into the cannula, compressing it fully with your hand, and pressing the cannula's edge into the callus root. The hot water will find its way to the root. The patient should endure the hot water's bite for an hour, then remove it, as the callus with its roots will be eradicated.	If the corns are not inverted, which usually happens on the surface of the body and particularly on the hands and feet, you should take a cannula made of bronze or iron or made of a vulture's quill, and place it on the corn or wart; then pour into the cannula a small quantity of caustic solution; keep your hand on it and rotate it, keeping up a slight pressure so that the edge of the cannula impresses a mark at the root of the corn and the caustic makes its way to the root of the corn. Let the patient endure the action of the caustic for a while, then remove it; for the corn may be drawn out with its root.	0.8669047
Then treat them with ointments that generate flesh once the callus roots are eradicated.	Then treat the site of them, after eradication, with stimulating ointments.	0.68351936

On the cauterization for tremors.	On cauterization for tremor.	0.9802999
When someone has tremors due to cold in the nerves, or from a fever caused by cold, or other similar causes, then cauterize them with four or five cauteries on the vertebrae of the back, placing one cautery between each vertebra; and one on the chest, and one on the stomach with an olive-shaped cautery.	When someone has a tremor, either from chill in a nerve or quartan fever, or from some other cause, you should cauterize him four or five times over the vertebrae of the back, one between each vertebra, and one on his breast and one on his stomach, with an olivary cautery.	0.8995609
This will calm the tremor and hasten the healing of the cold-induced illness.	Thus the tremor will be stilled and the dispersal of the cold distemper will be hastened.	0.7414491

On the cauterization of white pustules affecting the body.	On the cauterization of pustules occurring on the body.	0.746397
When the body is afflicted with white pustules, which are caused by thick, corrupt materials; at the onset, cauterize each pustule with a thin cautery stick made from myrtle wood, its tip burned; or with long erestology roots; or with a lenticular cautery.	Foul pustules sometimes arise on the body, caused by heavy corrupt frigid matter. When they first appear you should cauterize the head of each one lightly with myrtle wood whose tip has been lighted in the fire; or with the root of the long birthwort; or with the lenticular cautery.	0.82327056
Sometimes, this cautery is used at the beginning of their expulsion in this manner; they are not burned through, and the excess causing them is disrupted, thus they heal.	Sometimes furuncles also are cauterized in the same manner when they first arise; then they get no bigger and the superfluity originating them is dispersed and the patient is cured of them.	0.683905
However, this should be done after bloodletting.	But before you cauterize these, the patient must be depleted by bleeding.	0.62163293

On the cauterization for arterial bleeding caused by an incision.	On cauterization in haemorrhage arising from a cut artery.	0.90867305
Often, arterial bleeding occurs due to an incision from an external wound, from the incision of abscesses, or from cautery of a limb, and such cases are difficult to manage.	Very often there occurs bleeding from an artery which has been cut either by an external wound or in opening an abscess or in cauterizing a part of the body and so on, and it is difficult to stem.	0.81288654
When this happens, quickly apply your hand to the artery's opening, pressing your index finger firmly over it until the blood flow stops.	When this happens to anyone, quickly apply your hand to the mouth of the artery, putting your forefinger to it and closing it properly till the bleeding ceases under your fingers and nothing comes out.	0.7782556
Then place several small and large olive-shaped cauteries in the fire, blowing on them until they are very hot.	Then put in the fire several olivary cauteries, small and large, and blow on them to make them very hot.	0.93675977
Take a small or large cautery, depending on the location and wound size, and quickly apply it to the artery as you remove your finger, keeping it in place until the blood flow is cut off and stopped.	Then take one, small or large according to the size of the wound and the site of the opening of the artery, and bring the cautery down right on the artery itself, after promptly removing your finger, and hold the cautery upon it till the blood ceases.	0.8355489
If blood is expelled from the artery's opening when you remove your finger and apply the cautery, quickly take another cautery prepared in the fire and continue this until the blood is restrained.	But if it bursts out after you have removed your finger from the mouth of the artery, and the cautery has cooled, promptly take another of the cauteries which you have ready in the fire. Continue doing this, with one after another, till the haemorrhage is stanched.	0.8099162
Be careful not to burn the nerve that is there, to avoid causing further harm to the patient.	Mind you do not burn any nerve which may be there, so that another calamity afflicts the patient.	0.8061535
And know that when blood flows from an artery, it is not possible to stop the bleeding, especially if the artery is large, except by one of four methods: either with a cautery as we have mentioned, or by extraction when it is not drawn out, for when it is drawn out, the ends are better burned and the bleeding is stopped, or it is tied with a thread or by strong binding, or medicines with the property of stopping bleeding are applied to it; and they are pressed with an appropriate compress.	You should know that when there is arterial haemorrhage it is impossible to stop it, especially when the vessel is big, except in one of four ways, to wit: by the cautery as we have said; or by division of the vessel when it is not completely divided, for when it is cut through the ends of it contract and the bleeding is stopped; or by a strong thread ligature; or by the application of styptics with tight bandaging.	0.9032471
But one who administers proper restriction by binding and compressing with cloths or by applying burning substances and similar methods, will not succeed except late.	But those who try to stop bleeding with ligatures or cloths, or by the application of caustics and the like, never stanch it by these means, or at least very rarely.	0.6920068
But if this happens to someone and neither the doctor nor medicine is present, then act by calmly placing the index finger over the opening of that vein as we have said, and apply strong pressure until the blood is stopped from the upper part of the wound, and the finger is not removed from the artery; and the artery is sprinkled with very cold water until the blood is coagulated and thickened; and then consider whether it needs cautery or medicine.	And if this happen to anyone and there are available neither doctor nor remedies, let him at once apply his forefinger to the mouth of the vessel as we have bidden and close it firmly till the blood is stanched; and pour over the wound and over the artery, without removing the finger, water as cold as possible till the blood thickens and congeals and ceases to flow. And meanwhile one should be considering what kind of cautery or medicine is indicated.	0.88096213
On incisions and punctures and cupping and phlebotomy and wounds and their like.	ON INCISION, PERFORATION, AND VENESECTION, AND WOUNDS AND THE LIKE	0.6236324
We have already discussed in the first chapter all diseases for which cautery with fire is suitable, and with burning medicine, and the occasions and causes for it, and the necessary instruments with the forms of the cauteries; and I have arranged the chapters from the head to the feet.	IN the first book I spoke of all those diseases for which cauterization is of value, either the actual cautery or that done with caustic medicines; and of their reasons and causes; also the instruments and the shapes of the cauteries. This I set out in chapters, from head to heel.	0.81370014
And I will proceed in this chapter in the same manner, so that it may be easier for those seeking it, to find what they have requested.	In this book I shall proceed along the same route so that it will be easy for the inquirer to find what he is looking for.	0.79790986
And before I begin, it is necessary, sons, that you learn that in this chapter, there is something terrifying that is also in the first chapter of cauterization.	But before I begin this you ought first to know, my sons, that in this book there is more risk than in the first, which treats of cauterization.	0.7634433
And for that reason, great caution is necessary, because in the operations described in this chapter, many times evacuation involves blood, in which life is contained, through the spilling from a vein, incision on an abscess, opening of a fistula, cleaning a wound, extraction of an arrow, or cutting of a stone, and similar procedures. And all these are accompanied by fear and trembling, and in most of them, death can occur.	Wherefore in this matter there should be greater circumspection. For in the course of the work of which this book treats there often occurs an effusion of the blood upon which life depends, in the opening of a blood-vessel or the incision of a tumour or the perforation of an abscess or the treatment of a wound or the extraction of an arrow, or in the incising for a calculus or similar cases; all of which are accompanied by uncertainty and fear; and in most death will supervene.	0.7925794
And I warn you not to let hesitation fall upon you, because sometimes you may encounter men with many different kinds of diseases. And some of them will become angry with their illness and will be on the verge of death, due to the severity of what their illness entails, and due to the prolonged duration of their illness, and with the illness, there is fear which signifies death.	So I warn you against undertaking any case in which there is any element of doubt to you; for in the exercise of the art you will be mobbed by all kinds of persons with all manner of afflictions; some being so weary of their sickness that death itself is a relief on account of the extent of their sufferings and the length of their miseries, their illness being so settled as to presage death.	0.7826512
And some of them will give you their possessions and say that they hope for a cure, while their illness is pernicious.	Some will lavish their wealth on you and enrich you, in the hope that they may be curable, when their disease is mortal.	0.75638056
And thus, it is not proper for you to agree to help those who come to you in this manner; and let your caution be greater than greed and rapacity; and do not undertake any case unless you have certain knowledge that verifies it for you, and which brings praiseworthy success.	You should not assist any of this kind who approach you; let your caution be stronger than your greed and desire for gain; and do not embark upon anything of this kind unless you have positive knowledge, which you judge adequate, about the way of bringing the patient a good outcome.	0.81506085
And in the treatment of all your patients, use prognosis and indication of that which turns into health, for this helps you in acquiring fame and memory, praise, and glory.	In treating every patient be prescient and foretell the means whereby health may be restored to him. That will help you to obtain renown, glory, fame, and praise.	0.79134464
Oh, sons, may God inspire you with His understanding and not take away from you direction and protection, for that is in His hands.	May God inspire you, my sons, with His guidance, and grant that you hit the mark and succeed; for it is in His hand; there is no God but He.	0.7178805
And I have ordered this chapter, distinguishing by chapters as in the chapter on cauteries, from the care of the head to the feet, so that it is easier for you to find what you seek and what you need.	I have arranged this book in sections as I did with the previous book on cauterizations, from head to heel; so you will the easier find in it what you seek.	0.78608584
First chapter.	CHAPTER ONE.	0.7659606
On the treatment of water which is contained in the heads of children.	On the cure of hydrocephalus.	0.53362566
Know that this illness often occurs in children during childbirth or when the nurse squeezes the child's head too tightly.	This disease occurs most commonly in infants upon delivery when the midwife grasps the child's head roughly.	0.7565749
And sometimes it happens for an unknown hidden reason.	It also sometimes happens from some hidden and unknown cause.	0.85150176
But I have only seen this illness in children; and in all those I saw, death followed quickly, and so it seemed to me a neglected task in them.	I have never seen this disease except in very small children; and death very quickly overtook all those that I have seen; therefore I have preferred not to undertake operation in these cases.	0.7868364
And I have seen a child whose head was filled with water, and his head was so enlarged that he could not hold it up due to the size of his head, and the humidity increased until he died.	I have seen a child whose head was filled with fluid and daily growing in size, until the child could not sit upright on account of the size of his head, and the humidity increased till he died.	0.85034823
And this moisture is either collected between the scalp and the bone, or it is collected under the bone above the brain.	Now this humidity sometimes collects between the skin and the bone; sometimes it collects beneath the bone and over the membrane.	0.75386775
For the operation in that case, if the moisture is between the scalp and the bone and the swelling is small, then it is necessary to cut in the middle of the head with a fissure in the width, and the length of the fissure should be about two nuts so that the moisture can flow, and this is the shape of the incision:	The operation is thus: when the humidity is between the skin and the bone and the swelling is small, an incision should be made in the middle of the head, transversely. The length of the incision should be about two thumb-joints, so that the humidity may flow out. This is the form of the scalpel.	0.7691034
And if the moisture is more increased and the swelling is larger, then there are two fissures in this manner:	If the humidity is more copious and the swelling greater, make two intersecting incisions to this pattern.	0.66022635
And if the moisture is under the bone, a sign of it is that you see the seams of the head open in all parts and the water is squeezed out when you press it with your hand at the inner parts, and this is not hidden from you. It is necessary to cut in the middle of the head with three fissures in this manner:	But if the humidity is beneath the bone—and the sign of that is that you will see the sutures of the skull gaping on all sides, the water manifestly yielding when you press in with your fingers—you should make three incisions in the middle of the head, in this pattern.	0.7940471
and near the incision, extract all the moisture; and then tighten the fissures with cloths and sponges; and then anoint the area with wine and oil until the fifth day, and then loosen the bandage and treat the wound with tentacles and ointments, and bind the head with equal pressure; and feed the patient with dry food with little moisture until the part is strengthened and healed.	After incising, draw out all the humidity; then bind up the incisions with pads and bandages; and over the bandages foment with wine and oil till the fifth day. Then loose the bandage and dress the wound with lint and ointments. And do not forget to bandage the head lightly; and feed the patient with a dry diet with little fluid, until the part is strengthened and healed.	0.9248847
And there is another manner of incision, which considers where the swelling and collection of water appear, for sometimes it is more in the back, or in the front, or on the right, or on the left; and then attend to the incision where the swelling and collection of water appear, and do this as best as possible.	Another pattern of incision is to see where the tumefaction and collection of fluid is apparent. For sometimes it is greater in the posterior or anterior part of the head, or to the right or to the left. Therefore make your incision where the tumefaction and dropsy are apparent; incise that place in whatever way you can.	0.8415507
And observe not to cut the artery, lest there be a flow of blood and the patient die from that flow of blood with the evacuation of moisture.	Be careful not to cut an artery lest you cause haemorrhage and the patient die of that haemorrhage at the same time that the humidity is evacuated.	0.8813382
Second chapter.	CHAPTER TWO.	0.80715764
When someone has cataracts or rheums in the eyes or the chest, and this is old, and the treatment with medicines does not help, then the final treatment for this is the incision of those two arteries.	When a person gets painful defluxions into the eyes or chest which become chronic, and medical treatment is ineffectual in this case, then section of these arteries will be the most efficacious treatment.	0.7403718
And then, when you want to incise them, it is necessary that the patient shaves his head, and then rubs the area with a rough cloth so that the arteries appear, and then the patient's neck is tightened with a cloth; and then consider where the vein pulses; and the places of each are over the places near the ears that are depressed, and they are so hidden except in some men.	When you decide on section, you should shave the patient's head with a razor; then rub the place with a rough cloth to show up the artery; then bind the patient's neck with an end of his garment; then you will observe where the artery is pulsating (the sites of both are the depressions behind the ears) for it is uncommon for them to remain hidden, except in a few persons.	0.84668195
And then mark the artery with a probe, and then incise each one with the knife of each part, with the incision reaching the bone, and let this be across the width of the head.	Then do you mark with ink over both; then cut with a hooked scalpel, cutting down to the bone; the incision should be lateral to the head.	0.7103394
And if you want, insert the knife under the artery and cut it to the parts above.	Or if you prefer, introduce the scalpel beneath the artery and make a thrusting cut up at it.	0.6896832
And the length of the incision should be about two fingers together, because when a vein is incised, the blood exits with a pulsed egress, which jumps out frequently.	The incision should be of about two fingers' breadth. When cut, the artery gives out a pulsating jet of blood spurting intermittently.	0.7507394
But if the artery does not appear at the feeling, then it is necessary that you measure from the ear the amount of the space of three fingers, and then mark with a probe, and cut to the bone.	If the artery is not discernible, you should measure three fingers' breadth from the ear, than mark with ink, and cut down to the bone.	0.8392925
e fort leu ne geta de lu mays o mens, e tot aquo es segon la quantitat la qual appareys de la vertut del malaute e de la replecio de la arceria de lu. And what is necessary to draw from the blood is the amount of one ounce of wine, and then draw more or less, and all this is according to the amount that appears from the strength of the patient and the fullness of his artery.	The quantity of blood that should be let is six ounces on the average, but often more blood, or less, is withdrawn; all in proportion to the strength of the patient and the fullness of the arteries as they appear to you.	0.64074254
And then consider the wound, and if any cause remains on the bone from the brain, then incise this so that a swelling does not form.	Then examine the wound and if there remains on the bone any part of the membrane cut it off to avoid a haematoma.	0.6943433
And then tighten the wound with sponges and linen cloth bindings, and then treat it with ointments until it is healed.	Then bind up the wound with a bandage of linen cloth and dress with ointments till healed.	0.86957073
Chapter 3.	CHAPTER THREE.	0.77482486
On the extraction of the arteries which are in the temples.	On the extraction of the temporal arteries.	0.69582343
When someone has ancient migraines or severe cataracts due to agrimonial moisture and quality in the temple nerves, or ancient and severe sleepiness similar to those, and it is treated with medicinal methods and this does not help, then we have tried for these illnesses the extraction of the arteries in the temples, or cauterization of them as we have shown.	When a man has a chronic migraine or acute catarrh, on account of acrid humidities and heat in the temporal muscles, or a violent chronic headache, or the like, and he has been treated with various medical treatments without success, we have sometimes in these diseases tried extraction of the arteries from the temples or cauterization of them, already described.	0.7679108
And the manner of the operation and extraction of them is that the patient shaves the hairs which are in the temples; and pay attention to the apparent artery in the temple because it is shown to you by its pulse, and it is hidden except in few men due to the force of rubbing.	The manner of extraction is for the patient to shave the temporal hair; then you press upon the artery appearing on the temple; for it will be manifest to you by its pulsation, and is rarely invisible save in a few people or on account of severe cold.	0.78345144
And if it is hidden from you, then the patient's neck should be tightened with a cloth; and then rub the area with a rough cloth or bathe the area with hot water until the artery appears clearly to you. And then you take the knife of which this is the shape: And then you strip the scalp with it easily until you reach the artery; and then you remove it from there and extract it to the upper parts until you extract it from the scalp and uncover it from the tunics which are under it, in all parts.	But if it is not plain to you then let the patient bind his neck with the end of his garment; then do you rub the place with a piece of cloth or foment with hot water, till the artery is obvious to you; then take a scalpel shaped thus; then with it gently scrape away the skin till you come to the artery, then stick a hook in it and draw it upward till you extract it from the skin and free it all round from the membranes that are beneath it.	0.884953
But if the artery is subtle, then wrap it with the end of the probe, and then incise a part of it according to the amount by which its ends are extended and contracted, and there will be no flow of blood, because if they are not incised, the blood will not flow at all.	But if the artery be thin, twist it with the tip of the hook and cut out enough of it for the two ends to be well separated from one another and contract so that no haemorrhage occurs; for if it is not divided and cut it will not let blood flow at all.	0.7967492
And then remove one to three ounces of blood.	Then let blood, from six to three ounces.	0.7655519
And if the artery is large, then it is necessary that you tie it in two places with strong double silk thread or long cords, and do not allow it to rot before the wound is consolidated and a blood flow occurs.	If the artery be large it should be ligated in two places with a strong double thread; the threads should be either silken or lute-string, lest corruption attack them before the wound is healed, and haemorrhage occur.	0.82723975
And then cut the excess which is between the two ties; and do this at that time or at another time.	Then cut away what remains between the two ligatures; do that immediately or later.	0.8287194
And if you want, cauterize it with a cautery to the bone with a knife-shaped cautery until the ends of it are incised, and it will remain in place of the same work.	If you wish, you may cauterize it down to the bone with an edged cautery so that the ends of the artery be divided; for this will replace that operation.	0.6428121
And it is a better operation unless the patient has a fever or is of a hot complexion; because cautery is one of those causes that help with ending moisture, and therefore it is better in the summer.	It is in fact better, as we have said, unless the patient is feverish or of a hot constitution; cauterization is one of the means of eliminating humidities, so it will be of surer efficacy.	0.78395003
And it is necessary after the extraction of the arteries to fill the place with old cotton, and place well-made powders over it, and then treat it with dry medicines that make the flesh grow and with poultices until it is healed.	After extraction of the arteries the place must be packed with teased-out cotton wool, and on top of that must be put firm pads. And after loosening the ligature, dress with dry medicaments that encourage growth of flesh, and with bandages,, till it heals.	0.7757054
And if during the operation another time there is a blood flow from the artery, then quickly stop that blood, either with a cautery or by filling the place with cotton, and tighten it with your hand until the blood is stopped. And if none of those methods are present to you, then place your finger over the place until the blood is coagulated, and then bathe the place with very cold water until the sharpness rests, and tighten it as necessary.	But if arterial bleeding hinders you in the course of your operation, hasten to stanch it either by cauterization or by filling the place with vitriol, compressing it with your hand till the blood stays; or, if you have nothing of this kind by you, put your finger on it till the blood clots and rinse over the place till the flow dies down; then tie off as you should.	0.8383138
And what is easier in artery extraction is that you cauterize the vein with this cautery having two blades, since you have marked the two places with a probe, and place each one, very ignited, until they reach the bone and incise the vein in two places, so that what is between its ends is elongated, because they are not entirely consolidated with this cautery.	Less serious and easier than excising the artery is to cauterize the vessel with this cautery provided with two blades, having first marked both places with ink. Bring it down, very hot, till it reaches the bone and the artery is cut in two places, so as to put some distance between the two ends, for it will certainly not unite after this cauterization.	0.8344488
And this is the shape of the cautery:	This is the form of the cautery.	0.68557054
But however if they are less sharp than two blades it is better, because if they are as sharp as two blades they will quickly rub together, and will not cut the flesh quickly.	It should have two sharp blades like two small paring-knives, but they should be much less sharp than a knife, for if they are as sharp as a knife they will quickly lose their heat and the flesh will be slow in cutting.	0.7700603
So when there is some thickness in them, the heat of the fire is retained in them and the flesh is cut easily.	If they have a certain thickness in them the heat of the fire will be retained in them and they will speedily cut the flesh.	0.8353369
And this work is better in every procedure and easier.	This operation is superior to all and less severe and easier.	0.76923364
And let the space between the two blades be the thickness of a finger.	Let the distance between the two blades be the breadth of a finger.	0.84464145
Chapter 4.	CHAPTER FOUR.	0.7550161
On the treatment of sharp and acidic tears in the eyes.	On the treatment of a chronic flux of bitter tears into the eyes.	0.7755046
When the tears are acidic, and they come from the veins on the outer surface of the head, and no medicinal treatment helps, and the patient's face becomes red and feels a crawling sensation on the forehead as if ants are moving, and their eyes are weakened and moist to the point where the eyelashes become noticeable, and the eyelids are heated by the sharpness of the tears, the ancients advised treating this with the following operation, which is now detailed with a knife.	When lachrymation is chronic and arises from the external vessels on the cranium, nor does treatment by any kind of medical remedy have any effect, and you see the patient's features flushed, and he feels a creeping in his forehead like that of an ant, and his eyes are wasted and moist, and the roots of the lashes itch, and the eyelids are burned by the bitterness of the tears, the Ancients were compelled to treat it by this operation which they called 'treatment by the sword'.	0.79855657
You instruct the patient to shave the hair on their forehead, and then make three incisions on the forehead evenly spaced along its length. If the length of the incision is two fingers: one incision should be equally distant from the length of the nose in the middle of the forehead, the second according to the length slightly from the movement of the nerves which are in the tear ducts, and the third on the other side.	You bid the patient shave the hair of his forehead; then you make three parallel incisions across his forehead a little apart; and let the length of each incision be two fingers' breadths; the first incision continuing the line of the nose in the middle of the forehead; and the second at a little distance from the temporal muscle; and the third incision on the other side of the forehead.	0.91575325
Beware of cutting the arteries which are on both sides, and extend your hand away from the continuation of both jaws. And if the space of each incision is the width of three fingers placed together.	Beware of cutting the two arteries which are at the sides, and keep your hand away from the mandibular joint; and let there be a distance between each incision as of three fingers joined.	0.8896034
And have ready a piece of sponge or soft dried cloths to dry the blood.	Have ready by you some pieces of sponge or a number of linen towels to wipe away the blood.	0.71901107
Strip off all the scalp that is between the two incisions with the instrument that is over the bone, and then do this from the middle incision to the second incision. Then remove this spatula and insert into the first incision another instrument called a knife, sharp on one side and not sharp on the other.	Then introduce the double-edged scalpel shaped thus through the incision near the temple to the middle incision, and with it pare off all the skin between the two incisions with the periosteum; then do the same from the middle incision to the third one; then draw out this scalpel and introduce into the first incision another instrument which is known as 'the knife-shaped': sharp on one side, smooth and blunt on the other, thus.	0.81885695
Place the sharp side towards the flesh attached to the scalp, and the other side towards the bone, and push it until it reaches the middle incision, and cut all the vessels descending from the head to the eyes with it.	The sharp edge of it should be turned upward to the subcutaneous tissue and the smooth edge toward the bone; then push it on to reach the middle incision and with it cut all the vessels passing from the head down toward the eyes, without letting the incision come through the outer skin.	0.7803315
But continue the incision so that the scalp appears, and then do this in the middle incision to the other incision.	Then do the same from the middle incision to the third.	0.53393966
And if an equal amount of blood flows, squeeze the places of the pieces of coagulated blood.	After a moderate quantity of blood has flowed, express the bits of blood-clot from the place and pack into each incision a pad of teased-out cotton wool.	0.57070875
Then place old cotton in each fissure, and place powders soaked in wine and oil and sour wine on them, and ensure that no hot abscess occurs.	Over all put a pad soaked in wine and oil, or vinegar and oil, lest an effusion occur.	0.63912386
And on the third day, untie the bandage and administer a large infusion of warm or tepid water, and then treat it with basilicon ointment with rose oil and others until the wounds are healed.	On the third day loosen the bandage and rinse with plenty of tepid water and afterwards dress with balm of basilicon with rose-ointment and other treatments for wounds, until healed.	0.87152344
Chapter 5.	CHAPTER FIVE.	0.7872728
On the treatment of tears from catarrh and those descending to the eyes from the inner parts of the head.	On the treatment of tears and defluxions in the eyes arising from within the head.	0.7826835
When someone has acute and continuous catarrh, and sometimes the patient's eyes are strained, and their vision is weakened, and the eyelids ulcerated and losing their eyelashes, and there is sharp pain in the head and consequent sneezing, then know from these symptoms that the matter and catarrh come from many veins of the internal parts.	When anyone has a quantity of painful defluxions, acrid and continuous, and you see the eyes wasted and sunken and their sight is weakened and the eyelids are ulcerated and lose their eyelashes; while deep in the head there may be a vehement and grievous pain with incessant sneezing, then you may know from these occurrences that those humours and catarrhs arise from many deep blood-vessels.	0.8357599
And the best treatment for them is this: instruct the patient to shave their forehead, and then make an incision in the middle of the forehead, slightly across the width (and start with the incision from the left temple to the right temple; and let the incision be to the bone; and extend your hand away from the nerves of the temples which are damaged towards the chewing), until the bone is exposed.	The best treatment in this case is that which follows: you bid the patient shave his forehead; then you make one incision in the middle of his forehead or a little above, crosswise (begin the incision from the left temple going toward the right temple; the incision should be down to bone; and avoid the temporal muscles that move during mastication) until the bone is laid bare.	0.88573825
Dry all the blood with a sponge or dry cloth and then fill between the two lips of the fissure with old cotton or linen cloths. Then tighten above with powders soaked in wine and oil so that no hot abscess occurs.	Wipe away all the blood with a sponge and separate the edges of the incision with teased-out cotton wool or with rolls of linen; then bind up with pads over; the pads should be soaked in wine and oil to guard against an effusion.	0.7920079
And when you untie this and see that the abscess has already diminished, then rub the bone until flesh starts to grow, and then treat it with a drying regimen that makes the flesh grow, as if you take two parts wheat flour and four parts colophony and mix it, and make a plaster from it and apply it to these wounds until the flesh grows naturally.	When you undo it, if you see that an effusion has erupted, you should scrape the bone until a growth of flesh begins in it; then treat with a drying treatment which generates flesh. For example, two parts of wheat flour are taken and of colophonia four parts, and of them a salve is made which may be used to encourage the growth of flesh in wounds of this sort.	0.8198687
Chapter 6.	CHAPTER six.	0.8435001
On the treatment of what falls into the ears.	On the treatment of things that fall into the ear.	0.93589044
Everything that falls into the ears is one of four types, for it is either a mineral stone or something similar to a stone, like iron and glass, or it is from a plant like a pea or bean, or it is a flexible thing like water and sour wine and similar substances, or some animal.	All that falls into the ear comes under four categories: mineral stone, or what resembles stone, such as iron or glass; vegetable grain such as pea or date-stone or the like; or liquid such as water or vinegar; or animal.	0.8756361
And so when a stone falls into the ear or another similar thing that does not get stuck or grow in the ear, hold the ear to the sun, and if you see the stone, then drip some violet or sesame oil into it, and then administer its extraction, and make the person sneeze, and block the nostrils to prevent sneezing. Then place some pieces of cloth or wool around the ear, and extend the ear upwards, as many times it is expelled with these actions.	When a stone or something of that sort that does not grow gets into the ear, turn the ear toward the sun. If you see the stone, pour upon it a little oil of violets or sesame; then try to get it out by moving the head or by inducing sneezing with ptarmica and keeping the nose closed at the onset of sneezing, having first made round the ear a circle of pieces of cloth or wool and drawn the ear upwards. This treatment will usually bring it out.	0.8427243
And if it is not expelled, then administer its extraction with the instrument called "gesti epicicarios," which has this shape:	But if it does not come out, try to get it out with a fine pair of tweezers shaped thus.	0.46726045
And if it is expelled with "gesti," good; if not, then administer its extraction with a subtle hook of little duplication.	If it comes out with the tweezers, good. But if not, try to extract it with a fine blunt hook slightly curved.	0.65184253
And if it is not expelled by this, then make a brass cannula and insert the end of the cannula into the hole of the ear and seal around the cannula with wax and softened oil so that only the cannula is open. Then extract with your breath with strong suction, for many times with this we have succeeded.	And if this does not bring it out, make a bronze tube and introduce the end of the tube well into the meatus of the ear and fill in round with wax softened with oil so that there may be no outlet save through the tube; then suck it out with all your breath; it will often come out with this.	0.8647387
But if it is not expelled in this way, then take some "alum" or "vecz" used for catching birds in a small amount, and place it on the end of a stick, and then wrap it with cotton decently placed. Then insert it into the hole of the ear easily, and then dry the ear of moisture.	But if it does not come out with these means we have described, take turpentine resin or bird-lime, a very little; twist some compact cotton wool on the end of a probe and put this on the tip; then introduce it gently into the ear after you have dried out all the moisture from the ear.	0.57452494
And if it is not expelled with all the methods we have described, then hurry to cut it before it becomes a hot abscess or spasm.	But if your treatment so far is unavailing, then be quick and incise before an abscess or spasm supervene.	0.68841434
And the way to cut it is to first bleed the patient from the cephalic vein and extract blood according to its virtue, then make the patient sit between your hands and turn the ear upwards, and make a small incision at the root of the ear towards the thickness of it in the well-pressed place. And let the incision be of a crescent shape until it reaches the stone, and, having found the stone, remove it if you can with appropriate instruments; then sew the incision immediately with speed, and treat it until it is healed.	Now this is the way to incise: first, the patient's cephalic vein should be cut and blood drawn, in proportion to his strength; then seat the patient in front of you and turn his ear upwards; make a small incision at the lobule of the ear in the depression there (the incision should be crescent-shaped) until you reach the stone; then extract it with whatever instrument you may. Immediately afterwards sew up the incision and dress it till healed.	0.874016
And if the thing falling into the ear is one of the fats that grow and swell, then administer the treatment and extraction of it; but if it does not obey you to come out, then take a thin and subtle spatula of this shape: and use it for the excision of that lump which has fallen into the ear.	If the object that falls into the ear is one of those grains that grow or swell, then try to extract it by the means already mentioned. If it does not respond to your efforts to get it out, take a fine narrow scalpel like this and with it attempt to cut out whatever kind of grain has entered the ear.	0.71315944
And do not do this when you think it is already moistened by the vapor of the ear, and place it in many pieces, and then extract it with hooks or subtle gestures, or by incision as we have said, for its extraction is made easier.	You should not do this except when you are sure that this grain has become moist by reason of the vapours of the ear, so that you may cut up the grain into several small pieces. Then you may extract them with a blunt hook or fine-headed tweezers, or by suction, as we have mentioned; for their extraction will be easy.	0.77318126
But for water that has entered the ear, the patient should sneeze at the beginning, and fill the ear with some old cotton, and lie on the ear with the water in it, and if this expels it, good; if not, then take some thin and long stones according to the length of a finger, and heat them a little in the fire, and the patient should insert one of them into the hole of their ear and jump on one foot of that side and strike with another stone on the stone inside the ear. Then do not stop with the stone until all the water is expelled.	As for water getting into the ear, the patient should first employ sneezing excited by ptarmica, his ear having been plugged with a piece of teased-out cotton; he should lie upon that ear in which the water is; and if it so come out, well and good. But if not, take a number of small stones about a finger's length, thin and smooth, and warm them a little in the fire; and have the patient put one of them into the meatus of the ear and let him hop on that one foot on that side; and, with another stone, tap upon the one put into the ear; he should keep this up with stone after stone till all the water has come out.	0.91149914
Then do not stop with the stone until all the water is expelled. And the water will already be expelled if you take some paper or cloth, and place one end of it in the ear and extend the other end over the fire until most of it is burnt.	Sometimes the water is extracted by taking a reed or quill and introducing one end into the ear; then the other end is set alight till the greater part of it is burnt; then repeat time after time with more quills till all the water is got out.	0.688928
And then put another cloth and do this many times until all the water is expelled, and extract it with a cannula as said above for extracting the stone.	Or else suck it out with a cannula as described for a stone.	0.46367013
But for the extraction of an animal entering that ear, if it is a small thing like a flea or something similar, treat it as we have said in the division; but if it is a large thing that is visible to the senses, then administer its extraction with hooks and forceps, and the reason for it is easier than all other things that fall into the ear.	As for the extraction of a creature getting into the ear, look to see if it is small of body, such as a flea or the like, in which case treat by those means mentioned in the section. But if it has a large body, conspicuous to the touch, try to get it out with tweezers and hooks; for of all things that stick in the ear this is the easiest to extract.	0.8677776
But for the extraction of a worm generated in the ear, when you treat it with what we have said in the division and in the treatise on distillations and it does not work, then you need to hold the ear to the sun.	As for the extraction of a worm generated in the ear, when you have unavailingly treated it by those methods mentioned in the section in the treatise on instillations, you will need to examine the ear in the sunlight; and if you can see any worms, extract with tweezers or fine hooks.	0.6601349
And if some cause of the worms appears, then extract it with hooks or subtle forceps, but if no cause appears, then take a cannula narrow at the bottom and wide at the top, which has this shape: And insert the subtle end into the ear according to the amount the patient can tolerate; then suck with it strongly, and do this many times until all the worms are expelled.	But if you cannot see any, then take a cannula of this form narrow in its lower part, broad above; and introduce the narrow part into the ear as far as the patient can bear it; then make strong suction through it, repeatedly, till all the worms are extracted.	0.80968225
But if it does not obey you to come out, then seal and close around the cannula with wax as we have said; then administer distillations that the ancients have already tried in the treatment of worms, and you will find this in the treatise on distillations.	But if they do not come out in response to your treatment, plug all round the cannula with wax as bidden in treating for a stone. If nothing will bring them out, employ the instillations which I mentioned as having been tried by the Ancients for killing worms; you will find that in the treatise on instillations.	0.8300939
And let your infusion with which you pour the medicinal oils into the ear be done with this instrument, which has this shape: And make it of silver or brass, narrow at the bottom, with a small hole, and flat on top.	The instillation of oils or drugs should be done with an instrument like this, as you will see; you make it of silver or bronze, narrow at its lower end, with a small perforation, and wide at its upper part.	0.7566031
And then press down on what is in the concavity of the cannula to inject it where necessary. And if you want, take the rod and wrap the end of it with cotton decently, then pour oil into the concavity of the hearing, or juice of some herb, or whatever you want of these medicines into the cannula — which is in the ear —, then insert the rod with the cotton on it and press it with your hand with tempered compression until the oil is expelled into the hearing concavity and the patient feels the oil inside.	If you wish, you may make the obturator which goes in the cannula of strong bronze; or, if you like, take a probe and wrap cotton wool tightly round its tip; then pour into the cannula oil, juices, or whatever of these remedies you want, with the cannula in the ear. Then introduce the probe with cotton wool on it and press moderately until the oil is ejected into the meatus and the patient feels it enter.	0.9000503
And whatever is poured into the ear should be warmed a little with fire. And beware that the substance you drip into the ear is not too cold, for ear medicines do not tolerate this.	Let that which you put into the ear first be slightly warmed at the fire; and be careful that it be neither very hot nor very cold, for the ear is not suited to bear that.	0.7949437
Chapter VII	CHAPTER SEVEN.	0.66083944
On the treatment of ear blockage.	On the treatment of obstructions in the ear.	0.9297037
Sometimes some children are born from their mothers' wombs with unperforated ears, and this also happens in some men, blockage in the ear canal due to injury or flesh growing in it; and this blockage sometimes occurs in the opening of the ear canal that does not reach the eardrum, and sometimes it is in the outer parts.	Infants sometimes are born with an imperforated auditory meatus. Some people also get an obstruction in the passage of the ear, either from an injury or from flesh growing in it. Sometimes this obstruction is at the bottom of the ear out of sight, but sometimes it occurs a little outside the passage and is invisible.	0.8683261
And the one that occurs in the opening, which does not affect the eardrum, is in the worst conditions for difficult healing.	The sort which occurs in the depths of the ear and is invisible is, in general, difficult to cure.	0.5998552
And in the one that affects the eardrum, you should hold the patient's ear to the sun and examine it. And then if you see apparent blockage, open it with a subtle spatula of which this is the shape:	As for that which is within sight, set the patient's ear in the sun and examine it; and if you see that the object is something external you should make an opening with a fine scalpel like this.	0.75480187
With the end of it having a small width, with one part sharp and the other not; and the spatula should be double-edged so as not to cause injury to the ear.	Let its extremity be slightly broad, with a sharp point; while the rest of the scalpel should be smooth on both sides so as not to harm the ear.	0.8107838
And if the blockage is due to flesh growing in the ear or in the canal, then hold it with subtle forceps and incise it with great care until all the flesh is removed.	But if the obstruction be from flesh growing in the auditory meatus, catch it with a fine hook and cut it, with the utmost gentleness, till all the flesh is gone.	0.75013673
And if the blockage is in the opening of the ear, then take a fine rod and heat it slightly with fire, and then put it into the ear canal.	If the obstruction be in the depth of the ear, take a fine smooth probe and warm it a little in the fire; then push it into the meatus.	0.79117835
And then if you have felt the blockage with what the patient finds easy, due to hearing heaviness, ease the pressure on it gently; and take care not to damage the nerves of the ear.	If you feel the obstruction (what time the patient will experience hardness of hearing), seek to perforate it gently, being careful not to injure the nerve of the ear.	0.6751677
And then place a piece of cloth in the ear according to the width of the opening which you have wrapped in Egyptian ointment; and do this for several days until you are sure of the wound's consolidation; or take wool and soak it in water and sprinkle it over the wound; and if you see the ear already swollen, then you need to remove the wool and replace it with another wool which you will wrap in a plaster made with rose oil, until the swelling has subsided; and then treat it until it is healed.	Then put in a plug the width of the meatus, which you will have anointed with Egyptian ointment; do this for some days till you are sure that the wound is healing. Or take a plug and dip it into water and sprinkle it with powdered vitriol and use that. If you perceive the ear swelling with an abscess you should remove the plug and put in its place another previously prepared by soaking in wax made with oil of roses, till the abscess has subsided; then dress till it is healed.	0.93314576
But if there is a flow of blood, then submerge a sponge or cloth in cold water and place it over the ear, and use another treatment that restricts the blood flow, which is mentioned in the treatise on distillation.	If a haemorrhage occur, dip a sponge or piece of material in cold water and put it on the ear, and apply the rest of the treatment to stop haemorrhage mentioned in the treatise on instillations.	0.7976294

Styes that occur on the eyelids of the eyes are sometimes wet, sometimes dry.	These warts which occur on the eyelids are sometimes humid, sometimes dry.	0.87777287
Then you need to hold them with forceps or pincers, and cut them with a spatula from their roots, and then place crushed herbs over the spots.	You should hold them with forceps or a hook, and cut them away from the roots with a scalpel; then put powdered vitriol on the place.	0.7711073
But if pain with a flow of blood comes, then you cauterize them with a fine lancet cautery.	If there is bleeding from them, cauterize them with a fine lenticular cautery.	0.7214361
And the best cauterization is after the incisions and sometimes returning when some root cause remains; and when they are cauterized with fire, those roots are burned and do not return.	Cauterization of them after excision is best, for they often return when a part of their roots is left behind; but when they are cauterized the roots are burnt and they will not come back.	0.8342118

Treatment of swelling that appears on the eyelids.	On the treatment of stones occurring in the eyelids.	0.76517606
Sometimes, something appears on the eyelids that resembles hailstones in its hardness and strength, and thus is called "hailstone."	There often occurs in the eyelids a thing resembling a hailstone in its strength and hardness, and therefore called 'hail'.	0.88258195
It is an accumulation of thick moisture on the upper and lower eyelid.	It is actually a collection of thick humours in the upper or lower lid.	0.71507907
So the procedure is to examine if the swelling is moving across the eyelid and its cause is minor.	The operative treatment for it is thus: examine; and if the stone is external on the outer aspect of the lid, and mobile in all directions, dealing with it is simple.	0.41909274
Then make a lateral incision, and easily scrape it from all sides until it escapes, then lift it with a hook and remove it.	You make above it a transverse incision; then scrape gently around it till it is free; then catch it up with a hook and cut it away.	0.7427541
If the swelling is large, then stitch it and treat it until it heals.	If the incision be big, gather it up with a suture and dress it till it heals.	0.8413057
If it is small, there will be no harm as the ointment will restore and heal it.	If it be small, it will be no trouble, for ointment will restore it and heal it.	0.92220837
If the swelling moves inward towards the inner surface of the eyelid, then evert the eyelid, lift the swelling with a hook, and press it from all sides. If the eyelid is elongated by the incision, it causes no harm.	If the stone is rather toward the inner aspect of the eyelid, then invert the lid and catch up the stone with a hook—you will not need to incise the lid—and cut it all round. If the lid is pierced in the cutting, it will do no harm at all.	0.73565626
After the incision, wash the eye with saltwater and treat the wound with something that promotes healing until it is cured.	Then, after cutting away the stone, wash the eye with salt water; then treat with cicatrizing medicines till healed.	0.7881097

Treatment of 'axcirnah' on the upper eyelid.	On the treatment of hydatid in the upper lid.	0.49932435
Axcirnah is a growth that forms on the membranes of the upper eyelid, mostly in children, causing heaviness in their eyes and resulting in morning discharge; they cannot tolerate bright sunlight as tears flow from their eyes.	It is a disease chiefly occurring in children, irritating their eyes, giving them morning catarrh; they are unable to look full into the light of the sun, since they get an immediate secretion of tears.	0.7494588
You will see them lying on their faces all the time, sleeping on their faces; the lower eyelids and eyebrows are wet and swollen, and you can feel the swelling when you press the area with your fingers.	And for that reason you will find them lying always on their faces, and they also sleep on their faces; and the eyelids below the eyebrows are moist and covered with swellings, while the hydatid stands out prominently; and when you press upon the place with your finger you can feel the fat beneath it.	0.77764356
One method is to have the patient rest their head on your lap, place a cloth on it, make a circular incision around the swelling, and press it with your fingers to gather the swelling in the center. Then, make a small lateral incision into the center of the swelling, no larger than a phlebotomy incision.	The manner of operating is for the patient to let his head rest in your lap. Then you take a scrap of linen and prepare a pad of it. Make it into a circle of sufficient size to enclose the whole of the hydatid on all sides, then place it on it and squeeze with your fingers on all sides, so as to gather up the hydatid in the centre of the circle. Then in the middle of this humidity make a crosswise incision with a lancet, but do not let the incision be larger than that made for a venesection.	0.7198484
But in more severe cases, you must cut through the entire layer to reach the swelling, as in more advanced stages the swelling appears as a white substance.	As to the depth, the skin should be incised right through till you come to the hydatid, which in most cases will come out from the incision, in the shape of a white piece of fat.	0.48208362
Then extract it with cloths wrapped around your fingers, rotating your hands until it is removed.	Draw it out with a cloth rolled between your fingers, turning your hand to right and to left till it is separated.	0.6968266
Be careful not to press too much into the incision to avoid damaging the eye.	Be careful not to go so deep with your scalpel that it sticks in the eye and injures it.	0.6967159
If the swelling does not appear initially, gently press the incision until the swelling emerges, then extract it as described. Soak cloths in water and vinegar, place them on the area, and press with powders.	If you do not see the hydatid at the first incision, you must gently cut a little deeper till it comes forth, then draw it out as described. Then dip some cloth in vinegar and water, apply to the place and bind it up with pads.	0.80115616
Some people crush salt and place it in the cavity of the incision to dry out the remaining moisture.	There are some who grind up salt and put it in the hollow of the incision to liquefy thereby the remains of the humidity.	0.8978006
Then treat it until it heals.	Then dress till healed.	0.79710376
If an abscess forms, treat it with cedar plaster until it heals.	If an effusion occur in the place, treat with sedative plasters till healed.	0.7030929

On methods of treating 'tactimi' of the eye.	On the various methods of blepharoplasty.	0.45203292
When hair grows on the eyelids under the natural lashes and becomes hardened, it irritates the eye and causes conditions such as constant tearing and softening of the eyelids, which can lead to eye damage called 'tactini.' It is treated in four ways: by cautery with fire; with sharp medicine as previously described in the chapter on cautery; by making incisions and sutures; or by using canes, as I will describe.	When superfluous lashes grow on the eyelid outside their natural place, below the natural lashes, and continue, they injure the eye and give rise to many kinds of disease, such as chronic lachrymation, dropping of the eyelids (ptosis), and whiteness and opacity, eventually resulting in the destruction of the eye. The plastic operation on the eye is carried out in four ways: by the actual cautery; by caustic in the way mentioned above in the book on cauterization; by incision and suture; or with canes, as I shall describe.	0.7638185
Rest the patient's head on your lap, turn the eyelid with your left hand, and if it turns, it is good; if not, insert a needle with a thread from below the eyelid, penetrate the upper part, near the eyelid margin where the hairs grow, and pull the thread up through the eyelid.	You should place the patient's head in your lap, then with your left hand turn out the eyelid. Now if it thus becomes everted, good; otherwise introduce a threaded needle beneath the eyelid and pass the needle up; let that be near the hair itself.	0.86998
Make an incision on the inner part of the eyelid below the abnormal hairs from the major to the minor lacrimal, then extract the thread, place small powders of cotton or cloth under the eyelid, and suture the eyelid in a shape like a myrtle leaf.	Then draw the thread up with the lid and invert the lid with a probe; then make an incision on the inside of the lid below the superfluous lashes with the lancet, from the greater to the lesser angle. Then draw out the thread and put beneath the lid a small pad of cotton or linen; then mark with ink on the eyelid the shape of a myrtle leaf.	0.77286613
The shape should correspond to the elevation of the eyelid, which varies among people, as some require a large amount of the eyelid to be incised according to the extent of the softening.	The shape should be according to the amount you wish to raise the lid, and varies in different people.	0.7155794
Then make the incision along the two marked lines, starting from the major to the minor lacrimal. And your incision near the natural hairs should be as thick as a king's hair.	Then with a scalpel incise over the two lines you have marked, beginning at the greater angle and going toward the lesser angle; and let one incision be close to the natural lashes, at a distance of about the breadth of a probe.	0.7449762
Then place the hook in one of the two corners of the cut, scrape it entirely, align the two edges with a thread or fine wool, wipe the blood, and adhere the excess threads to the two eyebrows with a sticky substance if desired, otherwise don't bother.	Then introduce a hook into one angle of the skin and peel it all off; then join the edges with a needle and a fine woollen thread and wipe away the blood; and stick the ends of the threads to the eyebrow with adhesive, if you like; but if you do not it does not matter.	0.7194259
Leave the stitches for three to four days, then treat it.	Then let the suture and the threads remain for about three or four days, then dress.	0.79290134
If you wish, leave the wound without sutures and treat it with something that dries and tightens, as the eyelid will elevate due to the wound sealing and fluid accumulation; but suturing is better. This is what the ancients say about 'taxanir.'	If you like, you may leave the wound without suture and treat it with drying medicaments and styptics; then the eyelid will be lifted as the wound heals and comes together; but suture is better. The Ancients mention this method of operating.	0.775939
Be attentive to the patient, it is a good procedure, and there is no danger in it.	It involves some burden for the patient; but the operation is good and safe.	0.5545043
Another method in 'taxmir' is to mark a myrtle leaf shape on the eyelid, lift the eyelid with three separated and gathered hooks as follows:	Yet another way of operating is to mark on the eyelid the figure of a myrtle leaf as we have described; then lift the eyelid with three hooks, either separate or joined thus.	0.7862513
If it is not possible to use the hooks, take a needle with a thread, insert it in the middle of the shape, another thread near the major lacrimal, and another near the minor lacrimal, hold the threads evenly, and lift the entire marked area as described.	But if you cannot conveniently hold with the hooks, take a threaded needle and introduce it into the middle of the marking; and put another thread through near the greater canthus, and a third thread near the lesser canthus. With your fingers hold the threads evenly and then raise your hand evenly and you will raise up the whole of the marked skin as we have said.	0.75880235
Then stitch the two edges of the wound and treat it until it heals.	Then bring the edges together with a suture and dress till healed.	0.67902434
If an abscess forms near your incision or wound, treat it with plaster and ointment.	But if in your incision, or the opening you have made, a swelling arises, then allay the swelling with wax and similar sedatives.	0.64381254
Sometimes the eyelid hair turns inward, then you should use the described incision method; but suturing is more skillful.	Sometimes the lower lid also has the lashes inverted. For this you should use any of the methods we have mentioned: the incision and suture, and the operation by the actual cautery and by caustic. ( The operation by the actual cautery or caustic) is more effective, and easier on the patient, than incision and suture, (but incision and suture) is more workmanlike in either lid.	0.54961705
Treating with canes follows this method: Turn the eyelid and cut the described shape; then make two thin canes or slivers with a length matching the eyelid and a width less than the incision. Make incisions at the ends of each part where you hold the threads.	Trimming the lid by means of canes is done as follows: you invert the eyelid and cut the inner slit as I have described; then you prepare two slender canes or rods of a length equal to that of the eyelid and a breadth less than that of a scalpel; and at either end of each you make a notch to hold the threads.	0.8962074
Gently place each cane over the excess eyelid tissue, bind them tightly, and leave them for several days; the tissue will die and fall off by itself.	Then gently put them together over the superfluous part of the eyelid and tie them firmly together at both ends and leave for a few days; for the ligated flesh will necrose and turn black and putrefy and eventually fall away spontaneously.	0.7444835
If delayed, break it with forceps, and treat the wound until it heals.	But if it is slow in sloughing, cut off with shears; then dress till healed.	0.6429228
Once healed, the eyelid will be lifted, and the hairs will not irritate.	And when it is healed the eyelid will be raised and the lashes will no longer irritate the eye.	0.7916168
This is the method of making two canes as described: They should be the correct length and width, no more, no less.	Now this is the figure of the canes; you should prepare them exactly in this shape and of this length and breadth.	0.5648413

On the elevation of painful eyelashes in the eye with a needle when the hair is hard.	On the removal with the needle of irritating lashes from the eye.	0.5883676
When the hairs are unnatural, hard, rough, and painful to the eyes, then the procedure is to take a fine needle, insert a fine silk thread into it, and then tie the ends of the thread in a very delicate manner. The length of the threads should be about the size of a palm.	If it be one or two hairs the operation will be to take a fine needle, thread it with a fine smooth silk, bring the ends together, and knot them with a tiny knot; the thread should be about a span in length.	0.65987307
Then prepare another fine thread similarly and tie its ends if you wish.	Then in the loop insert another fine thread, shorter than the first, and join the ends with a knot if you wish.	0.6945738
Then have the patient rest their head on your lap and be near the sunlight so that your work is visible, as this is a delicate and fine procedure.	Then let the patient put his head in your lap in full sunlight, so that the operation may be clearly seen, because it is very fine work.	0.8226817
Next, insert the needle at the root of the hair that needs treatment, and make it penetrate the eyelid quickly until you pull it above the natural hair.	Then introduce the needle with the loop to the root of the superfluous hair and run it quickly through the eyelid till you make it come out above the natural hair.	0.8341929
Then pull the hair up and insert it into the conjunctiva, dealing with one, two, or three hairs at most.	Then draw the thread to the top of the loop and introduce that hair into the loop if it be one, two, or three, but not more.	0.70209694
Then pull your hand until the hair is removed with the conjunctiva in the eyelid along with the natural hair.	Then draw away your hand with it until the hair emerges with the loop on the eyelid among the natural hair.	0.8514615
But if the conjunctiva is pulled and the hair is not removed, you will pull the conjunctiva downward with the thread you have prepared until the conjunctiva is removed from the upper hole.	If you pull the loop and the hair does not come out with it, you draw the loop down by means of the thread which you have previously passed through it, until the loop comes out at the upper perforation.	0.71811235
Then you will see this with your eye's vision, for then you will remove the conjunctiva and the thread, and each will bleed and seal the eye, leaving the seal for two or three days until the hair adheres to its place and good flesh grows over it.	Then extract loop and thread and take them both out, and bind the eye and leave it bound for two or three days till the hair be fixed in its place and there is regeneration of flesh over it.	0.79283714
If the hair is shorter, you then attach a longer hair from the natural ones, and it is elevated with it, or you leave it until it lengthens a bit, and then you lift it.	If the hair be short, put with it a long natural hair so that it may be raised together with that; or let the hair grow till it reach a greater length, then raise it.	0.859326

On the treatment of contracture which appears on the upper eyelid.	On entropion occurring in the upper eyelid.	0.6956167
When contracture occurs in the eye, it is a contraction of the eyelid that is drawn upward or to the right or left due to improper healing of a wound, incision, or cauterization, and it is called "leporina." This contracture is either natural or accidental, caused by the improper healing of a wound, incisions, or cauterizations, or something similar.	The eye that suffers this inversion of the lid is called 'leporine' (i.e.	0.6174669
The way to operate on this is to cut through the consolidation and separate the edges of it, then place a piece of linen cloth between them and bind them until they are healed.	The idea of the operation is to excise the scar, separate the edges of the wound, pack linen between them, and bandage up till healed.	0.7349524
And you should not use drying or constricting treatments because if you do, the contracture will return worse than ever before.	In the treatment of it you should not use anything styptic or drying, for if you do the inversion will return worse than ever before.	0.78072894
Use softening treatments such as fenugreek, and wash with water in which marshmallow and linseed have been cooked, or an ointment called 'diachylon,' which is liquefied with some oils, and soak the linen cloth in it, and treat with that.	Employ relaxing substances such as fenugreek; and fomentation with water in which mallows and linseed have been boiled; and diachylon plaster which has been previously softened with one of the oils and spread on the packs; and treat it with this.	0.82322764
The key to your treatment is to ensure by all means that the wound does not consolidate as it did initially.	The main thing in the treatment is to use every device to prevent the healing up of the place as it was before.	0.7378976
This procedure we have described is merely a correction of the contracture that does not return the place to its original form.	This operation which we have described is but some correction of the inversion, not that the appearance of the place will necessarily revert to what it was.	0.7720684
Chapter XIV.	CHAPTER FOURTEEN.	0.70632744
On the treatment of contracture that occurs on the lower eyelid.	On the treatment of entropion of the lower lid.	0.68007374
This contracture which occurs on the lower eyelid, which is truly called contracture; some are natural, others accidental.	This inversion in the lower lid is that which is truly called entropion; and it is either congenital or acquired.	0.5895883
But accidental contracture is caused by a wound, incision, cauterization, or other similar causes.	It is acquired by injury or incision or cautery or something like that.	0.6522075
The procedure for this is to take a needle with a double thread, insert it into the flesh, and pass it from the left lacrimal gland to the right lacrimal gland until the thread reaches both ends of the flesh.	This is the method of operating for it: you take a needle through which has been passed a double thread and you run it into the flesh, making it penetrate from the left angle of the eye to the right angle so that the thread is fixed in flesh both ends.	0.8233172
Then extend the flesh upward with the needle and suture it with the needle, making a wide incision. Then if the eyelid returns to its proper shape, it is good; if not, take the needle and place it in the split shape, and with it turn the eyelid, making two incisions on the side of the lower eyelid.	Then with the needle stretch the flesh upwards and make an incision with a broad scalpel; and if the eyelid returns to its proper shape, well and good. But if not, take a probe and put it on the site of the incision and with it turn back the lid.	0.8581157
And let the ends of the two incisions form two angles of the incision, which you have made to converge, and let their shape form an angle that, when joined together, forms a figure.	Then make two incisions on the inner side of the lid; the two incisions should begin from the angles of the incision already made and run together making an angle so that when they join they are like this.	0.6942151
And this figure is the Greek letter lambda.	It is the Greek letter lambda.	0.78995275
Then remove that flesh by the amount that is on the edge of the lower part of it, where it cuts the eyelid.	You remove that flesh in proportion as the angled side is lower than that adjoining the lid; then bring the divided parts together with two sutures made with a woollen thread.	0.53994405
Then bring the separated parts together and suture them with woolen thread; treat them with what we have mentioned about softening medicines and warm applications until it is healed.	Then treat with the relaxing medicaments and dressings we have mentioned, till healed.	0.6728009
If the contracture occurs due to a fissure, suture, or cauterization, then you must cut with a flat incision over the hairs of the eyelid as described before. Then separate with the warm application between the two edges as we have described.	But if the inversion is acquired, from incision, suture, or cautery, you should make a simple incision below the eyelashes, as has been described, then bring apart the two edges with a packing, as we have said.	0.8214859
In summary, the treatment of contracture whether above or below, proceeds with the operation according to the prepared form of the contracture, which is of various kinds.	The sum of what there is to say about the treatment of inversion, whether it is in the upper or the lower lid, is that you should make your procedure follow the actual lines of the inversion itself ; for this is of varying shape.	0.634529
And the wise practitioner always prepares in every possible way to restore the shape to its natural form, or as close to it as possible, and treats the patient according to the requirements of the operation and the instruments with the best arrangements.	The experienced practitioner will make use of his skill in any way he can to re-establish the natural form or approximate to it. The disease itself will generally indicate to you the appropriate operation and instruments.	0.71352977

When this consolidation occurs in many men so that the upper eyelid is joined with the white of the eye, and its movement and natural functions are hindered, then you must insert the tip of a needle under the eyelid and lift it up, or extend it with a hook.	This adhesion happens to many people, the upper lid sticking to the white of the eye and hindering its movement and preventing its natural functions. You should introduce the end of a probe beneath the lid and raise it upward; or stretch it with a hook.	0.8268444
Then you cut the adhesion with a fine instrument, which should not have a sharp point, but be somewhat blunt so as not to disturb the patient during the operation, and remove the instrument without damaging the eye with its sharpness.	Then cut the adhesion with a fine scalpel; it should not be so sharp as a cutting scalpel, but somewhat blunt, lest during the operation the patient should shake, and the scalpel slip, and the edge injure the eye.	0.8083527
And let your incision scrape away the adhesion easily until the eyelid returns to its natural shape and all the adhesion is healed.	Let your incision be as if peeling off the adhesion. Wait until the lid regains its natural shape and the adhesions be wholly healed.	0.7306198
Then put salty water in the eye and wash it; or drip into it fennel juice dissolved in water.	Then rinse the eye with saline and cleanse it; or instil into it drops of a watery solution of eye-lotion of verdigris.	0.7922734
Then separate between the eyelid and the eye with a linen cloth, and place over the eye wool soaked in egg white, and on the third day use consolidating treatments until it is healed.	Then separate between the eye and the lid with a linen pad and put over the eye a piece of wool moistened with white of egg; and after the third day employ healing eye-lotions till it is better.	0.9094664
Chapter XVI.	CHAPTER SIXTEEN.	0.6767231
On the incision of the nail and the prominence of flesh in the lacrimal glands.	On incision of ungula and excrescence of the canthus.	0.614225
You should know that a nail grows in two ways: either it is hard and nerve-like, resembling a hard thin film; or it is non-nerve-like, resembling coagulated white moisture, which when touched by iron, must be taken with a hook, cut off, and the hook is not inserted into it.	Ungula occurs in two forms: either the nervous, which resembles a fine hard membrane; or the non-nervous, like a white congealed humidity; which, when the iron touches it or you try to pick it up with a hook, is cut through and the hook has no hold on it.	0.769325
Both types originate from the main lacrimal gland and gradually cover the vision, blocking light and the movement of the eye.	Both kinds grow from the greater angle of the eye, whence they spread little by little until they cover the pupil and block both the vision and the movements of the eye.	0.70688486
But the method of operating on this involves having the patient rest their head on your lap, opening their eyes, lifting the eyelid with your hand, then grasping the nail with a hook and gently extending it upward. Then take a needle and insert a hair from a horse, ox, cow, or similar animal, or a strong thread, doubling the end of the needle little by little and inserting it into the middle of the nail, penetrating it with the needle, and tying the nail with the thread; extend it upward, and scrape with the hair the side of the nail that touches the pupil.	This is the method of incision: the patient places his head in your lap and opens his eyes; then you raise the lid with your hand; then with a gently curved hook pick up the ungula and pull it upward; then take a needle threaded with a horse hair or an ox hair, and a strong thread; slightly curve the end of the needle; then thrust it into the middle of the ungula, piercing it with the needle; and tie the ungula with the thread and pull upwards; and, with the hair, peel the side of the ungula adjoining the pupil, and divide it with a sawing motion right through.	0.8968443
Then you cut the remaining part at the root of the lacrimal gland with a fine instrument or small scissors, leaving the natural flesh of the lacrimal gland so that continuous tears do not occur from cutting it.	Then what is left in the root of the angle cut out with a fine scalpel, or with small scissors; and leave the natural caruncle in the canthus lest, in cutting it away, a chronic flux of tears occur.	0.7491232
Sometimes the nail is extended with just the hook or thread as we have said, and then it is scraped with a sharp-edged lion’s instrument, which has this shape:	The ungula may be drawn out with the hook alone or with the thread as we have said, and scraped away with the smoothtipped scalpel of this form.	0.60134065
And be careful not to touch the corneal layer with the instrument, causing it to tear, and not to perforate the pupil.	But beware lest the scalpel touch the corneal covering and cause a fissure in it and the pupil protrude.	0.7406354
After the incision, put a little crushed salt or made-up powder of siniar into the eye, and leave it until the next day; then treat it with what is appropriate until it is healed.	Then after the incision put into the eye a little powdered salt or an eye-lotion of verdigris, and leave it till the following day; then treat as may be necessary till it heals.	0.89943254
If the nail is not nerve-like and you cannot insert the needle, nor the hook, then many times this type of nail is treated with medicines and is healed as I have recounted in the division.	If the ungula is non-nervous in origin and you cannot transfix it with a needle nor get a hook to hold fast in it, this sort is often successfully treated by medical means. So treat as described in the section.	0.79741675
If you want to cut it, then open the patient’s eye and take a fine lion’s instrument with a sharp edge according to this shape: with precision. If you see that it is rarefied and confused and penetrates the root, then drip some of your saliva into the eye with powder made of siniar or with red powder or crushed salt, and cover the eye until the next day.	But if you prefer to cut it, open the patient's eye, and take a fine smooth scalpel, rather blunt, like this and with this gently scrape away the ungula from above; and if you see that it is crumbling away and breaking down under the scraping, then immediately instil into the eye some eye-lotion of verdigris, or the red eye-lotion, or a little powdered salt, and bind the eye up till next day.	0.76598716
Then repeat the operation on it until everything that is there is removed, unless the opposite ulcer is in the eye, then you leave it and treat the ulcer initially until it is healed.	Then repeat the operation on it till you have removed it all, unless an abscess forms in the eye, in which case cease the operation and treat the abscess till cured.	0.8946705
Then repeat your operation on it until it is healed.	Then repeat the treatment with the same scraping till healed.	0.7812037
The prominence of the lacrimal flesh, if it harms the eye greatly, should be suspended with a hook; cut it off partially, but do not complete the incision to prevent continuous tearing.	As for a protuberance of flesh in the angle, if it causes great hurt pick it up with a hook and cut part of it away, with not too big an incision lest there be a flux of tears.	0.6211988
Then drip red powder made of siniar into the lacrimal gland until it is healed.	Then into the canthus instil red eye-lotion or lotion of verdigris till healed.	0.68415356
Chapter XVII.	CHAPTER SEVENTEEN.	0.72569954
On the incision of alguazardenic and of what grows from flesh attached in the eye.	On cutting for chemosis and superfluous flesh in the eye.	0.58762205
Sometimes in the eyes of some people, red flesh grows and covers the pupil, or it approaches or presses on the eyelids and firmly closes the eyelids from the outside and resembles a pomegranate flower.	Sometimes in the eye of certain people a red granulation grows up and increases so as to block the pupil or nearly so; or it grows over the eyelids and often turns the lids outward, and it resembles the blossom of the pomegranate.	0.8662138
But the operation is that the patient places their head on your lap; then you open their eyes and gather all that flesh with appropriate hooks, hold it with a forceps or tweezers; then cut the flesh at the beginning until everything is finished with a knife, and be careful not to damage the eye during the operation.	You operate for this by having the patient put his head in your lap; then he opens his eyes and you gather up the granulation whole, with suitable hooks, or hold it with tweezers or forceps. Then you cut away the first bit of flesh and then the next, until you have cut it all away; and beware of damaging the eye in the course of operation.	0.88010657
And let your incision with which you cut be done either with the fine instrument we mentioned in the incision of the nail, or with small scissors which are adapted according to the form of what is described in this chapter.	Your incision should be made with the scalpel which we described for the incision of pterygium; or with small scissors like those with which one gathers up pannus, as shown in the chapter after this.	0.78318346
Then, when your incision is completed and all that flesh is removed, fill the eye with crushed salt, or drip into it red powder similar to corrosive medicines, and place cotton soaked in egg white over the eye until it is safe from ulceration.	And when you have finished your incision and removed all the chemosis, fill the eye with powdered salt or instil the red powder or similar corrosive; and apply to the outside of the eye cotton wool with white of egg to ward off an abscess.	0.83982265
If there remains any cause of alguazardenic and you fear a serious ulcer, leave the eye and treat the ulcer with what heals that ulcer, then repeat the operation until it is healed, and similarly treat the flesh attached to the eye of this kind.	If there is any chemosis left and blood is getting the better of you and you fear an abscess, then desist and treat the eye with those means for settling a tumour. Thereafter return to your operation till cured. So must you do with superfluous flesh that arises in the eye.	0.72156686
However, you must avoid any treatment of the delicate eye either naturally or accidentally with iron, and do not put your hand in any of these operations until you see that the part can endure that operation.	But you must avoid treating surgically any eye that is weak, whether congenitally or by acquired disease. Never set your hand to an operation of this kind till you have seen if the organ can endure such an operation.	0.8244616
Chapter XVIII.	CHAPTER EIGHTEEN.	0.7280305
On the collection of sabel in the eye.	On gathering up pannus from the eye.	0.6601787
Sabel are red veins that are spread over the eye and prevent its functioning, weakening the eye over time.	Pannus is a network of blood-vessels spreading over the eye so as to interfere with the function of sight and, in the course of time, weakening the eye.	0.63867843
Therefore, it is necessary at the beginning to consider if the eye in which there is sabel is strong and if there is no other disease in the eye besides sabel, then you gather that sabel.	You must first examine, and if the eye with the pannus be strong, with no fault other than the pannus, then the pannus should be gathered up.	0.6139614
You command the patient to place their head on your lap, then suspend those veins with one or two hooks according to your judgement; and let that hook be of a fine duplicating form like this:	This is done by bidding the patient put his head in your lap; then, as skilfully as you may, pick up those blood-vessels with one or two hooks. The hooks should be of a gentle curve, like this.	0.8328184
or two hooks gradually combined into one like this:	Or there can be two hooks joined together on one handle, thus.	0.65351343
Then gather those veins with fine forceps, with precision, and stop the blood hour by hour, until you see those veins being removed from the eye and rolled back.	Then take up the blood-vessels gently with the fine scissors, and wipe away the blood constantly, till you see all those blood-vessels removed from the eye, and the blood wells forth.	0.7965322
And be careful not to harm the eye with the tips of the instrument; and if your operation is at noon before the sun, be very firm in your operation and only cut those veins.	But be careful of the eye lest you damage it with the points of the scissors. Let your work be done in broad sunlight at midday; and be very steady in your action so as to cut nothing beside the bloodvessels.	0.8074864
When you have completed, then you drip into the eye green or red powder so that its sharpness corrodes what remains of the sabel.	When you have finished, instil the red or green lotion into the eye to destroy by its caustic action the remnants of the pannus.	0.80048144
But if it is not possible for you to gather everything at that time, then you apply everything with what relieves its pain, and leave it for a few days until the pain is soothed and it is safe from ulceration.	If you are unable to gather it all up at that one time, apply a plaster to the eye such as will allay the pain, and leave him* for a few days till* the pain be eased and there is no danger of an abscess.	0.7460778
Then repeat the treatment in the same manner until it is healed.	Then repeat the operation in the same manner till it is healed.	0.942246
And this is the form of the scissors:	This is a figure of the scissors. [	0.56252337

On the reduction of arizati to the nose.	On turning a fistula into the nose.	0.5701329
When you treat arizati with cauterization or sharp, burning medicine according to the previous narration and it is not healed, then there is no method except to cut over the ulcer towards its maturity, and extract all the moisture in it and the pus until the bone is exposed.	When you have treated it with the cautery or with caustic according to the instructions given previously, and it is not healed, there is no clear method of treatment except to cut down on the tumour at its ripening and let out all the humidity or pus therein, till you reach the bone.	0.8580511
Then when the bone is exposed and you see in it corruption or blackness, you scrape it with an instrument which has this form:	When bone is reached and you see necrosis or blackness, scrape it with an instrument like this.	0.78254765
And it is called an aspre cap, made of Indian iron, with a round head like a rasp made pointed by the puncturing of a file or finely sharpened (as in the following form).	It is called 'rough-head' and is made of Indian iron. Its head is round like a button but is engraved with markings finely engraved, like those of a file or a rasp.	0.73575544
Place it on the corrupted part of the bone, then rotate it between your fingers, and press your hand little by little until you know that the corruption is scraped off.	Place it on the site of the diseased bone and spin it between your fingers, pressing down a little with your hand, till you are sure all the diseased bone has been scraped away.	0.8201653
Do this several times, then restore the place with drying and astringent substances.	Do this several times. Then let the place be dressed with stanching and styptic remedies.	0.79237795
Then if the place is consolidated and good flesh has grown there and the core of the ulcer is removed and it remains for 40 days, and it is not renewed and does not ulcerate and no accident occurs in it, then you know it is healed.	And if the place heals and flesh is generated there and the flow of sanies is stayed and there is no return after leaving for forty days, and there is no swelling, and nothing emerges, you may know it is perfectly healed.	0.82207197
If not, then there is no method except to reduce the fissure to the shape of the nose, and in this manner: you expose the bone with iron or sharp medicine, and when the bone is exposed, then take a rasp in this form:	But if not, there is no other means for it but to turn the fistula into the cavity of the nose, in this style, namely, that you lay bare the bone a second time, either by an instrument or by caustic; and when the bone is uncovered, then take a drill like this.	0.71626616
Let the tip of the iron be triangular, and its shaft be thin and extend to the tip as sometimes like this.	Its extremity, which is of iron, should be triangular; and its wooden handle should be conical in shape, and, as you see, tapering to the extremity.	0.6515329
Then place it on the bone, near the lacrimal; extend your hand a little from the eye, then rotate your hand with the rasp until it penetrates the bone, and the patient feels air coming out when you touch his hand.	Then put it to the bone itself near the canthus; but keep your hand a little away from the eye; then with your hand rotate the drill till the bone is perforated; and the patient will have the sensation of this, since, if he holds his hands over his nose he will find the breath coming out through the hole.	0.8429556
Then restore the place with drying astringent medicines as instructed.	And then dress the place with styptic and stanching remedies as I have taught you.	0.71779895
Then when the flesh grows and the place is hardened, the matter which was flowing outside returns to the nose, making it lighter for the patient.	And when the flesh begins to grow and the place gets hard, the matter which before was coming outward will be turned into the nose; and this will be easier for the patient.	0.84111357
Chapter XX.	CHAPTER TWENTY.	0.7059282
On the reduction of the prominence of the eye.	On the reduction of exophthalmos.	0.64321303
When the eye protrudes completely and does not cause harm or impairment in vision, you should leave the patient, follow up, and apply cupping on the neck without scarification and suck well; then apply a liniment made of acatra, aloe, resin, and sarcocolla on the eye, and tighten the dressing on the eye with many layers.	When the whole eye is prominent and there is no reduction or impairment of vision, you should get the patient's bowels open. Then venesect him in the cephalic vein; then apply cupping vessels to his neck without scarification and draw off by gentle suction; then put to the eye a poultice made of acacia and aloes and olibanum and sarcocolla; then bandage the eye over the application with many pads.	0.8537889
The way to make the layers is to take cloths of lion hair, each cloth folded in four layers; and make those layers.	The way to make pads is to take a number of soft rags and fold each into four thicknesses.	0.72232914
Then place them one on top of the other according to the amount needed by the eye. Then tighten them with a hard cloth with strong pressure; repeat the cupping without scarification; then remove the cupping glasses and leave the eye tight day and night.	Then put them one on top of the other as the eye requires; then bind on stiff bandages over these, tying them firmly. Repeat the cupping with suction and without scarification. Then take away the cupping vessel and leave the eye bandaged a day and a night.	0.9257582
But if the binding becomes soft in the meantime, then it needs to be very tight.	If the bandaging slackens during that time, it must be tied properly.	0.6056193
Then remove the binding day and night as we have said.	Then remove the bandaging after a day and a night, as we have said.	0.911092
And if the eye is already reduced, that is good; if not, then repeat the plaster with the layers, the pressure, and the cupping until it is healed.	If you see that the eye has receded, good. Otherwise repeat the applications and pads and bandages and the cupping till it does recede.	0.7303951
Chapter XXI.	CHAPTER TWENTY-ONE.	0.6217996
On the incision of the prominence of the uveal tunic. When there is a disruption in the uveal tunic, and it protrudes and projects outside the eyelids like a grape, and distorts a person's appearance, and you want to cut it, the operation is as follows: you insert the needle at the root of the uvea from the lower part to the upper part, then place another needle with a double thread at the lacrimal part, make it penetrate and leave the first needle in its position; then cut the place of the double thread and lift the part of the uvea around the needle, and tighten it firmly.	When a rupture befalls the uveal membrane so that it swells and protrudes outside the eyelids looking like a grape, and on this account the man's features are disfigured; if you intend to cut it away the operation will be as I am about to describe. You introduce a needle to the root of the uvea from the lower to the upper segment; then you introduce another needle threaded with a double thread, from the region of the canthus major where you will perforate it; and leave the first needle in its place. Then cut the place of doubling of the doubled thread, and with it ligature that part of the excrescence around the needle and tie it well.	0.90344536
Then remove the needle and place wool soaked in egg white over the eye and leave it until the thread and the uvea fall off.	Then remove the needle and apply to the eye wool moistened with egg-white; and leave till the thread falls away with the growth.	0.8630467
Then treat the eye with what strengthens it until the wound is healed.	Then treat the eye with fortifying dressings till the wound be healed.	0.905602
Sometimes a large prominence forms in the eye and is attached all around with a circle of cloth, then it should be perforated with a fine instrument to come to the front of the eye, and let the white fluid flow, and the eye will descend and fit immediately.	Sometimes the uvea is tied all round with a circle of material so that the prominence of the eye is greatly increased. Then you perforate it with a fine scalpel going to the depth of the eye; and an albuminous humour will flow out and the eye will shrink and return at once.	0.73732615
Then tighten until it is healed.	Then bandage till healed.	0.9055178
Chapter XXII.	CHAPTER TWENTY-TWO.	0.644111
On the treatment of alconati.	On the treatment of hypopyon.	0.57624793
This disease called alconati is not anything but a fluid which is attached in the eye resembling descending water, but it is not that.	This disease which is called 'hypopyon' is a collection of pus in the eye which resembles cataract but is not so.	0.66792226
The way to treat it is to make the patient sit on a prepared and upright seat, then take his head in your hands on both sides and move it until you see the fluid come to the lower parts, and it dries and does not descend, and the vision is clear, and the patient sees things as before.	The method of operating in this disease is to make the patient sit upright on a chair before you. Take his head on either side with your hands and shake it about till you can see the pus come down; then it will be fixed and not move; and the light will pass and the patient will see things as he was before.	0.8589974
If it does not descend, you know it is water.	But if it does not come down, we know it is cataract.	0.6852982
If the descent is not prepared with what we have said, then make the patient sit between your hands and take a fine instrument and make a small incision on the panniculus towards the continuation of the conjunctiva with the corneal tunic in the circle (in the empty place), until the fluid is expelled.	But if the pus is not ready to be brought down by this method, then seat the patient in front of you; then take a fine scalpel and cut a little above the corneal tunic near the coronal junction of conjunctiva and cornea, till the pus comes out.	0.7005671
Then when it is expelled, you drip warm water into the eye in which you have mixed honey or water in which fenugreek and honey have been boiled.	When it comes out, instil warm water mixed with honey, or water boiled with fenugreek and honey.	0.8417045
Then treat it with other remedies until it is healed.	Then treat as usual till healed.	0.730564
Chapter XXII.	CHAPTER TWENTY-THREE.	0.55875945
We have already discussed the types of water in the division and which ones are appropriate to perforate, with an explanatory speech, then according to the health.	We have already mentioned in the appropriate section the varieties of cataract and those in which depression is useful, in full detail; so you may take it accurately from there.	0.58401936
Then you need to make the patient sit between your hands on a square seat and bind his healthy eye, very tightly.	You should cause the patient to sit down cross-legged before you, facing the light in full sun, and firmly bind up his sound eye.	0.6841766
Then place your left hand near the eyelid of his eye if the water is in the left eye; or with your right hand if it is the right eye.	Then lift up his eyelid with your left hand, if it be the left eye in which the humour is; or with the right hand if it be the right eye.	0.8180733
Then with your right hand take the almagda (surgical instrument), if the eye is the left; or with your left hand if the eye is the right.	Then take the couching needle in your right hand if it be the left eye; or in your left hand if it be the right eye.	0.8268041
Then place the tip of the almagda near the edge by the thickness of a ray in the white of the eye on the side of the lesser lacrimal, and push the almagda firmly and rotate your hand with it.	Then put the tip of the needle near the corona, about the thickness of a probe away, onto the white of the eye itself, on the side of the lesser canthus.	0.66086406
Then penetrate into the white of the eye and feel that the almagda has reached an empty space.	Then thrust the needle firmly in, at the same time rotating it with your hand, until it penetrates the white of the eye, and you feel that the needle has reached something empty.	0.58029556
And the measure of the path of the almagda to the front should be the measure of the space from the pupil to the edge of the blackness, which is the corona of the eye; because you will see the pupil with the vision of the eye through the clarity of the corneal tunic.	The depth the needle goes in should measure as the distance from the pupil to the edge of the iris, which is the corona of the eye; you will see the metal in the pupil itself because of the transparency of the corneal tunic.	0.75199175
Then place the almagda into the location where the water is, and pull it down once and again, and if the water descends immediately, then see that the patient recovers his vision immediately, with the almagda in his eye.	Then put the needle up to the place containing the humour; then press the point downwards time after time. If the humour comes down at once, the patient will at once see whatever his vision is opened upon while the needle is still in his eye.	0.7606753
Then let him rest a bit; if the water has descended, then place it again before removing the almagda.	Then let him rest a little while; and if the humour goes back up again depress it a second time without taking the needle out.	0.6755042
Then when it is dry and does not descend, remove the almagda easily, and rotate your hand with it little by little, then dissolve a little clear gem salt in water and wash the eye with it; then place cotton or wool soaked in rose oil and egg white on the eye and bind the healthy eye with it.	When it stays down firmly and does not come back again, gently draw the needle out, twisting it ever so slowly with your hand. Then dissolve a little pure rock-salt in water and wash the eyeball with the solution; then apply all over the outer aspect of the eye carded linen or wool moistened with oil of roses and egg-white, and bandage it up together with the sound eye.	0.8625946
But we and those of our time place over it a dressing soaked in egg white.	Now we and our contemporaries apply pounded cumin with the egg-white.	0.68634
And if the almagda does not obey you in entering the eye due to its hardness — because there are some men whose eyes are very hard —, then you need to take the instrument called alberid, which has this form:	But if the couching needle does not serve, failing to enter the eye on account of its hardness (for there are some whose eyes are hard indeed), you should take the scalpel called al-baridl figured thus.	0.7332401
And then pierce that junction with it, and do not delay your hand in the hole, but make a path for the almagda to a subtle place.	With this make a perforation in the conjunctiva only, not piercing any further; for that is only to make a little entrance for the needle.	0.5014264
Then insert the almagda as we have said.	And then thrust in the needle as we said before.	0.70219904
And after completing your work, prepare a proper sleeping place for the patient where he can sleep on his back in a dark house, and he is prohibited from all movements.	At the end of your operation, prepare a solidly-built bed on which the patient may lie on his back, in a dark room; and keep him from all movement or coughing.	0.7832514
And apply to the nature of it what will soothe his nature, and do not let his head move to the right or left at all.	And prescribe such a diet for him as will relax his system; neither let him move his head to right or to left.	0.75281733
And let the binding be according to its arrangement until the third day.	Let the bandage remain in the same position till the third day.	0.73772264
Then unbind it in that dark house and expose the weak sight, and let him see some things, then rebind it until the seventh day.	Then loosen it in the same dark room and make trial of his sight, putting before him objects to be seen; then replace the bandage till the seventh day.	0.84983087
And you should not do this at the time of treatment or immediately after the infusion. First, you need to avoid this because the water can move easily with great and forceful regard.	You should not do this at the time of treatment nor immediately after the perforation by the needle; but on the contrary you should avoid it, for intensive use of the eye causes a rapid ascent of the humour.	0.69752216
But if an abscess happens, then you need to unbind the eye before the seventh day, and correct it with what relieves the abscess.	But if an abscess occur you should unbandage the eye before the seventh day and restore it to health by those methods that allay swelling.	0.87433064
Then you release the vision and place on his face a cover to protect the vision for a few days while staying in the dark house.	When it has subsided, allow him free sight, putting over his face a dark veil beneath which his vision may be exercised for a few days while he is still in the dark room.	0.7451409
Then gradually move him out of that house and return him to his normal activities.	Then let him come out of the room gradually and take up the exercise of his business.	0.748114
And know that in the operation the student of vision is not excused at times, so be brave about the operation.	But you should know that in the case of a depression of a cataract the student cannot manage without having seen that operation performed several times; then he may perform it himself.	0.52090645
It has come to us from some of those who are in Artach, and someone said that fire is made in Ayrac with the perforated almagda by which the water is sucked out.	I have heard that a certain Iraqi has said that in Iraq he makes a hollow needle by which the humour is sucked out.	0.51225936
But however, I have not seen anyone in our land who has done this perfectly, nor is this written in any of the ancient books; it is possible that this is new.

And these are the forms of the types of magdaan (another surgical instrument) for those who do not know them:	Here are the figures of some kinds of needle for the information of those who do not know them.	0.5112872
And they should be made of brass or properly of iron, and their ends should be with this triangular subtlety, the sharp end like this is the form.	They are mostly made of brass; and their extremities should be of this very fineness, triangular at the tip and sharp.	0.71816486

On the treatment of flesh grown in the nose.	On the treatment of nasal polyp.	0.6547384
And some of it is cancerous flesh, stone-like, of dark color; and some of it is flesh not dark in color.	One of these is a thing resembling a centipede; another, a cancerous growth, stony, hard, and pale in colour; another again is a soft growth, not pale.	0.7074858
So, in that which is these non-fraudulent and non-cancerous fleshes, you must make the patient sit between your hands and face the sun, and open his nostrils, and prick your nail into those fleshes.	Any of these growths that is soft is not malignant or cancerous. You should make the patient sit before you, facing the sun, and dilate his nose and introduce a hook into these polyps and draw them out; then amputate what you can take hold of, with a fine scalpel sharp on one side, till you know that all the growth is gone.	0.6401864
And then extract it to the outer parts, and then cut what you have comprehended from it with a sharp and fine spatula from one part until you know that all the flesh has been removed; for if any part of it remains that can be excised, then scrape it with one of the fine instruments easily until no part of it remains.	And if there be anything of them left behind that you cannot cut away, then gently scrape away with any fine instrument till nothing of them remains; and if the bleeding be too much for you, or an abscess occur, then combat it by suitable means.	0.6549684
But if it rules with blood or a hot abscess occurs, then you apply what is needed to it; or if it is one of the malignant abscesses, then quickly cauterize it until the blood is stopped and all cavities are sealed.	If it be a malignant swelling, then speedily cauterize till the bleeding stops and all the polypi are gone.	0.5757859
Then put into the nose near the incision some sour wine and water or just wine. But if the nose is open and moisture flows into the palate, then you know it is healed.	Then introduce into the nose, after the incision, vinegar and water, or wine; and if the nose be free and fluid flow into the throat from it, then know that he is cured.	0.8237963
But if the moisture does not penetrate as it should, then you know that inside it is flesh growing in the highest bones of the nostrils to which excision has not reached.	But if fluid does not pass through it as it should, you may know that there is a polyp within in the upper part of the ethmoid bone where the instrument could not reach to make incision.	0.72197795
Then you need to insert a bile from which there is some thickness, and mix it with many nuts, and place between each nut the amount of a finger or less, and make the patient swallow and insert one end of the bile into the nostrils with a ray or another suitable instrument.	In this case you must take a linen thread, rather thick, and tie many knots in it with a space of a finger's breadth or less between each pair of knots; and let the patient try to get one end of the thread into his nose with a probe or anything he can, after making it into the form of a button; and let him make a full inspiration till it reaches the cartilage and comes out through the throat.	0.7929822
And after that is done, he should draw in his breath until it reaches the nasal canals and exits over his throat, because sometimes similar actions are done by children at school, and it is an easy thing for one who wants to do it.	Boys at school often do this sort of thing, and it is quite easy for anyone who wishes.	0.4889099
Then place the two ends of the bile, one end that comes out of the nose and the other that remains in the nose, and then administer a closure of flesh with the nuts that are in the bile, and do this until you know that the flesh has gone with the nuts of the bile.	Then hold together the two ends of the thread, one coming out through the mouth and the other remaining in the nose; then saw off the polyps by means of the knots in the thread ; continue doing this till you are sure that the growth has been cut off by the knotted thread.	0.8183861
Then extract the bile, and place in the nose after the blood extraction a piece of gauze, and do this for three days or more until the ointment corrodes all that remains of the flesh.	Then take out the thread and, after wiping away the blood, put into the nose a plug dipped in Egyptian ointment. Do this for three days or longer till the ointment has consumed the remnants of the polyp.	0.8673136
And at the end of the treatment, place a lead tube in the nose for some days until it is healed.	Then, last of all, insert a lead tube in the nose for a few days till healed.	0.83105797
But if you need a drying cure, use that.	If he need treatment with drying medicaments, use them.	0.74998045
And this is the form of the capipurge instrument with which oils and medicines are distilled into the nostrils:	This is the figure of the instrument for instillation by which oil or medicines are dropped into the nose.	0.6740058
Make this of silver or brass, which should be like a small open lamp, like a small bowl, and the nozzle likewise.	It should be made of silver or bronze like a small lamp, its oil-container open, and with its channel likewise.	0.83197576
And if you want, make a closed tube like a reed, and the tube of the capipurge instrument should be flat, open; with a handle on the back of it, with which you hold it when heating it in the oil or whatever you want from the juices and absorbable substances.	If you like you may make its spout closed like a reed; and the oil-container of the instrument can be made covered over. It has a handle at the end, as you see, to hold it when heating the oil or whatever juice or other liquid you wish.	0.7632036

On warts born on the ends of the nose.	On warts growing on the end of the nose.	0.8894188
Many times a wart is born on the ends of the nose, and it is enlarged and increased in some days so that it is very noticeable.	There frequently spring from the end of the nose warts that grow and increase daily till they disfigure the man.	0.63972795
And therefore you must cut it at the beginning of its appearance and eradicate all of it. Then place on the site either a cautery or burning medicine which stays on the spot.	So you should cut them out when they first appear; totally eradicate them and apply to the place cauterization, either actual or by caustic.	0.7481998
But if its excision is delayed until it is enlarged, then consider if it is hardened, hard, of dark color, and little feeling, then do not touch it with iron because it is a cancerous abscess; because many times to those who cut this abscess great malice comes upon the one who had it.	But if excision of them has been overlooked till they have grown big, then examine, and if the growth is stone-like, hard, and pale in colour, and with little sensation, do not interfere with it with an instrument, for it is a cancerous tumour. For I have often seen people cut these tumours, and great affliction resulted to the sufferer.	0.84576637
And if the abscess is of a mild touch and not of dark color, and sometimes excision is possible in all of it, then evacuate the patient and cut it without fear, and treat the site with what dries and tightens until it is healed.	But if the tumour be soft to the touch, not pale coloured, and you see it can be wholly removed, then purge the patient, and cut it off him fearlessly, and treat the place with astringents and styptics till healed.	0.7725746

On the suturing of the nose, lips, and ear when continuity is dissolved by wound or similar.	On suture of nose, lip, and ear, when there is discontinuity from a wound or the like.	0.9192282
Know that when a solution of continuity happens in one of these cartilages, little confers in that operation except in some men.	You should know that when discontinuity occurs in one of these cartilages, treatment of them rarely does any good, except in a few people.	0.853837
So, when one of these causes happens to someone, you should consider if it is a fresh wound with its blood, and then you join the two lips of the wound with suture, and then treat it until it is healed.	When such a thing happens to anyone, look carefully, and if the wound be fresh and bleeding, bring the edges of the wound together with a suture, and dress them till they are healed.	0.69397783
And if the lips of the solution of continuity are already separated, and each one is healed, then you must scrape each part of its apparent scab until blood comes out. And then join the two lips with suture and tighten them, and sprinkle over them dragon's blood and pounded incense, and place over the powder a piece of diafinicon plaster, or some other consolidating plaster, and leave it tied for two or three days, and then untie it and change the plaster and leave it until the threads by themselves are detached, and then treat with ointment until it is healed.	If the discontinuity has separated the edges, and both edges have healed, it is necessary to scrape both edges on the external skin till they bleed; then bring the edges together with a suture and dust over it dragon's blood and olibanum; and put over the powder a plaster of Palm ointment or some other of the regenerative ointments, and leave bandaged for two or three days; then unbandage and change the medicine, and let the sutures come away of themselves; and afterward dress with ointment till healed.	0.87088394
But the manner of suturing is that you join the solution of continuity either with needles as we have recounted in the suturing of the belly, or you join the solution of continuity with thread as you have been taught.	Now the manner of suturing is to close the discontinuity, either with a needle, as we describe for suture of the belly, or with a thread as we tell you there.	0.7159811

Many times it happens to many men that in the inner parts of their lips there are hard abscesses resembling grains of barley, and some of them are smaller and some are larger.	A good many people sometimes get little hard swellings inside their lips, some resembling the vetch grain; some larger, some smaller.	0.8135619
So you must turn the lips and cut each of those hardnesses from every part, and then fill the site of the excision with pounded sage until the blood is stopped, and then wash it with sour wine and treat the site with what is astringent, until it is healed.	You should invert the lip, incise all along each nodule, catch it up with a hook, and cut it away all round. Then after incising rub pounded vitriol into the places until the bleeding stops. Then let him rinse with vinegar and salt, and dress the place with styptic drugs till the wounds heal.	0.78171945

On the incision of flesh attached to the gums.	On the excision of superfluous growths on the gum.	0.61147225
Often, flesh attached to the gum grows, which the ancients called albulus, then you must suspend it with a nail or hold it with forceps and cut it down to its root, and let the pus or blood flow.	There often grows on the gum superfluous flesh which the Ancients call 'epulis'. You should take it up with a hook or grasp it with forceps and cut it at its root and let the pus or blood flow out.	0.765034
And then place on the site pounded sage or other astringent or drying powders.	Then put on the place either pounded vitriol or one of the absorbent styptic powders.	0.70713896
And if that flesh returns, then cut it again, and cauterize it, because after the cautery it will not return.	And if the growth returns after treatment—for they often return—excise a second time and cauterize; it will not come back after cauterization.	0.72702265

On the scraping of teeth with iron.	On scraping the teeth with an iron instrument.	0.86733496
When on the surface of the teeth, in the inner parts and in the outer parts, and between the gums, there are rough scales attached, loose, and sometimes they are blackened and become yellow or green, which leads to corruption in the gum and makes the teeth loose.	Sometimes there collect upon the inner and outer surface of the teeth and also between the gums, rough scales, ugly, sometimes black or yellow or green, from which corruption is communicated to the gums and thus the teeth become unsightly.	0.8559718
And so you must make the patient sit between your hands and place his head on your lap, and scrape the teeth on which those scales and sand-like substances appear until no part of them remains, and do this for the blackness, the yellowness, and the other substances until they are cleaned.	The patient should sit before you, putting his head in your lap; and you should scrape the teeth or molars on which you can discern crusts or gritty substance, till nothing remains; do them all in the like manner, black, green, yellow, and the rest, until they are all gone.	0.8141639
So if what is on them is removed from the beginning of the scraping, that is good; if not, then repeat the scraping on them the next day and the second and the third until you reach the final state you desire.	If they disappear at the first scraping, good; but if not repeat the scraping on the following day and the second and third until you attain your purpose.	0.84221935
And know that teeth require many scrapers of various forms and many shapes according to what is prepared for your operation. And because the scraper with which the tooth is scraped from the inner part is different from the scraper with which it is scraped between the teeth according to different shapes, and these shapes of scrapers should be prepared by you, which you will see shortly:	You should know that molars need scraping-tools of many diverse forms and shapes according to the character of your undertaking; for the tool with which the inner surface of the teeth is scraped differs from the tool with which the outer surface is scraped; and that for scraping between the teeth is different again. Here is a number of scrapers, all of which you will have ready by you	0.78265953
Chapter Thirty	CHAPTER THIRTY.	0.6792026
On the removal of teeth.	On the extraction of teeth.	0.94767165
You must treat the tooth's pain with all ingenuity and delay any extraction because there is no substitute once it is removed, as it is a sublime substance and excuses are necessary for its extraction.	You should treat toothache with every device and be reluctant to extract; nothing can replace the tooth when it is extracted, for it is a noble substance—until there is no means of avoiding extraction.	0.8098154
But when the patient is forced to have that tooth removed, you must be firmly certain which tooth is painful because often the pain deceives the patient into thinking it is in a healthy tooth, and you remove that one, and the pain does not cease until the actual diseased tooth is extracted, as we have seen from the work of barbers.	When the patient is determined to have it out, act with deliberation till you are sure which is the painful tooth; for often the pain deceives the patient and he thinks the pain is in a tooth that is sound, so he has that one extracted; but the pain does not abate until the diseased tooth is removed. We have frequently seen this happen in the practice of the barber-surgeons.	0.84400654
So when you are certain which tooth is painful and know it well, you must then scarify around the tooth with a spatula with some potency until it is loosened from the gum on all sides, and then move it with your fingers or with fine forceps initially little by little until you can shake it loose.	When you are quite sure which is actually the painful tooth you should cut away all round the tooth with a scalpel having a certain measure of strength, until the gum is separated all round.	0.7350466
Then place large, strong forceps firmly around the tooth, and put the patient's head between your knees to hold it securely so it doesn't move, and then pull the tooth straight out in a manner that does not break it or cause the patient greater pain.	Then, with your fingers, or with a pair of fine forceps, first move the tooth slowly and gently till you stir it; then get a good grip on it with a pair of large forceps, holding the patient's head between your knees so that it does not move. Then draw the tooth straight out so as not to splinter it.	0.7762606
And if it is not dislocated, then take one of those instruments and place it under the tooth on all sides with ease and force its removal as done initially.	And if it will not come out, then take one of these following instruments and gradually introduce it beneath the tooth all round; then try to move it as you did before.	0.81309193
But if the tooth is hollow or corroded, then you must fill that hole with cloth and tighten it with the end of a fine stick so it does not break during your constriction on it with forceps.	If the tooth has a hole in it or is decayed, you should plug the hole with a rag, forcing it in with the tip of a fine probe so that it will not break when you grip it with the forceps.	0.81635344
And you must work delicately with scarification around the gum on all sides and be very careful with your strength so you do not break it and leave part of it, and cause the patient to return with a problem worse than the initial pain.	You must completely scarify all round the gum. Take the utmost care not to splinter the tooth lest a piece should remain behind and arouse the patient's ills afresh, causing greater pain than before.	0.75847775
And be careful not to do what some ignorant barbers do in their haste and boldness with their extractions, not administering what we have recommended; because often they cause patients great ailments which are more difficult to cure than broken teeth, leaving the roots behind, or extracting the tooth with parts of the jawbone as we have often seen.	Take care not to do those things that the ignorant barber-surgeons do in their rashness and haste in dental extraction, neglecting to employ the methods we describe. For they often bring great troubles upon people, the least of which is to break the tooth off short, leaving the whole or part of the root behind; or to remove the tooth together with a piece of the jaw bone, as I have often seen.	0.83463085
And after the extraction, the mouth should be washed with warm wine or sour wine with salt.	Then after the extraction let the patient rinse with wine or vinegar and salt.	0.69036496
And if there are blood flows because of this, as often happens, then crush some amount of sage and sprinkle it over the wound, and if that does not help, cauterize.	If there occur haemorrhage from the place—a common occurrence—then pound up a little vitriol and stuff the place with it. If the vitriol does not avail, cauterize.	0.69042385
The shape of the forceps and fine tongs with which the tooth is initially moved should be of long extremity, short handle, and thick, so they do not bend when you work with them.	The shape of the fine forceps with which you first move the tooth should be with long jaws and a short handle, thick, lest they bend when you take hold of the tooth.	0.92464674
And they should also be with thick handles so that when you squeeze them they do not bend, and should have short extremities.	As you see, they have thick handles so that when you apply pressure with them they do not give or bend; and short jaws.	0.6685296
And they should be made of Indian iron properly made with straight extremities, and at the ends of them should be teeth which interlock with each other and tighten with strong constriction, and sometimes the ends should be in the shape of the beak of a bird called a stork, that is, a crane, and are for strong constriction.	They should be of Indian iron or of steel, strongly made, the jaws tempered and having teeth fitting into each other so that a sure and firm grip may be obtained. Sometimes the jaws are made like a file, also to give a strong grip.	0.7684047

On the extraction of teeth and the removal of fractured jaw bones.	On the extraction of roots and of broken pieces of mandible.	0.7564454
When after the extraction of a tooth that is broken some part remains, you must place cotton with alum on the site for a day or two until the site is softened; then introduce a tool or forceps whose ends are shaped like the beak of a bird called a stork or crane, the shape of the forceps:	When, in extracting a tooth, a broken-off root remains behind, you should apply to the place cotton wool soaked in butter for one or two days to soften it; then insert the tongs or forceps with stork-bill jaws; this is the figure of the forceps.	0.80073285
Their ends should be made like a file or rasp inside.	The point should be made like a file or rasp on the inside.	0.84354186
And if it does not yield to you easily with these forceps or tongs, then you must dig around the root and uncover all the flesh and introduce the instrument called "atali," which is a small lever, the shape of which is this:	If it does not respond to your attempt to extract it with these forceps, you must dig down over the root and remove all the flesh, and then insert the instrument that resembles a small crowbar; this is its figure.	0.6633076
And it should have a short, thick end and not be soaked so that it does not break.	It has a short rather thick extremity, and should not be tempered lest it fracture.	0.7962168
So if by this the root is extracted, it is good; if not, help yourself with these other instruments, the shapes of which are: the first instrument's shape is of a triangular end with some thickness:	If the root comes out, good; if not, get assistance from the other instruments figured here. First, with a triangular point, somewhat stout.	0.7868034
The shape of the second instrument is that it should be triangular and with a finer end.	Another, triangular and slender.	0.49259162
and with other instruments which are predecessors in the shaving of teeth; because aid is made with this instrument which is shaped like a large hook, and this is the shape:	Sometimes also we get help from this forked instrument and beside this, from other instruments and appliances mentioned above under scraping of teeth. Sometimes also recourse may be had to this instrument resembling a large hook, figured thus.	0.6373642
of a triangular end bent or short, which has some thickness, and should not be soaked so it does not break.	The hooked extremity is triangular in section, of some thickness lest it break, not tempered.	0.7662453
And further know that the instruments for teeth are many and similarly the other instruments.	You should know that dental instruments are very numerous, as are the other instruments, almost beyond reckoning.	0.7657602
But the wise and subtle craftsman in the art finds for himself according to what the operation and the various diseases signify to him; because there are ailments for which the ancients did not speak nor placed proper instruments, due to their diverse shapes.	And the experienced worker with a knowledge of his craft may devise fresh instruments according as his work on actual cases suggests them to him. For there are certain diseases for which the Ancients did not mention any instruments, on account of the variety of them.	0.7559343
But if the jawbone or other bones of the mouth are broken or decayed, then care should be taken on that spot with the appropriate instruments and forceps we have mentioned in the extraction of the tooth roots, and help yourself with a tool of which this is the shape:	Now if the mandible or one of the bones of the mouth be broken or decayed, explore the site with some instrument that is suitable for it, namely one of the instruments or forceps mentioned for extraction of roots. We also make use of forceps of this form.	0.79696065
And it should have some thickness, little by little, and should be tightened or held with the mouth so it does not escape or flee until the entire bone is extracted; and then restore the site with appropriate medicines for that.	They are fairly thick, to grip the bone firmly lest it slip before the bone has been got out. Then cicatrize the place with suitable drugs.	0.6334531
But if there is a small decay in the bone, then scrape that decay and its blackness, and treat it until it is healed.	If the bone is only slightly decayed, scrape it clean of its decay and blackness, then dress till healed.	0.71925855

On the treatment of teeth that are prominent over the others.	On the sawing-down of teeth growing on top of others.	0.71285415
When teeth are prominent not according to their natural alignment, this affects their appearance, especially when it happens to women, particularly venerable young girls; then you must consider: if a tooth is born next to another tooth and cannot be moved or aligned, then remove that one; but if it is not attached to another tooth, then you incise it with this instrument, the shape of which is this; and it resembles a pig’s snout, and should be made of Indian iron with a very sharp end.	When teeth grow in other than their natural place the appearance is very bad, specially when it occurs in women or slaves. So you should examine; if the tooth has grown out behind another tooth and it is impossible either to saw or file it down, then extract it. But if it be attached to another tooth, cut it down with an instrument of this kind. It resembles a small chisel and should be of Indian steel with a well-sharpened end.	0.8611806
And your incision, with which you cut it, should be over several days due to the hardness of the tooth, and ensure that no other teeth are disturbed.	You should spread your cutting with it over several days on account of the hardness of the tooth and so as to leave the others undisturbed.	0.7625679
And if it is a prominent tooth exposed to filing, then file it with an Indian iron file, the shape of which is this:	If the tooth projects in such a way as to make filing possible, use a file of Indian iron, shaped like this.	0.70489764
And it should be entirely of Indian iron and easy to handle; and it should have many small points like a file used to make needles, with which the tooth should be filed little by little over many days with ease, so that no other teeth are disturbed and loosened. And then smooth it at the end and scrape it with some scrapers.	It should be wholly manufactured of Indian iron, its handle too, and covered with very fine points to resemble the file used in making needles. You should file the tooth with it very slowly and gently over a period of many days so as not to shift the tooth and cause it to fall out; then finally smooth it and scrape it with one of the scrapers.	0.864237
And if it is a tooth, part of which is broken and injures the tongue, then you must file it until the roughness of that fracture is removed and smoothed, and it should be evened out so that it does not injure the tongue or disrupt speech.	If it be a tooth of which part has broken off and it hurts the tongue in speaking, file it down till you have disposed of the roughness of the break and the tooth is smooth and neither injures the tongue nor hinders speech.	0.8777671

On the restoration of damaged teeth with gold or silver wire.	On interlacing loose teeth with silver or gold wire.	0.87215376
When the front teeth are concussed and loose due to a blow or a fall, and the patient cannot bite on food, and you have treated it with astringent medicines, and your treatment has not worked, then to prevent them from falling out, they should be bound with gold wire and not silver, because silver turns green and then decays within a few days, but gold never changes.	When the front teeth are loosened by some blow or fall and the patient cannot bite upon what he is eating lest they fall out, and you have without avail treated them with styptic medicines, the technique in this case is to bind the teeth with gold or silver wire. Gold is the better, for silver oxidizes and corrodes after some days, but gold remains for ever in its state and does not suffer this change.	0.8736321
And the wire should be of such subtlety and thickness according to the quantity that it can fit between the teeth; and the method of its weaving is that you take the wire and pass it twice between two healthy teeth, and then twist it twice between two loose teeth, or between one or many, until it reaches a healthy tooth on the other side. And then repeat the weaving back to the side from which you started, and tighten it with ease and wisdom so that it does not become loose.	The wire should be moderate in thickness in accordance with the distance between the teeth. The method is to take the wire and run it doubled between two sound teeth; then with the two ends of the wire you weave between the loose teeth, either one or several, until you bring your weaving to a sound tooth on the other side; then you repeat your weaving back to the side whence you began; tighten it gently and judiciously till they do not move at all.	0.90362513
And your tightening should be such that you secure the wire to the roots of the teeth so that it does not slip.	You should tie the wire at the root of the teeth lest it slip.	0.7450292
And then cut off the excess ends of the wire with forceps or scissors, and tuck them in at each place with a tool, and conceal them between the healthy tooth and the loose tooth, so that it does not injure the tongue. And then leave it thus tightened as it is.	Then with the scissors cut off the two ends of the wire remaining over, and bring them together and twist them with forceps and hide them between a sound tooth and a loose tooth so as to not injure the tongue; then for the future leave them thus bound.	0.8261821
But if it becomes loose or broken, tighten it again or them with another wire in such a manner for all time.	But if it comes undone or breaks, bind them with another wire; so may he have the use of them all his life.	0.7691705
And this is the shape of the teeth and the figure of the weaving of two healthy teeth and two loose ones, as these times are bound:	This is a figure of the teeth and the manner of interlacing two sound and two loose teeth, as you see.	0.71057785
And when it happens that one or two teeth return to their places due to each one’s fall, and they grow back as we have described, and they remain.	After one or two teeth have fallen out they may be restored to their place and bound in as instructed, and become permanent.	0.65969515
And no one does this but a good and wise craftsman.	This can be done only by an expert and gentle practitioner.	0.6270143
And sometimes a piece of cow bone is fitted and shaped like a tooth, and placed in the spot where a tooth is missing, and it is secured as we have said, and remains and serves for a long time.	Sometimes a piece of ox-bone may be carved and made into the shape of a tooth, and placed in the site where a tooth was lost, and fastened as we have said, and it will last and he will get long service from it.	0.90516067

And the procedure for it is that you open the patient’s mouth, their head resting in your lap; and lift their tongue, and then you cut that nerve binding according to the width needed to free the tongue from its restriction.	The operation for it is to open the patient's mouth, having his head in your lap, and lift his tongue; then cut that sinew-like ligament transversely till the tongue is freed from its hold.	0.8544609
But if there is any hardness or thickening in it, and this is due to the consolidation of a wound, then you take a hook and cut it by the width necessary until you have cut the binding and the thickening is dissolved.	If it is hard and nodular, arising from scarring after an injury, catch it with a hook and slit it transversely until the ligament is severed and the knots undone.	0.6594317
And be careful not to make a fissure in the fleshy part and that you cut here gradually so that a flow of blood does not occur.	Beware of making the incision deeply into the flesh, or you may cut an artery there and haemorrhage may occur.	0.66894466
And then the incision site should be washed with rose water or vinegar or cold water; and then place under the tongue licini; this is a piece of linen that the patient keeps under their tongue each night so that it does not consolidate again.	After the cutting, let him rinse with rose-water or vinegar and cold water. Then put under the tongue a pad of linen, which the patient must keep in position at night to prevent the adhesion from forming again.	0.78161895
But if a flow of blood occurs, place crushed vitriol on the site; but if the blood continues, then cauterize the site with an appropriate cautery iron. And then treat it with other remedies until it is healed.	If there should be haemorrhage, put pounded vitriol on the place; and if bleeding still prevails burn the spot with a lenticular cautery of suitable size and treat in the usual way till healed.	0.7847514

Sometimes an abscess resembling a small nut occurs under the tongue, preventing the tongue from performing its natural functions; and very quickly it grows large until it fills the mouth.	Sometimes there occurs under the tongue a swelling resembling a small frog, which hinders the natural movements of the tongue; sometimes it grows so as even to fill the mouth.	0.8699794
And the procedure for it is that you open the patient’s mouth seated facing the sun and examine the abscess.	The operation for it is to open the patient's mouth in the full light of the sun and inspect the tumour.	0.8141036
And if you see it is dark or black, hard, and the patient does not feel it, then do not touch it because it is cancerous.	If you see that it is dark or black, and hard, and the patient has no sensation in it, do not interfere with it, for it is a cancer.	0.8966557
And if it is leaning towards whiteness, in which there is moisture, then you place the hook in it, and cut it with a thin blade, and cut it in all parts; and if blood comes to you during the operation, then you place powdered vitriol on it until the bleeding is stopped.	But if it is inclined to be pale and has fluid in it, put a hook in it and incise it with a fine scalpel and free it all round; and if haemorrhage hinders you while operating apply pounded vitriol to it till the bleeding stops.	0.8152736
And then return to your work until you have completed it, until it is washed with vinegar and salt; and treat it with other remedies until it is healed.	Then proceed with your work till all is extracted; then let him rinse his mouth out with vinegar and salt. Then give all the suitable treatment till healed.	0.8317025

On the extraction of an abscess from both tonsils and those that arise in the throat and other abscesses.	On the treatment of swelling of the tonsils and other swellings in the throat.	0.7241764
When a hollow abscess occurs in the throat, it is from glands that are like wool, which occur outside and are called tonsils, which when you treat them with what we have said in the division and it is not healed, then you consider if the abscess is hard, dark, with little feeling, then do not touch it with iron.	Sometimes there occur in the throat buboes called 'tonsils', which resemble the buboes occurring externally. When you have employed the remedies described in their own place, without effect, examine, and if the tumour be hard, dark coloured, and devoid of sensation, do not touch it with an instrument.	0.74552596
And if it is red and its root is thick, then do not touch it with iron due to the blood flow; instead, leave it until it is mature, and then either you will pierce it or it will rupture by itself.	If it be of a red colour, with a thick root, do not touch this with an instrument either, for fear of a haemorrhage; but let it be till it come to a head; then you may perforate it or let it burst of its own accord.	0.7891238
And if it is white, round, and its root is thin, then that is the one that needs to be cut.	But if it be pale coloured, round, with a slender pedicle, this is the kind that should be cut.	0.73669016
And the procedure for it is that you consider, before your operation, if the abscess has already rested in a cool place with complete rest or if it has diminished somewhat; and then you have the patient sit facing the sun, and their head in your lap, and open their mouth, and the assistant holding their tongue down with a noble instrument of which this is the form:	The operation for this is first to see, before operating, whether his inflamed tumour has already completely subsided or to some extent diminished. Then make the patient sit down in the full light of the sun with his head in your lap; open his mouth; and have an assistant before you to press back the tongue with an instrument like this.	0.86161524
And it should be made of silver or brass, and be thin like a knife.	It should be made of bronze or silver, and slender like a knife.	0.8989948
Then when you press down with it on the tongue and the abscess is shown to you, and you look over it, then take a hook and put it in the tonsil, and pull it outward as much as you can. After you pull some of the tissue, then cut it with an instrument of which this is the form:	And when the tongue is depressed with its help, the tumour will be made manifest to you and your direct vision will fall upon it. Then take a hook and fix it in one tonsil and pull it forward as far as it will go; but be careful to not pull away with it any of the mucosa.	0.7132728
After you pull some of the tissue, then cut it with an instrument of which this is the form: It is like forceps, but the ends are curved, so that the opening of each is towards the other, very sharp, made of well-tempered iron.	Then cut it with an instrument of this form; it is like scissors except that its extremities are curved, the beak of each meeting the other, and very sharp.	0.68854225
But if this instrument is not present with you, then cut it with a blade of which this is the form: And it should be sharp on one side, not sharp on the other side.	If you have not this kind of instrument, cut it with a scalpel of this form, on the one side sharp, on the other quite blunt.	0.6676058
And after you have cut one tonsil, cut the other in the same manner, and after the incision, the patient should gargle with cold water.	And when one tonsil has been cut away, remove the other in exactly the same manner. Then after the excision let the patient gargle with cold water or vinegar and water.	0.8201819
But if bleeding occurs, gargle with a decoction of pomegranate peel or myrtle leaves and similar astringent substances until the bleeding is stopped, and then treat it until it is healed.	But if there occur a haemorrhage let him gargle with water in which have been boiled pomegranate peel or myrtle leaves or similar styptics till the haemorrhage is stanched; then treat till healed.	0.85235727
And sometimes other abscesses appear in the throat besides those two tonsils, and cut them as I have said in the cutting of the two tonsils equally.	Sometimes there grow in the fauces tumours other than the tonsils; remove them just as described for tonsils.	0.6374131
And I once treated a woman with an abscess that had grown in her throat, which was dark in color, with little sensation, which had already closed off her throat, and the woman was breathing with difficulty, and she could neither eat nor drink water, and she would have died if it had lasted another day or two.	I once treated a woman for a tumour that had grown in her throat and was rather dark in colour and had little sensation. It had almost blocked the throat and the woman had only a narrow opening to breathe through, and was quite prevented from eating or drinking, so that she was at death's door, if she had so remained for a day or two.	0.833555
And the abscess had grown so much that it had formed two branches, coming out through two openings.	From the tumour there arose two offshoots, which had eventually emerged through the nostrils.	0.620881
So I hastened surgically and inserted a hook into one of them, and pulled it, and a large portion came out, and then I cut it where I could see from the other opening, and then I opened her mouth, and held her tongue, and then I inserted the hook into that abscess.	So I made the utmost haste and, fixing a hook in one of them, drew it forward, and out came a sizeable piece. Then I cut it off where I had hold of it near the nostril. Then I did the same with the one projecting from the other nostril.	0.8384342
And then I cut out a large portion of it, and only a little blood flowed from it. Then the woman’s throat was cleared, and she began to drink water immediately, and then took food, and I continued cutting that abscess many times over a long period, and an abscess would form in its place, which I would cut until it was prolonged.	Then I opened her mouth and depressed the tongue; then fastened the hook in the tumour itself and cut off a part of it, with only a little haemorrhage; and the woman's pharynx was freed and immediately she had a drink of water, then took some food. And from time to time, for long after, I continued to cut away this tumour.	0.8575095
Then I took a tool and cauterized her throat, and it ceased to form; and then I departed and did not know what God did with her afterward.	Then I went about it astutely and cauterized the tumour high up in the throat, and it stopped growing. Then the woman left the district and I do not know what God has done with her since I had charge of her.	0.77195144

On the cutting of the uvula when it is abscessed.	On removal of the tumour of the uvula that is called 'uva'.	0.57400644
When catarrh descends to the uvula, and it becomes abscessed and elongated, it is called perpendicular; and if it is swollen and round at the bottom, then it is called buba.	When a flux descends to the uvula and it swells and the uvula becomes white and elongated, then it is called 'columella*. And if it should be swollen below and rounded then it is called 'uva'.	0.8072783
But when it is treated with what we have said in the division, and your treatment does not help, and then sometimes the abscess is delicate and should be removed, then it is necessary to cut that which is swollen and round; and if it is elongated, and is bloody, dark in color or black, and has no feeling, then it is necessary to attempt its incision, because there is a danger for the patient in it.	When it has been treated as mentioned in its section, and the treatment is unavailing, and you see the inflamed tumour subsiding and the uvula becoming thin, you should amputate it. Now those of them that are bunched up and rounded and not elongated, full of blood, or of a dark colour or black, and without sensation, these you should avoid incising; for this course is dangerous for the patient.	0.81710166
And when you see it as I have said, its whiteness and length, that you have the patient sit and press down his tongue with an instrument of which I have described its form, and then place a hook in the uvula, and pull it down and cut it with one of the two instruments which I have mentioned in the cutting of the two tonsils.	But when you see them as I have described, somewhat pale and elongated, get the patient to sit in the sunlight and depress his tongue with the instrument described above; then take hold of the uva with a hook and draw it down and cut it off with one of the two instruments described for excision of the tonsils.	0.78297246
And it is necessary that you do not cut more than what is attached beyond the natural boundary, because if you cut more, you will harm his speech.	You should not cut away more than up to the natural limit. For if you cut more off you cause injury to the voice and speech.	0.75434387
And after the incision, use what I have recommended in the cutting of the two tonsils, and treat it until it is healed.	Then, after excising, carry on the treatment on the lines described under removal of the tonsils, and treat till healed.	0.6980879
But if the patient is frightened by the incision, it is necessary to use a method of cauterization without fear, and the manner of cauterization here is with strong water, and it is that you place the patient’s head in your lap, and press down his tongue with the instrument we have mentioned, and then take the water which we have described in the chapter on cauterization, and apply it to the living tissue, and place it neither thick nor thin, and with it fill the concavity of the instrument of which this is the form:	But if the patient flinch from operation, then you must contrive to cauterize it, fearlessly and boldly. The method is to employ a caustic; you put the patient's head in your lap; then, having depressed the tongue with the instrument described above, take some of the corrosive fluid mentioned in the book on cauterization, make it up with quicklime to a medium consistency, and fill with it the hollow in this instrument, whose form is thus.	0.84584105
Its extremity should be concave, where the medicine is placed just like the concavity of a spoon, and place the instrument with the medicine on the uvula, and the patient should lie on his side so that saliva or mucus does not run from his mouth from the internal medicine, so that nothing descends from it onto his throat and injures it.	The end of it where you put the caustic should have a hollow like that of the spoon of a spoonprobe. With the patient lying on his side, letting the mucous secretions flow from his gullet out of his mouth so that none of the corrosive may run down his gullet and cause harm, you place the instrument right on the uvula.	0.8197628
And then hold the medicine with your hand, and squeeze it onto the uvula for the space of half an hour until you see it become blackened and calmed by the bite of the medicine.	Then, steadying the hand that is holding the medicament, press it out on to the uvula for the space of half an hour until you see the uvula turn black and the corrosive action cease.	0.90355897
And if you wish, take cotton and wrap it around the end of a probe, and dip the cotton in the medicine, and insert the probe with the cotton into a tube so that the cotton adheres to the tube, and do this as many times as needed until you achieve what you want with the cauterization of the uvula, and then leave it as it will dry and fall off in about three or four days.	If you wish, you can take some cotton wool twisted on the end of a probe, and, having soaked it in the caustic, apply the probe with the wool, down through a cannula till the wool sticks on the uvula. Do this over and over again till you have done all the cauterization you want, then let be; for it will shrink and fall off in three or four days.	0.8584939
And if it is necessary to repeat the medicine, repeat it, and after the cauterization clean around the uvula with cotton soaked in rose water, and cleanse with it what is around it from the medicine, and wash it with cold water, and treat externally with ointment, and internally with gargles until it is healed.	If you need to repeat the treatment, do so. After the cauterization, wipe all round the uvula with wool soaked in butter, and with that mop up all the caustic remaining round about it. Then let him rinse his mouth out with cold water and do you treat with external embrocations, and gargles within, till he is well.	0.82890284
And this type of treatment is safer than incision and less frightening.	This kind of treatment is safer than incision and less to be feared.	0.92322797
Sometimes the uvula is treated with something more subtle than cautery and incision, because it is treated with fumigation in this manner: take calamint, hyssop, oregano, rue, dried Arabic gum, chamomile, fenugreek and similar herbs, and mix all these ingredients, or some of them, in a pot, and submerge them with vinegar, and boil; and the pot should be well sealed with suitable luting, and in the middle of the pot there should be a hole, over which a concave instrument made of bronze is placed in this manner; it can be made of silver or bronze.	Sometimes uva is cured by a method milder than either incision or cautery, namely by means of vapour in the following manner: take pennyroyal and artemisia absinthium and organy and rue and wormwood and chamomile and southernwood and similar herbs and put them all, or some of them, in a pot, cover them with vinegar, and boil them.	0.7821566
And place the extremity in the patient’s mouth so that the vapor rises to the uvula through the tube, until the uvula is very fumigated.	The pot should be luted with clay; and there is to be a hole in the middle of the lid to which is fitted a hollow instrument like this, made of silver or bronze, and the end in which is the protuberance should be put in the patient's mouth so that the vapour passes up the tube to the uvula, which becomes of a very dark colour. Do this repeatedly till it sloughs away.	0.5433192
And then repeat this many times until it is dry, and be careful not to do this treatment at the beginning of the abscess, because it would add too much to the abscess, and it is not suitable to do this until after the abscess has been clarified.	Do this repeatedly till it sloughs away. Be careful not to apply this treatment at the first appearance of the tumour, for often you will aggravate the tumour; but you should do it at the decline of the inflammation.	0.671773
But if this instrument is not present, then take a reed and attach an eggshell to the end of it, so that the patient's mouth is not burned, because the eggshell prevents the vapor from burning the mouth.	If you do not have this instrument, take a reed and fit an egg-shell on the end so that the patient's mouth is not burned; for the egg-shell will prevent the heat of the vapour from burning the mouth.	0.9141983
And this treatment is beneficial for health.	This is a really good and safe treatment.	0.59906256

Many times a fishbone or some other cause gets stuck in the throat.	There often sticks in the throat a bone or fish-bone or something else.	0.80116427
Then you must extract whatever is visible, which you can see when you press the tongue with an instrument in the sunlight, so that you can clearly see what is in the throat.	After you have depressed the tongue with the instrument in the full light of the sun, so that what is stuck in the throat is made as conspicuous as possible, you should then remove whatever can be seen and comes into view.	0.7544766
And for what does not appear and is hidden in the throat, make the patient vomit before food is digested in the stomach, because very often the cause stuck in the throat will be expelled by vomiting; or the patient should swallow a piece of turnip or lettuce root or a piece of dry bread; or take a piece of dry sea sponge, tie it firmly with thread, and have the patient swallow it, because when it reaches the place where the thorns are, it will be pulled out, and then they will be expelled.	But when it is not visible to you, and lies hidden in the throat, you should make the patient vomit before the food in his stomach is digested, for often the object comes out with vomiting.	0.6591332
And also take an eel and tie it with thread, place it inside and then pull it out gently; or take a leek, insert it gently, and then pull it out gently.	Or let him swallow a piece of turnip or a heart of lettuce or a morsel of dry bread; or take a marine sponge, dry, and tie it on a thread; then let him swallow the sponge and when it reaches where the sharp body is then quickly pull on the thread.	0.6545667
But if they are not expelled with the methods we have described, then use an instrument made of lead in this form:	If it does not come out by the methods described, in this case employ an instrument made of lead, thus.	0.7930993
It should be a bit thicker than a rod, and at the end it should be concave, which you can easily insert into the throat.	It should be a little thicker than a probe, with a crook at its extremity.	0.6682032
And the patient should have their head elevated, and be careful that touching the bone of the throat, so that it does not become inflamed by the bone or the thorn, or that the doctor handles it with his hand.	The patient himself should introduce it into his own throat gently; he should raise the head backwards and take care not to touch the larynx lest coughing be aroused. And let him remove therewith the bone or sharp body.	0.76612556
But it is better if the patient inserts it themselves, due to their knowledge of the location of the stuck object, and they push downwards and pull their hand with the instrument upwards, all according to the amount necessary until it is expelled.	Or else let the doctor introduce it with his hand (although it is better if the patient himself introduce it, since he knows the site of the obstruction) and push it down and then draw up his hand with the instrument; all this according to the way it presents itself to him, till it is removed.	0.7237018

On the extraction of leeches stuck in the throat.	On the removal of a leech sticking in the throat.	0.8858024
When a leech is treated with what we have mentioned in the division of treatment with medicines and it does not help, then look in the patient's throat in the sunlight, after you have pressed down their tongue with the instrument we have described.	When you treat a leech by the medical means spoken of in the appropriate section, with no effect, then inspect the patient's throat in full sunlight after depressing the tongue with the instrument I have described.	0.83779585
So if you see the leech, extract it with a small hook or with delicate gestures properly.	If your gaze falls upon the leech, pull it out at once with a small hook or a fine pair of forceps.	0.6784507
And if it is not possible to extract it with that, then take a concave tube and insert it into the patient's throat, and place a heated iron in the concavity of the tube, and do this as many times as necessary (until the leech is dead and falls off from the throat) and the patient should abstain from water all day.	But if you cannot get hold of it, take a cannula and introduce it into the patient's mouth near the leech, then pass through the cannula a red-hot iron; do this repeatedly; while the patient must not drink at all that day.	0.7349456
And then take a glass full of cold water, and rinse the mouth with it; and do not swallow any of it and wet the mouth with the water every hour with the hand, because the leech will fall as soon as it senses the water.	Then let him take a vessel full of cold water, open his mouth in it and rinse out with it, but let him not swallow a drop of it; and he should keep the movement of the water going by hand time after time; for the leech straightway falls off when it feels the water.	0.8472742
But if it is not expelled with what we have mentioned, then fumigate the patient with cumin or asafoetida with the instrument we have described in the fumigation of the uvula.	If it does not come away by these means, fumigate the patient's throat with urine or with the juice of asafoetida, using the instrument described for fumigating the uvula.	0.78153944
Do this, so that it will fall off.	Do this several times, for then it will fall away.	0.6390033
And there is another method of operation in fumigation of that, which is that you take a pot in which there are burning coals and the pot is covered with a lid in the middle of which there is a hole, and the extremity of the instrument is placed in that hole; and then do the fumigation; and the patient places their mouth on the end of the tube, and closes their mouth so that the fumigation is not expelled until you know that the fumigation has reached the leech, because the leech will fall off soon.	In fumigating, this is the way to set about it: take a pot containing live coals, fitted with a lid and a hole in the middle of the lid into which is fitted the end of the instrument. Then put in the aromatic; and the patient should apply his mouth to the end of the cannula, with his mouth closed to prevent the escape of the vapour, until he knows that the vapour has reached his throat; for the leech will at once come away.	0.87019473
And if it does not fall off, then repeat the fumigation many times, and the patient should abstain from drinking, and eat salty foods and garlic, and not drink water, and with this regimen it is necessary that it will be expelled.	But if it does not come away, let the inhalation be repeated many times. Let the patient endure his thirst, and eat salty food and garlic and drink no water. It will inevitably be removed by this treatment.	0.84676766
And this is the shape of the instrument with which the leech is extracted from the throat when it is visible; and it is similar to forceps as seen, except that it has a certain curvature:	This is the figure of an instrument for extracting the leech from the throat when visible. It resembles forceps, as you see, except that it has this bend for entry into the throat; and the two extremities are shaped like a bird's bill, with the roughness of a file.	0.76835644
which is placed in the throat, and its extremity is like a stork's beak, which is toothed, so that when it grasps something, it does not let it go.	It is a wide ring of iron, of such a size as to go into the mouth above the tongue. It is inserted into the mouth standing on its side, and the mouth stays open without the patient's volition; nor can he dislodge it at all until you turn it.	0.5783785
Chapter 40.	CHAPTER FORTY.	0.6848998
In which the essence of the discourse on the opening of abscesses and their incision is discussed.	A general dissertation on the perforation and incision of tumours.	0.5225642
Abscesses come in many types, in many ways, as recalled in each case in this book.	The kinds of tumour are many and various, as will be mentioned in order in this book.	0.7762844
And they differ in perforation and incision in two ways, one by the type of abscess itself; and by what we understand about the humors.	They differ in the way they are to be perforated or incised, according to two criteria. One is the kind of tumour it is in itself and the humidities it contains.	0.7261994
And the second way is according to the places on the body where they occur, because an abscess occurring on the head is different from one occurring on the buttocks; and an abscess in a fleshy part is different from one in a joint; and each has its specific treatment.	The other is the part of the body where it occurs. For the tumour occurring in the head is different from the tumour occurring on the posterior, and a tumour occurring in a fleshy part differs from one on the joints; each having its separate category of operation.	0.86903733
And some abscesses should not be perforated until the pus in them has matured or they are fully developed.	There are some tumours that should not be opened till after the pus in them is matured and ripe.	0.71665525
There are other abscesses that need to be perforated when they are still raw and not fully mature, such as abscesses near joints, because when an abscess is near a joint, it can prolong its presence until it rots the surrounding area, and soon the ligaments or nerves of that joint are corrupted, causing contraction of that limb; or it is near a vital organ, and if you delay perforation until it matures, it will harm the vital organ; or it is near the buttocks, then perforate it even if it is not mature; and you should not perforate it raw if it is not fully digested, except for the one near the buttocks, so that the core does not rot and spread to the internal parts of the buttocks, forming a fistula, or making it incurable. But you must know the right time for perforating an abscess, and that is when it is matured.	But others should be opened when still raw and immature, such as a tumour near the joints. For when a tumour occurring near a joint lasts long enough to putrefy its surroundings, it often breaks down the ligaments or the tendons of the joint and causes paralysis in the limb. Or if the tumour be near a major organ, if you delay the opening of it until it ripens you will damage that major organ. In the same way, if it be near the anus you must open it, although unripe for opening.	0.87862986
And you know it is matured when the pain subsides and the fever ceases, and also the reduction in redness and throbbing, the softening of the head of the abscess, and other signs.	It is necessary too to know the time to open fully mature swellings: it is when the pain of the swelling is lessened, the fever departs, the redness and the throbbing are reduced, and the head of the abscess becomes wrinkled, with other signs.	0.6911965
And you must know that the perforation should be at the lowest part of the abscess for better drainage.	The perforation should be made in the lower part of the swelling if possible, so that the pus may more easily drain downwards; or else in the thinnest and most swollen part of the swelling.	0.5623014
And perforation should always be along the length of the flesh or body, if the abscesses are in the parts of the hands or feet, and in the location of the muscles, tendons, or arteries; and finally, in all areas where there is no reflection; because in those that are reflected, perform perforation according to the nature of that part.	Your incision should be longitudinal if the swellings are in such places as hands or feet or in the site of joints, tendons, nerves, or arteries; and, in short, in all flat places where there is no curvature. In curved places let the perforation proceed according to the place.	0.81976295
But when the abscess is in a fleshy area, it is better to delay the perforation until digestion is confirmed, as we have said; because if you perforate it before that, the abscess will prolong its course with much filth, and soon the lips of the wound will harden and deepen.	But when the swelling is in the fleshy parts it is best to leave the perforation, as we have said, until it is fully matured. For if you perforate it prematurely the sanious discharge will go on longer and will be excessively foul; and often both the edges and the depths of the opening will become indurated.	0.841093
But some abscesses are perforated according to the width of the flesh or body as needed, or according to what the part requires.	Some swellings are perforated latitudinally if necessary, or having regard to the requirement of the part.	0.6814035
And you should make a small perforation for small abscesses, and large, wide perforations or many incisions for large abscesses, according to their size.	In small swellings you should use a single perforation; while in large ones you should use wide or multiple perforations according to the size of the swelling.	0.75100005
And some abscesses need the skin to be scooped out and incised, like a loaf of bread that has already formed a crust, such as those that occur in carbuncles and buboes.	There are also some swellings that need a circular incision of the skin, and should be cut when they have become like a rag, and necrosed —which actually happens often in abscesses and sinuses.	0.666448
And some of these are incised with a three-angled section; and some are incised in the shape of a myrtle leaf, like the abscesses in the groin.	And there are some that should be incised triangularly; and others with an incision of myrtle-leaf form; e.g. a tumour on the groin.	0.82651657
And some of them are treated with a round section and a crescent-shaped section, and similar ones.	There are others again to which should be applied circular and lunate and similar incisions.	0.6185944
But for those without a head, like superficial abscesses, you should perforate them with a superficial or flat perforation only.	Those that have no head, such as the smooth and flat ones, should be incised with only a simple perforation.	0.72846526
And when the abscess is large and has accumulated much pus, you should perforate it and not rush to extract all the pus at once; first extract a part of it, then seal the abscess until the next day, and then extract a larger part, and continue doing this gradually until it is completely expelled.	When a swelling is large and has collected a large quantity of pus, and you perforate it, do not be in a hurry to get it all out at once; but get some of it out and then bandage it till another day; then again remove part of the pus; and so do, again and again, gradually, till it is all got out.	0.9042132
Especially if the patient is of weak strength, or a pregnant woman, or a small child, or an old person in decrepitude, because the animal spirit often dissipates with the release of the pus, and the patient can die quickly, and you harm them.	This particularly applies if the patient be in a weak state, or a pregnant woman, or a baby, or a decrepit old man; for the animal spirit is very often dissolved with the sudden evacuation of the pus, and the patient dies unexpectedly.	0.87086785
Therefore, observe this chapter with great caution, and after you perforate these abscesses, you should cleanse the wounds and consider if the wound of the abscess is small, or is a flat incision, then you should administer flax or old cotton; and if the abscess is large, and the fissures of the perforation are many, then you should place wicks in each hole so that they come together.	Be very careful therefore, with this sort. Then, after you have opened the tumour, you should cleanse the wound and consider: if the tumour has only a small opening, or it is one simple incision, employ swabs of lint or cotton wool; but if it is a large tumour with multiple incisions, introduce a swab into each incision so that they meet.	0.84478605
And if an abscess has part of the skin removed or you have scooped it out around the edges, then you should fill it with old cotton or linen thread, like when you have drawn out bread or roots, without moisture; and keep it tight until the third day; then proceed and treat it with suitable ointments until it is healed.	And if the tumour was such that you cut away a part of the skin, or sliced the tumour, you will need to pack it with cotton wool or plucked linen, dry; and bandage until the third day. Then remove it and treat with the needful ointments until healed.	0.89378184
But if there is a flow of blood at the time of your operation, then you should apply cold water and vinegar in which you soak a linen cloth, and place it over the site of the bleeding many times.	If a haemorrhage occurs while you are operating, use cold water and vinegar, soaking a lint rag in both and frequently applying it to the place.	0.7595359
But if the bleeding persists, then you should administer treatment and care and powders that I have recommended in many places in this book and in sections.	And if the bleeding still persists then it is necessary to employ the method and the treatment and the powders that we have prescribed in many parts of this book and in their own sections.	0.8278259
But if it is in winter, and the location of the abscess is a place with many nerves, then you should soak powders in hot wine and oil, and place them over the area.	Now if this should be in winter and the site of the tumour abound in nerves, you should have some pads soaked in hot wine and oil and then apply to the place.	0.85307205
And if it is summer, and the places are fleshy, then you should place powders soaked in water and oil or wine and oil, and keep them cold until the third day, as we have said, and then you should loosen the abscess and cleanse it and administer what is suitable for its healing until it is healed.	But if it be in summer and the parts be fleshy, apply the pads soaked in water and oil, or wine and oil, all being cold, till the third day, as we have said. Then unbandage the tumour and wipe it and give it the treatment suitable to it, until cured.	0.8978108
And this is what is necessary to know about the treatment of abscesses in general, but as per the method of distinction, I have already said about each abscess and the manner of its treatment in specific chapters.	This is the information you need about the treatment of tumours in general. As for the particulars, I now review the way to treat each tumour, by chapters, in detail.	0.68940985
Chapter 41.	CHAPTER FORTY-ONE.	0.59651756
On the incision of abscesses that appear on the scalp.	On opening superficial tumours of the scalp.	0.67495656
On the scalp, there are small abscesses, and these are of types of nodules that contain membranes; and their types are many.	Small swellings form in the scalp, which are of the various kinds of cyst, contained within membranes which form a capsule to them like the crop of a chicken. There are many kinds of these.	0.74739534
And some of them are soft, and some contain fluid similar to lime. And some of them contain fluid similar to dust, and similar; and some are stony, hard.	There are fatty ones, there are those containing a liquid resembling black slime, there are those containing a liquid resembling porridge and gruel and the like, while others are stony hard.	0.7664505
And in the incision of all of them, and in the extraction of them, there is no fear, because the extraction of them does not cause artery harm.	It is not dangerous to open and extract any of them, so long as you do not encounter an artery in excising them.	0.5992763
And the operation in the incision of them is that you test them with an instrument shaped like this, which is called a probe, until you know what they contain.	The operation for incising them begins by exploring them with the instrument called an explorer, figured lower down, so as to get to know what sort of contents they have.	0.70863354
For if what it contains is fluid, then you cut it with a longitudinal section as a superficial incision in this shape:	If they are the sort that contain fluid, incise them with a simple longitudinal incision, thus.	0.6699947
And start the incision from the line B to the line G. Then, when the fluid is evacuated, you remove that skin which contains the fluid, and leave none of it, because sometimes it returns if any of it remains.	Begin your incision at the letter b, to letter g; and when the humidity is emptied dissect away the capsule containing it, whole, not leaving the least remnant. For often it comes back if any has been left behind.	0.7846775
Then soak cotton in Egyptian ointment if available, or in water and salt; and fill the wound with it and leave it until the next day, as this will corrode all that remains of that skin.	Then dip some cotton wool in Egyptian ointment if you have some; if not, in saline; and pack it in the wound and leave till next day, for that will destroy the remains of the capsule.	0.8175315
And then repeat with the Egyptian ointment a second and third time if needed, until you are sure that there is no remaining cause of that skin; then treat the wound with ointment until it is healed.	Then repeat the cotton wool with Egyptian ointment a second time, or a third if need be, till it is certain there is nothing of the cyst left. Then treat the wound with ointments until healed.	0.9184983
And if the abscess contains fatty nodes, then you incise it in this shape: with a cross-shaped incision, and cut between the two lips of the incision and remove all parts, and force your skill in extracting the membrane that contains it.	If the tumour contains a fatty cyst, incise thus, a cruciform incision; then hook up the edges of the incision, dissect away every direction, and strive to extract the containing capsule.	0.6576803
But if it causes you artery problems, then do what I first advised.	If you should come across an artery, deal with it in the manner already described.	0.5229299
And similarly, do in the lithified abscess in incision and treatment as I have told you; and incision on a lithified abscess is easier, because it has little blood and little fluid.	Carry out the same manner of incision and treatment for a stony tumour, just as I have described. It is easier to open a hard tumour, for it has little blood and humidity; and sometimes these tumours on some people's heads have no humidity at all.	0.7380351
And sometimes there are some of these abscesses that are on the head in some people with whom there is no fluid; the reason is because I incised an abscess on the head of an old woman and found the abscess like a deaf stone, rough, white, which could not be cracked, and if anyone was struck with it, it would harm them.	I myself cut down upon a tumour in the head of an elderly woman and I found the tumour as hard as a stone, rough and white, which it was impossible to break, and which if thrown at anyone would have injured him.	0.66248196
But in other abscesses that occur on the head, other than this, there is this chapter, such as the abscesses that come to children's heads and near the roots of the ears, but the incision of all of these should be a superficial incision.	For all tumours arising in the head other than these, such as those which occur in children's heads and those at the root of the ear, make a simple incision.	0.6940508
And place the perforation of these at the lowest part of them so that the body is relieved of the pus to the lower parts.	You should always begin your incision from below to allow an easy downward flow for the pus.	0.4871627
And then treat those with what is appropriate for their healing.	Then treat with suitable after-treatment.	0.721256
Chapter 42.	CHAPTER FORTY-TWO.	0.6233381
On the incision of scrofulas that occur in the neck.	On the incision of scrofulous glands in the neck.	0.87111795
Many times these abscesses occur in the neck and in the armpits and in the groin; and sometimes they occur in other parts of the body.	Tumours of this kind often occur in the neck and in the axilla and in the groin; and sometimes in other parts of the body.	0.93413997
And those that occur in the neck, and there are many that are generated among them, and every scrofula among them is within its own membrane, and just as in the nodules and abscesses of the head, as we have recounted.	Those occurring in the neck are sometimes single and sometimes multiple, one arising from another; and each scrofula is contained in a capsule of its own, like the cysts and tumours of the head that we have described.	0.7865186
And the types of these scrofulas are many, for among them there are some stony, and among them there are some that contain fluid, and among them there are malignant ones that do not respond to treatment.	There are many kinds of these glands; some are stony, some contain humidities, some are malignant and do not respond to treatment.	0.74133015
And it is more careful that the vein or nerve is not incised.	Be most careful not to cut a blood-vessel or nerve.	0.7946691
And let the spatula not be very sharp, so that your hand does not slip during the incision, or disturb the patient, and you incise what is not necessary to incise; because if you incise a vein or artery and you stop your operation, then place on the wound crushed vitriol or other powders that stop the flow of blood, and tighten the wound, and leave it until the sharpness of the abscess subsides and the wound is softened and begins to putrefy.	The scalpel should not be over sharp lest you make the incision too big, or the patient flinches and so you cut open that which does not need cutting. If you cut a vein or artery and be thus hindered in your operating, apply powdered vitriol or some styptic powder to the wound, and bandage the wound and let be till the worst of the swelling has subsided and the opening is relaxed and threatens to turn purulent; for then the bleeding will stop.	0.8917513
Then return to your operation until you have completed it.	Then return to your operation and finish it.	0.8627537
And then, inquire with your index finger if there remains any cause from the other small scrofulas, then incise those and clean them.	Then feel with your forefinger to see if there are any small glands left, in which case dissect and clean them away.	0.79365826
And if there is a large vein at the root of the scrofula, it is appropriate then that you do not incise that scrofula at its root. Before, it is appropriate that you tie it with a strong doubled thread and leave it until it falls by itself without harm.	If there is a large blood-vessel at the root of the gland, then you should not cut that gland at its root but should ligature it with a strong double ligature and leave it till it sloughs away of its own accord without harm.	0.7789085
And then fill the wound with old cotton which you have already soaked in Egyptian ointment, and then treat it.	Then pack the wound with cotton wool previously soaked in Egyptian ointment; then continue dressing.	0.85140073
And if you incise that whole scrofula, then it is appropriate that you join the two lips of the wound and suture it immediately so that no superfluity remains.	If you excise the whole gland, you should at once draw together the two edges of the wound and suture them, when you are absolutely certain there is nothing of it left.	0.7079129
But if you see that superfluity remains due to the size of the scrofula, it is appropriate that you proceed to incise its root, and extract it and administer suture as said.	But if you see that, on account of the size of the scrofula, there is still some superfluity left behind, you should carry the incision to the root and base of it, and employ suturing and the rest of the remedies mentioned.	0.821914
And those of the scrofulas that contain fluid, perforate them with a superficial perforation where the place of maturation appears to you, and place the perforation at the lowest part of the body, just as we have said.	The glands that contain humidities you should open with a single perforation where they seem to have matured; make your perforation from below, as we have said.	0.64846164
And then administer the perforation, cauterize with ointment and similar substances, so that it corrodes what remains of the corruption. And then when you see the wound already cleaned, then treat it with generative flesh ointment until it is healed.	Then after opening use swabs soaked in Egyptian and similar ointments to do away with the unhealthy remains, till you see that the wound is clean; then dress with nourishing ointments until healed.	0.74694914
Chapter 43.	CHAPTER FORTY-THREE.	0.6399337
On the incision of the appendage of the abscess occurring in the throat.	On incising the larynx for a tumour arising in the throat.	0.7882086
The ancients mentioned this incision in the epiglottis, and I have not seen anyone in our land who has performed it.	The Ancients mentioned this laryngeal incision, but I have not seen anyone in our parts who has done it.	0.8413779
And this is the written account of their discourse.	Now here is the gist of what they say.	0.5149918
But in men having injury, it is appropriate to avoid the extraction of the epiglottis, as it is not beneficial since all the veins and the main vessels of the patient are there.	Incision should be avoided in those suffering from quinsy, for they will not benefit from it, since all the passages and the lung will be diseased.	0.58025485
But in those who have cauterized abscesses in the mouth or throat or both ears, when the illness is not in the trachea, it is appropriate to use the incision of the epiglottis to avoid the destruction caused by perforation.	But in those with an abscess in the mouth, throat, or tonsils, and when there is no disease in the windpipe itself, you must employ laryngotomy to avoid the mischief of suffocation.	0.73065317
So, when we want this, we incise the epiglottis below three circles of the circles of the epiglottis, or four with a small incision across the width at the point between two circles by amount, so that the incision is in the membrane, not in the cartilage, and this place is suitable for incision, because it is devoid of flesh and the blood vessels there are distant.	Now when we wish to undertake this we should incise the larynx under the third or fourth ring of the windpipe with a small incision transversely between two rings, so that the incision may be through the membrane, not the cartilage. This spot is suitable for incision, for it is deficient in flesh, and there are no blood-vessels near.	0.7917856
And if the physician is fearful, it is appropriate then to extend the skin of the throat with a hook, and then slit the skin until it reaches the channel, but avoid the blood vessels if you see any reason to.	If the practitioner be nervous, he must stretch the skin of the throat with a hook, then cut down through the skin till he reach the windpipe, and avoid blood-vessels if he see any.	0.80507165
And then incise the membrane as we have recounted; and it is indicated for the incision of the channel by the phlegm that comes out of it along with what is ruptured and by the loss of voice.	Then let him incise the membrane which we have spoken of. You can be certain of having opened the trachea by the emission of phlegm when it is pierced, and by the loss of voice.	0.76377654
And leave the wound open for some time.	Then leave the wound open for some while.	0.88190323
Then when the time has passed in which perforation is feared, join the two lips of the wound’s skin, and suture it alone without the cartilage.	When the danger of suffocation is passed, bring the two lips of the wound together by the skin, which alone must be sutured, without the cartilage.	0.776886
And then administer medicines that generate flesh until it is healed.	Then use medicaments stimulating granulation till healed.	0.7245485
And Albucasis said that the summary of the discourse we have recounted is nothing but that you see that some of these abscesses have already obstructed the patient's throat, and the patient is approaching death, and the breath is interrupted, and some go to incise the epiglottis so that the patient can breathe through the wound site for some respiration, and be saved from death.	The author of this book says, the interpretation of this account that we have given is this: when they see that one of the tumours that they mention has obstructed the patient's throat and he is approaching death and is anxious himself to be incised, they resort to laryngotomy so that the patient may breathe somewhat through the wound and his life be saved.	0.6746493
And for this, they ordered to leave the wound open until the malignancy of the illness is consumed; and the malignancy is for three days; and then they ordered to suture the wound, and treat it until it is healed.	They bid leaving the wound open till the worst of the disease abates; its height will last about three days; then they bid sew up the wound and dress till healed.	0.8107146
And what I have seen myself, is that a servant took a knife and put it in her throat and incised with it a part of the windpipe, and I was called for the treatment of it, and I found the patient as though she were dead, and I uncovered the wound and found the blood which had come out of the wound little by little.	My own experience was this: a slave-girl seized a knife and buried it in her throat and cut part of the trachea; and I was called to attend her. I found her bellowing like a sacrifice that has had its throat cut.	0.75590736
Then I was assured that she had not incised a vein or artery, and the air was coming out of the wound, and I treated it until it was healed.	So I laid the wound bare and found that only a little haemorrhage had come from it; and I assured myself that neither the jugular vein nor an artery had been cut, but air passed out through the wound. So I hurriedly sutured the wound and dressed it until healed.	0.74629825
And nothing happened to the servant except hoarseness in the voice, and after some days she returned to improvement in her condition.	And no ill befell the maid except for a hoarseness in the voice, but nothing more; and after some days she was restored to the best of health.	0.8671762
And now I say that in the incision of the epiglottis there is no fear.	Hence we may say that laryngotomy is not dangerous.	0.47014543
Chapter 44.	CHAPTER FORTY-FOUR.	0.6843705
On the incision of the abscess that occurs on the outside of the throat, and is called hernia of the throat.	On cutting down upon the tumour which occurs on the outside of the throat, and is called 'Elephant of the throat'.	0.77309394
This abscess called hernia of the throat is a large abscess according to the color of the body, and it is common in women.	This tumour which is called 'Elephant of the throat' is a large tumour of the colour of the body; it commonly occurs in women.	0.76873076
And it is according to two ways, for it is either natural or accidental.	It is of two kinds, congenital and acquired.	0.54353005
And the natural one is not a cause for treatment.	As to the congenital, there is no treatment for it.	0.5996452
Chapter 45.	CHAPTER FORTY-FIVE.	0.660313
On the incision of the types of nodes.	On incision for various kinds of cyst.	0.7174841
There are many types of nodes and I have already described all the types of them in the division.	There are various kinds of cyst. We have already mentioned all their varieties in the proper place.	0.6530973
And it is appropriate that I recount thus the difference between a node and an excrescence as there is doubt.	But we need here to set forth the difference between a cyst and an abscess, for it is complicated.	0.5155121
So I say that with an excrescence there is heat and fever and vehement pain until the ebullition of the superfluity is subdued; and putrefaction is completed and then fever, pain, and heat cease.	The abscess will be accompanied by heat and fever and fearsome pain, until the boiling-up of the superfluous matter settles down and the suppurating process is completed: then will the fever and intensity subside.	0.7523476
But with a node there is no heat nor fever nor pain, and it contains a certain membrane which is its own proper sac.	But with a cyst there is neither heat nor fever nor pains, and a membranous capsule encloses it, its own particular covering.	0.87205136
And it is according to the color of the body, and its beginning is like a pea and it is made like a swelling, whether larger or smaller, and they are according to two types, for they are either fatty and contain moisture, and the colors of the moisture are many, as I have said in the division.	The cyst is flesh-coloured, and it begins like a pea and becomes like a melon, more or less; and is of two kinds: either fatty or containing humidity; and the colours of the humidities are several, as we mentioned in the appropriate section.	0.7578491
So it is appropriate, when you arrive at the treatment of a node, to explore it and examine it at the beginning with an instrument which is called an introducer, as its form will come in the chapter that follows this one.	When you come to treat the cyst, you should first sound it and examine it with the instrument called the explorer, which is figured in the next chapter.	0.6886069
And it is the method of examination of abscesses and all nodes, and it is that you take this instrument and insert it into the moistest place that you find in the abscess, and you will rotate your fingers with it little by little until you know that the instrument has already penetrated the skin.	The way to examine all tumours and cysts is to take this instrument and press it in at the spot where the tumour is softest, and revolve it gently with your fingers till you know you have pierced the skin; then press it in proportionately to the size of the tumour.	0.76877856
And then complete your work according to the size of the abscess, and then remove the introducer and consider what has come out of the mark of it.	Then remove the explorer and see what comes out after it.	0.5697366
And if the moisture is expelled, whatever color it may be, then you incise it with a superficial incision as I have said in the other abscesses.	If a humidity should flow, whatever the colour, make a simple incision, as I said for the other tumours.	0.7376189
And if no moisture comes out of the mark of the introducer, then know that it is fatty.	But if no humidity come out along the track of the explorer you know at once that it is fatty.	0.7490537
And cut over it with an incision having the form of a cross in this form: As I have shown you, and suspend it with hooks, and strip the skin from every part with ease, and preserve the skin or sac, if you can, over it and extract that tissue with the node.	Therefore make a cruciform incision upon it in this shape, as I have told you, and attach hooks and dissect away the skin gently from all sides. Be careful with the capsule; if you can, get it out whole, together with the cyst.	0.7863889
But if it is ruptured in the operation, it is not possible to extract that tissue, and many times this happens, and then you extract it in pieces until no part of it remains.	But if the capsule is torn in the course of the operation, and you cannot get it out whole, which frequently happens, remove it bit by bit until there is none of it left.	0.8092463
For if any part of it remains, little or much, the node will return in the same way.	For if a part of it is left behind, either great or small, the cyst will generally return.	0.7907151
And if you see that any small part of it remains, then fill the wound with some sharp corrosive powders and tighten the wound, and apply over it what sets the abscess, and treat it with the other treatments until it is healed.	If it defeats you and some little piece of it remain, pack the wound, when you have done all you can, with some caustic powder and bandage it and put on it something to ease the inflamed tumour, and treat in the usual way until healed.	0.75778997
And if it is a large node, then you suture the two lips of it and treat it with what generates flesh.	If the tumour be large, sew the edges of the incision together and treat with stimulants.	0.60167587
But if a pulsating vein is opposite it, or a non-pulsating one, then you cauterize and fill the place with crushed sage that is vitriol and leave it tight for two days or three until the wound festers and the boiling of the blood rests; and then return to incise what remains of the node.	If you should come across a blood-vessel, pulsating or not, and there be haemorrhage, hasten to pack it with pounded vitriol; and leave bandaged for two or three days until the wound becomes purulent and the boiling-up of the blood is allayed; then resume cutting open the rest of the cyst.	0.8570179

On the forms of the instruments necessary for cutting and perforating.	On the shapes of the instruments used for incising and perforating.	0.9042379
Of these, the forms of the introducers are of three kinds: one is large, another medium, and another small.	Among these are the various explorers. There are three varieties of this instrument, large, medium, and small.	0.78072613
The form of the large introducer is this:	This is the figure of the large explorer.	0.5112202
The form of the small introducer is this:	Figure of the small explorer.	0.40477958
They are made of iron, with squared ends suitably, so that they quickly enter the abscesses.	They should all be made of the best Damascene steel, with quadrangular points, and strong, to assist entry into the tumours.	0.53745526
And these are the forms of the explorers, and they are called "albered," and one of them is called "berid."	And this is the shape of the probes; they are also called burud.	0.6125232
And they are of three kinds: one is large, another medium, and another small.	There are three kinds of this, too: large, medium, and small.	0.8335137
The form of the large explorer, its form:	Figure of the large probe.	0.45791805
The form of the medium explorer, its form:	Figure of the medium probe.	0.43471158
The form of the small explorer, its form:	Figure of the small probe.	0.45197105
They are suitable for these abscesses, exits, fistulas, and boils because they go among the bones and other causes.	They are suitable for exploring tumours, wounds, fistulas, and sinuses, to see what is inside them such as bones, etc.	0.6032505
And they are made round, thick, smooth, like large needles with which saddles are sewn, and are made of brass, copper, iron, or silver. The best ones are made of brass.	They are made round, polished, and smooth, like packing-needles, of Chinese copper or of white copper, or of brass, silver, or iron. The best are those made of white copper.	0.8069156
And the explorers are made of black lead, which ensures that fistulas are opened in their concavity, and they reflect light due to their smoothness.	Sometimes probes are made of black lead, for investigating fistulas whose deeper course is devious; so that by reason of their softness they can adapt themselves to the curves.	0.60048294
And they are of three kinds: some are long, others medium, and others short, according to the width of the fistula and its narrowness.	Of these, too, there are three varieties: the long, the medium, and the short, proportioned to the requirement of the depth of every fistula.	0.8366324
Form of the large lead explorer:	The large lead probe.	0.60612446
Form of the medium lead explorer:	The medium lead probe.	0.5842626
Form of the small lead explorer:	The small lead probe.*	0.5525837
The forms of the hooks are of many kinds: some are simple, with only one curvature, and they are of three kinds: large, small, and medium.	There are many kinds of hook.

And these are the forms of scalpels with which nodes and abscesses are cut and scraped, and they are of three kinds: large, medium, and small.	These are the figures of the scarifying scalpels with which you incise and dissect away cysts and tumours. They too are of three kinds: large, medium, and small.	0.84168637

The ends of these, with which the cutting is done, are sharp, and the other ends are not sharp, and are not placed in such a manner but for the assistance in the excoriation of nodes, fearing the incision of a vein or nerve. This way, the patient is healed and finds some peace from the burning that happens during the excoriation of the abscess.	The cutting edges should be sharp, and the other ends blunt. The reason for making them like this is so that they can be utilized in dissecting away cysts where there is a fear of cutting a vein or nerve, and also that the patient may console himself thereby and find some small relief from the pain involved in the dissection of a tumour.	0.78318745
And these are the forms of the almagidas, and they are of three kinds: large, medium, and small, as you will see.	Here are the figures of the 'deceivers' of which also there are three kinds, large, medium, and small.	0.6677241

And it has a punctured end with a hidden blade, and it moves to the inside and outside parts as you wish, as you see.	At one end there is the likeness of a broad spoon made of two plates, in the extremity of which is the point of a hidden scalpel; thus the knife is masked like a bird's tongue, moving in and out at will, as you see.	0.53446555
The forms of the spatimis, which are hidden among the fingers for the perforation of abscesses and are not perceived by the patients, are of three kinds: large, medium, and small. And these are the forms of those:	Figures of the scalpels which are hidden between the fingers when tumours are to be opened, so that they are not noticed by the patient. They are of three varieties: large, medium, and small.	0.8135084
The forms of the cupping glasses with which the blood flow is cut off, and they are of three kinds: large, medium, and small; their forms:	Figures of the cupping vessels with which haemorrhage is stanched. There are three kinds: large, medium, and small.	0.8748956
They are made of brass, round with some length, and they are thin.	They are made of bronze or of Chinese alloy, round but slightly elongated, as you see, and also rather thin.	0.57866603
And it is necessary that these kinds of cupping glasses, large, medium, and small, be with you so that you can quickly stop the blood flow when needed, especially when medicine is not available to you at first.	You should have these kinds by you, large and small, so that haemorrhage may be quickly stopped in an emergency and when you have no medicine.	0.7388853
However, do not use these to cut blood flow in every part of the body, only in fleshy places, such as the muscles of the legs and thighs, the muscles of the arms, the breasts, the belly, and the groins, similar to the moist fleshy muscles.	But they are not to be used for suppressing haemorrhage in all parts of the body, but only in the fleshy parts such as the calf and thigh muscles, the arm muscles, the breasts, belly, and groin, and other similar fleshy soft parts.	0.9101447
And sometimes these instruments are made smaller, resembling the peels of figs in this form, by which blood is stopped when phlebotomy is done, or by incision of a vein or artery.	Sometimes of this class small instruments, like nutshells, are made, like this. Haemorrhage from a venesection is stopped by these; or in the case of a cut artery or vein.	0.7356048

On the treatment of men’s breasts which resemble those of women.	On the treatment of the male breast when it resembles the female.	0.8438532
Sometimes the breasts of some men swell due to the growth of hair as they begin to become hairy, and the breasts swell, resembling those of women, and remain abscessed, distant.	The breasts of some males may swell on attaining puberty so as to resemble the female breast, and they remain permanently swollen and ugly.	0.74020255
And for those who have this, it is necessary to cut them with a lunar incision in this form, from line .B. to line .G., then scrape all the thickness, then fill the wound with healing medication, then join the two lips of the wound with stitches, and treat it until it is healed.	If this is abhorrent, a semicircular incision should be made on the breast, like this figure, from b to g. Then dissect away all the fatty tissue and pack the wound with a cicatrizing compound and sew the lips together and dress until healed.	0.67229986
But if the breast sags downward and is softened due to its size, like that of women, then it should be split in two upper parts, with two cuts resembling a lunar shape, each containing the other at the end, so that the larger line contains the smaller one in this form from line .B. to line .G. Then scrape the skin between the two lips of the wound, remove the fat, and apply what we said about stitching and powders necessary for the healing until it is cured.	But if the breast is pendulous and flabby on account of its size, as happens with women, you should make two semicircular incisions on the upper side, the ends joining one another, in such wise that the longer incision encircles the other like this, from b to g. Then dissect away the skin between the two incisions and remove the fat and sew up as we have described; and apply styptic powder and the necessary dressings until healed.	0.860814
And if you cannot complete the incision because of the patient's restlessness and the blood flow, then fill the wound with cotton soaked in corrosive ointment and leave it there until it corrodes the remaining fat, and then treat it until it is healed.	But if you cannot make the incision as full and perfect as it ought to have been, because the patient is restless, or because haemorrhage arises, you should pack the wound with cotton wool soaked in corrosive ointment and leave till it eats away the remainder of the fat; then dress until healed.	0.8379953

These abscesses that occur under the armpit are of the kind of scrofulas, hard, which contain a sack-like membrane.	These tumours under the armpit are of the type of scrofulous tumours, hard, enclosed in a capsule.	0.8351199
And some of them contain moisture; and those that contain moisture should be incised with a lunar cut in this form: from line .G. to line .B. And when all the pus in the abscess is evacuated, then you fill it with old cotton and leave it until the next day.	Some contain humidity. Those that contain humidity should be opened with a semicircular incision like this, from b to g. When you have removed all the pus that had been in the tumour, pack the wound with teased-out cotton wool and leave till another day.	0.7679765
Then the cotton is removed and treated with a suitable ointment for that until it is healed.	Then remove the cotton wool and dress with a suitable ointment until healed.	0.8961455
And if the abscess is of the type of nodes and scrofulas, then you incise over it as we said in the section on scrofulas likewise.	If the tumour be of the nodular scrofulous kind, cut directly down on it just as we prescribed for that kind.	0.62507087

On the incision of abscesses that occur due to an artery or a vein.	On opening a tumour arising from a bloodvessel, called an aneurysm.	0.61050844
When an artery is ruptured, and the skin over it is consolidated, then many times an abscess occurs. The signs by which it is known that inflammation and abscess are due to an artery or a vein: when the abscess is due to an artery, it is long, aggregated in the body's depth; and when you press the abscess with your fingers, you feel a sort of creaking.	When an artery is injured and the overlying skin scars, a tumour very often arises from this; the same thing happens to a vein: a swelling and a tumour. And these are the signs by which you may diagnose whether the swelling and tumour arise from an artery or a vein: if it be from an artery the tumour will be a deep and elongated mass; and when you press upon it with your finger there will be a feeling of pulsation.	0.86594445
And the one caused by a vein is round on the body's surface.	But if it arises from a vein the swelling will be circular and superficial.	0.51430285
And incision on this abscess is an error, especially on those under the armpits, in the groins, on the neck, and in many places on the body; and it is very serious, so it is necessary to avoid treating it with iron, and the one that is on the extremities, or on the head, must be avoided.	It is dangerous to make an incision on tumours of this kind, specially in the axilla, the groin, the neck, and in many other parts of the body; it is indeed highly dangerous, so in these you must avoid treatment by the knife; also in those in the limbs and in the head it must be avoided.	0.84980345
But for the one caused by the swelling of the artery’s orifice, make an incision in the skin lengthwise; then open the incision with hooks and near the artery, and free it from the membranes until it is uncovered.	But any such that arises from the inflation of the mouth of an artery, you may cut down in the skin over that with a longitudinal incision; then open up your incision with hooks and dissect away the artery, freeing it from the tissues till it is laid bare.	0.85411805
Then place a needle over it and make it penetrate to the other side, and tie the artery with a double thread in two places, — a method I showed you in the extraction of two arteries in the temples.	Then run a needle beneath the artery to reach the other side, and tie the artery in two places with a double thread, as I showed you for the extraction of the temporal arteries.	0.78573656
Then press the place between the two ligatures with a spatula until all the blood is expelled, and the abscess is dissolved.	Then with the scalpel prick the part between the two ligatures to let out all the blood and get the tumour down.	0.8415997
Then apply a treatment to where there is decay until the ligatures fall off; and then treat it with suitable ointments until it is healed.	Then apply dressings to excite suppuration until the ligatures fall away; then dress with suitable ointments until healed.	0.87615037
And if the abscess is due to a vein, then you must hold with your hand as much of the abscess as you can with the skin, and then insert a needle below the place you held with your hand, and make it penetrate; and it should have a double thread so you can pull it from the other side, and then tie the abscess with a good ligature as I told you in the ligature of the uvula in two parts with two ends of the thread.	If the swelling be due to a vein that has been penetrated, you should gather up with your hand as much of the tumour as you can, together with the skin; then pass a needle beneath the place which you have grasped in your hand and run it through, threaded with a double thread, until it emerges at the other side; then with it tie a strong ligature round the swelling as I mentioned to you on ligaturing the swollen uvula, from either side, with the ends of the thread.	0.8828337
But if you fear that the thread will be pulled out, then insert the thread with that needle under the whole abscess along the first needle’s incision, and tighten your threads in four places.	If you fear that the threads may come loose, pass a second needle and thread beneath the whole tumour to intersect with the passage of the first needle; and tie your threads in four places.	0.82390535
Then dry the abscess in the middle of it until what is in it comes out, then you incise the excess skin, and leave what is tied.	Then incise the tumour in the centre to extract the contents. Then cut away the superfluous skin and leave what has been ligatured.	0.8174828
Then place a powder on it that you have soaked in wine and oil, and then apply the treatment made with poultices and ointments until it is healed.	Then put on that a pad previously soaked in wine and oil; then apply the treatment with lint and ointments until healed.	0.88642645
Chapter 50 on the abscess that occurs due to the twisting of nerves.	CHAPTER FIFTY. On the tumour arising from the twisting of a tendon.	0.6485034
Just as an abscess occurs in an artery and a vein, similarly an abscess occurs in the nerves when they are struck or due to excessive work, and for similar reasons.	As a tumour arises on an artery or a vein, so may it also come in a tendon when it has been bruised; or it may arise from excessive fatigue, or such causes.	0.7963441
And it occurs mostly in the places of the joints or the heel, or in any place where the joints are affected.	This occurs mostly at the wrists, at the heel, and at all sites of articular movement.	0.7349497
And it is a severe abscess, and it resembles the color of the rest of the body, and it is mostly in the large joints, and when it is pressed with force, the patient feels a kind of numbness in it.	It is a hard tumour of the same colour as the rest of the body, and is generally painless, and when strong pressure is put upon it the patient has a numb feeling in it.	0.719465
And it is not an abscess aggregated in the body's depth, and therefore it is under the skin, and it is affected all over and does not move forward or backward.	It is a tumour that does not form in the deeper tissues but is subcutaneous. It is freely movable laterally, but will not go forward or backward.	0.6606513
So those that are in the joints should not be invaded with iron, because it will very easily lead to contraction.	Those that are situated on joints should certainly not be tackled with the knife, for that often causes palsy.	0.65049577
But the one that is on the head or the forehead, separate the skin with a spatula. But if it is a small abscess, then hold it with scissors and cut it off from the roots.	Incise the skin of those occurring on the head or forehead, and if the tumour be small take hold of it with the forceps and cut it away by the root.	0.64816195
And if it is large, then you lift it with a hook, scrape it, and then remove it; and join the wound with stitches, and treat it until it is healed.	But if it be large, catch it up with a hook and dissect it away and remove it; and sew up the incision and dress until healed.	0.85592115
Chapter 51:	CHAPTER FIFTY-ONE.	0.4524064
On the incision of an abscess that occurs due to something that happens to the belly.	On the amputation of warts occurring on the belly.	0.7057952
Many times it happens to some men in their bellies and in other parts of their bodies, such lumps which are called fungal due to their resemblance to fungi, of which the root is subtle and the head of it is large; and already the lips of them are inverted, and some are small, and some are very large.	Some people often get warts on the belly and on the rest of the body, called fungous warts, because of their resemblance to fungi. They have a slender pedicle and a broad head, the edges of which are sometimes inverted ; and some are small, whereas others of them grow very big.	0.8546825
And I have already seen one, and in his belly there were two lumps which were more like fungi, and there was no difference between those white ones with small roots.	I myself once saw a man who had two warts on his belly that looked more like fungi than anything else; they were white and had thin pedicles.	0.7984996
And already the lips of those were inverted and split, and moisture flowed from them all the time.	Their edges were inverted and had split open, and a humour flowed continually from them.	0.65745986
So I incised those and found in one a weight of almost 18 ounces and the other almost 6 ounces.	I amputated them both and weighed them: one came to about eighteen ounces, and the other six ounces.	0.7852274
And the operation in their incision is that you consider if the patient is moist, and the color of the lump is white, moist, with subtle roots; then you incise it with a wide spatula, and in your presence, cauterize with fire, because many times after the incision a lot of blood is expelled; and if the blood comes, cauterize it.	This is the operation for amputating them: examine the patient carefully, and if he be of a humid temperament and the colour of the warts be white, and if they are soft, with a thin stalk, amputate them with a broad scalpel. But you should also have at hand cauteries in a fire; for often in amputating them there is much haemorrhage. So, if the bleeding be a hindrance to you, be quick and cauterize them.	0.8565071
And if you see the patient fearful and scared, avoid incision with iron; but then take newly made lead thread, and tie it around the lump, in the manner we have described; and leave it for two days.	So, if the bleeding be a hindrance to you, be quick and cauterize them. On the other hand if you see that the patient is frightened and dreads the cutting of them with the scalpel, take a wire of stout lead, and ligature this type of wart and leave for two days.	0.7050558
Then tighten the lead thread; do not stop tightening it more and more around the lump, until it is cut off and falls off by itself without effort.	Then increase the stricture by the lead wire and go on doing this as it sinks into the wart, until the wart is cut through and spontaneously falls away with no trouble.	0.7780652
But if the lump has large roots, then in its incision, there is some cause for fear and dread, especially in one that is in the belly.	But if the warts have stout pedicles there is some risk and fear in the cutting of them, especially those that occur on the belly.	0.8068878
But it is possible that you incise half of it, and then cauterize it so it does not return.	Sometimes, however, you can cut away the half, or some part, and then cauterize to prevent recurrence.	0.72574294
Then treat it until the wound is healed.	Then dress until the wound is healed.	0.87719697
And beware not to attempt to incise a lump that is of dark color, with little feeling, and soft touch, because that one is likely cancerous.	But beware of trying to cut away growths that are dark in colour, with little sensation and hideous in appearance, for they are cancerous tumours.	0.7662989
And I will come to the memory of cancer near this.	I shall soon be mentioning cancer.	0.5987576
Chapter 52:	CHAPTER FIFTY-TWO.	0.46814835
On the treatment of umbilical eminence.	On the treatment of protruding navel.	0.8418801
Umbilical eminence is caused by many factors; either by fissures of the diaphragm that is above the belly, and from it, the membrane or intestine comes out as in other ruptures; or by blood that flows from a vein or artery as previously mentioned, or by confined wind in it.	The navel becomes prominent from many causes; either from a rupture of the peritoneum over the abdomen, so that omentum or intestine comes through it as in other ruptures; or from blood extravasation from an artery or vein, as we have mentioned; or else from wind trapped in it.	0.8927916
But if it is due to a fissure of the diaphragm and the coming out of the membrane, then the color of the abscess resembles the color of the body; and it is smooth without pain, and it appears in various locations. And if it is due to the intestine coming out, then the location of it is more varied as we have described, and when you press it with your fingers, it is hidden, and then it returns; and it becomes very prominent after bathing and vigorous work.	If it be due to ruptured peritoneum and protruding omentum, the colour of the tumour will be the same as the rest of the body; it will be soft and painless and will seem to change its position; But if it be due to an escape of bowel the change of position, compared with what we have described, will be greater, and it will disappear on digital pressure, and then will recur; and often there will be crepitus with it, and it will increase in size on entering the bath or on violent exertion.	0.80426973
But if it is due to moisture, then it is smooth and is not hidden when you press with your hand, nor is it constricted, nor increased.	If it be due to fluid, it will be soft and will not disappear on manual pressure, nor will it grow larger or smaller.	0.7081506
And if it is due to blood, then with these signs, the abscess appears with a dark hue.	If it be due to blood, then in addition to these signs the tumour will appear blackish.	0.81335354
But if it is due to growing flesh, then it is a serious abscess, large and hard, and fixed to a certain extent.	If it arise from a fleshy overgrowth, the tumour will be solid and hard, remaining always constant in bulk.	0.65420425
But if it is due to wind, then its touch is smooth.	If it be due to wind, it will be soft to the touch.	0.79535496
And the operation on it is that you consider if the umbilical eminence is due to blood from an artery, or vein, or due to wind; then you should avoid treating it, as there is fear and dread in it, as I have explained in the chapter where I talked about abscesses from arteries and veins.	The operation for these is to examine, and if the exomphalos be due to arterial or venous blood, or wind, you should withhold treatment since it is dangerous in these cases, with an uncertain outlook, as I taught you in the chapter on tumours arising from an artery or vein.	0.81848323
And if the umbilical eminence is due to the intestine or membrane, then instruct the patient to hold his breath, and lie extended; then mark around the entire umbilicus with a probe, and instruct him to stand bent between your hands on his back, and then encircle the umbilicus with a wide spatula on the location you have marked with the probe; then extend half of the abscess to the upper parts with a large hook; and then tie around it with strong thread or silk in the proper manner of tying.	But if it be due to bowel or omentum, bid the patient hold his breath and stand stiffly upright; then make an ink mark all round the umbilicus; then tell him to lie on his back before you; then with a broad scalpel cut all round the umbilicus along the line marked out; then draw up the middle of the tumour with a large hook; then ligature the site of the incision with a strong thread or silk cord, tying it securely with a slip-knot.	0.9213349
Then open the middle of the extended abscess over the binding and insert your finger into it and seek the intestine; and if you find and guard it by the binding, then carefully extract it and push the intestine back into the inner parts of the belly.	Then open the middle of the tied tumour above the ligature and insert your forefinger and search for the bowel; and if you find it caught in the ligature slacken the slip-knot and push the bowel back into the abdomen.	0.9010788
And if you find the membrane, then take it with a hook; and incise its superfluities.	But if you find omentum, stretch it with a hook and cut off what is superfluous.	0.7053835
But if it is contrary to you, an artery or vein, then circle around it, and return to your operation; and take two needles and insert strong threads in them and insert the two needles around the circuit you made around the abscess in the manner of a cross, and make them penetrate; then tighten the abscess in four parts over the needles.	And if you come across an artery or vein, tie it securely and go on with your work: take two needles and thread them with two strong threads and insert the two needles into the incision that you have made around the tumour, pushing them in so that they cross one another. Then ligature the tumour in four places over the needles.	0.8587915
And if you want, remove the needles and leave the place until the extended flesh decays and falls off by itself; or incise it when it is thin and decayed, and then treat it with the appropriate ointments until it is healed.	If you wish, you may remove the needles and let be until the ligatured tissue necroses and falls away of its own accord; or cut it away when it is thin and necrosing. Then dress with the needful ointments until healed.	0.8833424
And if the umbilical eminence is due to growing flesh or moisture, then you should hollow out the abscess as we have said and extract the blood or moisture you find in it, and then treat it with the appropriate ointments to solidify the place.	But if the prominent navel be due to an overgrowth of flesh there or from humidity, you should slice the tumour as we have said and get out all the blood or humidity to be found there. Then dress it with stimulating dressings.	0.81478894

On the treatment of cancer.	On the treatment of cancer.	1.0000002
We have already said, in the division, about the types of cancer and the manner of treating it with medicines, and that treatment with iron should be avoided so it does not become ulcerated; and we have discussed cancer engendered in the flesh and the precautions for its treatment.	We have spoken, in the relevant section, of the kinds of cancer and of the way in which medical treatment of them is to be attempted; with a warning against treatment by the knife lest they ulcerate. We also mentioned the cancer arising in the uterus and gave a warning against its treatment.	0.86046064
And the ancients said that sometimes cancer is in a place where it is possible to eradicate it, as with cancer in the breasts or the thigh and their similar members, to extract all of it, especially when it is just starting small.	The Ancients said that when a cancer is in a site where total eradication is possible, such as a cancer of the breast or of the thigh, and in similar parts where complete removal is possible, and especially when in the early stage and small, (then surgery was to be tried).	0.7958169
But when it is old and large, do not attempt to treat it, for I could not cure any of it nor have I seen another who could.	But when it is of long standing and large you should leave it alone. For I myself have never been able to cure any such, nor have I seen anyone else succeed before me.	0.76192564
And the operation on it, when it is located as we have said, is that you precede and let the patient purge the black bile sometimes, and then bleed him, if a manifest repletion is found.	The procedure in a case amenable to treatment, as we have said, is first for the patient to be purged several times from black bile; then bleed him if his veins seem full.	0.76364577
Then prepare the patient with preparation in which he is located for the operation, and then apply hooks where necessary; and then hollow out all around with a good cutting, ensuring no root cause remains. And let the blood flow, and do not cut it lightly, and press the places, and wipe away the thick blood with your hand or with an instrument as possible.	Then put the patient in the most convenient position for operating. Then attach to the tumour hooks suited to it; then make a circular incision all round to include the skin with the utmost thoroughness so that not the least root of it remains; let the blood flow and do not stanch it quickly; but put pressure upon the place and squeeze out all the thick blood, either by hand or with any instrument you can.	0.87883496
But if the thick blood contradicts you by cutting a vein or artery, then cauterize it until the blood flow ceases, and then treat it with the other treatment until it is healed.	If in operating you get a very severe haemorrhage from cutting an artery or vein, cauterize the vessel until the bleeding stops; then dress in the usual way until healed.	0.7329581

On the treatment of dropsy.	On the treatment of dropsy.	0.99999994
We have already discussed, in the division, the types of dropsy from water, and the signs of each type, and their treatment with medicines.	We have mentioned in the section the kinds of hydrops, and the manner in which the fluid collects; the signs of each kind; and the medical treatment of them.	0.7866718
And the one that is treated with iron is only the type of ascites, and iron is not used for the type of tympanites or the type of anasarca, for it is fatal.	The only kind which is to be treated by operation is the one called 'ascites'. But neither the kind called 'tympanites' nor general anasarca are to be treated by operation at all, for that would be fatal.	0.76144284
And when you have treated this type of tympanitic dropsy with medicines and your treatment does not work, then consider, for if the patient has already acquired weakness, or has another illness besides dropsy, such as a cough or belly condition and similar to these, then avoid treating him with iron, for there is fear in that.	When you have been trying medical treatment for this kind, for ascites, and your treatment is ineffectual, then consider; and if the patient be in a low state or suffer from other disease beside the ascites, such as cough or diarrhoea or some such, then beware of attempting operative treatment since it will be of uncertain outcome.	0.7887056
But if you see the patient with abundant strength, and he has no other illness but dropsy, and is not a child or elderly, then the manner of operation is that you lift the patient between your hands, and the assistant presses his belly with his hand, pushing the water to the lower part of the abdomen, and then take a sharp spatula in this shape:	But if you see that the patient has plenty of strength and suffers under no other complaint beside the dropsy, and is of neither tender nor advanced age, then the operative procedure in this case is for you to place the patient, standing, before you, with an assistant behind him to apply manual pressure to his abdomen and push the fluid down into the pelvis.	0.82460064
let it be long with two sharp parts, with a sharp tip like a spatula; but it should have some small brevity, so that in operation with it you do not pass into the intestine and injure it.	Then take a pointed scalpel of this shape, sharp along both sides, long, and very sharp at the end like a scalpel, but slightly stubby so that in operating you do not reach the intestines and damage them.	0.6587525
Then consider if the dropsy is from the intestines, for then you should move your incision away from the navel by the amount of three fingers towards the lower parts, in the direction of the pubic region.	Then consider; and if the dropsy arises from the region of the intestines then you should make an incision three fingers' breadth directly below the umbilicus, above the pubes.	0.8123827
But if the dropsy is from a liver disease, then your incision should be to the left of the navel by three fingers.	If the dropsy arises from disease of the liver, let your incision be three fingers to the left of the umbilicus.	0.86434513
And if it is from the spleen, then your incision should be on the right side.	If it arises from disease of the spleen, let the incision be three fingers to the right.	0.62998945
And do not make your incision on the side where the patient prefers to lie, so that the superfluities do not flow to that weak place.	Moreover, the incision must not be on the side which the patient wishes to lie on, so that the superfluities may not flow to the damaged part.	0.78646976
Then perforate the whole skin with the instrument, and insert it into that incision, and raise your hand with the spatula between the skin and the membrane, and peel it off; to the amount of a nail or around that.	Then pierce the skin with the instrument, introduce the instrument into that incision, and bring the scalpel up between the skin and the membrane, as if excoriating, over an area about the size of a fingernail.	0.8404821
Then perforate the membrane until the spatula reaches the empty space, which is the place of the water. Then extract it and insert an instrument in this shape: it is similar to a thin silver tube; it is made of silver or brass or light bronze, at the lowest part of it there is a small hole, and on its sides there are three holes: two on one side and one on the other side; and the tip of it is incised in the manner of a feather, as you sometimes see:	Then pierce through the membrane till the scalpel reaches a cavity, which will be where the water is; then withdraw the scalpel and put into the opening the instrument shaped like this; it resembles a fine section of reed, made of silver, bronze or white copper; smooth and well polished, with a small opening at the lower end and three at the sides, two on one side and one on the other, as you see. Its extremity may be cut to the shape of a writing reed like this; the upper end of it is supplied with a ring.	0.9189828
And at the uppermost end of it is a small ring, for when the instrument reaches the water, it then descends over the instrument, then evacuate the water in half the quantity at a time, for if you evacuate more than is appropriate at once, the patient may die quickly from a resolution of his animal spirit, or he may faint which approaches death.	Its extremity may be cut to the shape of a writing reed like this; the upper end of it is supplied with a ring. When the instrument reaches the fluid, the fluid will at once pass down into it. Evacuate at one time only a moderate amount of fluid; for if you evacuate more than you should at a time, the patient may die through a dissolution of his animal spirits, or he will undergo a fainting that is next door to death.	0.8325789
But evacuate it according to the quantity of his strength and as the patient's pulse and condition indicate to you his strength and wellness.	But let out such quantity of fluid as is proportionate to his strength and as is indicated to you by the patient's condition: the strength of his pulse and the goodness of his colour.	0.8050529
Then remove the instrument, and retain the water which is retained by the skin which closes the hole that you made on the membrane as described.	Then withdraw the instrument and keep (the rest of) the fluid in. For it will be immediately held back by the skin that closes the opening in the peritoneum, which, as I have told you, must be perforated in that manner.	0.7086765
Then repeat the use of the instrument the next day if you see the patient tolerating it, and extract a small quantity of water, and do this for a few days with caution, and avoid error until only a little water remains.	Then repeat the use of the instrument another day if you see that the patient can tolerate it, and withdraw again a small quantity of fluid. And do this daily, watchful and on guard against error, until there is only a trace of fluid left.	0.92804813
But if you fear for the patient, and you leave a large quantity of water, then treat him with burial in warm sand, and much sweating in the bath, and exposure to the sun for a long time; and treat him with desiccative medicines until he is healed.	But if you are afraid for the patient and leave a large amount of fluids treat him by burying him in hot sand, and by heavy sweating in the bath and in the sun, and letting him go thirsty; while you treat him with drying medicines, till he is well.	0.9505123
And cauterize over the stomach, the spleen, and the liver near the water extraction site, as I have explained in the preceding section.	He should also be cauterized on the abdomen and on the liver and spleen after the paracentesis, as I have previously described.	0.67871726

About the cure of children who are born with the urinary passage not perforated.	On the treatment of boys born with imperforate urinary meatus; or with the meatus small or not in the proper place.	0.56133276
Sometimes some children are born from their mother’s womb and the tip of their urethra is not perforated (or the hole is narrow or not in the right place).	Sometimes a boy is born from his mother's womb with the glans penis not perforate.	0.65261066
Then it is necessary to perforate it as soon as the child is born with a very fine spatula in this shape:	So at the moment of his birth you should be quick and make a perforation with a fine scalpel figured thus.	0.6777414
Then place a thin lead nail in the hole and tie it, and keep it there for three or four days.	Then put in the opening a slender leaden sound, tie it and keep it in for three or four days.	0.8908876
And when the child wants to urinate, it should be removed and let him urinate; then reinsert it.	When he wishes to make water, it will be removed and he will do so; then put it back.	0.7040945
And if you do not insert the lead, it is possible that the urine that goes over the spot will not allow it to close.	If you do not put in the leaden sound it may be that the urine passing through the place will prevent the wound from healing.	0.7045287
But for the one whose hole is narrow, it should be treated with a lead nail, as we have said, for several days until it widens.	The case having too narrow a meatus should be treated with the leaden sound, as we have said, for many days until it is wide enough.	0.70787746
But those in which the hole is not in the right place, it means, in those cases, where the child is born and the hole is at the end of the tip of the penis so that he cannot urinate downward unless he lifts the penis with his hand upward; and this is not normal, because the sperm cannot reach the mother properly, and it is a serious illness.	In those cases having a misplaced meatus—for example, there are some born with the opening at the edge of the glans so that they cannot make water forwards until the opening of the penis is lifted up by hand, nor can they beget, since the semen cannot reach directly to the uterus, a disorder which is very ugly.	0.6739477
And the way to operate is that the patient lies on his back, and then extend the tip of the penis with your left hand with a strong pull, and incise the tip of the penis from the foreskin with a sharp spatula, like a feather incision, or shave off a part, so that the middle of it becomes like the tip of the penis and the hole falls in the middle as it should.	The manner of operating in this case is for the patient to lie back; then with your left hand draw out his glans firmly and cut the end of the glans at the place of the meatus with a broad knife or sharp scalpel, as if sharpening a pen, or as if you were whittling something, so that the middle of it protrudes like a glans penis and the opening falls in the middle as it should.	0.8762287
And be careful during your operation of the blood flow, because this often happens; and stop it with something that stops the bleeding, and treat the wound until it is healed.	And beware, in your operating, of haemorrhage, which often happens; meet it with styptics and dress the wound until it heals.	0.75395143

About ulcers that occur on the foreskin and the tip of the penis, and about corruption, blackness, and adherence of the foreskin to the tip of the penis.	On pustules occurring on the prepuce and on the glans; and blackness and necrosis and adhesions between glans and prepuce.	0.7497612
Often these ulcers occur on the penis and are a protrusion of soft flesh.	These pustules very frequently occur in the urinary meatus and are excrescences of foul tissue.	0.7997079
And among these, one is malignant and the other is not malignant.	Some are malignant and some are not.	0.67511296
For the non-malignant one, you should suspend it with a thin hook and cut it off completely; then place a cotton swab soaked in Egyptian ointment on it; and after that, treat it with diafinicon ointment until it is healed.	The nonmalignant you should seize with a fine hook and pare away until they are altogether gone; then apply to the place cotton wool soaked in Egyptian ointment; then afterwards dress with Palm ointment until healed.	0.8056666
And if the ulcer is malignant, of a blue color, then you should apply cautery to the incision site and its area.	But when the pustules are malignant, of a dirty colour, for these you should employ the cautery after cutting and scraping them.	0.64598876
But if the ulcer is on the foreskin of the uncircumcised penis, and one part of the ulcer is inside the foreskin and the other part is outside, then you should remove the ulcer inside first until it is consolidated; then treat the outside, because when you treat both the foreskin and the ulcer at the same time, it is not ensured that it will not tear.	If the pustules be on the prepuce of an uncircumcized unbeliever and there are some inside the prepuce and some outside, those that are inside should be removed first; and when they are healed over, then treat those outside. For if you deal with both at the same time you are in danger of going through the prepuce.	0.77506346
And sometimes blackness and corruption occur on the genitals and foreskin, then you should scoop out all that is blackened and starting to corrupt or already corrupted; then spread honey on it, which is mixed with pomegranate peel flour and crushed and sieved roots.	Sometimes there occurs a blackness and necrosis in the testicles and prepuce; then you should scrape away all the black part which looks ready to go necrotic or has already necrosed. Then afterwards smear on the place honey with pounded and sifted pomegranate peel and bitter vetch.	0.8291043
And then treat it with other cures until it is healed.	Then carry on with the usual treatment until healed.	0.72787786
But if there is a blood flow, then apply lunar cautery in this way:	If haemorrhage set in, cauterize with a lunate cautery figured thus.	0.54230666
because the cautery is helpful for both conditions at the same time, that is, for blood flow and for the wound when it is corrupted.	For the cautery serves a twofold purpose, namely against haemorrhage and for a putrefying wound.	0.64115053
And if the tip of the penis is corroded and completely destroyed, then you should insert a lead tube into the opening of the foreskin so that the patient can urinate through it.	If at any time the penis mortifies and goes entirely, you should pass into the urethra a leaden cannula so that the patient can make water.	0.7141886
In the adherence of the foreskin to the tip of the penis (and this adherence only happens to those whose foreskin is intact, and circumcision is not required; and when adherence happens due to a wound or abscess) you should peel it off with a blunt spatula until the bond is dissolved and the tip of the penis is freed from all parts.	As to the adhesion of the glans to the prepuce (which occurs in him who has his prepuce intact, being under no obligation to be circumcized; sometimes too adhesion may occur by reason of a wound or an abscess) you should scrape it with a flat-nosed scalpel until the adhesion is divided and the glans penis is freed all round from the prepuce.	0.8701775
And if it is difficult to separate them precisely, then you should peel off a part of the tip of the penis and the foreskin with a spatula, and this is because the foreskin, when it is thin, is very easily perforated due to its thinness.	But if the complete separation of the two be difficult then you should dissect away a little of the glans and of the prepuce; for the prepuce is thin, and consequently it is often pierced quickly.	0.7314944
Then separate between the foreskin and the tip of the penis with a thin blade, which has been soaked in cold water so that they do not stick together again.	Separate then between the glans and the prepuce with a piece of fine linen dipped in cold water to prevent further adhesions.	0.7626634
Then treat it with a styptic wine until it is consolidated.	Then let it be dressed with some styptic wine till it heals over.	0.8594301

On the cleaning of children and the treatment of what happens to them after circumcision.	On the circumcision of boys; and the correction of their erroneous treatment.	0.64240825
Circumcision is not a break in continuity like other wounds: but since it is our procedure and our intention, and its use is mainly in children, it is necessary to assign the best operation and the easiest way to lead to health.	Circumcision is nothing but a solution of continuity like other wounds: but as it is a result of our deliberate action, and as it is done particularly to boys, we should plan in this case the very best operation, and the easiest way that leads to safety.	0.82802105
Therefore, I say that the ancients did not describe circumcision in any of their books, because it was not used in their laws, and it is only because we have learned through experience, which is why I have found that most craftsmen and barbers use circumcision and cleaning with a razor and tweezers; and they use ligation with bile and incision with the nail.	Now the Ancients made no mention of circumcision in any of their books, since it was not practised in their religion; but it is something we have acquired by experience. I have myself seen the common run of practitioners and barbers carry it out with razor and with scissors; they use a spindle-whorl, a ligature of thread, and incision by means of the finger-nail.	0.8221454
And I have tried all these methods and found no better cleaning with scissors, ligation with bile than with nail cleaning, because often the upper layer escapes, because the foreskin has two layers, and the lower layer remains, and it is very quickly forced into another incision and sure pain. And with the cleaning done by wrapping, and it is digital, which cobblers use, the incision of the tip of the penis is not ensured, because it very quickly goes into the hole.	I have personally tried all these ways and have not found a better than circumcision with scissors and a thread ligature. For circumcision carried out with the razor is often eluded by the skin; for the skin of the prepuce is of two layers; and often the outer skin is incised and the inner is left intact, so that a second incision is needed, and renewed pain; while when the circumcision is done with a spindle-whorl you are in danger of cutting the tip of the penis, since the tip often goes into the aperture of the whorl.	0.8123239
But with the operation with the nail, you very quickly encounter iron and corrupt your operation. And the child’s foreskin is naturally short, and often it is born in such a way that it does not need cleaning, and I have seen this.	As for circumcision by the finger-nail, the nail will often slip off the skin and your operation be spoilt; or the boy's foreskin may be naturally short, for many are born thus, not needing circumcision. I have seen this myself.	0.7097019
But from the cleaning done with scissors and ligation with bile, the quality, experience revealed to me, because the scissors are of proportional incision, because the sharpness that is above is like the sharpness that is below; and when you press with your hand, two sharp edges are proportionate, and you incise accordingly in one go; and the compression of the bile is made in a shape containing the foreskin of the penis in all parts, with which no error happens at all.	Experience has taught me the superiority of circumcision with the scissors and the thread ligature. For scissors cut evenly, since the upper edge of the scissors is exactly the same as the lower edge; and so, as you compress your hand, thanks to the correspondence of the two blades you cut equally and simultaneously; and you make the girdle of the thread like a wall all round the skin of the tip of the penis: thus no error can occur.	0.8269185
And the way of the first operation is that you make the child stand, especially if it is one who understands a little, so you only tie the bile on his penis and leave it until the next day.	The manner of operating is first to make the boy, especially if he is one who understands a little, imagine that all you are going to do is tie a ligature on the tip of the penis and leave it for another day.	0.7821434
Then make him happy in any way that is possible for you and that he understands. Then make him stand between your hands properly, and not be restless; and hide the scissors in your hand or under your foot, so the child does not see them or any other instruments.	Then amuse him and cheer him as much as you can, according to his intelligence; then stand him upright before you, not sitting; and hide the scissors in your sleeve or under your foot and do not let the boy's eye chance upon that or any other instrument.	0.8610379
Then put your hand on his penis and blow on the foreskin, and pull it until the tip of the penis comes out, and then clean it from any dirt that has accumulated on it.	Then with your hand take hold of the tip of the penis, blow into the foreskin, and draw it back till the glans penis is exposed; then cleanse from it all unclean matter that has collected.	0.85254407
The shape of the scissors for cleaning, this is the shape:	This is the type of scissors most suitable for circumcizing.	0.45172387
One end should be non-cutting and the other should be cutting, so that the ram does not come out of the nail, and the length of the two sharp edges should be equal to the length of the two handles.	They should be fiat-nosed, sharp, with no bend in them, and with the pivot tempered ; and the length of the handles should be equal to that of the blades.	0.58156395
But the error in cleaning is that the entire inner foreskin, or part of it, often escapes towards the incision.	Now the mistake often occurring in circumcision is for the inner layer of skin, either the whole or the part, to be inverted at the cutting.	0.72293425
So you need to stretch it from your time with your nail before the swelling of the area and incise it accordingly.	So you should at the start draw it out with your finger-nail before the place swell; then make an even incision.	0.72666544
And if you cannot hold it with your nail, then extract it with a hook and incise it.	And if you are unable to get a hold with your finger-nail then pick it up with a hook and make your incision.	0.9045136
But if three days have passed, and the area under the penis remains swollen and festering, then leave it until the swelling subsides, and then peel it easily and incise it as you see fit.	If after three days there still remains some inflation and swelling of the part below the tip of the penis, let it be until the effusion subsides, and then gently peel it away and cut it as best you may.	0.791119
And be careful of the tip of the penis, as this will not harm it.	Be careful of the tip of the penis; though if any of the tip is cut away that will do no harm.	0.7339883
And then treat it with what consolidates the wound from the powders we have mentioned in the treatise on powders.	And dress the wound with stimulating medicaments from among the powders that we described in the treatise on powders.	0.83666724
And if the foreskin is incised beyond measure, and it reaches the upper parts, this does not harm it.	Should more of the skin be cut away than necessary and the skin is wrinkled up, that will do no great harm either.	0.5716603
And then treat it with what we have mentioned until it is healed.	Continue such treatment as we have mentioned, until healed.	0.75573134

On the treatment of urine retention in the bladder.	On the treatment of retention of urine.	0.9118316
Urine retention in the bladder is caused by an obstruction from a stone, coagulated blood, pus, or flesh, similar to what we have discussed in the methods of treatment in the division.	Retention of the urine is caused by an obstruction, from a stone or a clot of blood or pus or a fleshy tumour, or similar cause.	0.7569513
And if the urine is not dissolved by what we have said and the cause is severe for the patient, then you must administer extraction with an instrument called a syringe, which has the following shape: It should be made of silver, thin, concave, like a bird’s quill with a fine long ray similar to a palm and a half in length, with a thin tube at its tip.	But if these measures do not free it and the matter is very urgent with the patient, then you should attempt to bring it out with the instrument called a catheter, of which this is the figure. It is made of silver, slender and smooth and hollow like the quill of a bird's feather; as slender as a probe; about a span and a half in length; and with a tiny funnel at the end.	0.7684859
And the method for releasing urine with this is to take double bile and tie wool or cotton at its end for a good binding; insert the ends of the bile into the lower part of the syringe, and cut any excess wool with scissors, then insert it into the tube with force. Then wet the syringe with water and egg white.	This is the manner in which you draw off the urine through it: take a double thread and with a strong knot tie a little wool or cotton on the end, introduce the end of the thread into the lower end of the catheter, and trim off with scissors any superfluous wool, so that it will go into the tube and close it like a tassel. Then smear the catheter with oil or butter or egg-white.	0.81119925
Have the patient sit on a chair, and anoint his bladder and penis with moist oils, olive oil, and rose water.	Make the patient sit down; then anoint the bladder and the meatus of the penis with humid oils or with olive-oil and warm water.	0.79915214
Then insert the syringe gently until it reaches the base of the penis; fold the penis upwards towards the navel; push the syringe into it; and push it until it reaches the bladder, and the patient feels it reaching the empty area, not following this order, but in a winding path.	Then gently introduce the catheter into the urethra until it reaches the root of the urethra. Then turn the end of the penis upward toward the umbilicus; then push the catheter inwards until the curve of the catheter ends, and push the catheter in until it reaches nearly to the seat. Then turn the penis down, with the catheter in it, and push until it reaches the bladder, and the patient now feels that it has entered a hollow.	0.86878574
Then extend the bile with the wool little by little, as the urine soaks into the wool.	Then withdraw rather firmly the thread with the wool plug attached, for the urine follows the wool; then pull it right out and the urine will pour out.	0.58247256
Then extract it and make urine flow for treatment, using the syringe; continue doing this until the bladder is emptied and the patient finds relief.	Apply the catheter again and again until the bladder is emptied and the patient finds relief.	0.6750488

On the quality of bladder clysterization with a clampcedra and similar instruments that are suited for this.	On the manner of irrigating the bladder with a syringe, and the forms of the instruments that serve for that.	0.55277675
When there is an ulcer or abscess in the bladder, or coagulated blood, or it is restricted by putrefaction, and you want to instill waters and medicines, then use an instrument called a clampcedra, which has the following shape:	When there occurs an ulcer in the bladder, or there is a clot of blood or a deposit of pus in it, and you wish to instil into it lotions and medicaments, this is done with the help of an instrument called a syringe.	0.7571578
It has a blind end, meaning it is closed. And in it there are three holes: two on one side, just like you sometimes see.	It is made of silver or ivory, hollow, with a long fine tube, fine as a probe; entirely hollow except for the end, which is solid with three holes in it: two on one side and one on the other, as you see.	0.6283212
At the beginning, there is a concave place, in which what is pushed is, and it should be the right amount to fill it, without addition, so that when something is pulled from it, the moisture is drawn in, and when expelled, it is drawn with it, and when expelled far, just like the clampcedra with which naphtha is shot in naval battles.	The hollow part containing the plunger is exactly of a size to be closed by it, so that any liquid is drawn up with it when you pull it up; and when you press it down it is driven in a jet, as is done by the projector whereby naphtha is thrown in naval battles.	0.65323234
So when you want to inject moisture into the bladder, insert the end of the clampcedra into the moisture, and pull with it what is pushed to the upper parts, as the moisture is drawn into the concavity of the clampcedra.	So when you wish to inject fluid into the bladder, dip the end of the syringe into the fluid and draw up the piston, for the fluid will be drawn up into the cavity of the syringe.	0.7110086
Then insert the end of the clampcedra into the penis as we have described with the syringe; then push the moisture with what you are pushing, as the moisture reaches the bladder quickly, and the patient feels it.	Then introduce the end into the urethra as we described for catheterization; then expel the fluid by means of the piston; the fluid will immediately flow into the bladder and the patient will have a sense of its entry.	0.7921274
The shape of the fine clyster with which the bladder is clysterized, and this is its shape:	This is the illustration of a fine clyster also for irrigation of the bladder.	0.42572784
It should be made of silver or brass, with the top part resembling a small feather, and below it a tube inside a ligature.	It is made of silver or white copper. The upper part of it is like a small funnel and beneath it is a groove where falls the thread of the ligature.	0.81095076
Then take a bladder from a small animal, place in it the moisture you want to inject into the bladder, tie it between two points with a strong double ligature, and heat the moisture over a fire.	Then take a camel's bladder and fill it with whatever fluid you wish to wash the bladder out with, and tie it to the syringe with a strong ligature of double thread between the two ridges.	0.75500375
Then insert the end of the clyster into the penis.	Warm the fluid a little over the fire; then introduce the end of the siphon into the end of the urinary meatus.	0.4448982
Then squeeze your hand over the bladder with the moisture with firm pressure until the patient feels that the moisture has reached the bladder.	Then apply strong pressure to the bladder containing the fluid until the patient can feel the fluid has entered his own bladder.	0.82808137
But if you do not have a bladder available, then take a piece of parchment and make a circle from it; perforate it around its circumference; then insert a strong bile into those holes, as it is rolled; then add the circle so that it is held like a stopper, after you place the moisture you want, and oils and waters in it.	But if you have not a bladder, then take a piece of parchment and cut out a circle; then make holes in the edge all round the circle; then pass a strong ligature through these holes all round and draw the circle in, as a bag is closed with a draw-string, first putting into it whatever fluid, oil, or water, you desire.	0.8922417
Then tie it to the instrument and do with it as you did with the bladder, and squeeze with your hand until the moisture reaches the bladder.	Then tie it to the instrument and do with it as with the camel's bladder, squeezing until the fluid reaches the bladder of the patient.	0.84354925

We have already discussed in the section the types of stones and their treatment with medicines, and the difference between stones formed in the kidneys and those formed in the bladder, and the signs of each.	We have already in the due place reviewed the different kinds of stone and the medical treatment of them. I mentioned too the difference between stones arising in the kidney and those arising in the bladder, and gave all the symptoms of them.	0.86597824
And we have discussed the stones that require manual operation and incision.	I also mentioned the kind of stone to which manipulation and incision are appropriate.	0.6121701
And the stone formed in the bladder is specifically the one that is lodged in the bladder.	This is in particular the stone arising in the bladder, and the sort impacted in the urethra.	0.68276614
And I am describing it here with clear explanation and brevity.	I shall now give a short description of this with a clear explanation and summary.	0.8251686
So, I say that stones formed in the bladder mostly occur in children; and the signs of this are that the urine expelled from the bladder looks like water in its clarity, and sand appears in it; and the patient rubs his penis, often feels pain, and then it becomes erect; and with this, there is pain in the rectum at times.	Now I say that a vesical calculus most frequently occurs in boys. Among the symptoms is that the urine passed out of the bladder is of a thin consistency like water, and sand appears in it; and the patient keeps on rubbing and playing with his penis; and often it hangs flaccid and then is erected; at the same time many of them get a prolapse of the rectum.	0.8616638
And it is easier to cure in children up to the age of fourteen; but it is difficult to cure in the elderly. But in young adults, the cure is intermediate because it is between these stages.	The cure of boys under the age of fourteen years is easy; but the treatment of old people is difficult; and that of young men midway between the two.	0.85123
And in those cases where the stone is larger, the treatment is easier; and if it is small, it is the opposite.	And the larger the stone the easier the cure; with a small stone the cure is otherwise.	0.84503275
So, when we come to treat this, we must first cleanse the patient with a clyster to remove all filth from the bowels; because sometimes this filth prevents the stone from being discovered in the examination.	When we undertake treatment the patient must first have an enema to empty his bowel completely; for sometimes the faeces prevent the calculus being found when it is looked for.	0.80680346
Then, the patient should be taken by the feet and shaken or moved downwards so that the stone descends to the bottom of the bladder, or sometimes moves from a higher place.	Then the patient should be taken by the feet and jarred to and fro and shaken downwards to bring the calculus down into the neck of the bladder; or else let him jump down from a height a number of times.	0.79927844
Then have him sit between your hands, and his hands should be under his thighs, so that the bladder is completely inclined downward.	Then have him sit down upright before you with his hands beneath his thighs, to make the whole bladder incline downwards.	0.8458082
Then examine it thoroughly and completely from the outside.	Then examine him and palpate him externally.	0.7534888
So, if you feel the stone in the space, then proceed immediately with the incision.	If you feel the stone in the empty place, immediately hasten and cut down upon it.	0.6863735
And if you do not find it entirely by touch, then you should oil the index finger of your left hand if the patient is a child, or the middle finger if he is an adult, and insert it into his rectum. And search for the stone until it is under your finger. And gradually move it towards the neck of the bladder.	But if there is not the slightest sign of it to the touch then you should anoint with oil the forefinger of your left hand if it be a boy, or the middle finger if it be a fully grown young man, and introduce it into the anus and search around for the calculus, until, when it comes under the finger, you can work it slowly towards the neck of the bladder.	0.8550015
Then press on it with your finger and push it outward towards the place where you will make the incision.	Then press upon it with your finger and push it outwards toward the place where you wish to make your incision.	0.97048396
And instruct the assistant to press the bladder with his hand; and instruct another assistant to extend the genitals upwards with his right hand, and with his other hand, lift the skin beneath the genitals towards the place where the incision will be made.	And bid an assistant squeeze the bladder with his hand; and bid another assistant raise the scrotum with his left hand and with the other hand stretch the skin under the testicles away from the place where the incision is going to be.	0.91421354
Then insert a well-made spatula, which has the following shape: and cut in the area between the anus and the genitals, not in the middle but towards the left thigh; the incision should be over the stone, with your finger in the rectum, and make a transverse cut so that the external incision is wide and the internal narrow, according to the size needed for the stone to pass through, and no more, because your finger in the rectum will press the stone towards the incision, and it will be expelled without difficulty.	Then do you take a lancet like this and make your incision in the space between the anus and the testicles, not in the mid-line but on the side of the left buttock; and cut down upon the calculus itself, keeping your finger in the anus and pressing it outwards. The incision should be oblique, wide externally and narrowing inwards down to dimensions allowing the exit of the stone, not larger. Now you may press with the finger that is in the anus upon the stone as you make the incision, and it comes out without difficulty.	0.8927655
And know that some stones have angles and edges, making their expulsion difficult.	You should know that sometimes there are stones which have angles and edges, on which account their extraction is difficult.	0.8357909
And some stones are smooth, resembling an acorn, and are round, making their expulsion easy.	Some are smooth like acorns and rounded, and these come out easily.	0.7570085
So if it is one with angles and edges, adjust in the incision.	But in those cases where the stone is rough and angular you should slightly increase the incision.	0.5837003
And if it is not expelled this way, you need to use force, or press on it properly with an instrument similar to a file, to press on the stone without slipping; or use a fine curved instrument from below.	Then if it still will not come out you must then resort to a device— namely to catch hold of it with strong forceps having an extremity like a rasp, to get a tight hold of it so it shall not slip out; or else introduce beneath it a narrow instrument with a crooked end.	0.75377095
But if you cannot manage it this way, then enlarge the opening a little, and if you see bleeding, stop it by applying crushed vitriol.	And if you then cannot get the stone out, widen the incision slightly; and if there is any bleeding stanch it with vitriol.	0.7679235
But if there is more than one stone, first push them towards the neck of the bladder, then cut over it; then push a little further; and do the same if there are many more than two.	If there should be a number of stones first push the largest of them into the neck of the bladder, then cut down upon it; then push a smaller one down after it; and do the same if there be more than two.	0.86371833
And if the stone is very large, it is unwise to make a large incision, because one of two things will happen: either the patient will die or suffer from continuous urine leakage because the area cannot completely heal.	But if the stone be very large it is foolish to make a great incision down upon it; for the result is that the patient either dies or has a chronic urinary fistula because the place will not heal at all.	0.78866506
But try to expel it until it is out, or use forceps to break it into pieces and remove it.	Try rather to manipulate it so that it protrudes; or else attempt to break it up with the forceps so that you can extract it piecemeal.	0.75595355
So when you have completed the operation, fill the wound with a mixture of aloe and dragon's blood, and tighten it. And place a cloth soaked in oil and wine, or in rose oil and cold water, to prevent swelling.	And when you have completed the operation pack the wound with frankincense and aloes and dragon's blood, and bind it up and apply a pad soaked in olive oil and wine or oil of roses and cold water, to reduce the swelling.	0.87885356
Then lay the patient on his back and do not untie the bandage until the third day.	The patient should lie flat on his back and the bindings should not be undone before the third day; and when they are undone foment the place with plenty of oil and water.	0.63064104
When you untie it, wash the area with water and oil, and then treat it with diafinicon and diabasilicon ointments until it is healed.	Then dress it with Palm ointment and basilicon ointment until it heals.	0.58550715
But if in the wound there is a hot, burning, and corrosive swelling, and if it seems like blood is congealed in the bladder, preventing urine flow (this is known by the discharge of blood with urine), then insert your finger into the wound and extract the blood, because if it remains, it will cause the bladder to decay and rot.	If an increasing and cankerous abscess occur in the wound, or anything similar such as clotting of blood within the bladder, with stoppage of the urine (which would be signified by the urine being accompanied by blood) pass your finger into the wound and remove the blood; for if it lies in it it will lead to sepsis and necrosis of the bladder.	0.7388259
Then wash the wound with vinegar, water, and salt, and with anything else that is suitable for healing it until it is healed.	Then wash out the wound with vinegar and water and salt, and apply whatever treatment is suitable for the case until it heals.	0.9277191
And during the whole treatment period, you must bind both thighs and apply the medicines over the area.	Also at all times during treatment his hips should be bound and kept together so that the medicaments applied to the place may not be disturbed.	0.6486162
And if the stone is small and lodged in the urethra, blocking urine flow, treat it as I described before attempting surgery, because sometimes this treatment alone can avoid surgery; and I have already tested this method, which involves using a perforating iron tool shaped like this:	Now if the calculus be small and be impacted in the opening of the urinary passage, preventing the exit of the urine, treat it with the means I am about to describe before you go on to make your incision, for often I have found this treatment suffice without incision; I have experience of this. You take a drill of the finest steel, of this shape.	0.8461462
With a triangular, sharp tip, set in a wooden handle.	It should be triangular at the point and sharp, with a wooden handle.	0.7494358
Then take a string, and tie it around the penis below the stone so it does not return to the bladder.	Then take a thread and with it bind the penis beneath the calculus to prevent the stone from returning to the bladder.	0.8840275
Next, insert the iron tool into the penis, perforating easily until the tool reaches the stone. Then rotate the tool with your hand on the stone little by little, forcing the perforation until you penetrate the other side; the urine will be immediately released.	Then introduce the iron of the drill gently into the meatus until the drill reaches the stone itself, and then very very gently revolve the drill upon the stone with your hand, and try to perforate it, till you pierce it through to the other side. Then the urine will at once be released.	0.88446826
Then press your hand on the remaining part of the stone from outside the penis, because it will be broken and expelled with the urine, and the patient will be healed.	Then, with your hand outside the penis, squeeze the remains of the stone, and they will crumble and be washed out by the urine and the patient will be cured.	0.9001621
But if this treatment is not possible for some reason, then tie one string below the stone and another above it. Then make an incision over the stone in the penis between the two ties. Then extract the stone. Then untie the bindings and clean the congealed blood that has formed in the wound.	But if this treatment is not possible for you on account of some impediment, then tie a thread beneath the stone and another above; then make an incision down upon the stone in the penis itself between the two ligatures, extract it, then undo the ligature and clean away the blood that has clotted in the wound.	0.9440594
The binding below the stone is only necessary to prevent it from returning to the bladder, and the one above is needed because when the string is untied after the stone's extraction, the skin returns to its place and covers the wound.	The purpose of the ligature beneath the stone is lest it return to the bladder; and the purpose of the one above it is that when you loosen the ligature after removing the stone the skin may fall back into place so as to cover the wound.	0.81404155
Therefore, it is necessary that when you tie the string above, you pull the skin upwards, so it covers the wound as we have described.	On this account, when you tie the upper ligature, you will have to raise the skin so that when you have finished operating it may go back and cover the wound as we have said.	0.7514944
Chapter 61.	CHAPTER SIXTY-ONE.	0.5640953
On the extraction of stones in women.	On the extraction of a stone from the female.	0.85120887
Stones in women are rarely formed.	It is very uncommon for women to have stone.	0.80690765
But if a woman does develop stones, the treatment is difficult and hindered in many ways.	But if it should happen to a woman the treatment is indeed difficult and is hindered by a number of things.	0.81136894
One reason is that a woman can easily become virgin again.	One is that the woman may be a virgin.	0.6983305
The second reason is that you rarely find a woman knowledgeable enough to expose herself to a physician whether she is chaste or married.	Another is that you will not find a woman who will expose herself to a (male) doctor if she be chaste or married.	0.71155155
The third reason is that you do not find many women who know this art, especially the manual operation.	A third is that you will not find a woman competent in this art, particularly not in surgery.	0.76511693
The fourth reason is that the site for incision in women is far from the stone, requiring a deep incision, which is frightening.	Then a fourth is that the place for cutting upon the stone in a woman is a long way from where the stone lies, so the incision has to be deep, which is dangerous.	0.7849361
But if necessity compels you to this, you must find a knowledgeable female physician, who is rare.	If necessity compels you to this kind of case, you should take with you a competent woman doctor.	0.70305574
But if you lack one, seek a skilled and subtle midwife, or present a well-instructed matron in women's matters, or a woman who has recently learned this art.	As these are very uncommon, if you are without one then seek a eunuch doctor as a colleague, or bring a midwife experienced in women's ailments or a woman to whom you may give some instruction in this art.	0.7125555
Then bring her forward, and command her to do everything you instruct, starting with the investigation of the stone; if the woman is a virgin, she must put her finger in her anus and seek the stone.	Have her with you and bid her do all that you enjoin; first of all, in searching for the stone. If she perceive that the woman is a virgin she should pass her finger into the anus and palpate for the stone.	0.8345351
If she finds it, she must hold it with her finger, and then you instruct her to make an incision over it.	If she finds it and keeps her finger on it, then bid her cut down upon it.	0.8179435
But if she is not a virgin, instruct the matron to insert her finger into the patient's vagina and search for the stone while placing her left hand on the bladder, pressing firmly.	But if the patient be not a virgin bid the midwife pass her finger into the vulva and palpate for the stone, after she has placed her left hand upon the bladder and applied a good pressure.	0.8351423
If she finds it, she must carefully move it from the bladder opening downward with the utmost care until it reaches the root of the thigh.	If she finds the stone she should gradually push it down from the outlet of the bladder as far as she can until it reaches the bottom of the pelvis.	0.7925175
Then make an incision at the middle of the vagina near the root of the thigh on whichever side the stone is located, and the finger must not be removed from the stone, holding it below.	Then she should cut down upon it from about the middle of the pudenda near the root of the hip on whichever side she can conveniently feel it; she must keep her finger on the stone, pressing from below.	0.75985944
The incision should be small at first; then insert the probe into the incision, and if you feel the stone, adjust the incision according to the size needed to extract the stone.	The incision should start by being small; then let her introduce a sound into the small incision, and when she finds the stone then she will enlarge the incision until she knows that it is big enough for the exit of the stone.	0.7787039
And know that there are many types of stones: some are small and large, smooth and rough, long and round, and with branches.	You should know that there are many kinds of calculus: some are large and some are small; smooth and rough; long, rounded, and pronged.	0.8333589
So you should know the types to determine the best approach.	Learn to recognize these types and you will have an indication of what to do.	0.5820855
If you see blood flow, apply powdered vitriol to the area and hold it for an hour until the bleeding stops, then resume the operation until the stone is extracted.	If you are hindered by a haemorrhage, scatter powdered vitriol on the place and keep it there for a time until the haemorrhage has ceased, and then return to your operating until the stone is out.	0.8399944
Prepare the instruments mentioned for extracting stones in men, to assist you in the operation.	See also that you have ready the instruments mentioned for the extraction of stone from the male, to assist you in operating.	0.8273641
If you see blood flow, and know that it is from the artery being cut, then apply powder to the area and tighten it with bandages and pressure, do not repeat it; leave the stone and do not extract it, as the patient may die. Then treat the wound.	If you are hindered by a haemorrhage and you know, by the spurting of the blood, that it comes from an artery that has been cut, then put styptic powder on the place and bind up tightly with bandages and leave it and do not come back to it; let the stone be and do not extract it, for often that loses the patient; then dress the wound.	0.814945
When the bleeding has stopped after a few days, and the area has healed, you can return to the operation until the stone is extracted.	And after some days, when the acute haemorrhage has subsided and suppuration has set in, return to your operating until you get the stone out.	0.7981138
Chapter 62.	CHAPTER SIXTY-TWO.	0.5886768
On the section about watery hernia.	On opening a watery hernia.	0.5789156
Watery hernia is merely an accumulation of moisture in the white sac which is under the covering of the genitals containing the testicle, and it is called the sac.	A watery hernia is a collection of fluid in the white membrane lying beneath the skin surrounding the testicle, which is called the scrotum.	0.846224
And sometimes it is in the proper membrane that nature prepared in the testicle area, making it appear as though there is another testicle; and it is the genital covering between the white sac we mentioned, and it is merely solid matter.	Sometimes it has a capsule of its own which nature has formed alongside the testis so that one would think it another testicle; it may also form between the skin of the scrotum and the white membrane which we mentioned; however, this occurs very rarely.	0.7324877
The generation of this hernia is due to weakness occurring in the genitals, causing this material to accumulate there, and sometimes it occurs from a blow to the genitals.	This hernia arises from a weakness occurring in the testicles and this matter drains into it; sometimes it happens from a blow upon the testicles.	0.84587336
This moisture has many colors, either yellowish, blood-like, red, black and foul, or watery white, which is the most common.	The fluid is of different colours, sometimes yellowish, sometimes blood-red, sometimes like lees, black, and sometimes the fluid is watery-pale; this actually is the commonest.	0.8123301
The signs by which this accumulation of water is known are these: if it is in the white sac, the swelling is round, slightly elongated like the shape of an egg, and the genitals appear so because the moisture surrounds it entirely.	Now these are the signs whereby we know where the fluid is collecting: if it be in the tunica albugínea, as we have said, the tumour will be round and slightly elongated like the shape of an egg. The testis is not apparent since the fluid hems it in all round.	0.76416004
If the moisture is in the membrane itself, the swelling is round with part of the testicle, and thus it is thought to be another testicle.	But if the fluid be contained in a capsule of its own the tumour will be round, to one side of the testicle; therefore one imagines that it is another testicle.	0.7319282
If the moisture is between the genital covering and the white sac, it falls below the perception.	If the fluid be situated between the skin of the scrotum and the tunica albugínea it will be obvious to the touch.	0.61103225
When you want to determine the color of the moisture, you test the color of the moisture in the swelling with a square probe; and based on what comes out in the mark from the probe, you judge what is inside.	If you wish to know the colour of the fluid, take a sample from the tumour by means of the four-sided exploring needle which has been figured previously; and by what comes out in the track of the explorer you may know the colour of the contained fluid.	0.75043666
When we come to treating it with surgery, we should instruct the patient to be bled if possible, and cleanse his body fully.	When we begin operative treatment the patient should be told to be venesected, if possible, if you see that he is of a plethoric bodily habit.	0.67328614
Then let him lie on his back on a slightly elevated surface, and place many cloths under him.	Then let him lie on his back upon something a little raised, and have a heap of material placed beneath him.	0.8314783
Sit on his left side, and instruct the assistant to be on his right side, who will extend his penis to one of two sides to the covering of the genitals and the lower part of the abdomen.	Then sit down on his left side, and bid an assistant sit on his right side and draw out his penis toward one side or other of the scrotum and toward the hypogastrium.	0.7832526
Then take a broad knife and cut the genital covering in the middle along its length down to near the pubic bone.	Then take a broad scalpel and make a longitudinal incision in the scrotum, from the middle almost to the pubes.	0.80789125
The incision should be made straight and equally distant from the line dividing the skin of the genitals, until it reaches the white sac.	The incision should be straight, on a parallel with the median raphe of the scrotum, down to the tunica albuginea, and dissect away from it carefully lest you cut it.	0.62810826
Expose it, and be careful not to cut it; your exposure of it should be done delicately, suspending the testicle more and carefully inspecting it according to the amount possible.	You should dissect chiefly on the side where the testicle is most adherent, and take your dissection as far as possible.	0.61567235
Then perforate the water-filled sac with a wide opening and extract all the water.	Then open up the membrane containing the fluid with a wide perforation and draw off all the fluid.	0.8600056
Separate the two lips of the incision with hooks, and extend the sac to the upper parts; do not touch the covering of the genitals, and cut the sac as much as possible. Cut it entirely or in pieces, especially its delicate side, because if you do not carefully cut it, there is no guarantee that the water will not return.	Then with hooks separate the two edges of the incision and draw the membrane upwards but do not touch the skin overlying the testes; then cut away the membrane in whatever way is possible, either as a whole or piecemeal, particularly the side piece; for unless you use the utmost diligence in cutting it away you cannot be certain that the fluid will not come back.	0.8460006
But if the testicle comes out of its covering during your operation, once you have completed the incision of the sac, return it inside, and then join the two lips of the genital covering with sutures, and treat it like any other wound until it heals.	If the testicle should protrude from its covering of skin while you are operating, return it when you have finished cutting the membrane; then bring together the two edges of your incision with a suture. Then dress with the usual dressings for wounds until healed.	0.7869288
If you find the testicle is corrupted by another disease, you must tie the vessels on the suspensory cord, remove the testicle, and treat it as previously mentioned.	If you find the testicle corrupted by some other disease, you will have to tie off the vessels which are in the suspensor, for fear of haemorrhage. Then cut the testicle from the suspensor and remove it and dress as we said above.	0.7851709
If the water is accumulated in two separate parts, know that there are two hernias; make the incision in that part as you did in the other; if it appears to be a single operation, then do it.	If the accumulation of fluid be on both sides you may know it to be a double hydrocele; so make another incision on the other side as you did for the first. If it is convenient for you to make one operation of it, do so.	0.79356575
Then cleanse the blood, and place wool soaked in oil or rose oil in the incisions; place other wool soaked in wine and oil outside, spread it over the two genitals and the lower abdomen; place folded cloths and powders on top, and bind them with a bandage in this manner:	Then wipe away the blood and apply to the incisions wool that has been soaked in olive-oil or oil of roses and on that again more wool that has been soaked in wine and oil, and spread that over the testicles and over the hypogastrium; and over that again folded pieces of linen forming pads and bind them down with a bandage having six heads. Two pieces of cloth should be taken and sewn together and packed in between with carded wool to this pattern.	0.84902513
Take two cloths and fill them with carded wool as follows; make ends of cotton or damp wool, attach them with a structure in the breech of the trousers, one end from the bottom to the back, the second end to the lower part of the abdomen, two ends over the thighs below, and two other ends over the groins, and adjust the whole structure in the breech of the trousers.	Two pieces of cloth should be taken and sewn together and packed in between with carded wool to this pattern. The ends by means of which it is attached should be made of cotton or soft wool and should be drawn tight at the waist of the breeches. One of the ends you take over the seat toward the back: the second end you take toward the pubes, the two ends round the thighs below, and the remaining two ends over the groin, and the whole is bound up tight with the belt of the breeches.	0.8551165
Sometimes this hernia is treated artificially with cautery instead of surgical cutting; take a subtle knife-like cautery and incise the covering of the genitals, ignite it as we have described until the white sac containing the water is exposed, then take the cautery in this shape: It is shaped like a Greek letter.	This rupture may also be treated by cautery instead of surgery. This will mean taking a knife-edged cautery and cutting with it the skin of the testicles; it should be hot, as we told you before, and used until the white membrane covering the hydrocele be exposed. Then take another cautery of this type, which resembles the Greek letter tau; and with it perforate that membrane.	0.7419321
Then pierce the sac with it, ignite it until all the moisture is expelled.	It should be hot so as to draw out all the humidity.	0.524982
Extend the sac with hooks, and expose it with hooks, and expose it with a subtle ignited cautery; cut it as much as possible until you eradicate everything; take care not to let the fire touch the testicle.	Then stretch the membrane with hooks, dissect away the capsule with the cautery and cut it away as best you are able until you have completely removed it. But be careful that the heat do not touch the testicle.	0.70493793
Know that this operation is safer and less prone to blood flow, and better than surgery with cutting.	You should know that this operation is safer, further removed from the danger of haemorrhage, and better, than operation by incision.	0.86785793
But if a hot swelling opposes you during the cutting or cautery operation, or if there is a flow of blood, you must treat the opposition accordingly, with the treatment appropriate for it as mentioned.	If, while operating either with the knife or the cautery, you are hindered by an inflammatory swelling or haemorrhage or anything else, you should deal with all of them by suitable treatment in accordance with what has been said before.	0.74443716
But if the patient is fearful and does not endure the second operation due to its horror, administer a perforation as I describe here; this is when it is confirmed by you, from what we have said about the signs, that this hernia is watery.	If the patient be timid and will not suffer this operation on account of its unpleasantness, then treat by perforation as I shall now describe.	0.7380997
Then have the patient sit on an elevated seat, pierce the swelling at its lowest part with a broad knife, and make the perforation along the length of the body.	When by the signs we have mentioned you are certain that the hernia is watery, you should seat the patient on a high chair and pierce the tumour in its lower part with a broad scalpel.	0.6293474
The opening should be wide enough to drain all the water.	The perforation should run in the long axis of the body, and it should be an ample opening to let all the fluid run out.	0.71049017
Then place cotton over the area, bind it, and leave it, so that the remaining water drains. Then treat it until the wound is healed.	Then put cotton on the place and bind it on and leave it so as to soak up the rest of the fluid; then dress the wound until it heals.	0.90615356
But if there is opposition to the drainage of the water when you pierce it, this is because the white membrane in the wound opening opposes and prevents the exit of the water, you must insert a plug or instrument used to extract water from dropsy, as previously described; or adjust a small instrument in the wound opening.	But if the fluid fail to flow out when the opening is made, which would be due to the tunica albuginea's obtruding into the opening and preventing the outlet of the fluid, you should then introduce into the wound a goose-quill or an instrument such as is used for ascites, already described; or else the opening should be widened a little.	0.75405467
Know that the water returns, and it is accumulated around six months or thereabouts; when it is accumulated, pierce it in the same manner, as the patient will thus live out his days.	But you should know that after six months or so the fluid may come back and collect again; when it does so, perforate him in exactly the same manner; so will the patient prolong his life.	0.76792336
Chapter 63.	CHAPTER SIXTY-THREE.	0.5600095
On the section about fleshy hernia and its treatment.	On cutting for a fleshy hernia and its treatment.	0.8720416
Know that in the section on this hernia, there is fear leading to ruin in major cases; therefore, I find that abandoning it and being saved from it is better.	You should know that cutting for this kind of hernia has an uncertain outcome and in most cases results in death; and therefore I think it better to let it be and to safeguard the patient.	0.7067236
I am recalling the operation on it and the types of swellings.	However, I shall mention the manner of operating for this and all kinds of tumour.	0.7032469
I say that the swellings occur in bodies whose genitals are affected and this happens for many reasons: either by an acute sour excess, which is poured into the genitals, or by a blow.	Now I say that many tumours arise from the bodies composing the testicles; and this from several causes. It may be from an acrid superfluity running down into the testicles, or from a blow.	0.7962521
The color of the swelling matches the body color, and it is not painful, but it is a serious swelling.	The colour of the tumour will be like that of the rest of the body and there is no water to it.	0.51375306
Often the swelling becomes stone-like, its color is dark, and it has no sensation.	The lump will be solid and often will be stony hard, of a dark colour, and without sensation.	0.73831403
Sometimes it occurs by blockage of the arteries, and by swelling of them as has already been mentioned, or by swelling of veins.	Sometimes also it arises from a knotting and inflation of the arteries, as has been mentioned, or from an inflation of the veins.	0.85974646
What is caused by swelling of arteries is known by the dispersal of the swelling when you press it with your fingers; it should not be touched.	The sort arising from a swelling of the arteries may be recognized by a dispersal of the lump when you press upon it with your fingers; this should not be interfered with at all.	0.8836913
What is caused by swelling of veins is not dispersed at all by compression with fingers.	The sort arising from a swelling of the vein will not disperse when you press upon it with your fingers.	0.8144676
It is possible to make an incision on this type and on other fleshy parts; you must cut the genital covering, extend the testicle to the upper parts, remove it from the white sac, free the suspensory cord from the vessels, tie them, and cut the suspensory cord as you free it from all parts of the testicle.	It is sometimes possible to cut down on this kind and also on the other fleshy tumours thus: make an incision in the skin of the testicles; then draw the testicle upward and out of the tunica albuginea, and free the suspensor from the vessels and tie the vessels, and cut the suspensor after you have freed it from all round the testicle.	0.8036995
If the testicle is consolidated with those fleshy parts, you must remove and cut it.	Should it happen that the testicle is adherent to the fleshy growth, you will have to cut away the testicle itself and remove it.	0.6874622
If there is adhesion to any part of the sac, or to the vessels, you must free all that adhesion and cut it with a circular incision.	But should the adhesion have formed somewhere inside the membranes or in the space between the vessels, then you must free the adhesion as a whole and cut it away with a circular incision.	0.7414222
If there is a growth of flesh in the place of the adhesion which is behind, you must cut all of it and remove the testicle as we have said.	If the fleshy growth should be at the site of the junction which is behind, you will have to cut the whole thing away and remove the testicle as we have said.	0.93207616
When your operation is complete, fill the wound with wool soaked in rose oil and wine; then treat it with the other treatment until it is healed.	And when your operation is finished, pack the wound with wool moistened with oil of roses and wine; then dress in the usual manner until healed.	0.8610407

On the treatment of hernia caused by veins.	On the treatment of hernia with varix.	0.7898376
Vein swelling is a swelling surrounded by a wrap similar to a shoot with softening of the testicles, making movement, exercise, and walking difficult for the patient.	A varix is a twisted tumour resembling a cluster of grapes, with relaxation of the testicles, which makes movement and exercise and walking difficult for the patient.	0.80207825
Treating this illness is feared because of the previously mentioned reasons.	The treatment of this condition is of uncertain outcome, akin to those conditions just spoken of.	0.5236862
However, we must describe the operation on it as the first did.	Nevertheless we must describe the operation for this condition as it was performed by the Ancients.	0.72635114
I say that you should have the patient sit on an elevated seat; push the testicular suspensory to the lower parts; hold the genital covering with your fingers along with the vessels attached to the penis; another assistant should hold and stretch them vehemently.	So I begin by saying that you must have the patient sitting upon a high seat; then push down the suspensor of the testicles and take hold of the skin of the testicles with your fingers together with the blood-vessels near the penis; then let your assistant take hold instead of you and draw out strongly.	0.8581589
Then cut with a sharp broad knife transversely over the vessels until they are exposed.	Then with a broad sharp scalpel make an oblique incision in the direction of the vessels so that the vessels are laid bare.	0.74142987
Expose all parts as we have described for artery extraction in the temples.	Then dissect on all sides in the same way as I told you for extracting the temporal vessels.	0.58030236
Insert a needle with a double thread into them, tie it at the first place where the vein problem occurs, and tie it again at the end of them. Then cut them in the middle with a straight incision along the length of the body, and remove what is accumulated of fetid and corrupt humors.	Then run through them a needle doubly threaded and tie at the spot where the varix begins and tie it again where the varix ends, then cut through the varix in the middle with an incision at right angles to the length of the body and draw out the turbid corrupt humidity that has gathered in it.	0.7937589
Then treat the wound as you would other wounds where you want healing to be produced, so that the vessels nourishing one of the two testicles fall off, for there is no harm in this.	Then dress the wound with the wound dressings usual where you wish to encourage suppuration, so that the vessels nourishing the one testicle may perish; there is no harm in that.	0.78516203
But if the vein problem affects all the vessels, the testicles must be removed or the testicles and vessels should be closed off, depriving them of all nourishment through vessel incision, and they should be atrophied, or closed off so they are not beneficial.	But if all the vessels are varicose then you will have to remove one testicle with its vessels lest the testicle be deprived of nourishment through cutting into the vessels; for it will wither and be of no use.	0.72919947
Chapter 65.	CHAPTER SIXTY-FIVE.	0.6090057
On the treatment of intestinal hernia.	On the treatment of intestinal hernia.	0.99999994
The occurrence of this hernia is due to a tear that happens in the sac extended over the abdomen from the parts of the inguinal regions, causing the intestines to descend through that rupture to some of the intestines.	This hernia is due to a split occurring in the membrane stretched from the hypogastrium over the belly in the region of the groin. Through this opening the bowel descends upon one of the testes; this opening is due to the membrane's splitting or stretching.	0.7518392
And this rupture is either of the sac or its extension, and these two types occur for many reasons: either from a blow, or a jump, or shouting, or lifting something heavy, or similar.	And these two kinds occur from a number of causes: from a blow or jumping or shouting, or lifting a heavy weight, or a similar cause.	0.87951344
The sign of this, when it is due to an extension of the sac, is that it happens little by little over a long time, and does not happen suddenly, and it is a swelling similar to a tumor because the sac compresses the intestine.	The symptoms of it, when it arises from a stretching of the membrane, are that it is a slow and chronic development and does not happen on a sudden, and the swelling is even and deep down, because the membrane is pressing the bowel.	0.7804146
The sign of it is when it is due to a tear in the sac, because initially it causes sudden intense pain; and it is a different swelling apparent below the surface, and this is due to the protrusion of the intestine, with its body outside the sac.	When it is due to a split in the membrane, the signs will be that it starts with a sudden severe pain, and the lump varies in consistency, appearing close under the skin; that is due to the emergence of the bowel and its passage outside the membrane.	0.796175
Sometimes the membrane is pushed out with the intestine, and this is called an intestinal hernia with a membrane.	Sometimes also the omentum comes out with the bowel, and this hernia is called intestinal and omental; sometimes it contains wind.	0.692158
Sometimes it is formed with gas, and sometimes it runs into the crack of the intestine, where it is retained, causing great harm to the patient, and sometimes it causes severe pain, especially when pressed.	Sometimes also the excrement comes down with the bowel and gets held up there, and this involves the patient's death, for thence arises an intractable pain and borborygmi, specially when pressed upon.	0.70904255
And in the treatment of these types of this disease with iron there is fear, so it must be avoided.	The treatment of the varieties of this disease with the knife is dangerous; so be cautious of rushing at it.	0.68171746
And the way to perform the operation is to instruct the patient to push the intestine back with his hand into its cavity if it responds to its return, then he should be inverted over his neck between your hands, and you raise his legs.	The manner of operating is to bid the patient reduce the bowel back into the belly if it be disposed to return, then lie back before you and raise his legs.	0.79167277
Then stretch the covering that encloses the testicles to the upper parts, and cut the covering of the testicles lengthwise; then place hooks in the two edges of the incision as you need to open the incision with them.	Then do you stretch upward the skin adjacent to the groin, and cut the whole length of the skin of the testicles; then attach to the edges of the incision as many hooks as are necessary to open the incision.	0.82625103
And if the incision is according to the size that it is possible for you that from there the testicle is pushed out.	The incision should be sufficiently large to allow the testicle to be drawn out.	0.52236176
Then peel off that sac which is below the covering of the testicles, until the hard white sac is exposed on each side.	Then dissect away the tissues that lie beneath the skin of the scrotum so that the hard tunica albugínea be exposed all round.	0.7043469
Then insert your finger into what encloses the testicle, into what is between the white sac, which is below the covering of the testicle, and between the second sac, and release with it the adhesion that is on the back of the testicle.	Then introduce your forefinger in around the testis in the space between the white membrane beneath the skin of the testicle and the second membrane, and with your forefinger free the attachment at the back of the testicle.	0.86867636
Then move the covering of the testicles to the outside with your hand, and with that stretch the white sac upwards with your left hand, and lift the testicle with the sac to the incision site; instruct your assistant to stretch the testicle upwards and you dissolve the adhesion that is behind with complete separation.	Then with your right hand explore within the scrotum and fold back the covering of the testicles, at the same time stretching the tunica albugínea upwards with the left hand, and bring the testis with the membrane up into the opening, and bid your assistant to stretch the testis upwards; and do you fully free it from the posterior attachment.	0.84271693
And check with your fingers that there is no part of the intestine wrapped in the hard white sac. But if you find any part of it, then push it back to the abdomen below.	Feel with your finger that there be no part of the intestine that has got twisted within the tough white membrane; and should you find any push it back into the abdomen.	0.8063091
Then cut the part below the covering of the testicles with an incision from which blood and healing fluid will flow as we have described before.	Then make a counter-incision in the lower part of the skin of the testicles, to let the blood and matter drain away as we bade you before.	0.7888904
Then apply wool soaked in oil, and place it on the wound; and apply the binding we mentioned (and sometimes the white sac is cauterized, as we have said near the incision to prevent blood flow, because this often happens) and leave the binding until it falls off by itself.	Then apply wool soaked in oil to the wound, and the bandage that we prescribed (sometimes also the white membrane that we spoke about is cauterized after the incision to forestall haemorrhage, for that usually happens) and let the ligatures be until they fall away spontaneously.	0.92754734
But if its removal is delayed, then it should be soaked with hot water and placed on it until it falls off as we have said.	If they are slow in coming away, then foment with hot water and apply something to sweat them off.	0.51693857

In this hernia, no one has been seen to be daring enough to treat it with iron.	I have not seen anyone pluck up enough courage to attempt the operative treatment of this kind of rupture.	0.6049889
And the first ones said that it is done as we have described in the hernia with life; which is that you tie the vessels near the incision over it easily; then dry the area around the swelling with something that opens it, until the vessels fall off.	The Ancients indeed said it ought to be done in the same way as hernia with varicocele; namely, to ligate the blood-vessels after cutting down upon them, gently, and lower down. Then make an incision in the middle and apply to the tumour such things as will keep it open until the blood-vessels fall away.	0.6790133
And treat the wound as we have said until it is healed.	And dress the wound in the manner we have already mentioned until it heals.	0.9162346

On the rupture that occurs in the groin.	On the treatment of the rupture that occurs in the groin.	0.80480444
Sometimes a rupture occurs in the groin as we have said, and the place swells.	Sometimes there occurs a rupture in the groin as we have said, and the part protrudes.	0.8796898
And it does not leave any cause from the intestines to the genitals; and if it does, it is little; and it returns at all times.	No portion of the intestine descends into the scrotum; or if anything it will be only a tiny portion and will reduce at any time.	0.6494424
But if time is prolonged with this, a fissure is formed in the sac in which the intestine descends into the sac; and this happens because of the extension of the sac that is in the groin as we have said, which causes the sac to be stretched, and then it becomes softened and the place is swollen and enlarged.	But if it goes on for a long time the rupture in the membrane increases until the bowel and omentum descend into the scrotum. It arises from a stretching of the membrane in the groin, as we said; the membrane stretches and then relaxes and the place swells.	0.8286107
And the treatment of it is with cautery as previously described.	Its treatment by the cautery is as I have already described.	0.76940125
And sometimes it is treated with iron in this manner: and the patient lies on his back between your hands, then dry the place of the rupture from the swelling with an incision across it according to the width of three fingers.	Sometimes also it is treated with the knife in this manner: With the patient lying back before you, make an incision three fingers wide, transversely across the swelling of the rupture which projects.	0.7816645
Then stretch the white sac that is under the covering until it is exposed.	Then perforate the subcutaneous tissues so as to expose the white membrane that lies under the skin alongside the rupture.	0.7025641
Then take a rod and place it on the swollen area of the sac, and press it to the belly button.	Take a probe and place it upon the projecting part of the fascia and push it back into the depths of the abdomen.	0.6458106
Then sew the two swollen areas over the end of the rod of the sac, and join them with the suture.	Then sew together the two swollen portions of membrane over the end of the probe and suture the one to the other.	0.8031595
Then remove the end of the rod, and do not cut the sac completely, nor extend the testicle, nor any other part as I let you know in the treatment of intestinal hernia.	Then take out the probe. On no account make the incision into the fascia nor touch the testis nor anything else, as I taught you on the subject of treating the intestinal hernia.	0.7632554
Then treat it with wound care, and when you cut the threads, clean it and restore the wound until it is healed; because the sac is contracted and the rupture is not swollen.	Then dress the wound, and when the stitches come apart remove them and bandage the wound again until it is healed over. For the membrane will draw together and the rupture will not come out again.	0.770582
And cautery is better in this place, because it is closer to health.	But the cautery is better at this spot, for it is safer.	0.7468635

On the softening of the covering of the testicles.	On the loosening of the skin of the scrotum.	0.8191796
Sometimes the covering of the testicles in some men is softened because the flesh between it is softened, and its care is unpleasant.	In some men there often occurs a loosening of the skin of the scrotum without any loosening of the organs within. This has a horrible appearance.	0.5984401
Then it is necessary for the one who is asked to treat it to make the patient lie on his back, and cut all the covering that is softened over the natural covering; then join the two edges with the suture.	He who desires to treat this condition should make the patient lie on his back; and he should cut away all the loose skin that is over and above the normal. Then he should bring together the two edges of the incision with a suture.	0.8330151
And if you want, sew at the beginning the excess of the softened covering with three or four stitches and a firm suture.	Or, if you prefer, first suture the excess of loose skin together, with three or four stitches, and make the suture firm.	0.84842944
Then cut between the sutures; and then treat it as with other wounds until it is healed and the threads fall off.	Then cut away what is taken up between the stitches. Then dress the wound with the usual dressings till it heals and the stitches come away.	0.76962197
Chapter 69.	CHAPTER SIXTY-NINE.	0.59418154
On castration.	On castration.	0.9999998
You should know that castration in our law is excommunicated, but for a reason it is allowed for me to remember it in this book; and its remembrance is necessary only for two reasons, one is so that it is in the knowledge of the doctor when asked about it, that he knows the treatment for the one it happens to; and the other reason is that we often need to castrate other animals for our benefit, such as horses, goats, pigs, and similar animals.	Castration is forbidden in our law and I ought therefore to make no mention of it in my book. But I must speak of it for two reasons. One reason is that it should be part of the doctor's medical knowledge when asked about it, and that he should know how to treat anyone whom it befalls. Another reason is that often we need to castrate certain animals for the sake of the benefits that accrue from them, such as rams, he-goats and cats, and such animals.	0.88727146
So I say that castration is done in two ways: either by attrition, or by incision and cutting.	So I say that castration can be performed in two ways: either by contusion; or by opening up and cutting away.	0.9100841
But in the one that is done by attrition, the way of the operation is that we make the animal sit in hot water until its genitals are softened and relaxed and hang down. Then take them in your hand until they are dissolved and do not appear under touch.	The method by contusion is that we make the animal sit in warm water until his testes are relaxed and become soft and pendent; then rub them with your hand until they are so loosened that they are no longer palpable.	0.79038453
But in castration done by incision and cutting, you need to hold the animal and press the covering of its testicles with your left hand.	As to castration by open operation and excision, the animal should be held and pressure put upon the scrotum with the left hand.	0.7701802
Then tie the suspensory, and cut over each testicle with an incision until both testicles protrude.	Then tie the spermatic cord and with one incision cut down upon both testicles so that both are brought up out of the scrotum.	0.7933761
Then cut those more that you have exposed. And do not leave any part of the sac on them, except the subtle sac that is over the bases.	After dissecting them away cut them off; do not leave any of the coverings upon them except the thin membrane covering the vessels.	0.701533
And this manner of castration is better than the one done by attrition, because strong attrition leaves some part of the testicles that causes the animal to desire mating.	This manner of castration is better than the contusion method, for contusion often leaves something of the testicles, and the animal desires to couple.	0.7503941

On the treatment of hermaphroditism.	On the treatment of the hermaphrodite.	0.9558935
Hermaphroditism in men is in two ways: one is when it appears in the space in the covering of the testicles, in that between the two testicles there is a figure like a female vulva in which there is hair.	There are two kinds of male hermaphrodite: one has the appearance as of female pudenda with hair in the region of the perineum; the other has the same in the skin of the scrotum between the testes.	0.8161595
And sometimes from it flows urine which is in the covering of the testicles.	Sometimes also urine is excreted through that which is in the skin of the scrotum.	0.76833755
But in women it is one type: and it is that the vulva of the woman above the pubis is like two testicles of a man a little extending outward like the foreskin of a man and two testicles.	There is also one kind among women, in which there is, above the female pudenda, on the pubes, what resembles the male organs. These are small indeed, but protuberant, one being like the penis and the two others like testicles.	0.7730489
And the treatment is of three types: two for men and one type for women. And it is that you need to cut those attached flesh until the appearance of it is removed, then treat them with wound care.	This is the treatment of all three kinds, that is, two male and one female: the superfluous growths must be cut away so that every trace is destroyed; then the usual treatment for wounds should be applied until they are healed.	0.7724823
And in the second type in men from which urine flows that is in the covering of the testicles, there is no treatment or operation for it.	As to the second kind, in man, where the opening is in the scrotum and the urine runs out of it, there is no operation for this, and no cure.	0.8357596

On lentigo and protruding flesh from causes in women.	On cutting the clitoris and fleshy growths in the female genitalia.	0.6397842
Lentigo is often joined to natural causes when it is stressed and made the target of attention; and sometimes it is enlarged in some women to the extent that it spreads like in men and becomes involved in intercourse.	The clitoris may grow in size above the order of nature so that it gets a horrible deformed appearance; in some women it becomes erect like the male organ and attains to coitus.	0.5505706
Then you need to hold the excess of lentigo with your hand or with a hook and cut it.	You must grasp the growth with your hand or a hook and cut it off.	0.694978
And do not delay in cutting, especially at the base of the root, so that it does not cause a flow of blood.	Do not cut too deeply, especially at the root of the growth, lest haemorrhage occur.	0.7745711
Then treat it with wound care until it is healed.	Then apply the usual dressing for wounds until it is healed.	0.720812
But new flesh is flesh that grows in the orifice of the mother until it fills it, and often it is expelled to the outside in the form of a tail (and for this reason some first called it "tailed disease"); so we need to cut it as we cut lentigo, and treat it until it is healed.	As to the fleshy growth, that is, flesh growing in the cervix and filling it, and also often protruding like a tail (on which account some of the Ancients called it 'caudate disease'); this too you should cut away as you do for the clitoris, and dress until healed.	0.71420527

On the treatment of imperforate hymen.	On the treatment of unperforated female pudenda.	0.7015741
Alratica is when the vulva of the woman is not perforated or the opening is very small. And it is either natural or accidental.	This condition is when a woman's pudenda have no opening or have only a tiny opening; it may be either congenital or acquired.	0.6421766
Accidental is due to a preceding illness, and it is caused either by flesh grown together or by a thin or thick membrane.	The acquired sort is due to some preceding disease; either to a fleshy growth or to a membrane, thick or thin.	0.8129542
And it happens either at the base of the vagina, or on its sides, or at its top, or at its bottom, and it prevents intercourse, conception, and childbirth, and often stops menstruation.	It may be in the fundus of the uterus or in its walls or in the upper part or in the lower part; and it prevents intercourse, conception, and delivery; it often also hinders the menses.	0.858779
And the diagnosis of this is made by the observation of the midwife if the blockage is apparent and near; but if it is not apparent, then you search for it with your fingers or with a rod.	This is recognized by inspection by the midwife, if the obstruction be obvious and low. But if it be not visible she should palpate with her fingers or with a probe.	0.8053353
But if the obstruction is due to a thin membrane and it is near the two labia, then you cut it and break it.	And when the obstruction is due to a thin membrane near the labia you should lose no time in breaking it down.	0.6136411
And it is that you place on the two labia some powder, and then place your index fingers of both hands together.	This is done by applying some sort of pad to the labia; then put both thumbs upon it.	0.76607955
And the woman should be on her back, her thighs extended, and then extend the two labia with force until the thin membrane is broken and the obstruction is opened.	The woman should be upon her back with her legs spread wide apart; then the labia are to be stretched strongly till the thin membrane is ruptured and the obstruction is laid open.	0.83986235
Then take wool and soak it in oil and place it on the spot, and lie with a man that day so that the cut place does not heal.	Then take wool soaked in oil and apply to the place, and let the woman engage in coitus every day lest the place close over.	0.77468693
But if the membrane is thick and dense, then you need to cut it with a broad spatula or a myrtle leaf.	If the membrane be thick and strong you should incise it with a broad myrtle-leaf scalpel.	0.81540585
But if the obstruction is due to grown flesh, then lift it with a hook, and cut it.	But if the obstruction be due to a growth you should catch hold of it with two hooks and cut it away.	0.7624172
And have with you the medicines that stop the flow of blood without stinging, such as acacia, dragon's blood, and frankincense, mixed with egg white.	And have at hand remedies for allaying haemorrhage without pain, such as acacia and dragon's blood and olibanum, all mixed with egg-white.	0.8281217
Then administer a broad lead tube so that the wound does not heal quickly.	Then use a cannula of lead to prevent the wound healing up too quickly.	0.7930846
And keep it for some days and administer dry calk.	She should keep it in position for some days and employ a bandage of dry linen.	0.74236715
Then treat it with other wound care until it is healed.	Then treat with the usual healing dressings until it heals.	0.7413229
And sometimes there is a birth of other flesh in the vagina, and then you need to cut it in this manner. But if this is due to a cancerous abscess, no treatment with iron should be done to the cancerous abscess in the vagina in any way.	Sometimes other growths of flesh arise in the uterus itself; you should cut away in this manner all except cancerous tumours; for a cancerous tumour arising in the uterus is under no circumstance to be treated with the knife.	0.76339364

On the treatment of hemorrhoids and warts and red swelling that occur in the vulva of women.	On the treatment of haemorrhoids and warts and red pustules arising in the female pudenda.	0.8943111
Hemorrhoids are seen at the openings of many veins from which much blood continuously flows; and when hemorrhoids are old, warts are formed.	Haemorrhoids are an inflation of the heads of the blood-vessels leading to abundant and constant bleeding. When haemorrhoids are chronic they turn into warts.	0.717449
And I have already mentioned in the division the types of these and their signs, and I will also say which of these can be treated and which cannot be treated.	I have already mentioned in their place the kinds of wart and their symptoms. Now here I shall say which kinds permit of treatment and which do not.	0.8164685
So I say that hemorrhoids and warts when they are at the base of the vagina and are not felt, then no treatment with iron should be done for those.	I begin by stating that haemorrhoids and warts in the depths of the uterus that are not palpable are not able to be treated operatively.	0.6394428
But those which are in the opening of the vagina and are felt, those are the ones that are treated.	Those at the orifice that are palpable you can treat.	0.4865932
And you need to place the woman in a warm bath and then extend the hemorrhoid with forceps, or with rough cloth, and cut them at the roots.	So you should get the woman into a cool place and then draw on the warts with forceps or catch hold with pieces of rough cloth, and cut them away from the roots.	0.72017014
Then sprinkle on them some of the powders that stop bleeding without stinging, such as acacia and similar ones.	Then if that cause a flow of blood sprinkle with one or other of the powders that stop bleeding but are not corrosive, such as acacia or dragon's blood or olibanum or the like.	0.6937151
Then bind her feet together for an hour, and then place her in cold water.	Then raise her legs up against the wall for a while and then bring them down into cold water.	0.7869699
And if the bleeding persists, then make her sit in a decoction of sumac and pomegranate peels and galls and similar things.	And if the haemorrhage persist for a long time make her sit in an infusion of sumac and pomegranate rind and oak-galls and the like.	0.8887954
Then take barley flour and mix it with honey and sour wine and make a plaster with it over the back of the area.	Then take barley flour and beat it up with honey and vinegar, and apply to the back a plaster made of this.	0.9047206
And if the bleeding stops, it is good; if not, use two cupping glasses, and on the breasts without scarification.	And if the bleeding cease, good; but if not, apply to the loins and breasts cupping-vessels without scarifying.	0.7913356
Then take wool and soak it in coriander juice or nightshade juice or rockrose juice with sour wine and apply it to the place; then treat the place with ointments until it is healed.	Then take wool and dip it in the juice of red cynomorium or plantain or wild eglantine, together with syrup of oak galls, and apply to the place.	0.71407866
And treat it until it is healed.	And when the swelling has subsided treat the place with ointment until it heals.	0.6187383

On perforation of accidental abscess in the vagina.	On the perforation of eruptions occurring in the uterus.	0.81055975
Many types of abscesses occur in the vagina, such as cancer, stone abscess, ulcers, swollen tissues, herpes, fistulas, hemorrhoids, cracks, warts, and other abscesses. And I have already mentioned these diseases and their types and their signs, and their treatments in the division.	From time to time there occur in the womb various kinds of tumour, such as cancer and the stony tumour and ulcer and abscess and gangrene and fistulae and varicosities and cracks and warts and inflamed tumours; all these diseases I have mentioned, with their varieties and their symptoms, in the appropriate section.	0.781646
And I need to say in this treatise about the hot abscess which comes in the vagina when it is one of the abscesses that collects pus, and if you want to know in what manner the operation of it is done with iron.	But now in this treatise we must mention an inflamed tumour of the kind where there is a collection of pus, and the manner of its opening with the knife.	0.63122845
Then you need to consider if the pain of the abscess in its beginning is sharp with throbbing and phlegm and fever, and if you see it redden and if it is felt, then do not hurry with its perforation, and treat it with what helps with maturation until the acuteness of the symptoms stops.	You should inspect it, and if the pain of the tumour is acute from the outset, with pulsation and inflammation and fever, and, if it is visible, you see that it is red, then do not be in a hurry to open, but treat it with applications helpful for suppuration till these symptoms have subsided.	0.8275374
And then you need to make the woman sit on a chair that has two seats; and recline on her back and adjust her feet to the lower part of the abdomen, and her thighs should be spread, and place her arms under her knees, and tie each with a band to something convenient.	Then you should get the patient to sit in a chair having a double seat, lying back. She should put her feet together upon her abdomen, with the thighs apart and the arms joined under the knees and bound together in a suitable manner.	0.8489403
Then the midwife stands on the right side and administers the instrument with which the vaginal opening is opened, the shape of which will be shown in those cases that will be performed next.	Then the midwife should sit on the right side and employ the instrument for opening the orifice of the womb, which will be described later.	0.79059434
And when you want to use this instrument, you need to place the base of the vagina of the woman with the rod, and what is inserted from the instrument into the vagina should not be more than the base of the vagina and harm the patient. But if the instrument is larger than the base of the vagina, then you need to place powders on the tissue of the base of the vagina so that the entrance of any instrument into the base of the vagina is prevented.	When you are going to use this instrument, you should measure with a probe the depth of the womb so that the instrument be not introduced beyond this measure lest the patient be harmed; if the instrument be longer, pads should be put over the rim of the cervix to prevent the passage of its whole length.	0.7100879
And you need to place the screw that runs in the instrument from the top side and the administrator holds the instrument and turns the screw until the vaginal opening is open.	You must put the screw that runs in the instrument, in from the top and hold the instrument while your assistant turns the screw until the entrance of the uterus is opened.	0.81052387
And when the abscess appears, and it is felt by the hand and is smooth and soft, then you need to cut it from its head with a broad spatula.	When the abscess is exposed, and on manual palpation is found to be thin and soft, you should make an incision at its head with a broad scalpel.	0.8349669
And when the pus is evacuated, then you need to place in the wound a swab soaked in rose oil or green oil in which there is some astringency; and place the swab in the section in the base of the vagina.	And when all the matter is evacuated you should place on the wound a soft wick soaked in oil of roses or green oil with some styptic quality, and let it come outside from the incision into the cervix uteri.	0.73889685
And place outside the vagina and on the pubis clean wool soaked in water in which mallows have been boiled.	Over the area of the uterus and pubes there should be clean wool soaked in an infusion of mallows.	0.6709264
Then treat it for two days with ointment that is suitable for this until it is healed.	Then after two days dress with a suitable ointment until healed.	0.8833239
And sometimes the vagina and the wound are washed so that it is crystallized with water and honey, and then with water in which lily root or long aristolochia is boiled, and then return to the ointment.	Sometimes also both the wound and the uterus are washed out with a douche of honey and water, then of a decoction of liquorice root or long aristolochy; then go back to the ointment.	0.88315487
And if the wound is deep in the vagina and hidden, then you should be prohibited from treating it with iron, but treat it with what we have said in the division.	But if the lesion be hidden in the depths of the womb then you will have to abstain from operative treatment but carry out treatment as spoken of in its place.	0.70182025
Chapter 75.	CHAPTER SEVENTY-FIVE.	0.63181454
To teach the midwives in what manner the live embryos are treated when they come out in an unnatural position.	On the training of midwives in how to treat living foetuses when not brought forth in the natural manner.	0.827796
It is necessary that the midwife knows at the beginning the figure of natural childbirth by its signs, and when you see the woman exerting pressure on her lower parts and wanting to breathe the air, and then she is relieved by the pressure of the childbirth, and hastens the emergence of the embryo, then know that this birth is according to the natural position, and it is the emergence of the baby on its head, and the placenta with it or hanging or suspended from the umbilical cord.	If you see the woman strain her abdomen and desire to breathe more air, and the pangs come easily to her and she hastens to deliver the child, by this you may know that the labour will follow a natural course and that the presentation will be vertex with the afterbirth, either together with the child or hanging by the umbilical cord.	0.74918795
So when you see these signs, you need to compress the belly so that the embryo descends gently because when it descends on its head, it descends with the placenta, and it is cleaned of those superfluities with good cleansing.	And when you observe these signs it will be necessary to put pressure upon the abdomen to bring forth the foetus quickly. For when it presents the vertex the afterbirth comes down with it and she is thoroughly cleansed of those superfluities.	0.76921505
But the one that is different from this birth is unnatural and not praiseworthy, because when the embryo comes out on its feet and its body comes out before its head and its feet, and one of its hands, or on its foot, or its head and its hand come out, or its belly, and it is very easily twisted on its neck, and such shapes are not praiseworthy.	But a delivery that is contrary to this is unnatural and wrong. Sometimes the infant is delivered by its feet; or by its hands before either head or feet; or a single hand or foot; or the head comes out together with a foot. Or it comes out all twisted, often with the nape of the neck first; or in other wrong positions.	0.7321255
Therefore, it is necessary for the midwife to be wise and subtle in all these cases and to avoid error and deception.	So the midwife must have wisdom and dexterity and be skilled in all these cases and beware of failures and mistakes.	0.87389076
And I am showing each figure of these, and what tool is used in them so that it is indicated by this and it is established accordingly.	I shall explain the technique in these modes of delivery so that she may be instructed and may be acquainted with them all.	0.5234566
When the baby comes out on its head by natural expulsion, and this is strong on the woman and makes the birth difficult, and sometimes her strength is already weakened, then make her sit, or the women hold her, and vaporize her vagina with boiled fenugreek and moist oils.	When the foetus comes out by the vertex in the normal manner and yet the delivery is with great difficulty for the woman and you see that her strength is getting exhausted, then make her sit on a seat and have her held firmly, and foment her womb in a decoction of fenugreek and in bland oils.	0.7862903
And then the midwife inserts between her fingers a small spatula and cuts with it the placenta, or cuts it with her nail until the moisture within it flows out. And press the woman's belly until the fetus descends.	Then the midwife should take between two fingers a little scalpel and make an incision in the foetal membrane or open it with the finger nail, to allow the contained waters to flow out; and put pressure upon the woman's abdomen until the foetus comes down.	0.8298678
But if it does not descend, then the woman needs to be anointed with a mucilage of psyllium and fenugreek with sesame.	But if it will not come down then the woman should have an enema of mucilage of fenugreek with oil of sesame.	0.88587236
And then instruct her, near the anointing, to be compressed and make her sneeze with a condition; and hold her mouth and nose for an hour, because the fetus will be expelled quickly.	Then bid her bear down after the enema, and with ptarmica stimulate her to sneeze; and close her mouth and nose for a while and the foetus will quickly come out.	0.79126114
And if both hands of the fetus are expelled at the beginning, then you need to reduce them easily little by little. But if it does not respond to insertion, then place the woman on a chair and lift her feet up, and then shake the chair on the ground; and the woman should be held so that she does not fall due to the shaking.	If the hands of the foetus present, you should slowly and gently push them back; and if they will not go back then place the woman upon a seat, have her feet raised and meanwhile shake the seat; but the woman should be held lest the shaking cause her to fall off.	0.82050604
And if the hands are not turned inside and the fetus dies, then cut them and extract the remainder of the fetus or tie its body to the hand with a cloth and extract it with equal force, because it will be expelled.	But if the two hands will not go back and the foetus is dead cut them off and draw out the remains. Or tie tapes to the hands and pull on them evenly and it will come out.	0.76398367
When the fetus comes out on its feet, then you need to push them up, and then turn the fetus gently, and then straighten it, and then take one of its feet and extend it little by little.	Foot presentation: when the foetus presents feet first you should raise them both; then you should very gently turn the foetus so as to straighten it. Then take one of its feet and stretch it gently.	0.77971315
But when it is out to the thighs, then you instruct her to exert pressure, and make her sneeze with a condition, because it will be expelled if God wills.	When they come down as far as the hips, bid her bear down, make her sneeze with ptarmica, and it will come out.	0.4475171
And if it is not expelled with what we have recommended, then you return the fetus little by little until you place it in the natural position, because then it will be expelled with an easy emergence.	But if it will not come out with these means we have described, you should return the foetus gently until you have placed it in the natural position; then it will come out easily.	0.81493175
And if it is prohibited with all that we have recommended, then take mucilage of mallow and dissolved gum, and pound it all in a mortar with good pounding, and then anoint the woman’s vagina and the lower part of her belly with it. And then make her sit in warm water, until it reaches her hypochondria.	But if it defies all that we have described, take mucilage of marsh mallow and fenugreek and oil of sesame and dissolved gum, and pound them all well together in the mortar and anoint the woman's pudenda and lower abdomen; then make her sit down in warm water reaching to the costal margin.	0.81564754
And when you see that her lower parts are softened, then make her inhale the smoke of myrtle and place her over it. And when she has inhaled the smoke for an hour, then make her sit on a chair, and then make her sneeze and stretch her mouth, and lift her from it, and press the lower part of her belly with light compression, because the fetus will be quickly expelled.	And when you see the lower parts are softened, make a suppository of myrrh and let her introduce it; and when she has had the suppository in for a while make her sneeze, stopping her nose and mouth; and press gently upon the abdomen; then will the foetus immediately emerge.	0.78573716
Emergence of the fetus laterally with one of its hands hanging. It needs to be handled by reducing the hand, but if you cannot reduce it, then lift the woman and make her walk.	Presentation by the side with one hand hanging down: attempt to manœuvre the hand back again; but if you cannot reduce it then make the woman stand up and walk.	0.77067304
And if she cannot walk, then make her lie on the bed, and shake her thighs with strong shaking, and then administer the mucilages I have mentioned.	But if she cannot walk then have her lie on a couch, and agitate her feet violently. Then employ the ointment which I described among the mucilages.	0.8658201
And if the childbirth comes, then make her sit on a chair, and then study the reduction of the hand, and straighten the fetus according to the natural position, and make the woman sneeze and instruct her to exert pressure until it is expelled.	If parturition begins, make her sit upon a seat and attempt the reduction of the hand and version of the foetus to the natural position, and make the woman sneeze and bear down until the child is born.	0.77823687
Emergence of the fetus on its neck with its hands spread and its face to its mother’s back. The midwife needs to hold the fetus's hand and then turn it little by little, and align it easily.	Presentation on the back, with hands outstretched and face towards the mother's back: the midwife should take the infant's hand and then turn him very slowly, and gently rectify his position.	0.78305805
And when it is aligned, then place on her vagina what we have recommended of oil and mucilages.	Then when he is in the correct position apply to the maternal passage the oil and mucilage prescribed.	0.75664794
And then instruct her to move little by little, and when you have done this, then make her sit on a chair and instruct her to lean to the right side, and then instruct her to be compressed; and make her sneeze with a condition. Exit of the fetus prepared on its side.	Then bid the woman move gently and when she has done so make her sit down upon a seat and bid her lean over to her right side; then bid her bear down, and with ptarmica make her sneeze ; then the foetus will come forth.	0.8448214
When it descends to the horror of the mother in this manner, consider, and then you cut the placenta with your nail until the moisture is evacuated.	The foetus presenting laterally, doubled up : when it presents at the os in this manner together with the membrane, open the membrane with your finger nail and let out the waters.	0.4072821
And if the fetus is suspended on its face and neck, then you cut it from the umbilical cord, so that it is not retained and dies.	And if it adhere over the infant's face and neck, cut it away from the umbilicus lest he be strangled and die.	0.88413095
And then push the fetus inside until you place it as needed, and instruct the woman to exert pressure a few times, and it will be expelled with easy emergence, if God wills.	Then push the foetus back till it is in the proper position, and bid the woman bear down a few times until the foetus comes forth.	0.65006685
Exit of twins or multiple fetuses. Know that twins are often born, and sometimes three or four are born, but this is rare and seldom happens; but sometimes they are born by nature, and not alive.	The birth of twin or multiple foetuses: you should know that it is a common occurrence for twins to be born alive, and sometimes three or four infants, but this is a rarity; while five after this manner is altogether unnatural and they never live.	0.890851
And count them, even if they are multiplied, with one placenta, and they are separated by a membrane, distinguishing them by the ligament in the umbilical cord of each of them. And sometimes they are expelled just like a fetus with easy natural emergence, and sometimes they are expelled with an unnatural emergence as we have recounted.	Although they may be more than one, they are enveloped in a single membrane but separated one from the other by a dividing membrane joined to the umbilicus of each one. And when they are born they may come in the natural easy manner of a single foetus; or by any abnormal presentation such as we have described.	0.7974646
And if some of them are difficult during childbirth and come to what we have said about the unnatural figures, then you treat them as we have recounted.	And if one of them be born with difficulty, presenting in some unnatural manner as described, the treatment is also as described.	0.69552696
And if the midwife is subtle and does this with ease and subtlety, and with delay, and is skilled in every figure as it is prepared with the skill bringing health.	Let the midwife be delicate and do whatever she does gently and calmly, adopting in each case whatever technique it demands that will conduce to a safe result.	0.594285
Remembrance of what is formed in the womb from embryos and aborted.	A note on the foetuses that may be formed in the womb and abort.	0.780069
Sometimes one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, or even ten are formed in the mother, and it has been verified by me that a woman aborted and expelled six, and another ten all formed, which was done by the measurement of the glorious sages.	Sometimes in the womb there may form one or two or three or four or five or six or seven or more than ten. And I can vouch that one woman had an abortion of seven foetuses and another woman of fifteen, all of them formed.	0.81301904
And all this must be in the knowledge of the midwife because very soon she will encounter such a case, and therefore she should act accordingly with what is appropriate.	And all this should be part of the midwife's knowledge, for one day she may meet such a case and she must deal with it in the proper way.	0.76606864
Chapter 76	CHAPTER SEVENTY-SIX.	0.50139844
On extracting the fetus when it is dead.	On the extraction of the dead foetus.	0.8291333
When you treat the dead fetus with what we have discussed in the section on medication and it has not come out, and you are forced to use manual operation, then you must consider if the woman is of healthy constitution and not afflicted with any conditions that could lead to her demise.	When you have dealt with a dead foetus by those methods mentioned in their chapter, and it does not come out, and you are compelled to operate, you should examine to see if the woman be in a healthy state and not having any disease on account of which you might entertain a fear for her life.	0.8160893
Then, the woman must be laid on her back on the bed, with her head inclined downwards and her thighs elevated.	The woman should lie on her back on a couch, her head tilted back and her legs raised.	0.85181594
And the assistant should hold her from both sides or tie her to the bed so that her body does not move during the extraction of the fetus.	An assistant on either side should hold her down firmly or she should be bound down to the couch, lest the body be drawn out of position in extracting the foetus.	0.7735695
Then, you should moisten the mother's genital area with humid oils and mucilage of mallow, fenugreek, and linseed.	Then the opening should be anointed with moistening oils and with mucilage of marsh mallow and fenugreek and with linseed.	0.8437718
Next, the midwife should anoint her hand with these oils and mucilages, and then gently insert her hand into the mother, searching with her hand for a place to hook onto the fetus.	Then the midwife should anoint her hand with these oils and mucilages and gently introduce it into the vagina and with it locate a place in the foetus to fix hooks in.	0.8788879
And appropriate places for this are: if the fetus is positioned to come out head first, then you should hook into its eyes, or the neck, or the mouth, or the palate, or under the chin, or in the collarbone area, or in the spaces near the ribs, or under the hypochondria.	The suitable places for that: consider, and if the foetus present the vertex then she should fix the hooks in its eyes or in the neck or in the mouth or palate or beneath the chin, or the collarbone, or about the ribs, or beneath the false ribs.	0.82803494
But if it is positioned feet first, then in the groin, or in the middle of the back.	But if it present the feet let the hooks be fixed in the pubic region or middle ribs.	0.77863765
And you must hold the hook with your right hand, place the curved part of it between the fingers of your left hand, and gently insert your hand and place the hook in one of those mentioned locations until you reach the empty cause.	She should hold the hook in the right hand and put the curved part between the fingers of the left hand, and introduce the hand gently and fix a hook in one of the places before mentioned, driving it in until it comes to a hollow.	0.82969344
And then place and fix another hook, or a third if needed, so that the traction is equal and not just in one direction.	Then opposite it let her fix another or a third if need be, so as to give even traction, not pulling to one side.	0.7998463
Rather, it should be pulled in all directions, so that its extraction is eased, just as it is done when removing a tooth from its socket.	Then she should pull evenly, not just in a straight line but with the foetus moved from side to side so that its exit may be eased, as is done in extracting a tooth.	0.6783022
It is necessary that the stretching is softened; and if any part of it is retained, the midwife should anoint some of her fingers with oil and gently insert them to loosen the retained part.	From time to time the tension must be relaxed, and if any part of it be held up the midwife must oil some of her fingers and introduce them to one side to manipulate the retained part.	0.8217211
Then, if a part of the fetus is removed, the hooks should be moved to a higher place; and do this until the whole fetus is removed.	And if a part only of the foetus come away she should shift the hooks to other parts a little higher up, and so on, until the whole of the foetus has come out.	0.79584277
But if one hand comes out before the other, and it is not possible to reduce it due to its tightness, then cloth should be wrapped around it; and then extract it until it is completely removed, and cut it either at the wrist or the elbow.	If the hand should come out before any other part and it is impossible to reduce it on account of the pressure, then a tape should be wound round it and she should pull on it until it is all out; then it should be cut off at either the carpal or the elbow joint.	0.80409384
And you must do the same with the other hand and the two feet.	In the same manner should the other hand be dealt with, and the feet.	0.76548135
But if the fetus's head is large, or if it is constricted in the delivery, or if there is water in its head, then you must insert between the fingers a pointed spatula and pierce the head to extract the water, or use an instrument called “alundat,” whose shape will be described along with other instruments in the chapter near this one.	If the foetal head be large and it is tightly squeezed in exit, or if there be a collection of fluid in the head, you should introduce between your fingers a spike-shaped scalpel and split the head to let the water out; or you should smash it with the instrument called cephalotribe which will be illustrated, together with figures of the other instruments, in the chapter following.	0.7263937
And do similarly if the fetus has a naturally large head: then you must cut it with a knife, or take it with the alunda as we have mentioned; and then extract the bones with forceps.	In the same manner you act if the foetus have a naturally large head: either you should cut the skull open or smash it with the cephalotribe as we said; then you should draw out the bones with forceps.	0.81870914
And if the head has come out but is constricted at the clavicle, then it should be cut until the moisture in the chest is released.	If the head comes out and the foetus is held up at the collar bones, an incision should be made to let out the humidity in the thorax, for the thorax will then shrink.	0.6896501
But if it is not complicated, nor responding to extraction, then you should cut the head as soon as possible as you are able.	But if the thorax does not shrink and is not disposed to emerge then you should cut off pieces in any manner possible.	0.65821576
And if the lower abdomen is abscessed or has dropsy, then you must pierce it so that the moisture inside can flow out.	If the lower belly be swollen or dropsical then you should make an opening to draw out all the fluid.	0.787897
But if the fetus is on its feet, then its traction is light and its direction to the mother's mouth is light.	If the foetus present the feet then the extraction will be easy and it will be a simple matter to guide it to the maternal opening.	0.6401862
But if it is constricted around the belly and chest, then you must extract it with a cloth wrapped around your hand, and cut the belly and chest until what is inside flows out.	If it be stuck about the abdomen or thorax then pull on it with a cloth wound around your hand and cut an opening in the abdomen or thorax to allow the contents to flow out.	0.7683327
But if the other limbs are out and the head remains, then the midwife should insert her left hand; but if the mother's mouth is open, then insert the hand into the throat, search for the head, and pull it with the fingers to the mother's mouth, then insert a hook, or two hooks, and pull it out with them.	If all the limbs are removed but the head is turned backwards and is jammed, the midwife should introduce her left hand and, if the mouth of the womb is open, should put the hand into the cervix of the womb and investigate the head and, with her fingers, draw it down toward the opening and fix a hook or two in it, and extract it with these.	0.843724
And if the mother's mouth is constricted by an abscess that occurred, then it must not be worked on; instead, moist and fatty remedies should be administered. And apply plasters; and have the patient follow a regimen of baths that soften and moisten.	If it should be that the mouth of the womb is closed on account of an abscess, then one must not be rough with it but should use in this case instillations of moistening greasy substances; plasters also should be applied; and the woman should sit in a bath of softening and moistening waters.	0.8007655
And if the fetus is on its side, then if possible, it should be turned: and follow what we have said for a live fetus.	If the foetus present laterally and it is possible to reposition it, there should be applied the things mentioned for a living child.	0.64203715
And if this is not possible, then it should be cut into pieces and extracted.	But if this be not possible then it should be cut away piecemeal and extracted.	0.90427154
And it is necessary that no part of the placenta is left inside.	It is necessary that not a scrap of the afterbirth be left behind in the womb.	0.7058368
And when you have completed all your operations, then administer what we have said about treating the abscesses that occur in the mother.	When you have completed your treatment then also apply those treatments we have mentioned for abscesses occurring in the uterus.	0.7786087
And if there is a flow of blood, then have her sit in astringent baths and administer other treatments.	If haemorrhage occurs, the woman should be put into styptic fluids and the usual treatment applied.	0.6236013
And I have seen a woman in whose womb there was a dead fetus, and then she became pregnant again, and the fetus died again. It happened to her after a long time an abscess in her navel; and it swelled until it opened, and began to discharge pus.	Now I myself once saw a woman who had become pregnant and the foetus had then died in utero; then again she conceived and the second foetus also died; and after a long while she got a swelling in the umbilicus which grew and eventually it opened and began to produce pus.	0.8805175
And I was called to treat it, and treated it for a long time, and the wound did not heal.	I was called in to attend her, and I treated her for a long while but the wound did not heal up.	0.79708916
Then I applied to it some strong drawing plasters, and a bone came out, and after a few days, another bone came out; and I was greatly amazed, as there are no bones in the belly.	So I applied to it certain very strongly drawing ointments, and then a bone came away from the place; then a few days passed and another bone came out; and I was mightily astonished at this, seeing that the abdomen is a place where there are no bones.	0.92081785
And then I thought that they were the bones of the dead fetus.	I formed the opinion that these were bones from a dead foetus.	0.7622795
Then I treated the wound, and extracted many bones from it, with the woman being in better condition, and she lived in this way for a long time, discharging a little pus.	I continued this procedure and got a great number of bones out of her, the woman being in the best of health; indeed she lived for quite a while like that, with a little pus being exuded from that place.	0.867239
And I do not consider this strange, but rather see it as knowledge and help in what the skilled physician can administer by hand for healing.

Form of the screw with which the mother is opened:	Speculum for opening the entrance of the womb.	0.43831354
This is the form of the screw in which the books are joined, in which there are two screws at the ends of two rods. However, this screw must be more delicate in structure, and be made of ebony or boxwood.	This is the type of instrument with which books are pressed. It has two screws at either end of two pieces of wood; but this instrument should be more slender than a book press, and should be made of ebony or boxwood.	0.8684273
And the width of each rod should be about two fingers, and the edge of each about one finger, and the length of each is one and a half palms; and in the middle of the two rods are two joints of the same wood that are already fixed, whose length is half a palm and a little more, and the width of each is about two fingers, or a little more.	The width of each piece of wood should be about two fingers' breadth and the thickness about one, and the length a span and a half; and in the middle of both pieces of wood, firmly attached, should be two projections made of the same kind of wood, each half a span long or a little more, and two fingers wide or a little more.	0.93629974
And these two additions should be inserted into the mouth of the mother so that she can be opened with them when you turn the two prescribed screws.	It is these two projections that are to be introduced into the vagina so that it is thereby opened when you turn the screws.	0.7079041
Another similar form, more delicate and lighter:	Another instrument, for the same purpose, but smaller and lighter.	0.6470151
Should be made of ebony or boxwood in the likeness of forceps. But at the end of it, there are two additions as usual, and the length of these additions is about one palm, and the width of each is two fingers.	It is made of ebony or boxwood in the shape of forceps, but at the end it has two projections as you can see; and the length of each is about a span and the breadth two fingers.	0.8066178
And when you want to open the mother with them, then you make the woman lie on the bed with her legs hanging, exposing what is between her thighs. Then open your hand with the instrument as you do with scissors equally according to the amount you want of the opening of the mother until the midwife does what you want.	When you wish to open the womb with this, make the woman sit on a couch with her legs hanging down, parted; then introduce the two projections pressed together into the orifice of the womb while you hold the end of the instrument lower down between her thighs; then open your hand in the same way as you would do with forceps, to the extent to which you wish to open the womb, so as to allow the midwife to do what she desires.	0.8069253

And it is similar to forceps which have teeth at the end, as usual, and sometimes it is made long like forceps in this shape, as usual, which have teeth like saw teeth with which it is cut and crushed. Form of a small crusher:	It resembles scissors with toothed jaws, as you see. Sometimes it is made long like forceps, as you see in this illustration, with teeth like the teeth of a saw; and you may either cut or crush with it.	0.78039134

All these instruments are exercised, and the more the species of them are multiplied and prepared by the craftsmen, the easier their operation and the more valuable they become for men.	The more types of these instruments the practitioner has ready by him, the more rapidly he operates, and the greater his reputation among men.	0.7109509
And you do not work with those instruments unless you are well-prepared, because the necessity of them is inescapable.	So do not neglect to have ready by you a single one of these instruments, for you will certainly need it.	0.6419887
On the extraction of the placenta.	On extracting the afterbirth.	0.8431705
When the placenta is retained after childbirth, you must command the patient to hold her breath, and then make her sneeze in a certain way, and press your hand on her mouth and nose, and if it comes out with that, good.	When in a confinement the afterbirth is left behind, you should bid the woman hold her breath then make her sneeze with ptarmica, with your hand holding her mouth and nose; and if it come away thus, good.	0.8188131
If not, then take a pot and make a hole in the lid and place in it herbs that open the mouth of the mother, such as calamint, rue, dill, chamomile, arabic gum, cassia, and centaury. All these herbs or some of them should be submerged in water in the pot, and place it on the fire.	But if not, then take a pot, pierce a hole in the lid, and put in it herbs that will open the womb, such as pennyroyal, rue, anise, chamomile, artemisia, cassia, and centaury, some or all of these remedies, submerge them in water, and place on the fire.	0.85529053
Then place a reed tube in the mouth of the mother, and hold it until the steam comes into the cavity of the mother.	Then fix a silver tube to the hole in the cover and bring the other end into the orifice of the womb and hold it in position so that the vapours may reach the body of the uterus.	0.7222309
Then make her sneeze as we have said, and the placenta will be quickly expelled.	Then let her sneeze, as we said, and the afterbirth will quickly come away.	0.9006816
But if it remains after this treatment and has not come out, then command the midwife to immerse her left hand in sesame oil or marshmallow mucilage, and then insert it into the vagina and search for the placenta, and when she has found it, then take it and extend it little by little. But if it is attached to the throat of the mother, then insert her hand as we have described, and when she has found the placenta, extract it little by little in a straight manner so that the mother does not fall due to the strong pulling. First, it is necessary to move her to the right and left sides with ease.	But if, after this treatment, it still remains and does not come out, then tell the midwife to dip her hand in oil of sesame or mucilage of marshmallow and introduce it into the vulva and search for the afterbirth, and when she has found it, to take hold of it and very gently draw it until she bring it out. But if it be adherent to the depths of the uterus, then let her piss her hand in as we described until she find the afterbirth; then let her draw very slowly and gently lest by violent pulling she cause a prolapse; and she should slowly move it from side to side, left and right; then let her increase the traction, for then it gives way to the pull and is freed from its adhesions.	0.9152534
And if the mouth of the mother is constricted, we have already described the treatment with sneezing and the pot with herbs.	If the uterine opening be narrowed, we have earlier mentioned the treatment by induced sneezing and that of the pot and herbs.	0.7554337
But if it is not expelled with all the methods we have described, then be careful not to strain her by repeated attempts at extraction, but rather what has come out to the mother's mouth should be tied to the woman's thigh, and then coat it with ointment and tetrapharmacum; because that will make it rot in a few days, and it will be dissolved and expelled.	But if it does not come away by all the means we have described, beware of treating her roughly with repeated traction. Whatever of it comes out of the opening should be tied to the woman's thigh, and then syringe her with Tetrapharmacon ointment; for that will cause putrefaction in a few days and it will loosen and come out.	0.8854979
But when it rots, a bad smell rises to the head and stomach, and this harms the patient; and then it is necessary to administer fumigations and other suitable treatments.	However, when it necroses foul odours arise from it that ascend to the stomach and head and these cause harm to the patient; so she should have suffumigations appropriate for this.	0.82025206
But some of the Ancients have already tried fumigations with assafoetida and dried figs.	One of the Ancients tried suffumigation with nasturtium and dried figs.	0.7341729
Form of the instrument with which the woman is fumigated for the retention of menses and the placenta:	The form of instrument for suffumigating a woman for retention of the menses and of the afterbirth and the like.	0.763392
Should be made of glass or brass.	It is made of lead, resembling a funnel, or it may be made of bronze.	0.50424945
And the narrow end should be placed in the vagina and the wide end over the fire, and the fumigation should be placed on the coals of the fire.	Its narrow extremity is introduced into the pudenda and the wide end is put over the fire, and the suffumigation is produced on the hot coals.	0.6950243

On the treatment of the unperforated anus of the child.	On imperforate anus.	0.50067663
Many children are born and their anuses are not perforated, which have a thin and obstructed membrane. Then the midwife should pierce that membrane with her finger; if not, pierce it with a sharp spatula, and be careful not to touch the muscle.	Infants are quite often born with the anus imperforate, closed by a fine membrane; then the midwife should perforate the membrane with her finger or pierce it with a sharp scalpel, being careful not to touch the muscle.	0.86078995
Then place wool soaked in wine and oil on it; and then treat it with ointment until it is healed.	Then wool dipped in oil and wine should be applied, and treat it with ointments until healed.	0.897992
But if you fear that it will be obstructed, then place a cannula in the opening for many days, and remove it when the child wants to defecate.	If you are afraid it may close up, put into the opening a leaden tube for many days, which will be removed when the child wants to evacuate the bowel.	0.8099153
And if obstruction of the anus occurs due to the consolidation of a wound or abscess; then that consolidation should be incised, and then treated with what we have said about treatment and lead.	Sometimes also the anus is closed by the scarring of a wound or an abscess; then the scarring should be incised, and then dressed by those methods we have mentioned, including the leaden tube.	0.68093526
Of the treatment of fistulas that occur below.	On the treatment of fistulae occurring in the lower parts.	0.8492987
The fistulas that occur in the lower part are characterized by swelling and thickness, which occur near the anus externally or in the space of one side.	Fistulae in the lower parts are a knotting and thickening of the tissues occurring externally near the anus or in the perineum to one side.	0.8522516
And it can be a single fistula or multiple ones.	A fistula may be single or multiple.	0.8200151
And when that swelling is old and discharges a watery white fluid or subtle decay, sometimes some of these fistulas are penetrating.	When a thickening of this kind has become chronic it opens and there flows out a white watery humidity or thin pus.	0.6941372
And those penetrating fistulas are known by what exits from them through discharge and wind; and sometimes the patient has discharge, and often worms exit from them.	The former may be known by faeces or flatus coming out of them when the patient opens the bowel. Often also worms come out of them.	0.68755305
And some of these fistulas sometimes penetrate into the space of the bladder, and into the urethra; and some penetrate into the junction of the thigh and into the coccyx.	Sometimes also there are fistulae occurring in the perineum which penetrate to the urinary bladder and to the urethra; and some also penetrate to the hip-joint and to the coccyx.	0.8431054
And what is known as a penetrating fistula into the anus and non-penetrating is that you place your index finger into the anus, and insert a slender probe of brass or iron into the fistula when it is not tortuous.	A fistula penetrating to the anus may also be distinguished from one not so penetrating by introducing the finger into the anus and a fine probe into the fistula, made of either bronze or iron, if there be no bend in the course of the fistula.	0.82062864
But if it is tortuous, then insert a slender probe of lead or horsehair until you feel the probe or hair on your finger.	But if the course of the fistula be tortuous, then introduce a thin leaden probe or a horse-hair, until you feel the probe or horse-hair come on to your finger.	0.8830576
And if you do not feel it at all nor is there any discharge of excrement, worms, or wind from the hole, as we have said, then you know it is non-penetrating, and then proceed to treatment.	But if you do not feel it at all and if no faeces nor flatus nor worm come out of the opening, as we said, you may know it is not perforating; so hurry on with treatment.	0.86678517
And when the fistula penetrates into the bladder or into the urethra, then the sign of it is the exit of urine from it and the prevention of consolidation of the area with medicine.	When the fistula penetrates to the bladder or the urinary passages it is signified by the passage of urine and by the fact that medical remedies cannot cure it.	0.7203759
But if it penetrates into the junction of the thigh or into the bone and causes pain in the area, then the sign of it is that the probe reaches there if it is not tortuous into the bone, and causes pain in the area; and it constantly discharges pus; and no medication is effective, nor is it consolidated with ointment.	But if it penetrate to the hip-joint or coccyx, this will be signified by the probe's passing right through to there if it be a straight passage to the bone; and by the pain felt in that part; and by the chronic purulent discharge; and the fact that medical treatment does no good and ointment does not heal it.	0.8320913
And in all those penetrating fistulas, there is no complete cure, and the treatment of them is work and vanity of the many doctors on whom they rely.	There is in these perforating sinuses no cure whatever; and their treatment is labour in vain for all the ignorant doctors who pretend that they understand them.	0.73525804
But in those that are non-penetrating and not old, healing with iron is expected as I will explain to you, and what I have already tried.	But there is hope in operative treatment for those that are not perforating and chronic, as I know from experience and shall now describe.	0.6860658
And it is that the patient lies between your hands on his back and raises his legs upwards, his thighs inclined to his abdomen, and then insert a lead probe, or a brass one if the fistula is tortuous, until you know the place where the probe reaches.	Thus: have the patient lying on his back before you and let both his legs be raised with the thighs flexed back upon his belly; then introduce a probe of bronze, or of lead if the course be tortuous, until you determine where the probe reaches.	0.8113167
And if the patient feels it around the anus, then you need to insert your index finger into the anus.	Then, if the patient feel the probe somewhere in the region of the anus, put your forefinger into the anus.	0.80548406
And if you feel the probe on your finger already exposed penetrating by itself, other than what you feel between your finger and it being tissue or flesh, then you know certainly that it is penetrating; and then do not work on it, because there is no cure for it, as we have said.	If you feel the probe itself with your finger, coming through bare, and you do not feel anything interposing between your finger and the probe, either membrane or flesh, then you may know for certain that it is a perforating fistula; do not spend your energy over it, for, as we have said, there is no cure.	0.8628993
But some might say that it heals in some men late.	Yet some have said that it may be cured in certain cases, but rarely.	0.64449245
And of the treatment by which help is expected is that you use a slender cautery according to the width of the fistula, as described earlier, and insert that heated cautery into the fistula until it reaches around the anus; and then repeat that two or three times until you know that all those fistulous tissues that are like the shaft of a bird's feather are burned.	The treatment from which some relief may be hoped is to heat a fine cautery corresponding to the width of the fistula, as we have said before, and pass this, hot, through the fistula to the anus; then repeat this two or three times until you know that all those compact tags of superfluous flesh, which resemble quills, are burnt away.	0.8843459
And then treat it with bandages soaked in vinegar until all those burnt tissues fall off, and then treat it with medicines that generate and consolidate flesh, and if it is healed, it is good; and if not, then it is not healed at any time by any other treatment.	Then dress with a pad soaked in oil until the burnt tissue comes away. Then treat with healing ointments and, if it heals, well and good. If not, it will never heal with any other treatment.	0.8072542
And if the probe enters, and does not penetrate into your finger which is in the anus, and between it and the probe there is a thick layer of flesh or tissue, and sometimes the fistula is at the surface of the skin, then cut the skin from the beginning of the fistula, and you cut with the probe, and be in the fistula until the cut reaches the place where the end of the probe reaches, and by the probe, it is freed and falls.	If you introduce the probe and it does not come through to your finger in the anus, and there be between your finger and the probe something firm interposing, either tissue or lining, and you see the fistula to be close under the skin, then cut open the skin at the origin of the fistula and continue your incision, with the probe in the fistula, until you come to the place where the tip of the probe has reached and the probe is freed and falls out.	0.8797129
And then cleanse those fistulous tissues which are like the shaft of a bird's feather and ensure no cause remains from them.	Then clean out all the solid quill-like pieces of tissue and let none remain.	0.6463101
But if a flow of blood comes between you and your operation when you cut those tissues, then the best thing and the lightest instrument is to cauterize with fire or sharp medicine, because cautery with fire has two good effects: it burns those adjusted tissues, and stops the blood and dries the moisture.	If the haemorrhage be too much for you and interferes with your operating when cutting away the tissues, then the best and most speedily efficacious thing you can do is to cauterize, either with fire or with caustics. For cauterizing with fire unites two good characteristics, the burning away of those superfluous tissues, and the stanching of the bleeding, as well as the drying-up of humidity.	0.7845208
And then treat it with bandages soaked in vinegar or in crushed things until the place produces scabs, and then treat the wound with ointments that generate and consolidate hard flesh.	Then treat with a dressing soaked in butter, or sulphur pounded with oil, until the place putrefies and the burnt tissue comes away in the pus. Then treat the wound with salves to encourage healing and the growth of firm flesh, these remedies having also a styptic and drying quality.	0.7521868
And these are medicines that have astringency and drying; when it is restored, it is already healed and do not fear recurrence.	Then treat the wound with salves to encourage healing and the growth of firm flesh, these remedies having also a styptic and drying quality. Then when the wound is healed over it is cured for good and there is no fear of a recurrence.	0.65975916
But if the fistula already reaches into the anus and is elongated from the surface of the body, then insert your finger into the anus and examine with it.	If the fistula reaches deep into the anus and is far from the surface of the body, then put your finger into the anus and palpate.	0.785405
And if you then feel the probe and between you and it there is a layer of tissue or flesh, and it is near penetration, then there is no operation in it except by a method of trust and hope.	If you feel a barrier of flesh or membrane interposed between the probe and your finger, and it be nearly through, then there is nothing to be done except to try a remote hope.	0.75499356
The treatment involves one of three methods: either cauterize it as we have said; or cut it until you reach the cavity of it so that it is possible for you to insert the necessary tools and the proper treatment; and do not proceed much with cutting so that you do not cut the muscle containing the anus, and cause the patient to have involuntary discharge; and then treat it as we have said because it will heal very quickly; or extend that layer and cleanse that pus by cutting it near the anus, as we have said, with a probe or another sharp instrument, and then cleanse those fistulous tissues which are in the cut until you can remove them; and then try to restore the entire wound with cutting, and if the upper opening is not consolidated, and the fistula remains open in the part of the anus, it will be easier for the patient. And sometimes the fistula is ended in this way: it is when you insert the probe into the fistula, and it is on the side of the anus around the surface of the body with the skin and at the edge of the anus, then take a probe with a perforated tip, which is like a needle for sewing leather according to this form:	There are three methods that you may employ. The first is to cauterize it, as we have said. Or you may cut it open until you reach the termination so as to be able to insert a dressing and bring the medicament into contact with it, but do not extend your incision too far lest you cut into the sphincter muscle and the patient become incontinent of faeces; then dress in the manner we have said and perhaps it may heal. Or you may perforate the barrier and pierce it through, after incising to the vicinity of the anus, as we have said, either with the probe or with some other sharp-pointed instrument; then clear away the fleshy granulations in the incision as far as you are able; then attempt the repair of the whole wound with the incision and the upper opening, until it heals.	0.8866342
and insert into it a thread wrapped with five threads or around those; and then insert the probe with the thread into the fistula until you reach the cavity of it.	Sometimes also a fistula is cut out in this way: namely, you pass a probe into the fistula; it should be near the circle of the junction of the outer skin with the anal mucosa; then take a probe with an eyed point like a shoemaker's needle; put into it a thread twisted of about five threads, and insert into the fistula until it reaches the end.	0.66825277
But if it is penetrating into the edge of the anus near inside, then you extract the thread from that hole so that you insert your finger into the anus; and pull out the end of the thread and join the two ends together, and tighten each, and leave it for a day or two, and then when you cut more into the flesh, tighten it well until those tissues that are between the two ends of the thread are cut and fall.	If it has perforated through at the anal margin within, nearby, draw the thread out of that perforation by introducing your finger into the anus. Draw out the end of the thread and tie the two ends together and leave for one or two days. As the thread cuts into the tissues, tighten it up well until those tissues enclosed in the thread are cut through and fall away.	0.8818211
And then treat the wound until it is consolidated and healed.	Then dress the wound until it be healed and sound.	0.85565615
But if the opening of the fistula is not penetrating, then make it penetrate, in whatever way is prepared for you, except that it is much in the anus, for you must not do it so that you do not cut the muscle; and then treat it until it is healed.	If the mouth of the fistula is not perforated, perforate it as best you can, unless the depth is too great; in which case you must not do so lest you cut the muscle. Then treat as we have said until it heals.	0.78663826
The form of a spatum spinos with which the fistula is cut: its curve is very sharp and the other part is not sharp, so that you do not cut what is not necessary, as sometimes.	Figure of the sharp-pointed scalpel for cutting open fistulae; the curved edge should be exceedingly sharp and the other blunt, lest you cut what should not be cut, as you see.	0.67243546
On the suturing of hemorrhoids in which blood flows in the incision of them.	On cutting and incising piles that are bleeding, and the treatment of fissures.	0.54906803
Hemorrhoids are in two ways, for they are either between the anus looking like coals, or as if they are like clusters of grapes. And of those some are small and some large, and blood flows from them continuously and some are single, and there are many, and they are outside the anus, and at its edges.	Haemorrhoids are of two kinds: either internal, resembling red bubbles or grape-seeds, small or large, with blood perpetually flowing, and they may be single or multiple; or they may be external, round about the anus.	0.81130457
But those that are outside the anus are mostly due to little moisture, from which flows yellowish water or a little blood with continuous discomfort, and according to the color of the body.	External ones are for the most part fairly dry; a little yellowish fluid or blood constantly oozes from them, and they are of the colour of the body.	0.7196852
And the treatment of those that are inside the anus is that you instruct the patient to sit and strain until the anus protrudes and the hemorrhoids appear to you. Then you quickly suspend them with hooks or hold them with your nail, and then cut them towards their roots.	The treatment of internal piles: bid the patient open his bowel and bear down until the anus opens out and the swellings are disclosed to you; then quickly take hold of them with hooks or with your finger-nail and cut them off near the roots.	0.7366827
But if the hooks do not hold them because of their moisture and softness, then take them with a rough cloth or cotton or wool blanket, and pull them out with your fingers, and then cut them and sprinkle on them some hot powders near the incision, so that they act on them in place of cautery; or cauterize them as previously mentioned in the chapter on cauterizing. And then treat them with the other treatment until they are healed.	If the hook does not retain its hold on them because of their humidity and softness, then cut them with a piece of rough material or a rag of goat-hair, or draw them out with your fingers and cut them off; and after excision sprinkle some caustic powder on to act instead of the cautery; or cauterize them as previously described in the book on cauterization; then dress in the usual way until healed.	0.8840337
And if the anus does not respond to evacuation, then use a small biting enema on the patient, and wash with it what is in the anus so that it responds to evacuation lightly when the patient strains.	But if the anus will not open out for you then give a slightly corrosive enema so as to wash out what is within, and then, the anus will open out quickly when the patient bears down.	0.7490857
But if the hemorrhoids are outside the anus, then the treatment of them is easier, and it is that you take them with your nail, or take them with a hook, and cut them, and then treat them as we have said until they are healed.	Now the treatment of external piles is easy and simple: take hold of them with your finger-nails or catch them up with a hook and cut them away; and treat as before mentioned until cured.	0.65125775
And for the one who dislikes incision, you should administer suturing of them in this manner: take a thread wrapped and insert it into a needle and then extract the hemorrhoids to the upper parts, and make it penetrate with the needle at the root of the other part, and wrap the two ends of the thread in the lower part of the needle, and this transversely; and tighten the hemorrhoid with a strong tie, and then knot the thread and extract the needle.	But with the patient who refuses excision with the knife, this manner of removal should be practised: thread a twisted thread into a needle, then draw the piles upward and run the needle through the root of each, from one side to the other, and wind the ends of the thread round beneath the needle as it lies crosswise, and bind the pile firmly; then knot the thread and remove the needle.	0.83205473
And do this to all, and leave one of them and do not sew it, so that the excess blood runs from it.	Do this with each pile, but leave one not destroyed so that the superfluous blood may flow from it.	0.765024
And then place over the anus a cloth soaked in rose oil or plaster; and place it over the anus and instruct the patient to rest. And then leave it until it falls; and when it has fallen, treat it with ointments or with other treatment until it is healed.	Then apply to the anus a piece of material soaked in oil of roses or wax; apply it and bid the patient lie quiet; then leave him until the piles fall away. When they fall away, dress with ointments and the usual dressings until healed.	0.8854804
And when they are old and do not heal with that medicine, then you must scrape them with the tip of a spatula or with your nail until they are made moist and remove the uppermost scab, which prevents them from healing; and then treat them until they are healed.	If they become chronic, and medical treatment is unavailing, you should scrape them with the edge of a scalpel or with your finger-nail until they become soft and the upper layer, that prevents healing, is removed; then dress until they mend as they should.	0.82702243
Then you remove them more vigorously than the first time until much blood flows and they are excoriated; and then treat them until they are healed.	But if they do not heal, repeat the scraping more strongly than at first until they bleed freely and become raw; then apply dressings and they will heal.	0.6578925
Know that "alamermar" is a corn, and it is nothing but a round knot resembling the color of the body and similar to the head of a nail, and it is formed on the whole body but mostly on the parts below the feet and the toes, and it causes pain in those areas.	A corn is a round knob, the same colour as the body and resembling the head of a nail. It occurs in all parts of the body but particularly in the soles of the feet and the toes, whence arises pain in walking.	0.61564
Then you must incise around the corn, hold it with scissors or a hook, and remove it from its root; and then treat it.	You should cut away what is round the corn and take it with forceps or a hook and tear it out by the root; then dress it.	0.82873535
And if you want, cauterize it as described in its chapter.	If you wish you may cauterize it in the manner already described in the book on cauterization.	0.6480522
But a wart is a small, rough, round prominence on the surface of the body, and often appears on children's hands.	Then concerning dry warts: a wart is a little round rough compact eminence on the surface of the body; it occurs often on the hands of boys.	0.673823
And its treatment is to stretch and incise it, or to bind it with thread or skin until it falls off. And if you want, cauterize it, as we have said, with fire or with a sharp medicine.	Now the treatment is to draw out the wart and cut if off; or tie it off with a silken thread or a hair until it falls out; or if you wish, cauterize as said before, either with the actual cautery or with caustic.	0.7712752
But "formica" is a small, felt-like or large fistulated prominence on the surface of the body, moving a lot in the flesh, and when it is touched, it feels like an ant bite, and it is formed around the body.	A pimple is also a little compact thick prominence on the skin surface, going deep; when it gets cold there is a feeling as of an ant's sting in it. It is found all over the body but mostly on the hands.	0.5452719
And its treatment is to take a tube made of goose feather or vulture feather, and make it strong, and place it over the "formica" so that it contains the circle of the tube around it; then rotate your hand with the tube until you incise around the "formica," and place it deep in the flesh, and eradicate the "formica" from its root.	The treatment is to take the quill of a strong feather of the goose or the vulture, and place the quill over the pimple so as to encircle it with the circumference of the tube; then revolve the quill with your hand so as to cut all round the pimple, and go deep into the flesh, and then the pimple may be drawn out by the roots.	0.7791859
And if you want, do this with a brass or iron tube in this way:	If you wish you may extract it with a tube of bronze or of iron, of this form.	0.7503114
The upper part of the tube should be narrowed, closed (that is, not perforated), wrapped so that the handling of it with the finger is facilitated and its rotation is smooth.	The upper closed part of the tube should be fine, solid, and twisted, to give easy purchase for the fingers in holding and revolving it.	0.6259139
And if you want, cauterize the "formica" as previously described in the chapter on cauterization of atheyl.	If you wish you may cauterize the pimple as described earlier on the cauterization of warts in the book on the cautery.	0.63532734
On the form of the instruments used to administer enemas.	On the kinds of instrument for administering enemata in diseases of the rectum, and in diarrhoea and colic.	0.5229797
Sometimes enemas are made of silver or brass or cast or hammered bronze; and sometimes these instruments are made small and large according to those to whom they are administered, because those used for treating small children should be small; and for those whose anuses are delicate or painful, their enemas should be small.	A clyster may be made of silver or of Chinese alloy or of cast or hammered bronze. Large and small varieties of this instrument are made, to suit those on whom they are to be used; those for the treatment of children will be small. Patients with stricture of the anus, or pain, will have very slender clysters.	0.7990366
The form of a large and small enema:	Figure of a large clyster.	0.44978964
The top of the tube to which the bag is attached should be wide in this manner; and it should be at the place where the bag is tied, as usual.	The upper end of the funnel to which the membrane is bound should be broad like this; it should have a rim where the membrane may be bound down, as you see.	0.73676986
And the lower end, which is inserted into the anus, should be closed (that is, not open) and very smooth, narrowing to a fine point; and on one side there should be two holes, and on the other side one hole, and the size of the hole should be according to the thickness of the roots and a little thicker.	The lower extremity, which is introduced into the anus, should be closed and smooth, and on one side of it should be two holes, and on the other, one; the width of the holes should be about that of a probe or a little wider.	0.7755217
And the bag in which the medicines are placed should be made of animal bladder or sheep skin, and its root should be a palm in length.	The membrane to hold the medicament is made out of an animal's bladder or of parchment, made up in the form of a small bag, a span in diameter.	0.6287806
And it should be perforated with many holes as it is wrapped; and the space between the holes should be the thickness of a finger.	It should be pierced with a number of holes in a circle a finger's breadth apart; and into these holes pass a strong thread of yarn, twisted of ten or so threads, and with this gather up the skin like a bag; and when the medicament is placed in it tie it down firmly between the two rims on the upper end of the clyster; and then give the enema.	0.58214074
Then insert into those holes strong bile of raw bile, which should be from ten gallbladders, or around them; and attach the bag to it; and when the bag is placed on it, it should be tightened at the top of the enema tube with strong constriction between two markings, and then administer the enema through each hole: But the quality of administering the enema with it is that you fill the bag with the medicine, which should be heated according to the patient's tolerance; and be careful that it is neither too hot nor too cold.	This is the figure of the circle of skin with the holes. Now the way to give an enema with this instrument is for the parchment or bladder to be filled with the medicament, which should be warmed so as to be tolerable for the patient; but beware lest it be too hot or too cold.	0.625123
Then the patient should lie on their back, raise their legs, and place a pillow or sheet under them; then anoint the end of the enema tube with oil or egg white or fenugreek mucilage or something similar; then insert it into the anus easily, and the administrator should take the bag and squeeze it with both hands with force until everything in the enema tube is evacuated into the intestine; then remove the enema tube and the patient should lift their legs against the wall.	Then let the patient lie back and raise his legs; and put under them a leather mat or a blanket. Then anoint the tip of the clyster with oil or egg-white or mucilage of fenugreek or the like; then gently pass it into the anus; then let an assistant take the membrane in both hands and together firmly squeeze it until all the contents are squirted into the bowel. Then the clyster should be removed and the patient should raise his legs against the wall.	0.9319855
And if the medicine forces a bowel movement, the patient should hold it in as long as possible; and if they sleep with it for the whole night, it is even better for the treatment.	Then the clyster should be removed and the patient should raise his legs against the wall. If the enema stimulates him to evacuate, let him hold it as long as he can; if he delay all night long, it will be all the more efficacious.	0.73412967
But if you administer the enema in cases of diarrhea and its exit causes burning, then you should repeat the enema until it is healed.	If the enema be given in a case of diarrhoea and he has to evacuate hastily, then the use of the enema should be repeated until he is cured.	0.74101806
And if there are hemorrhoids or painful abscesses in the anus, then the enema tube should be very smooth and narrow, like the enemas used for children.	If there be haemorrhoids or painful tumours in the anus, the clyster should be exceedingly slender and smooth, of the sort employed for children.	0.7923541
On the treatment of wounds.	On the cure of wounds.	0.9638159
I have already mentioned in the section on the treatment of wounds what is suitable for the book, and now I will describe the treatment of those with manual techniques and medicines according to the procedure.	I have already mentioned in the appropriate section the treatment of such wounds as are suitable for cauterization. Here I shall describe the operative and medical treatment in full.	0.7362646
So I say that the wounds are varied according to what causes them and according to the location on the body where the wounds occur.	So I begin by saying that wounds differ according to that which causes them and according to the site.	0.8373512
And the causes for which many times wounds are made are such as the throwing of stones, or incision by sword or knife, or striking with a spear, or with sticks, or with arrows, or similar to those from many causes.	Those things that cause wounds are many: a knock from a stone, a cut from a sword or a knife, a blow by a spear, stick, or arrow; and many such things.	0.8146957
But the wounds that are on the parts of the body are such as a wound that falls upon the head, or the neck, or the chest, or the abdomen, or the liver, and similar to those of the limbs.	To consider wounds according to their site on the body, they are such as a wound occurring in the head, or neck, or chest, or belly, or liver, and so on.	0.77742755
And I am recounting the treatment of some wounds so that you apply that reasoning and rule to other wounds.	Now I am going to describe the treatment of certain wounds, so that you may take them as a standard and a guide for other wounds.	0.7533986
And I will start with the simple wounds of the head, for the consideration of the complex ones will come at the beginning of the third chapter.	I shall begin particularly with the simple wounds of the head; for mention of the compound wounds will be made at the beginning of the third book.	0.8526337
So I say that when a simple wound occurs on the head and it is not a fracture, then consider: if it is from the throwing of a stone or something similar, and it has only cracked the skin and is a large wound, and you fear for the patient the occurrence of a hot abscess, then promptly perform phlebotomy on the cephalic vein, and do not delay; and extract from the patient the blood according to the strength of the person unless some cause prohibits phlebotomy, especially if the blood that comes out of the wound is little.	I say then, that when there occurs a simple wound of the head, with no accompanying bone-fracture, you should look; and if it be caused by a knock from a stone or the like, and has only broken the skin, but it is a big wound and you fear lest there occur an abscess, then bleed the cephalic vein at once without delay; draw off from him blood in proportion to his vigour if there is no contra-indication to venesection; and particularly if the haemorrhage from the wound be slight.	0.85813123
And let the phlebotomy be on the opposite side of the wounded part; and the patient should avoid repletion, wine, and heavy foods.	The venesection should be on the opposite side to the wound; and caution the patient against gluttony and wine and rich food.	0.81254655
But if some cause prohibits bloodletting, then let the patient reduce their food intake and avoid meat and wine.	But if from any cause venesection is prevented, he should be on a light diet and avoid meat and wines.	0.78641164
And place on the wound, if a hot abscess occurs, cotton soaked in rose oil or in wine in which there is astringent.	And apply to the wound, if there be any inflammation, cotton wool soaked in oil of roses, either alone or with a somewhat astringent wine.	0.8025025
But if you are sure of a hot abscess, then place on the wound, if it is recent with its blood and the air has not altered it, the powder which I will mention shortly.	And if you are sure there is no inflammatory swelling, then apply directly to the wound, if its blood is fresh and it is unaltered by the air, the powder that I shall describe to you a little later.	0.8407817
And if the air has already altered it, then place some ointments on it until it is healed.	But if the air has already changed the wound, apply to it one of the ointments to cause it to discharge the pus; then dress until healed.	0.7297914
But if the wound is large or is by incision of a sword and the like, and the lips of it are not joined by powders, then join them with sutures as I will describe for their suturing.	Now if it be a great wound, being caused by a sword-cut or the like, and dressings will not bring the edges of the wound together, you should suture them together in the manner I shall describe in dealing with the suture of abdominal wounds.	0.7753049
But if the wound has already exposed the bone and tendon, and there is no other retention but a small suspension, then incise it and treat the wound with medicines and restore the flesh next to the skin, and instruct the patient to abstain from foods that are heavy: heads and cooked forms and similar to them, until it is healed.	But if the skin has actually disclosed the bone, and is attached by a small strip only, then cut it away and dress the wound with medicaments that will produce firm flesh to replace the skin, and bid the patient go on a diet of solid food such as brawn and gruels and the like.	0.76595604
And if you find putrefaction in the skin and it does not adhere to the bone, then you incise all that is rotten and remove it, and then treat it.	And if decomposition arise in the skin and it will not adhere to the bone, then excise all the diseased part and discard it and then dress.	0.7803803
But if in these wounds there is an artery or vein from which blood can flow, and it is not stopped by medicines, then inquire about the artery, and if you find it not incised, then you incise it with a spatula, or tie it; and if necessity forces you that what we have said does not suffice, then cauterize until the blood is stopped.	If in these wounds there be an artery or vein shedding blood, and medicinal applications do not stanch it, then examine the artery, and if you find it not quite severed then cut it through with a scalpel and ligature it; and if you are compelled, our directions being unavailing, then cauterize until the haemorrhage stops.	0.89017075
And if these wounds are simple and small, then their cause is minor; so you sprinkle on them this powder, so that they are healed before the air changes them.	If these be small and simple wounds their treatment will be a light and easy matter; it is sufficient to sprinkle some of this powder on while they are still bleeding, before the atmosphere causes a change.	0.81972
And the method of the powder is this: take one part oil of mastic, two parts dragon's blood, three parts unslaked lime; let all be very finely ground and sifted, and let the wound be filled with it, and be compressed with good compression until it adheres well to it, and be coagulated with the blood.	Description of the powder: let one part of olibanum and two parts of dragon's blood be taken, and three parts of quick or slaked lime, all beaten up together and passed through the sieve; and let the wound be packed with this and bound up tightly so that the powder sticks in position and coagulates with the blood.	0.7344185
And then compress it on top with powders and leave it, and do not untie it while it is thus until it is not abscessed, for the medicine is not removed from it until it is healed.	Then bind pads above and let it be, not undoing it so long as it remains without swelling; for the dressing will not come away of itself until it is healed.	0.8298386
And sometimes do this only cautiously, when you do not have mastic and dragon's blood present.	Lime alone can do this if you have no olibanum and dragon's blood at hand.	0.60389465
And always do this same operation on large wounds when it is necessary that it be placed on them and they be compressed, and these are recent wounds with their blood, which the air has not altered.	It has exactly the same effect too on most large wounds, when the application and bandaging are properly done, and when the haemorrhage is recent, so long as the air has not changed them.	0.75410295
And if the air has altered them, especially when it is in summer, then it is not appropriate to apply this powder, but instead treat them with what we have mentioned, so that you place on them some digestible ointments, or you place on them powders of barley flour with water and honey until they remove the rottenness; and then treat them with the other treatment until they are healed.	If, however, the air has brought about some change, especially if it be in the summer season, then there is no point in the application of this powder. Treat it then as we have said, by applying one or other of the suppurative ointments; or by applying a gruel of barleymeal with water and honey, so that the pus flows; then treat by all the usual methods until cured.	0.8248345
But if with the wound a fracture of the bone occurs, and it is small, then extract it with gesture.	If, with the wound, there be also fracture of a bone, if it be slight, you should extract it with forceps.	0.73021567
And I will tell the cure of fractures of the head in what is to come.	I mention the treatment of fractures of the head later on.	0.68883467
From the wounds of the neck.	On wounds in the neck:	0.68749887
But if the wound occurs on the neck, then there is no difference in treatment compared to a simple wound on the head.	If a wound occur in the neck the treatment of it does not differ from that of a head wound, if it be simple.	0.81991124
But if the nerve or artery in the neck is cut, then if it is a nerve, do not use astringent agents like zinc and alum, as they are harmful to the nerves and can cause contraction. Do not apply any cold substance to the wound, as the nature of the nerves is cold, and they are connected to the brain, which is the highest of all organs.	But if a nerve or artery in the neck happens to be cut: if it be a nerve, there is no device that will serve except to avoid treatment of it by strong styptic remedies such as verdigris and vitriol and the like; for these injure the nerve and cause spasm; and under no circumstance let anything cold be applied to the wound, for the substance of the nerve is cold and it is continuous with the brain, which is the most noble among the organs.	0.73670435
And treat the wound with light medicines, such as washing it with fresh water, sometimes infused with rose oil or not, and then washing it again with fresh water and applying moist ointments.	But let your remedy for it be mild, such as lime slaked in sweet water many times and moistened with olive-oil or oil of roses; and with tutty, likewise washed in sweet water; and other minerals according to this prescription, and with bland ointments.	0.67879593
But if the wound is large, then administer sutures, or close its edges, and treat it with powders until it is healed.	If the wound be large, use stitches or draw the edges of the wound together with pads; then dress until cured.	0.7755279
But if the wound is deep or occurs in a decaying area, then perforate it at the lowest part.	But if there be depth to the wound and a sinus appears at the bottom of it, in which pus has collected, then make an opening at the site of greatest depth.	0.686534
But if an artery is cut in the wound and there is a flow of blood, then separate or dry it, or tie it, or cauterize it if necessary.	Now if an artery has been cut in the wound and you are in time to find it still bleeding, divide it or ligature it; or cauterize it if you are compelled to.	0.7893102
But if the vertebrae of the throat or neck are cut and the veins of the neck are saved, then align the edges of the wound with sutures over the throat and do not touch it; first, align and reduce it to its natural shape, then secure it properly, and leave it for a few days; then treat it with ointments that have astringent and stimulating properties until it heals.	If it be such a wound that some of the cartilages of the trachea are laid open, or the whole trachea, the jugular veins being safe and sound, then join the skin edges together with a suture over the windpipe, and do not touch the windpipe, but straighten it and restore to its natural form; then tie firmly and leave for some days; then treat with salves having some styptic and astringent quality, until healed.	0.7731476
But if the wound in the bone has caused damage, then treat it, and if there are bone fragments, remove all that you can; and leave what you cannot remove until the wound decays, and it can be separated and the removal is easier.	If the wound has affected bone, examine it, and if there be fragments of bone in it get them all out, or all you can. Those you cannot get hold of, leave until the wound suppurates and heals, and it will be easy to extract them.	0.83936894
And if the wound is recent, then apply the recommended powder to it. But if a fistula has formed in the wound, then treat it with what is described in its chapter.	If it be a fresh wound, sprinkle on the powder I have described ; and if any bone corrupt in the wound and it becomes a fistula, treat it by those means we shall mention in their place.	0.76895344
If it is a strike from a spear or knife, and you see its depth, then consider if air comes out of the wound when the patient breathes; then know that the wound is mortal.	If it be a piercing wound by a spear or a knife, and you see that it is deep, examine if there be a passage of air out of it when the patient breathes; whence you may know that the injury is mortal.	0.9427203
And if it is not deep and the wound is recent with its blood, then apply the powder from the first hour, and do not compress it so that the blood is not retained in its depth and returns to the heart and kills the patient, but apply an attractive ointment and loosen it twice a day.	But if it is not deep and the haemorrhage is fresh, then do not straight away apply powder or bandage lest it keep the blood in the depths, so that it be returned to the heart and kill the patient; but apply to it a drawing ointment, and uncover it twice daily.	0.7829597
And if the ointment is not available, then place old cotton in the wound's opening to absorb the moisture; and make the patient sleep on the wound so that what is inside runs out.	If you have no ointment, apply carded cotton to the opening of the wound to soak up the humidities issuing from it. And make the patient sleep on the (side of the) wound so that what collects therein may flow out.	0.82216513
But if three days or more have passed and the patient has not experienced spasms or bad heart tremors or breathing difficulties, and other good conditions are observed, then know that the wound is safe; and then treat it with poultices and other treatments until it heals.	And if three or four days pass by after the wound, and the patient have no spasm or harmful palpitation of the heart nor obstruction to drawing breath, and you see that in other respects he is doing well, you may know that the wound is not dangerous; so treat it with pads and the usual dressings until it heals.	0.88571876
But if its healing is delayed and it remains open all the time, then know that a fistula has formed; treat it according to its chapter.	But if it will not heal and it permanently discharges pus, you may know that it has become a fistula; look for the treatment of this in the proper place.	0.7761306
And if the wound is from an incision by a sword or knife and is simple on the surface of the chest or back, then treat it with what is mentioned for sutures if it is large, or with powder if it is small.	If the wound be from a cut with a sword or knife, a straightforward surface wound in the breast or back, then treat it as described before; that is, by suture if it be a great wound or by powder if it be a small one.	0.84125376
But if damage to the bone has occurred and pieces are cut off, then twist the wound and quickly remove those pieces if they are separated. But if they are not separated, then leave them until the wound decays, making their extraction easier.	But if there has also been injury to the bone, cutting out fragments from it, you should explore the wound and hasten to draw out the fragments if they are detached from the bone; but if they are not detached then let be until the wound suppurates, when the removal of the fragments will be easy.	0.8813796
And for other wounds occurring in other limbs, the judgment in treatment is the same as what we have said.	Then with regard to other wounds occurring in other parts of the body, the same class of treatment should be used for them as for those already mentioned.	0.71150416
From the wounds of the abdomen.	On wounds of the abdomen, and protrusion of the intestine; and on suturing them.	0.47723535
The condition that occurs in the abdomen can be large, small, or moderate.	The tear that occurs in the abdomen may be great or small or it may be middle-sized.	0.8221371
Small disruptions are difficult to manage in another way, and so their reduction is more difficult if you do not promptly return them to their place, as they can swell and thicken, making repositioning difficult.	Small openings may also be difficult in another way, for they are bound to be harder to reduce, and if you do not hurry to return the gut to its place at once it will swell up and enlarge, thus rendering reduction difficult.	0.85755247
Thus, a moderate disruption is best, as it is not difficult to reduce the intestine, unlike in the other two types mentioned before.	So the best tear is the medium-sized, for in this case the reduction of the intestine will not be as difficult as in the two other cases.	0.80982906
Know that the suturing of the abdomen follows four methods, but two sutures are common and suitable for other body wounds.	Then you should know that suturing the abdomen may be carried out in four ways. Two of them are general; suitable both for suture of the abdomen and for other wounds of the body.	0.8099201
And two other sutures are specific to abdominal wounds, but they can also apply to other wounds.	The other two sutures are special; they may be used for other wounds, but are more suitable for abdominal wounds.	0.8344818
And I will explain each one to you in detail.	I shall describe each one to you separately, with comments and explanation.	0.7038822
So I say that when the wound is small and something from the intestine protrudes and is difficult to reduce, it is due to either the smallness of the disruption, as we have said, or when the intestine has become swollen from the cold air.	I begin then by saying that when the wound is small, and a piece of intestine protrudes from it, rendering the reduction of it difficult, the difficulty will be due to one of two causes: either on account of the smallness of the fissure, as we said; or because the gut has become inflated on account of the coldness of the air.	0.7972045
And when this happens, you must warm it by soaking a sponge or cloth in warm water alone or boiling it with skink, cypress, and spikenard, and apply it to the intestine until the swelling subsides.	If the latter case obtains, the gut must be warmed by fomenting with a sponge or piece of cloth bathed with warm water or water in which have been boiled rushes and cyperus and hyacinth, bathing the gut until the inflation is gone down.	0.726356
Sometimes, use a solution with astringent properties, which is better than plain water for reducing the swelling.	Wine that is somewhat astringent may do; in bringing down the swelling it is better than plain water.	0.6289488
And when you see the swelling has subsided, moisten the intestine with water in which marshmallow and mallow have been boiled, as this eases its repositioning with little effort.	When you see that the swelling has come down, bathe the gut with water in which have been infused althea and mallows; for with this the reduction of the bowel becomes easy, using the lightest effort.	0.8203386
But if repositioning is still difficult with this treatment, then slightly enlarge the disruption with an instrument used for incising hemorrhoids.	But if after this treatment the reduction is still difficult, open up the wound a little with the instrument for opening up haemorrhoids.	0.80693763
The primary treatment is better when it is proper and not just an incision, and it should not involve drying out unless necessary.	The first method, if possible, is better than incision, but one may be compelled to incise when other means have failed.	0.54361624
About the instrument, according to its shape:	This is the form of the instrument.	0.47724563
One part of it is sharp and curved, and the other part is not sharp, with a fine point, but not as thin as a needle, rather slightly blunt.	The curved side should be sharpened, but not the other; the slender extremity should not be as slender as a scalpel, but rather blunt; it is an instrument like a small polo-stick, as you see.	0.6572232
When the wound is enlarged, and the intestine protrudes, it must be returned to its natural form in its proper place, if possible, as this is better.	When the wound is opened up a little with the instrument and the bowel is reduced, it is important to return it to its natural shape and proper position, if you can, for that is better.	0.8012246
But when the disruption is large and in the lower part of the abdomen, make the patient lie on their back with their legs higher than their head; if it is in the upper part of the abdomen, place the patient's head and chest higher than the lower parts.	When the wound is large and in the lower abdomen the patient should lie on his back and have his legs higher than his head; but if it be in the upper abdomen his head and chest should be placed higher than his lower parts.	0.9100367
Similarly, if the disruption is on one side of the abdomen, always ensure that the part with the wound is higher than the other.	And in the same way if the opening be on one side of the abdomen you should always make it your object to put the wounded side higher than the other.	0.82082707
And so you should administer this for large and moderate wounds.	So must you proceed in large or middling wounds.	0.75637376
For small wounds, use what you have prepared, and ensure the assistant is compassionate, holding the disruption with their hand, adjusting the edges, and revealing the wound to the one performing the suture.	But in small wounds put the patient in a position convenient to yourself. Then have an assistant under your direction to enclose within his hands the whole of the wound and bring the edges together, and then uncover it bit by bit for the one who is putting in the stitches.	0.69090295
This is the common suturing method: take the needle, or count the needles according to the width of the wound; leave from the end of the disruption on the ring finger, and tighten the needle, making sure not to place the thread in both ends of the suture, with two ends of the linen under the internal parts, until you penetrate from that part; you have already gathered two ends of the suture and two ends of the linen, making four orders.	Now this is the description of one general suture, namely: one or more needles are taken, depending on the size of the wound; then, leaving about the width of the little finger from the end of the opening, pass an unthreaded needle from within through both edges of the skin together with both edges of the peritoneum which lies beneath the skin, piercing from one side to the other; thus you will have brought together both skin edges and both peritoneal edges, making four layers.	0.7976766
Then, tighten with double thread around the needle, sometimes from both sides together, and bring the two edges of the wound together properly; leave a finger's width and insert another needle, tying it with thread as you did with the first needle; continue doing this with the needles until you have completed the entire closure of the wound.	Then wind a double thread several times round the needle, and tighten up from both sides so as to bring the two edges of the wound perfectly together. Then again leave about a finger's breadth and put in another needle and fasten it with thread as you did in the first instance; and go on doing this with as many needles as you need until you have finished mending the whole wound.	0.91806835
The needles should be moderately thick, as very thin needles easily cut the flesh, and very thick ones are difficult to insert into the linen, so they should be of moderate thickness and fineness.	The needles should be of medium fineness; for the very fine needles soon cut into the flesh; while thick needles, on the other hand, are difficult to pass through the skin; so they should be medium between fineness and thickness.	0.8465936
The needle should not be placed too close to the two ends of the linen, to avoid easily cutting the flesh and causing the wound to open before healing.	You should not introduce the needle too near the edge of the skin lest the tissues be soon cut through and the wound gape before it has joined.	0.80042326
The sutures should not be prolonged so that the wound is not hindered from healing.	Nor should there be too great an interval between the stitches, lest the wound be prevented from scarring up.	0.7200572
Cut the ends of the needles so they do not hurt the patient while sleeping; apply powders over the sutures to cover the ends of the needles and leave them until you know the wound has healed.	Then cut off the ends of the needles lest they hurt the patient during sleep; and make for him pads of linen scraps to cover the needle ends on both sides; and let them be until you know the wound is healed up.	0.85340905
This type of needle suture is more suitable for small wounds, as one or two needles are enough for suturing them.	This method of suture with needles is most suitable in small wounds, for one or two needles or thereabouts will probably be enough for such.	0.85602033
But the second suture is common: you administer the four ends, two from the linen and two from the flax, at once, with a needle threaded with equally fine and thick thread.	Now the second kind of general suture is to bring together all four edges, the two skin edges and the two peritoneal edges, at one and the same time, with a needle furnished with a twisted thread of medium thickness.	0.6829324
And when you have penetrated these four ends with the needle, return the needle from the same part you started, so the thread retracts from the uppermost part to the wound, making the suture like sewing fabric where the cloth is tightened.	Then when the needle has pierced these four edges bring it back precisely to where you began, so that the thread may lie knitted over the wound to make a stitch in the manner of sewing up the bags in which goods are packed.	0.8040918
Leave a space between each suture the size of the little finger's thickness.	The distance between stitches should be a little finger's breadth.	0.70893884
And this suture is known to people.	Everybody is familiar with this stitch.	0.63372
And with such a suture, I closed the wound of a man who had been stabbed in the abdomen with a knife. The wound was larger than a palm, and around two palms of the intestine had protruded from the middle part of the abdomen. I reduced it after the intestine had been out of the wound for twenty-four hours.	With this stitch I once sewed up a wound that a man got in the belly. He had been wounded with a knife; and the opening of the wound was more than a span long; and by that time there protruded some two spans' length of his mid-gut. The opening was in the middle of his belly; and I reduced it after the bowel had been outside the wound for twenty-four hours.	0.8910391
And the wound healed within about fifteen days. I treated it, and it healed; afterward, he lived for many years and maintained his health.	The wound healed in about a fortnight, and I treated him until he was better; and he lived for many years after this, carrying on as usual.	0.8510445
Other doctors had judged that he would not heal, but it was a miracle because I treated him without ointment, as it was a place where ointment or any medicine was not available. Instead, I applied old cotton twice a day and washed it regularly with honey water until it healed.	The verdict of the doctors was that he could not be healed. The remarkable thing is that I did not treat him with any ointment, for I was in a place where there was no sort of medicine; so twice a day I applied teased-out cotton wool to the wound, and carefully washed it with honey-water until he was healed.	0.79908544
But I will describe two specific types of sutures according to Paracelsus.	I shall now describe one of the two kinds of special suture according to the text of Galen.	0.65289134
The first is to start with the suture from the linen, inserting the needle from the outside to the inside.	You begin at the skin, running the needle from without inwards.	0.66596425
When the needle penetrates the linen and follows a straight path along the length of the body, leave the end of the thread in which the needle was inserted; then insert the needle in the other end from inside to outside at the other end of the wound.	When you pass it through the skin and the muscle that runs the length of the belly, leave the edge of the peritoneum on that side where the needle was introduced; and pierce the other edge of the peritoneum from within outwards through the other edge of the abdominal wall.	0.7436828
Once you have done this penetration, insert the needle again from the same end of the wound, from outside to inside; leave the end of the thread on that side and insert the needle on the other end from inside to outside.	When you have done this, pierce the same edge of the abdominal wall from the outside inwards, leaving the edge of the peritoneum which is on that side, and pierce the other side from within outwards.	0.72756684
Insert the needle with the thread into the end of the wound so that it penetrates completely.	As you pierce, make the needle pass through the peritoneum to the edge of the abdominal wall that is adjacent to that part until it pierces right through the whole.	0.47210968
Then, start from the same side and sew it with the end of the thread on the other side. Remove the needle from the linen it penetrated, reinsert it into the linen, and sew the end of the thread on the other side with this end of the wound; remove it from the linen on that side.	Then begin again on that same side and sew it together with the peritoneal edge on the opposite side and bring the needle out through the skin nearby. Then reintroduce into the same skin area and sew the opposite peritoneal edge with that abdominal skin edge and bring the needle out through the adjacent skin.	0.78945166
Do this once and again, repeating until you have sewn everything outside according to that example.	Do this once again and repeat until you have sewn up the whole wound after this fashion.	0.81009096
The essence of this suturing method is to sew it with a stitch similar to leather stitching, sewing the thread from the linen once from the end, and leaving it again until it is completed.	In short, this way of suturing is to sew with the stitch used by furriers in sewing skins; thus you stitch the peritoneum once one way with the skin edge and leave it once the other way, until you have done.	0.67840815
But the second specific type of suture, which is known as Gualia, is described as follows: you sew it similarly to how some doctors sew it, by matching each part to its corresponding part as naturally as possible; and applying the end of one to the end of the wound, as I described to you.	Now the manner of the second type of special stitch which Galen mentioned is this (these are his own words): that you suture it in the same way as many practitioners. That is, they suture each part to the part that corresponds naturally to it; so they join one peritoneal margin to the other and one skin margin to the other, in the manner I shall describe.	0.7879282
You should place the needle at the end of the wound closest to you from the outside, making it penetrate inside at that point, leaving two ends of the thread; then, turn the needle and make it penetrate from outside to inside at two ends of the thread.	You should put the needle from without inwards, in that edge of the abdominal wall that is nearest to you, and make it pass inward through that alone, leaving out the peritoneal edges; then turn the needle round and run it from without inwards through both peritoneal edges.	0.7962922
Then, turn each one and make each one penetrate from inside to outside in two other ends of the wound that are on the opposite side.	Then turn it round again and make it pierce, from within outwards, the other edge of the abdominal wall, on the opposite side.	0.7450249
This method of suturing is better than the common light suture and is the one I mentioned before.	This type of suture is better than the easy general suture that has been mentioned.	0.7949431
This is the teaching of Gualia.	These are Galen's very words.	0.5124514
Some might say that the abdominal suture is done with two needles, each threaded, starting with the insertion of the needle from your side and making it penetrate to the other side, according to the way you would sew skins.	Some have said that the suture of the abdomen may be performed with two needles, thus: you thread one thread into both and begin by introducing the needle into that part near you and carrying it through to the other side. Then you insert the other needle on the far side and bring it through to the near side, after the manner of the shoemaker's stitch.	0.8033062
Know that when the disruption is in the middle of the abdomen, suturing it is more difficult than in other parts of the abdomen.	You must understand that when the fissure is in the middle of the abdomen the sewing of it is more difficult than in other parts of the abdomen.	0.91935694
But the assessment of the wound treatment is the same as for other wounds.	But the medical treatment of the wound comes under just the same heading as that of other wounds.	0.8630687
The reason is that if you treat the fresh wound with its blood before the air alters it, and you reduce the intestine, sew it, and dress it properly, then you apply an incarnative powder.	When you find a wound with its blood quite fresh, before the atmosphere has altered it, and you have reduced the intestine and have sewn it up and closed it firmly, apply to it powder to encourage fresh growth.	0.6186206
If the air has already altered the wound, then apply some ointments that are available to you until it forms a hard scab and the threads fall out, and the skin and flesh are consolidated; then treat it as you would other wounds until it is healed.	But if the air has altered it, then apply to it some of the available ointments until it suppurates and the threads come away and the peritoneum and abdominal wall heal; then dress it as you would any other wound, until it is better.	0.7648432
But if you don't have medicines available, then apply old cotton as soon as it starts to discharge, changing it twice a day as instructed, until it heals, because you won't need other medication in many cases when the wounds are simple.	If you have no medicaments to hand, apply cotton wool as soon as suppuration begins, and change it twice daily, as I have taught you, until it heals. You will need no other treatment in the majority of cases when the wounds are simple.	0.8406871
But if you fear that the wound might affect the principal organs, then you should soak wool in well-tempered oil or rose oil and apply it around the areas between the groin and under the armpits.	But if you fear that the important organs may share the hurt of the wound, then you should dip some soft wool in moderately warm olive-oil or oil of roses and bind it round the various sites between the groin and the axillae.	0.8495921
If there is pain or putrefaction in the intestines, which happens often, then wash it with lukewarm astringent black wine, especially if the putrefaction has reached the intestines and is making its way into the abdominal cavity.	If pain or gangrene be felt in the bowels—and that frequently happens—then clyster him with tepid astringent black wine, particularly if the gangrene has already set in in the bowel and has become a wound penetrating to the abdominal cavity.	0.8490602
And know that a wound in the large intestine is easier to heal than one in the small intestine.	You should know that if the injured bowel be the large intestine it will heal the more easily, while if it be the small its healing is more difficult.	0.7194748
It is difficult to heal because the intestine called "jejunum" does not heal well from any wound due to the large number of veins and the size of those veins, the thinness of its tissue, and its proximity to the nature of the nerves.	But the part of the bowel called the jejunum is not likely to recover from an injury to it at all; and that is due to the number and size of arteries in it and to the thinness of its structure and to its nearly approaching a nerve in its character.	0.7255718
But if what protrudes from the wound is the omentum, and you manage it while it is still fresh, reduce it carefully as you would reduce the intestines.	If what protrudes from the wound be omentum, and you find it freshly protruding, then reduce it as you do intestine.	0.77276313
But if it has already turned green or black, then tie it off with thread at the discolored spot to allow blood to flow, because the omentum contains veins and arteries.	But if some time has lapsed and it has turned green or black, you should ligate it above the site where it has gone black lest there be a haemorrhage; for the omentum contains veins and arteries.	0.87092006
Then cut below the tie and leave two ends of the thread hanging from the lower part of the wound outside, to relieve the tension on the omentum and allow for the drainage of the wound.	Then cut off what is below the ligature and leave the ends of the thread hanging out from the lower part of the wound, so that it will be easy for you to draw upon it and extract it as the omentum falls away and the wound suppurates.	0.80131954
Recollection of wounds when they occur in the intestines.	A note on the wound occurring in the intestine.	0.7036154
When a disruption occurs in the intestines and it is small, it is possible that it can be restored in some people, because I saw someone who had been wounded in the stomach with a lance; the wound was on the right side of the stomach, it had become old and formed a fistula, and there was discharge and gas coming out of it.	When a break occurs in the intestine and it is a small one, it is possible, in some men, that it may mend. For I myself saw a man who had been wounded by a spear-thrust in the abdomen. The wound was to the right of the stomach, and, being chronic, became a fistula whence issued faeces and flatus.	0.88787293
So I undertook the treatment of it, even though I was not confident in its healing, but I continued to carefully treat it until it was healed and the area was consolidated.	I set about treating him, though I had no hope of his recovery, and I continued to attend him, and eventually he recovered and the place healed over.	0.6920252
And once I saw the area consolidated, I feared for the patient that something bad might happen to his stomach; but nothing bad happened, and he remained in good health, eating and drinking, and even taking baths and exercising as he used to.	And when I saw that the place had healed over I was afraid for the patient lest some harm should occur in the abdominal cavity; but absolutely no harm arose from it, and he remained perfectly well and healthy, eating and drinking and engaging in coitus and going to the bath and carrying out the duties of his office.	0.88657343
And some experienced people have said that when there is a wound in the intestine, and it is small, it should be tied in this way: you take ants with large heads; then you bring the two lips of the wound together and place an ant with its mouth open on the two lips of the wound; when it bites and tightens its mouth, you cut off its head, as it adheres and does not come off.	Some men of experience have said that when a wound occurs in the intestine and it is small, it should be sutured in this manner, namely: ants with large heads are taken; then the edges of the wound are brought together and one of these ants is applied by its open jaws to the two edges of the wound, and when it seizes it and closes its jaws then the head is cut off, and it will stick and will not loosen.	0.9121052
Then place another ant next to the first one, and continue doing this with ants, one next to another, according to the size of the entire wound.	Then another ant is applied near the first; and you proceed after this manner with a number of ants according to the size of the wound.	0.8566864
Then you reduce the wound and sew it; and those heads remain attached in the intestine until the intestine is healed; and no harm comes to the patient.	Then reduce the intestine and sew up the wound; for the heads will remain sticking to the intestine until it is healed up; and no harm will come to the patient.	0.9405524
It is also possible that the intestine can be tied with a thin thread made from animal intestines, which is attached to it and then threaded through a needle; you take the end of this gut thread, make it very clean, and tie it to another thread, wrap it, and then insert that thread into the needle and sew the intestine with it, and reduce it in the disruption.	The intestine may also be sewn up with the fine suture which is extracted from an animal's gut and sticks to it after being threaded in a needle. The method is that the end is taken of this suture made of gut, well scraped; and to this end is fixed a fine linen thread, twisted, and then that thread is passed through the needle affixed to the suture of animal's gut, with which the intestine is sewn and then replaced in the abdominal cavity.	0.8642901
And this method of suturing with ants is only a way of trust and hope.	These kinds of suture, with the ants and with the gut, are by way of a remote hope.	0.50305754
But if the wound is large and wide, especially if it is in one of the small intestines, then it is not healing but a refinement, and it is not a complete healing.	But if the opening be great and wide, and especially if it be in one of the small intestines, there is no technique to deal with it, nor any cure.	0.8184036
On the treatment of sores and fistulae.	On the treatment of defluxions and fistulae.	0.88476264
Know that any wound or abscess, when it worsens and becomes old, and turns into an ulcer, and is not healed and continuously discharges and is not cut off, then, in any part of the body, it is universally called a fistula and we call it azukem.	You should know that any wound or tumour, when it becomes old and chronic, and turns into an ulcer, and does not heal over, but discharges pus chronically and constantly, is generally called a fistula, in whatever part of the body it may be; but we call it a defluxion.	0.8777351
And a fistula, in truth, is a hard, white, felt-like node that is not painful and has a cavity like a bird's feather shaft; hence, some call it rizatz, that is, feather.	The fistula proper is a compact hard white painless induration with a central hollow like a bird's quill; on which account some call it a quill.	0.7548467
And in some people, it is moist, discharging fluid; and very quickly the moisture can be cut off in a few hours. And sometimes this moisture is abundant, and sometimes it is scant, thick, or thin.	At certain times it may be moist, constantly discharging pus; and again at certain times the moisture may cease; and the discharge may be greater or less; and it may be thick or thin.	0.71436614
All these causes have been shown, along with their signs and the treatment with medicines, in the division.	I have indeed already, in their proper place, explained all these causes and their symptoms and their medical treatments.	0.67287564
And it is necessary that I inform you about the treatment of fistula, which is done by surgical operation.	Now here I must explain to you the operative treatment of fistula and defluxion.	0.6863687
And know that fistula occurs in all parts of the body; for there are fistulas that reach the large veins and arteries, or the nerves, or the omentum, or the intestines, or the bladder, or some of the ribs, or one of the vertebrae of the back, or some of the joints composed in a way similar to the hand and foot; and among those are the ones that harm the proximity of the principal member and similar areas.	You should know that a fistula may happen in any part of the body; and some fistulae reach as far as some great vein or artery or nerve or membrane or intestine or the urinary bladder, or one of the ribs or dorsal vertebrae, or some highly complex joint such as the hand or foot, while some terminate quite near some major organ, and so on.	0.87333333
And therefore, those among these fistulas which are of this kind are diseases of difficult healing, and do not receive treatment, and dealing with them is laborious and ignorant.	Fistulae of this kind are among the diseases from which recovery is difficult; they are not amenable to treatment and to occupy oneself with them is labour in vain.	0.81012493
And if there is a fistula, the depth of which does not reach these places that I mentioned, and you hope and trust in its healing, and want to gain knowledge of it, then take a probe of bronze or iron, and if the fistula goes straight, then explore it with that.	But if there are any fistulae which do not reach in depth the places we have mentioned, and you have some hope and expectation of curing them, and you wish to attain to recognizing these, then you take a probe of bronze or iron, if the fistula run in a straight line, and investigate it with that.	0.86054873
But if the fistula is tortuous, then investigate it with a thin lead probe, because lead, with the lightness of its body, is relieved and curved towards the tortuosity.	But if the fistula be tortuous then investigate it with a thin leaden probe; for lead is soft, so as to flex on entry and follow the curves of the fistula.	0.82558364
And if the fistula has many openings, it is not possible for you to identify it with a probe.	But if the fistula have multiple openings so that you cannot explore it with the probe, then make an injection into one of the openings.	0.7495169
Then inject fluid through its openings, because the moisture with which you inject it will go to the other openings and flow out of them.	The fluid you inject into that one will run to the other openings and flow out from them.	0.7758033
And then inquire carefully, in whatever way it is possible for you to determine if there is bone or nerve here, and if the cavity of the fistula is deep or shallow, or if it is a fistula with many openings; consider all this with the sum of your skill, your questioning of the patient, the finding of pain by pressing with your hand on the area, and the appearances of the signs and the causes related to the abscess.	Then make a complete exploration by whatever means you can, to find out whether there be at that place a bone or nerve, and whether the fistula be deep or superficial, and whether the fistula be one with multiple openings. Inform yourself of all these points, exerting yourself to inquire of the patient whether he feels pain while you are compressing with the hand, and seeking other indications and causes of tumour that may arise.	0.90009755
And when you have considered all these causes with true understanding, then come to the treatment with confidence: consider whether the fistula is close or in a safe place, far from a joint, nerve, artery, or vein, or one of the places I mentioned to you.	When you have made quite certain of all these points, then proceed confidently with the treatment, namely: see if the fístula be obvious and accessible, or in a harmless situation far removed from a joint or vein or artery or tendon or any of the other places I have mentioned to you.	0.81621903
Then you dry the fistula as previously described, remove what is in it by filtration and the corrupted flesh, and what has grown in the opening from flesh or other similar tissue, and treat it until it is healed.	Then lay open the fístula by the method I have described and fetch out of it all the granulations and diseased and superfluous tissue and whatever tissue or growth be arising in its opening, and dress until healed.	0.7832071
But if the fistula is deep, and straight, then it must be cut with a knife as much as possible, and then clean it of all its corrupted flesh; and then apply sponges soaked in sharp medicines, and insert them into the cavity of the fistula, which you have understood with the iron probe.	If the termination of the fistula lies deep and its course be straight, you should cut it open as far in as you can and then clean out of it all diseased tissue; then use swabs soaked in corrosive, and push them to the bottom of the fistula, which is as far as you can reach with the probe.	0.78832555
And do this with it several times until the sharp medicine corrodes all that remains in the cavity of the fistula from the corruption.	Do this repeatedly until the caustic has destroyed all the superfluous matter remaining at the bottom of the fistula.	0.7365719
And then restore it with ointments that generate healthy flesh until it is healed.	Then dress it with ointments that make the flesh grow sound, until it heals.	0.81488216
But if it is not healed by this, then you cauterize it as we have recommended.	But if it does not heal thus, then cauterize it in the prescribed way.	0.8591156
But if the cause of the fistula is bone and you are certain of this, then you examine it and dry it as we have recommended, unless some vein, nerve, or principal part prevents you as we have said.	If a bone be the cause of the fistula, and you are sure of that, then examine the fistula and open it up in the way I have told you, if there be nothing in the way like a blood-vessel or nerve or important organ, as we said.	0.8090813
But if the bone is exposed to you and there is some corruption and blackness, then you scrape it until all the corruption is removed; and then treat it with something that causes it to regenerate until it is healed.	And if the bone is laid bare to you and there be in it some corruption and blackening, then scrape it until all the corruption be removed; then put on dressings that will encourage granulation, until it be healed.	0.8786119
And if it does not heal and still discharges as it did before, then know that you have not completely eradicated the corruption; and then you expose it again and carefully perform the scraping and cleaning with your utmost skill, and then restore it.	If it does not heal but discharges pus in the way it did before, then you may know that you have not yet managed to extirpate the corruption completely. Therefore you must expose it again and with the utmost diligence carry out the scraping and cleaning of it.	0.87654436
And if it is healed, that is good; if not, then know that the corruption is in the deep recesses of the body, which cannot be reached, and then it is best to leave it alone.	Then dress it; and if it heals, good; if not, then you may know that this corruption is very deep-seated in the body and out of reach, and there is nothing you can do for it but leave it to nature.	0.7936098
And if the corrupted bone is small, or it is possible for you to extract it, then you extract it with fine forceps that are suitable for this.	If the diseased bone be a small one, and it be possible for you to extract it, then do so with a pair of fine forceps suited to the purpose.	0.84528244
And if there are many bones, then carefully perform the extraction of all of them, and do not leave any behind with your skill.	And if there be a number of bones then you must accurately carry out the extraction of all of them, and spare no effort to ensure that none is left.	0.8137562
But if some cause of moisture interferes with you, and there is no fear or mistake in their incision, then you incise those ligaments or flesh if they are there, and free the bones.	If any ligaments lie in your way and there be no danger in incising them, then make an incision into the ligaments and whatever tissues are there, and free the bones.	0.7142476
But if it is not the right time for you to remove the bones, then place over the wound something that can rot the wound, and leave it until it reaches around those bones of flesh and ligaments, and keep the wound from healing, and keep the section that you have incised in your operation open.	If it is not possible for you to extract the bone immediately, apply over the wound something to induce suppuration, and leave it for some days until suppuration has set in in the tissues and ligaments around the bones.	0.701566
Further, if you fear, place over it a cotton soaked in soap and oil, or cotton soaked in Egyptian ointment, or in some of the green ointments, for when those ligaments rot, and the bones are separated from them, the removal is eased.	Keep an eye on the wound lest the incision that you made during your operation close up; if you fear this, apply to it cotton wool soaked in sulphur beaten with olive-oil, or cotton soaked in Egyptian ointment or in one of the green ointments. Then, when those ligaments have been softened by putrefaction and the bones crumble, it will be easy to shift them and take them out.	0.80768824
But if it is a large bone such as the bone of the leg or thigh or similar to those, and what is corrupted is only the surface, then scrape it only slightly until that blackness and corruption is removed, and then restore the wound.	If it be one large bone such as the tibia or the femur or the like, and the diseased part be only the surface, then scrape it thoroughly until all the blackness and corruption is gone, then close the wound.	0.81675065
But if the corrupted part is large, and the corruption has already reached the marrow of the bone, then it is necessary to close it and cut it all the way to the place where the corruption has reached, and then treat it until it is healed.	If the corrupt portion be very extensive and reach to the marrow of the bone, you will not be able to avoid sawing it off and cutting it all away to the point where the corruption ends; then dress until healed.	0.7661888
And I recount to you what happened to a man in his thigh so that you may take it as an example and help in your operation.	Now I shall tell you of a defluxion that once occurred in a man's leg, as an example and a help to you in your treatment.	0.8115386
It was a young man about 30 years old, who suffered pain in his thigh, and from the inner parts of the body the bad matter moved to the thigh, and it was matter of an abscess with a large abscess, and it was not caused by an external factor.	This man was young, about thirty years of age. He once got a pain in the leg from something internal, which so worked that eventually matter came into the leg and caused it to swell greatly, there being no external cause.	0.7983972
And so the time was extended due to the error of the doctors until the abscess burst, and much matter came out, and its treatment was delayed until the leg developed fistulas, and many openings formed, all of which discharged pus and body fluids.	And time passed by, to the accompaniment of error on the part of the doctors, until the tumour opened and much discharge came away; and the treatment was so mismanaged that fistulae formed in the leg and many sinuses opened up, all of which discharged pus and body humours.	0.8910991
And then many doctors treated him for about two years, and none had a skilled hand in the art, until I was called.	A whole host of doctors had been treating it for a matter of two years, not one of whom had any skill in the surgical art. Eventually he sought me.	0.7970783
And I saw his leg and the matter flowing from those openings in large amounts; and the man's body was completely wasted and his color was jaundiced.	I saw his leg, with matter coming away from the orifices in large quantities; and the man's body was wasted and jaundiced.	0.898622
And then I inserted the probe into one of those openings and the probe reached the bone.	So I introduced a probe into one of the openings and the probe touched bone.	0.86828977
And then I examined all the openings and found that they all reached the bone in various parts of the leg.	Then I investigated all the openings and found them all communicating with one another in all parts of the leg.	0.8919673
And then I hastened and incised over one of those openings until I exposed a part of the bone, and found it corrupted, already crumbly and blackened; and a part of the leg was already corrupted, having penetrated to the marrow.	So I quickly cut down upon one of these openings until a part of the bone was laid bare, and I found it diseased, by now eaten away, and black and foul and full of holes, down to the marrow.	0.85265267
And then I sawed what was exposed and prepared of the exposed bone.	So I sawed off as much of the diseased bone as I had exposed and could get at.	0.5823064
And I believed that it was not in the bone but only that corruption which I had excised and sawed off, and I had already eradicated it.	In fact I thought that there was no more disease in the bone beyond what I had cut and sawn away, and that I had completely eradicated it.	0.6953085
And then I applied restorative medicine to the wound for a long time, and it did not heal.	Then I tried for a very long time to heal the wound with medicines encouraging growth of flesh, but it would not heal.	0.7522961
And then I repeated and exposed the bone again from the first exposure, and found continued corruption with the bone.	Then I again uncovered the bone, above the first opening, and found the corruption co-extensive with the bone.	0.80452317
And I sawed off what appeared to me of that corruption, and then I was forced to treat and restore it, and it did not heal.	So again I sawed away as much of the corruption as I could see; then I tried to heal it, but it would not heal nor unite.	0.7477411
And then I exposed it again and did not cease incising the bone little by little in parts and forced its restoration, and it did not heal until I incised about a palm's width of it, and extracted it with its marrow, and then restored it with medicines, and it healed slightly and was healed.	Then I opened it up once more and went on cutting away the bone piecemeal and trying to heal it, and it would not heal until I had cut away about a span of bone with the marrow; then I treated it medicinally and it quickly healed over and was cured.	0.8693496
And repetition of the operation and cutting is not necessary except for the condition of its fragility and the lack of its tolerance and fear of death, as it caused frequent bad syncope from excess evacuation.	But it would not have been necessary to repeat the operation and the incision thus, were it not for the patient's weakness and inability to tolerate much at a time, and because of my fears for his life, since an evil faint was constantly seizing him on account of the heavy drain.	0.6892463
And then he was healed completely, and in place of the bone there was hard flesh; and his condition was good in his body and his strength returned; and he resumed his usual activities and had no trouble walking nor any other problem.	But he was completely cured, and in place of the bone there grew up firm tissue; his bodily state was sound and his strength was restored. He went about his business, and no hurt whatsoever came to him from walking.	0.86277676
But if it is a prominent bone in a location of the body that is already cut, then you should proceed in this manner: take a bandage and tie it at the end of the prominent bone, and instruct someone to pull it upwards; place a thicker wool bandage over the first bandage; and then tie it over the flesh below the bone, and extend the end of it so that you pull the flesh downwards, and you expose the flesh over the place you want to saw so that the saw does not harm the flesh.	Now in the case of a prominent bone that has been broken in any part of the body, it should be sawn off in this manner: you take a ligature and tie it to the extremity of the prominent bone and bid someone keep it stretched upward; then you put on another ligature of wool thicker than the first, tying it to the tissue that is beneath the bone, and pull on the end so that the flesh is drawn down and you lay bare of flesh the spot where you intend to saw, so that the saw does not injure the flesh.	0.8926756
And place wood or a board under the bone decently, because when you do this the saw will not be prevented from cutting the corrupted flesh.	You should place a block of wood or a board firmly beneath the bone; which done, there is no hindrance to the saw's cutting through the diseased bone.	0.8295735
And the sawing should be done over the corrupted part little by little, because if the corruption is in the cavity of the bone and does not appear on its surface, it will be necessary to saw it again.	The saw-cut should be made a little above the site of the disease in case there should be disease in the cavity of the bone that is not apparent on the surface, which might compel you to carry out the sawing a second time.	0.65240014
And if the bone is corrupted and not prominent, and it is a single continuous piece, and the corruption is in the middle or a part of it, then you expose all the flesh around it; and then place wood under it, and then saw it from the first part where the corruption is until the sawing is continuous with the other part.	If the bone be diseased without any swelling, but it all seems the same from one part to another, and the disease be in the middle or in one segment of it, then expose it on all sides; put the block beneath, and saw it from the first side, where the disease is. When you have finished this, saw it from the other side.	0.7738954
And the sawing should be done a little according to the location of the corruption, as we have said.	The saw-cut should be at a little distance from the diseased part, as we have already said.	0.6391289
And if the corruption is in the joint, incise that corrupted joint, and saw the bone where it is continuous with the other part.	If the disease be in one of the phalanges, amputate the diseased phalanx and saw through the bone where it is continuous on the other (healthy) side.	0.6442297
And if the corruption is in the continuation of two joints, then it is not in the cutting but rather in the skill.	If the disease be in the joint between two members, then there is nothing to be done but scraping.	0.5559063
And if the corruption is in the palm of the hand or the foot, it is very difficult; however, you should examine the corruption in whatever manner it appears to you, and you should expose it, and clean it according to whatever condition is possible for you, and with whatever skill is suitable for you, as long as it does not interfere with any vein or nerve.	If the disease be in the carpus or tarsus it is a very difficult matter treating them; you must peel off the disease in whatever way seems possible, and scrape it away and clean up the part in whatever way you can and by whatever technique is convenient for you, so long as there is no vein or nerve in your way.	0.7540226
And you should know that the cutters and saws used to incise these bones vary according to the location of the bones, their preparation, their thickness, their subtlety, their size, their smallness, their hardness, and their rarity; therefore you must prepare the appropriate instrument for each type of operation.	Now you should know that there are a great number of cutting instruments and saws for cutting these bones, varying according to the different sites and arrangements of the bones; their thickness or thinness; their greatness or smallness; their hardness or sponginess; so you should have ready for every sort of operation an instrument suitable for that operation.	0.8561195
And you should know that this operation indicates to you the type of instrument you need; because for you there is great study and long experience and knowledge of the methods of this art, and witness to the types of illnesses, as you then have for yourself what is suitable for the instruments for each illness.	You should know too that when you have long experience and knowledge of the branches of this art the operations themselves may well indicate the kind of instrument needed; for the man who is skilled in the art and has seen various kinds of disease may think out for himself which instrument is suitable for each disease.	0.8448803
And I am providing you at the end of this chapter with the list of instruments that you will use with examples with which you will proceed in your practice which you will experiment with on others. Form of a saw:	At the end of this chapter I give you illustrations of a number of instruments as types for you to copy and as a pattern upon which you can base others, God willing:	0.7488752
Form of another saw:	Another saw.	0.5313402
Form of another large saw:	A large saw.	0.50167507
Form of a rasp: Let the head of this rasp be in the form of a star-shaped nail, and the points be in the form of the points of a stele.	Scraper; the head of this scraper should resemble the head of a nail, stellate, engraved like a file.	0.7107655
And it is only necessary that with it the heads of the joints are rubbed when they are corrupted, or if the opening is large and wide.	What it is suitable for is to scrape the diseased heads of joints, or big broad bones.	0.59393245
Form of a smaller razor:	Another scraper, small.	0.45795977
Form of a broad razor:	Broad scraper.	0.5204216
Form of another decently made saw: let it be made with a high arch and the sharpness of it of iron, and its handle of properly made wood. Form of it:	Firm (bow) saw. The upper bow and the blade are made of iron, the handle of box-wood, turned and firmly fixed.	0.58344924
Form of a razor with a concavity:	Scraper with concavity.	0.4843055
Form of another fine razor:	Another scraper, fine.	0.49502856
Form of another razor with a curved end:	Another scraper, with bent extremity.	0.62589216
Form of a small razor similar to a probe:	Small scraper resembling a probe.	0.7687259
Form of another smaller incisor:	Another osteotome, small.	0.56299084
Form of another incisor; this one similar to a rasp, and its end is like a saw, and it is used in many places in bone operations:	Another scraper. Its extremity is like a probe, and it is handy in many places for scraping bone.	0.7487329
Form of a rasp which is suitable for cutting bones:	A scraper suitable for perforated bone.	0.6964949
And its end is triangular and sharp.	Its extremity is triangular, with sharp edges.	0.7942309
And it is made of Indian iron, and similarly all the things we have mentioned about razors and incisors and saws.	It is made of Indian iron, as should be all the scrapers and cutting instruments we have mentioned.	0.80791366
On the incision of extremities and the sawing of bones.	On the amputation of limbs and the sawing-off of bones.	0.9214997
Extremities can rot either due to intrinsic or extrinsic causes, or when you have treated that corruption with healing medicines and the healing does not occur, or you see the corruption spreading towards the limb without any apparent cause, then you must incise that limb where the corruption has reached, so that the patient may avoid death or severe damage which is a greater detriment to the limb.	Sometimes the extremities become gangrenous, either from an external or an internal cause. Now when you have treated this disease by medical means, ineffectively, and you see that the disease is spreading over the limb and nothing will stop it, you must cut off that limb as far as the disease has spread, so that the patient may escape death or great affliction, greater than the loss of the limb.	0.70748043
And the sign of one to whom this occurs is that the limb turns black as if it had been burned, or it rots near the blackness until that rot spreads to the limb and takes over the whole body; and then you should quickly incise it.	Now the sign of the victim of this state is that the limb goes black, so that you might think it were burnt with fire, or, after the blackening, it putrefies, and the putrefaction spreads to parts adjacent to that limb and begins to attack the whole body; cut it away as soon as you can.	0.80414224
Similarly, if the cause of the corruption is the bite of some venomous creature such as a sea scorpion, viper, spider, or similar.	So must you do if the disease is caused by the bite of some dangerous reptile such as the marine scorpion, viper, or venomous spider, and so on.	0.8048028
And if the corruption or the bite is on the fingertip, then you should incise the finger and not give the corruption space to spread to the hand.	If the disease or bite be at the tip of the finger, cut off the finger, giving the disease no opportunity to spread to the rest of the hand.	0.7194288
Similarly, if it reaches the hand, then you should incise it at the root of the wrist, and not give the corruption space to reach the arm.	Similarly, if it attacks the hand, cut if off at the wrist, giving the disease no opportunity to spread and attack the two bones of the forearm.	0.728059
And if it invades further, then you should incise the arm at the elbow joint.	Similarly, if it attacks the forearm, cut it off at the elbow through the joint itself.	0.5972058
And if the corruption passes beyond and you see it around the elbow, then the patient’s death is imminent; administering another cure is only a matter of grace.	If the disease passes onward and you perceive that it has reached the region of the shoulder, by no means cut the shoulder, for that will be the death of the patient; use any treatment but that, as best you may.	0.6246972
Similarly, for the foot, when corruption invades the toe, you should incise it up to one of the joints.	In the same manner act in regard to the foot when the disease attacks a toe; namely, amputate the toe through one of the interphalangeal joints.	0.695663
And if it reaches the instep of the foot, then you should incise the entire foot. But if it rises to the knee, then you should incise the leg up to the knee joint.	If the disease attacks the tarsus then amputate the whole foot; and if it ascends toward the knee, amputate the leg at the knee-joint.	0.76443744
And if the corruption has already reached the knee, then there is no skill left but resignation, and to leave the patient to death.	If it be that the disease has passed on above the knee, there is nothing of any avail in this case but to leave it, and for the patient to resign himself to death.	0.72570705
And the way to incise the limb or to saw it is that you tighten the bandage on the part below where you want to incise, and tighten another bandage above the location; and the assistant should extend a bandage to the lower parts, and another assistant should extend a bandage upwards; and you separate the flesh that is between the two bandages in a broad space until all the flesh is exposed; and then incise or saw it.	Now the way to amputate or saw off a limb is to bind a ligature round below the site and another above; an assistant draws the one downward and another assistant draws the upper ligature upward; while you dissect away the tissues between the two ligatures with a broad scalpel until it is laid bare of flesh; then it should be cut or sawn.	0.86233455
And it is necessary to place linen cloth all around so that it does not touch the healthy part, and that the patient receives a proper bandage and careful dressing.	You must place linen dressings on every side lest the saw touch a part that is sound and thus cause the patient additional pain and inflammation.	0.64459455
But if bleeding occurs while you are working, then you should quickly cauterize the location, or place some powders to staunch the blood; and then return to your treatment until it is complete.	If a haemorrhage occurs while you are operating, cauterize the place as quickly as possible, or apply to it one or other of the styptic powders; then continue until finished.	0.75340676
And then tie the wounded limb with a bandage at a suitable place, and treat it until it is healed.	Then bind up the mutilated limb with a suitable bandage and dress until healed.	0.85604185
And I will recount to you what happened to a man with his foot, this very same incident which I have recounted to you, which is that blackness occurred on his foot with a burning that seemed like a fire burn.	Now I shall relate to you an example; what I am going to tell you is exactly what happened to a certain man's foot. He had a blackening of the foot, with a burning like that of fire.	0.8730719
And that corruption first occurred on his toe until it spread to his whole foot.	The disease, to begin with, was in one toe, but it went on to involve the whole foot.	0.57718784
And then that man prepared himself, seeing that the treatment was progressing to the limb with the severity of what he found of pain and burning, and he incised that foot up to the joint, and he was healed.	When the man saw the disease spreading in the limb and felt the violent pain and burning, he hastened of his own accord to amputate it at the joint, and he got better.	0.77199835
A long time later, the same corruption occurred on the finger of his hand.	After a long time had passed the very same kind of disease arose in the forefinger of his hand.	0.7947052
And then he came to me, and I was compelled to counteract that superfluity with what I placed on his hand of medicines, after cleaning his body; and the superfluity was not counteracted and began to spread to the other finger until it started on the hand.	He came to me, and I attempted to suppress the superfluity with remedies that I applied to the hand, after purging his body; but the superfluity was not to be suppressed and began to spread to the second finger, and eventually the whole hand was involved in the disease.	0.859951
And he asked me to incise his hand, and I did not want to do it, hoping for the counteraction of that superfluity, and more because I feared the death of the patient from the incision of his hand, as his strength was severely diminished.	He urged me to cut off his hand, but I did not wish to do this, hoping I should be able to overcome the superfluity, and also fearing he would die at the amputation of his hand, for the man's strength was on the decline.	0.8189416
And after he despaired of me, he returned to his land and it came to me that that man prepared and incised his whole hand, and he was healed.	When he despaired of me he went back to his own country, and I then heard that he had gone and cut off his whole hand, and got well.	0.783563
And I have included this story only to help with understanding this disease, and to be an example for which it may be recognized and according to which one should act.	I narrate this story as help against this kind of malady when it occurs; and as guidance for you to take and act upon.	0.6903414
On the treatment of sinuses and the quality of irrigation with medicines.	On the treatment of sinuses and the way to irrigate them.	0.7506699
When an abscess occurs in some fleshy members and the space of the abscess is prolonged until it collects pus, and then it is ruptured and perforated, and the pus is released from it, and the place remains empty almost as if it were a vessel, and the membrane over it is like a fine cloth, and it has not progressed to deep corruption, and it does not impinge upon the bone or nerve or ligament, it is called a sinus, and it is not named a fistula.	When an abscess occurs in any of the fleshy parts and becomes chronic and eventually collects pus, and then it breaks open or is perforated, and all the contained matter comes out and the site is left hollow, like a vessel, and the overlying skin thinned like a rag, but the suppuration has not gone so far as to involve bone or tendon or ligament—and hence it merits the name of 'sinus' and is not called a fistula.	0.8895503
But if the space is prolonged until the corruption presses on some member, then it is called a fistula and not a sinus.	But if it goes on until the disease involves any of these parts it is then called a fistula or defluxion.	0.59971625
And the treatment for it is to incise that entire membrane as it is twisted, and especially when it is thin and is like cloth, and make sure that it does not adhere to the place due to its corruption.	The treatment of it will be to cut away all that skin with a circular incision; specially if it be thinned and has become like a rag, and you are sure that it will not adhere to the place, because of its corruption.	0.79800487
But if you expect the membrane to adhere and that the corruption has not yet achieved deep progression, and the membrane has a clear space, then you treat it with irrigation.	But if you are in hope of its adhering, and the corruption has not reached that point, and there is in the skin some thickness of flesh, then treat it by irrigation.	0.71997416
And this is what you do: consider the sinus, and if it is large and the discharge is of a fetid odor, then irrigate it with an Egyptian medicine made of oil and sour wine and ginger in equal parts, and place them in a vessel, and cook them over the fire until the medicine turns red and takes on the consistency of honey.	The procedure is that you examine the sinus, and if it be large and the purulent discharge from it smell bad, then irrigate it with Egyptian medicine, which is vinegar, oil, honey and verdigris, equal parts of each, mixed in a vessel and heated on the fire until the compound thickens and assumes the consistency of honey.	0.7435397
Then you take from it what is necessary and dissolve it with water and honey; and irrigate the sinus with it, and tighten the opening of it, and leave the medicine in it for about two hours.	Then take as much as you need and dilute it with water and honey, and with this irrigate the sinus and bind up the opening, leaving the compound inside for two hours.	0.8796979
Then expel it with pressure; and do this for several days until the sinus is cleansed and the odor is gone.	Then get it out by pressure. Do this for several days until the sinus is clean and the smell disappears.	0.9495843
Sometimes, the sinus is irrigated with ash water when this medicine is not available; you take vine ash and put it in water; then strain it and irrigate the sinus with it until you are sure that the sinus is cleared.	It may be irrigated with water of ashes if the medicine is not at hand. For that, you take ashes of vine or of oak, and put water upon them; then clarify the liquor and with it irrigate the sinus until you are sure it is thoroughly clean.	0.79676104
If the patient cannot tolerate the Egyptian medicine or the ash water, then irrigate with water and honey mixed with crushed ginger, and irrigate with wine and honey mixed, because the property of honey is to cleanse and wash, and the wine makes the sinus adhere, especially when the wine has an excess of astringency and dryness.	But if the patient cannot tolerate the Egyptian medicine nor the water of ashes, then irrigate him with water and honey with which a little pounded verdigris has been mixed; or irrigate with honey and wine mingled; the value of the honey lies in its cleansing and washing, while the wine closes up the sinus, specially if it be a wine which has some dryness and astringency.	0.8774251
And when you do this several times and you are sure that the sinus is gone, then irrigate it with something that makes flesh grow in it.	When you have done this several times and you are sure that the sinus is clean of diseased matter, then irrigate it with those compounds that will encourage granulation in it.	0.7930671
And this is done by taking some dyafinicon ointment and dissolving it with rose oil and astringent wine; or you irrigate it with some medicines and other ointments that have the properties which I have already written in the treatise on ointments.	For example, you may take a little Palm ointment and dissolve it in oil of roses and some astringent wine; or irrigate it with some of the other ointments and medicines whose prescriptions we have recorded in the treatise on ointments.	0.7846477
And if the opening of the sinus is narrow so that the irrigation cannula cannot enter, then you gradually widen it with an iron instrument, and place a reed wrapped in Egyptian ointment or basilicon ointment until it is widened.	If the opening of the sinus be too narrow for the nozzle of the syringe, open it up slightly with the knife, or put in it a pad steeped in Egyptian ointment or vermilion ointment, until it is dilated.	0.72978324
Similarly, if the opening is wide, then you sew the edges together and leave a small amount of space for the irrigation cannula without addition.	On the other hand, if the opening be wide, bring the edges together with a suture, and leave of it sufficient width that the syringe may be only just introduced.	0.66367304
And if the opening from which the discharge flows is elevated above, then drain it from the lowest point that is in it so that the discharge flows downwards, because when the discharge is confined in the depth of the sinus, flesh will not grow in it.	In the same way, if the opening from which the discharge flows be raised up, then incise it at its lowest part so that the discharge may flow downward out of it; for when the discharge collects at the bottom of the sinus it prevents the formation of flesh in it.	0.86013687
And if it is not possible for you to drain the sinus from the lower edge of the bone as you wish, then you must prepare the member with a preparation through which the discharge flows lightly as is prepared by you, and that no cause of the discharge is retained in it.	If you cannot open it up as you wish at the lower point, then try to set the part in whatever position you conveniently can to facilitate the discharge of pus, and try to ensure that no pus is held up in it.	0.5948422
But the one that is over the opening of the sinus, you remove at all times so that it can expel what is lodged in it from the discharge. And so you know if what flows from it from the discharge is much or little, or is digested, or is undigested.	But the dressing over the sinus opening you may constantly remove, so that the pus collected behind it may come out and so that you may know whether there be much or little ichor, and whether digested or not.	0.854769
And also you consider the location of that sinus, if the patient feels pain in it or not, and if there is an abscess in it.	And at the same time investigate the site of the sinus itself to see whether the patient feels any pain in it or no pain, and whether there be any swelling in it or not.	0.81899285
And when your treatment is prolonged in such a manner, and you see the matter that is thrown on the opening of the sinus already adhering, or is starting to adhere, then in the morning you untie it or on the third day, and when you untie the wound, then change the cloth for another and renew the ointment.	Then when your treatment has reached such a point that you see that there is only a little superficial matter coming out round the mouth of the sinus, you may know that the sinus has closed up or is near to closing up. Then you may unbandage it the next day or the third day, and when the wound is unbandaged make a change of dressing and ointment.	0.7730385
But if from the sinus after a long time a subtle discharge still comes out, then do not despair of its adherence, because the healing of it is approaching, for there are some people in whom the generation of flesh in their wounds is slow, and in those, the opposite is true.	But if, after a long while, the sinus discharges a thin ichor, do not despair of its closing up, for its healing is near. For there are some men whose wounds are slow in healing, and some are the opposite.	0.8328606
And if from the sinus for many days undigested discharge has come out, then know that the sinus does not adhere; and if the adherence of the sinus is delayed and the cause is prolonged, then you add to the drying of the medicines, and if the medicines are moist in their substance and in their virtue, they are dry as dyafinicon ointment, when it is added to it with the excess of wax.	If, after many days, undigested pus is discharged you may know that the sinus has not closed. If the closing of the sinus be delayed and it be a long affair, make the medicines dryer; let them be medicines that have some humidity in their substance but dryness in their potency, such as Palm ointment with the addition of excess of rock-alum.	0.7823499
And the last thing with which it is treated is that you take dyafinicon ointment and dissolve it in rose oil, and pour over it aged wine equal in its substance, and mix it with it, and use that.	A most efficacious treatment is to take Palm ointment and dissolve it in oil of roses and sprinkle over it old wine of even consistency. Then knead together, and use that.	0.74925464
And do similarly in that action, when there is no discharge, dyafinicon ointment, honey cooked until it thickens, and use that; or take myrrh and aloes and incense, crush all and powder it over the honey when it is on the fire, and then spread that on a cloth and press it over the sinus; and spread that with the honey you have cooked until it thickens, and powder it over the cloth and press it.	Then knead together, and use that. The same sort of thing may be done with honey if you have no Palm ointment at hand; if you heat the honey to a thick consistency and use that; or take myrrh and aloes and incense of juniper and beat them all up together and sprinkle on the honey while it is heating on the fire, spread on lint and bind over the sinus; or spread on it honey heated to a thickness, and over that sprinkle powdered aromatic roots, and over these place a dressing that you bandage on.	0.8687037
And sometimes it is treated with long aristolochia and roots of heavenly lily (that is, heavenly lily) and flour of iris and centaury, and use these simply or mixed, crush them and sift and powder them over the honey which I have mentioned; and use that.	Sometimes also in a case of this sort long birthwort and the root of the blue iris and vetch flour and centaury are usable, either separately or mixed, beaten up together, sifted and scattered into honey as I described; use them thus.	0.78161347
And if the sinus is prolonged and not healed by this treatment, then know that the corruption is in its depth, and already seek it in the bones or other hard members or ligaments; then treat it with fistular treatment, as mentioned above.	But if the sinus be chronic, and it does not heal with this treatment, then you may know that there is corruption at the bottom of it, which has affected the bones or motor nerves or ligaments; the treatment then is that of fistula as already given.	0.8052291
On the treatment of panarici and damaged nails, and the incision of extra fingers and their removal.	On the treatment of paronychia and broken nails; and on the amputation of a superfluous finger; and the separation of webbed fingers.	0.78255785
A panarici is an abscess that forms under the nail of the thumb or toe and quickly appears on other fingers. When it persists and its treatment is neglected, or when it is caused by a hot abscess or becomes corrupted, it discharges pus that corrodes the root of the nail, quickly destroying the entire nail, often reaching the bone and causing a foul odor. This makes the end of the finger swollen, and the color turns dark.	Paronychia is a growth of flesh under the nail of the thumb or big toe; it may also occur in the other fingers and toes. When it is chronic and the treatment of it is neglected, it comes up as an abscess, or corrupts and generates pus until it eats away the root of the nail. Often it rots it entirely, and often the disease reaches the bone and gives rise to foetor and broadens the tip of the finger and makes it livid in colour.	0.83733356
So, when you have treated it with the method we described earlier and it does not respond to the treatment, you must then cut away all the remaining nail with an iron instrument and then cauterize the wound thoroughly because cauterization is very beneficial in such cases.	When you have treated it with those means mentioned in their place, and your treatment is ineffective, you must excise all the superfluous growth from the nail and then cauterize the wound, for in this case cauterization is a great help.	0.76485014
But if the bone is healthy and the nail is intact, and the edges of the nail press into the surrounding flesh causing pain and injury, you must place a thin wedge under the edge of the nail that presses on the flesh, push it up, and easily cut that flesh. Apply corrosive burning medicines to the remaining flesh until it is all removed, then treat it with ointments until it is healed.	But if the bone be healthy and the nail also healthy, and the in-turned angle of the nail has pressed the flesh inwards and begun to stab it and injure it, you should pass a thin probe beneath the corner of the nail that presses into the flesh, and raise it up and carefully cut away that flesh and apply caustic to the remainder, until it is all gone; then dress with ointments until cured.	0.8731907
But if the corruption has already reached the bone, you must cut and remove the affected bone, for it will never heal as long as the bone remains corrupted.	But if it should be that the disease has already begun to involve bone, that bone should be excised and removed; for it will never heal while there remains any diseased bone.	0.8394663
And if you see the corruption and decay spreading in the finger, you must cut it at one of the joints as previously indicated and then treat it until it is healed.	And if you see the corrosion and corruption spreading in the finger, amputate it at one of the joints, as has been previously mentioned; then dress it until it is healed.	0.8830968
But if the nail is injured by a blow or friction and causes severe pain, you must initially bleed the patient, then cut the nail with a sharp blade in a transverse section from top to bottom. Be careful not to cut into the flesh beneath the nail, as this will cause the patient intense pain and will lead to the growth of excess flesh in the area. Then treat the area with something that relieves pain.	If a laceration or bruising happen to the nail, with violent pain, you should first bleed the patient and then cut away the nail with a sharp scalpel, a swerving cut from top to bottom. But be careful not to cut into the nail-bed, for you will give the patient violent pain and it will cause a growth of superfluous flesh at the place. Then dress the part with sedative dressings.	0.9131941
An extra finger, which some people are born with on their hands, is often entirely fleshy, sometimes contains bones, or is sometimes found on the nail.	A superfluous finger growing on the hands of some men sometimes is all flesh, sometimes contains a bone, sometimes has a nail.	0.8287584
Some of these are born at the root of the joint, or they may originate from some joints of the fingers. But those that are born on the finger joints are usually not harmful, while those on the joints are more troublesome.	Some of them arise at the root of a finger, or on one of the phalanges of a finger, and the latter do not move, while those that arise from the root of a finger do sometimes move.	0.7137502
For those that are purely fleshy, the removal is easy: you simply cut it at its root with a broad blade.	That which is purely fleshy is easily removed; you cut if off at the root with a broad scalpel.	0.7732473
But for those that originate from the root of the joint, the treatment is difficult; therefore, be cautious in removing them.	But the treatment of that which arises at the root of a finger is difficult; you should avoid amputating.	0.80011964
For those born on the finger near the joints, you must first cut the flesh with a circular incision down to the bone, then saw through the bone with a suitable saw, and then treat it until it heals.	In the case of one growing from the finger at a phalangeal joint, you should first cut through the flesh down to the bone with a circular incision; then saw the bone through, with one of the saws that suit the purpose; then dress it until it heals.	0.7985019
But the fusion that occurs between the fingers sometimes by birth, by healing of a wound, by burning, or similar causes, you must cut through that fusion until the fingers return to their natural form.	As for webbing of the fingers one to another, that occurs very frequently. It may be either congenital or from the healing of a wound or burn or the like.	0.6534574
Then place linen cloth soaked in rose oil between them so they do not easily re-fuse, and keep them separated, or place a thin lead sheet between them until they heal properly.	You have to cut the web away until the fingers are brought back to their original form; then interpose between them a pad or piece of material soaked in oil of roses, to prevent them from rapidly joining together and to keep them apart; or you can put between them a thin sheet of lead until the healing takes place as it should.	0.74224836
Similarly, if fusion occurs between some fingers and the palm, cut through the fusion according to the shape and configuration of the member.	Similarly, if one of the fingers becomes joined to the palm of the hand, cut through the adhesion according to the form it takes, and with proper regard for the shape of the member.	0.74748904
On the incision of varices, which are varicose veins.	On cutting for varices.	0.63319653
Varices, also known as varicose veins, are large, twisted veins filled with melancholic superfluities. They often appear in many parts of the body, but are most common in the legs, especially in people who travel, labor, or carry heavy loads.	Varices are thick twisted veins filled with melancholic superfluities. They occur in most parts of the body, but generally in the legs, particularly in the legs of couriers and ploughmen and porters.	0.8020731
Thus, it is necessary to purge the body of black bile occasionally with strong expulsion, and then bleed the patient from the basilic vein.	First you must purge the body free from black bile, several times, strongly. Then venesect the patient in the basilic vein.	0.8102851
However, their treatment with iron is done in two ways: one involves making an incision and drawing out the black blood, and the other involves lifting and removing the entire vein.	The treatment with the knife is of two kinds: one is to incise and bring out all the black blood, the other is to draw out the vein and extract it bodily.	0.8627188
The incision is done in this manner: first, soak the leg with hot water until the thick blood, which is thickened in the leg, is dissolved. Then, tightly bind the leg of the patient from the upper part of the thigh down to below the knee with a bandage. Next, make an incision in the vein at one or two or three places with a broad cut, and draw out the black blood with your hand from the lower part of the leg upward and from the top downward, until the desired amount of blood is extracted and you see that it is enough to relieve the patient.	The incision is done thus: the leg is first well fomented with hot water to liquefy the thick foul blood; then bind up the patient's leg well from the upper part of his thigh to below the knee; then make an ample incision into the vein in one, two, or three places. Then with your hand press the black blood upward from the lower part and downward from the upper part of the leg and draw off as much blood as you see suffices or as the patient's strength can bear.	0.93632174
Then, bandage the area and instruct the patient to abstain from foods that generate black bile.	Then bind up, and bid him abstain from foods that give rise to black bile.	0.73530453
Repeat the treatment by phlebotomy whenever the veins are filled and it troubles the patient.	The evacuation and venesection should be repeated whenever the veins fill up again to the patient's hurt.	0.65042233
But lifting the veins is done in this way: shave the patient's leg if it has many hairs, then put it in a bath and soak the leg with hot water until it turns red and the veins become prominent. Alternatively, have the patient perform vigorous exercise if a bath is not available, until the limb is heated.	Extraction is carried out in this way: the patient's leg is shaved if it is very hairy; then bring him to the bath and foment the leg in hot water until it becomes red and the veins are filled. Or if there be no bath available let him take violent exercise until the limb gets hot.	0.87900436
Then, make an incision in the skin over the vein with a long cut either behind the knee or lower down near the heel.	Then make a longitudinal incision in the skin over the vein, either at the upper end of it near the knee or at the lower end near the ankle.	0.9298963
Next, open the skin with hooks and strip the vein from all sides until it is fully visible, and you see it turning dark red to black.	Then with hooks open up the skin and dissect away round the vein on each side until it is laid open to view.	0.7489224
Then, when you see it and the surrounding tissue looks white like a cord.	When it is visible you will see it red almost to the point of blackness; and when it is freed from the skin you will see it look like a cord.	0.5227917
Next, insert a rod under it to lift it and detach it from the surrounding tissue, then suspend it with a hook.	Then pass beneath it a probe to lift it up, and when it is clear of the skin hold it with a blunt smooth hook.	0.64129865
Then make another incision about three fingers' width from the first, and strip the skin from the upper part of the vein until it is exposed.	Then make another incision near by, three fingers distant; then dissect away the overlying skin until it comes to view; then raise it with a probe as before and lift it with a second hook as you did at first.	0.78114873
Next, lift the vein and cut it at the lower incision near the heel, then extract and lift it until it comes out through the second incision, and continue extracting it from the upper incisions.	Then make yet another incision or several if need be; then draw out the vessel at the lowest incision near the ankle and cut it through. Then pull it and draw it out until it emerges from the second incision.	0.7741405
Continue this process until you have extracted it from the highest incision, until the entire vein is removed, and then cut it.	Then draw it towards the incision above that and so on until you draw it out of the third incision (or) the uppermost, until it is all extracted; then cut it off.	0.65114075
If you have difficulty extracting and lifting it, insert a needle with strong double thread and tie it off, then extract it, or insert the rod underneath and twist your hand around it until it is removed. Be careful not to cut it; if it breaks, it will be very difficult to lift and will cause harm to the patient.	But if it does not respond to your attempts to draw and extract it, pass in a needle with a strong double thread and ligate it and draw it up; and introduce a probe beneath it, and twist it all round until it comes out; but be careful lest it break; for if it break the total extraction of it will be very difficult for you and harm will thereby come to the patient.	0.8255334
Once you have removed it completely, place a cloth soaked in wine, rose oil, and regular oil over the wound and treat it until it heals.	When you have got it all out, apply to the incisions wool soaked in wine and oil of roses, or olive-oil, and dress it till it be healed.	0.81056
If the vein is contracted and twisted, and has loops at parts, and is not straight as described, you must make incisions over each twisted part and at the loops, then suspend it with hooks until you can lift it entirely.	If the varix be contorted, with twists and turns from side to side and not in a straight line, as we said, then you should cut down along both sides of the twisted part and the places where it is tortuous, then catch it up with hooks and extract it whole.	0.7830949
Be careful during the incisions not to cut or injure the vein, as it will be difficult to lift; use your skill and prudence.	Be careful in incising over it that you do not cut into or injure the vein, for this will render the extraction difficult; therefore be most careful.	0.81205964
Shape of the tool used for vein sectioning:	The lancet for cutting upon a varix.	0.44321358
It is not sharpened like a hook, nor does it have a pointed end so that it does not harm the vein; and it has a thick, flexible body, because if it were thin, it would cut the vein due to its thinness; rather, it has an excessive thickness as we have said.	It is not bent like other hooks, and its extremity must be blunt so as to not injure the vein. It should be of a broad curve and smooth, for if it is fine-pointed its fineness may cut the vein; rather it should be quite thick, as we said.	0.84082776
On the extraction of a vein from the leg.	On the extraction of the Medina vein.	0.66821283
This vein is found in the legs in hot regions such as Ategi in the land of the Arabs and in the hot and dry lands of India, where little soft tissue exists and no grass or trees grow.	This kind of vein occurs in the leg in hot countries such as the Hejaz and the lands of the Arabs and in hot arid infertile countries.	0.7378899
It is also easily found in other parts of the body besides the legs.	It also often occurs in other parts of the body beside the legs.	0.8043719
Its formation is due to putrefaction under the skin, just as snakes, worms, and scarabs form within the body between the skin and the flesh.	The origin of it is a corruption taking place beneath the skin in the same way that round-worms and worms and gourd-worms arise in the inward parts of the body; also the worms that are generated between the skin and the flesh.	0.74081635
A sign of its presence is a severe inflammation in the leg, followed by blistering at the site, and then the vein begins to emerge from the blistered area like a root from a plant.	The sign of the beginning of the occurrence of this vein is a violent inflammation in the leg; then the place swells up and blisters; then the vein begins to extrude at the blistered place as if it were a plant-stem or an animal.	0.8095391
When the tip appears, wrap a piece of lead weighing one or two drachms around it, and let the lead hang from the leg.	When its extremity has appeared it should be wound and tied round a little piece of lead, from one to two drachms in weight, which you leave hanging from the leg.	0.8053845
Each time a part emerges, wrap it with lead and tie it off. If it is very long, make an incision in part of it and wrap the rest. Do not cut it close to the root until it is fully out, as cutting it too early will cause it to retract into the flesh, leading to abscess, rot, and a bad ulcer.	Then as fast as any of it issues from the leg, wrap it in the lead, and if there be plenty of it cut off part and tie the rest of it; do not cut it right down until it has all come out; for if you cut it right down it will contract and draw back into the flesh and produce at the place an abscess and suppuration and a bad ulcer.	0.808499
Thus, it should be treated gently and extracted little by little until it is completely out, leaving nothing behind in the body.	Therefore it should be treated gently, and drawn out slowly until the very extremity of it emerges and not the least bit of it remains in the body.	0.8629624
In some men, this vein has reached a length of five, ten, or even twenty palms.	In some cases the vein comes out five or ten spans in length; indeed I have heard of one twenty spans long that came out from a certain man.	0.7205634
If it is incised during treatment, insert the rod into the wound and puncture it along the length of the body until all the material is evacuated. Treat the area for a few days with medicines that counter putrefaction, then heal it as you would an abscess.	If it breaks during your treatment of it, then pass a probe into the hole and open it up with a long incision longitudinally, until all the contained matter is evacuated; and try to make the place suppurate with medicines for a few days, then treat as an abscess.	0.8486978
Sometimes this vein has many branches, especially when it appears at the joint of the foot or in the foot itself, where it emerges through many openings, with each opening giving rise to a branch.	Sometimes also this vein is found branching, especially when it appears at the joint of the foot or on the foot itself; and in this case there are many openings and a branch comes out of each.	0.9013938
Treat it as described above, following the steps mentioned.	The treatment is as mentioned above in the section.	0.644995
On the cutting over worms generated under the skin, known as bovine disease.	On incision for the worm arising beneath the skin, called 'the cattle disease'.	0.8420918
This disease is called the "bovine disease" in some lands because it often affects cattle. It is a small worm that grows between the skin and the flesh, traveling throughout the body, moving up and down, and can be felt as it moves from limb to limb until it breaks through the skin and comes out.	This complaint is called by us in some regions 'the cattle disease' since it frequently happens to cattle. It is in fact a small solitary worm generated between the skin and the flesh, that creeps all over the body, both up and down; it can be felt as it creeps from one part to another until it breaks out at a place where it can break through the skin, and out it comes.	0.83006
Its generation is due to the putrefaction of certain humors, just like worms, serpents, and roundworms in the intestines.	It arises from the putrefaction of certain humours as do worms, round-worms and gourd-worms in the abdomen.	0.8371743
It is feared for its malignancy, as when it travels through the body and reaches the head, it can quickly penetrate the eye and destroy it, which happens frequently.	Part of the harm that may be expected of it is that when it creeps about the body and goes up to the head and reaches the eye it may make an opening in the eye and come out and destroy the eye; this frequently happens.	0.7058102
Therefore, when you want to treat and remove it, it can only be done by tracking its movement and feeling it. Then, tightly bind the area above and below it, make an incision over it, and extract it.	If you wish to treat this and extract it, it must be done while it is creeping about and can be felt. You must tie a tight tourniquet above and below it, then cut down upon it and extract it.	0.77554774
If it is deep in the flesh and you cannot find it, use a cautery iron to burn the area until it dies. The main concern is its corruption, which can damage the area as mentioned.	But if it burrows into the tissues and you cannot locate it, then apply the actual cautery to the place until you have burnt the worm. The greatest damage to be feared from it is damage to the eye, as we have said.	0.7310339
If it reaches the head near the eye, bind the area above the eyebrow tightly, make an incision over it, and extract it. The patient should then cleanse their body with medicines that expel putrid humors and avoid foods that cause putrefaction.	So if you see that it has entered the head and is near the eye, then bind a strong bandage over the forehead beneath it, then cut down upon it and draw it out. It is important also for the patient to take care to cleanse his body with laxative medicines from all corrupt and evil humours. He should also avoid all foods giving rise to putrefaction.	0.7978848
Regarding the section on the illness called nafir.	CHAPTER NINETY-THREE. On incision for the disease known as 'flitting disease'.	0.61989045
This illness is called nafir in our land, and it is a pain that comes to some limbs, and is often transferred from limb to limb.	The disease known in our region as 'the flitting disease' is a pain arising in a limb and then passing from limb to limb.	0.6929482
And I have seen that according to what I will tell you. I was called to a sick woman in a village, and I uncovered her arm and saw a small swelling in the vein of the arm, and after an hour, I saw that swelling move as if a worm was climbing up, but more lightly than could be, as if it were quicksilver running from place to place.	I have personally seen it as I shall describe to you: I was called to a woman patient in a country district, who uncovered her arm and showed me a small inflation of the cephalic vein. After I had waited a while I saw the swelling creep like a worm along the forearm, ascending towards her shoulder, with the greatest possible speed, as of quicksilver running from place to place.	0.864113
And then the pain moved from that place and settled in the muscle, and stayed there for about an hour.	Then the pain left that place and settled in the elbow.	0.6894819
And then it ran through the body until it reached the other arm.	Then I waited a while and the pain ran through the whole body until it reached the other arm.	0.7250352
And then she recounted to me that it revolved throughout her entire body as I saw; and I was very amazed by the movement and the speed from limb to limb. And I had already seen this before with my own eyes in that manner, but I have seen many cases where the pain was transferred from limb to limb. But I did not see this with my eyes as I did in the woman.	Then she related to me that it used to pass all round her body as I had seen it. I was amazed at the speed with which it migrated from one part to another, as I had never before seen this disease in this form, though I had seen many who had a pain that passed from limb to limb; but never with my own eyes had I seen anything like what I saw in this woman.	0.91161025
And I do not think this is anything but because the woman was old, with a dry body and exposed veins, and in this way, that moving swelling appeared to the senses.	The only opinion I could form of it was that it was due to the woman's being of the dwellers in the wilds, dry of body, with outstanding veins, and hence that moving vapour was perceptible.	0.68412024
And it is necessary that this does not appear according to this back-and-forth movement in those who are healthy and have moist bodies with hidden veins.	But it follows then that it does not appear in that manner in people leading a leisured life, with humid bodies and hidden veins.	0.67739147
And when you want the cure for this, and the patient feels that pain, then it is not apparent to you by sight as we have said, then you press on it and gently shake it until that trapped swelling comes out, and cauterize the spot.	When you want to cure this, and the patient feels the pain of it, and if you observe the appearance we have described, then tie a bandage round above and beneath it as quickly as possible and cut down on it so that the vapour enclosed there may come out; and cauterize the place.	0.7736614
But if you do not see it with your eyes, then you cure it with exercise of the body and with things that expel swellings, and treat them with foul-smelling pills and with serapic pills and the like.	But if there is nothing visible to you then treat by purging of the body and by medicines dispelling and getting rid of flatus, such as foetid pills and pills of sagapenon and the like.	0.7268796
Regarding the extraction of arrows.	On the extraction of arrows.	0.9037108
Arrows are varied according to their types, and according to the places in the bodies where they strike, because their diversity is such that some have large points, and small, and concave, and blunt, which means solid; and among them are those with three edges, and those with barbs; and those with splinters.	Arrows vary both as to types and as to the different parts of the body pierced by them. They differ thus as to type: some are big and some are small; some with hollow heads and some with solid; some of them have three angles and some four; some have tongues; some have spikes.	0.88120645
And the signs of the brain are when the arrow strikes there, and it pierces the bone, and it comes out from the covering that is over the brain, because it happens with sudden vehemence, and dizziness, and vertigo, and redness in the eyes, and inflammation and redness of the tongue, and spasm and confusion of understanding and vomiting of bile, and very soon speech is cut off and the voice is destroyed, and from the place of the wound comes out white moisture resembling dust, and something comes out that looks like the moisture of the flesh.	Now the signs when the arrow has struck the brain, and penetrated the bone and injured the meninges covering the brain, are these: there arise from that a violent headache and vertigo and giddiness and a redness in the eye, and a redness of the tongue, and convulsion and mental confusion and bilious vomit; perhaps also blood comes out of the nose or from the ears; often also the speech is affected and the voice is lost; also there comes out of the site of the wound a white fluid which resembles gruel, from which there flows something like the juice of meat.	0.85555816
And so if these signs appear to you, then you refrain from the treatment and the extraction of the arrow, unless it is outside.	If you observe these signs, avoid treating the patient and extraction of the arrow if it has not come out.	0.77679473
But the signs of the arrow when it strikes the heart are that it is near the left nipple, and it feels as if it is stuck in a hard place, and not an empty place; and very soon the movement of the arrow is like the movement of the pulse, and from the wound flows black blood, and follows coldness of the extremities, and cold sweat, and fainting; and then you know that death descends without any doubt.	The signs of an arrow in the heart are: nearness to the left breast; the patient feels it as if it were fixed in something solid, not hollow; often also there will be imparted to the arrow a pulsating movement; and black blood will issue from the wound; and after this follow coldness of the extremities and a cold sweat and unconsciousness; then you may know that death is surely on its way.	0.86311936
And the signs when the arrow has wounded the lung are the spitting of foamy blood from the wound, and the vessels near the neck are swollen, and the color of the patient is changed, and they exhale with a great noise, and demand the attraction of cold air.	The sign of an arrow that has wounded the lung is the exit of frothy blood from the wound; also the vessels that lie along the neck swell up and the patient changes colour, breathes heavily, and seeks to inhale fresh air very strongly.	0.83570373
And if the arrow strikes the covering that is in the chest, and the pain then is near the lower ribs, and a great swelling is made with vehement pain and sighing, and not all the muscle members are harmed.	But if the arrow strike the pleura then it will be close to the small ribs and he will breathe deeply with much pain and heaving of the chest, and all parts of his shoulders will be agitated. If the arrow hits the liver, there ensues violent pain, and blood flows from the wound, resembling the liver in its redness.	0.7915001
And if the arrow strikes the stomach, then very soon from the wound comes out some undigested food.	If the arrow strikes the stomach, often undigested food comes out of the wound and renders the case obvious.	0.72415346
And if the arrow strikes the abdomen, and is stuck there, some contents of the wound come out, or the membrane, or the intestine which is ruptured, and there is no hope in the cure by extracting the arrow.	If the arrow wounds the belly and is fixed in it, and from the wound there comes excrement or omentum or torn bowel, there is no hope in treatment nor in extracting the arrow.	0.82364166
And if the arrow strikes the bladder, and urine comes out, and something passes to the external parts, and very soon there is pain over the patient, then you know it is mortal.	If the arrow has hit the urinary bladder, and urine comes out and some of the bladder protrudes and the patient has violent pain, then you may know that the wound is mortal.	0.82749486
But the other members like the face, the neck, and the throat, and the shoulders and the arm, and the vertebrae of the back, and the collarbone, and the thigh, and the leg, and their similar members, are saved according to the major conditions when the arrow does not find a vein or artery and is not a poisonous arrow.	But as for the other parts, such as the face, eye, throat, shoulder, arm, dorsal vertebrae, collar-bone, hip, leg, and the like, in most cases they will heal if the arrow does not happen to strike an artery or nerve, and if the arrow is not poisoned.	0.8302165
And I will recount this to you what I have seen about these arrows, so that you may know about your treatment.	Now I will relate to you certain cases of arrow wounds that I have seen, so that you may be guided thereby to your own methods of treatment.	0.72364295
Which case is, because in a man, an arrow struck in the tear duct of his eye in the root of the nose, and I extracted it from the other side, under the cartilage of his ear, and he was healed, and no harm occurred to his eye.	For example, once an arrow struck a man at the corner of his eye near the root of the nose, and I extracted it from him on the other side beneath the lobe of his ear, and he got well, and his eye was none the worse.	0.8471179
And I extracted another arrow from a Jew which struck him in the cartilage of his eye, under the lower eyelid, and the arrow was already hidden and only a small tip with which it was attached to the shaft was obtained, and it was a large arrow from the sharp arrows of the Turks, with iron tip that did not have barbs.	Also I extracted from a Jew another arrow that had pierced the orbit beneath the lower eyelid; the arrow had sunk out of sight and I could take hold only of the tiny extremity of it which is secured to the shaft; but it was a big arrow from a compound bow, the iron tip four-sided, very smooth without barbs.	0.88643956
And the Jew was healed, and no harm occurred to his eye.	The Jew recovered, nor did any ill befall his eye.	0.88823676
And I extracted another arrow from a Christian man which had struck his throat, and it was an Arabic arrow, and it had barbs; and so I cut over it between two guides, and it was already submerged in his throat; and then I delicately worked with it, and soon I extracted it, and the Christian was healed.	I also extracted another arrow from the throat of a Christian. It was an Arab arrow, one of those with two barbs; and I cut down upon it between the two jugulars (for it lay deep in the throat), and worked gently at it until I extracted it; and the Christian was saved and recovered.	0.90740526
And I extracted another arrow from a man which had struck his abdomen, and I thought he would die from it; and then, after thirty days had passed and nothing had changed in his condition, I cut over the arrow and worked on it, and he was healed, and no bad accident happened to him.	I also extracted another arrow from a man, that had struck him in the abdomen, and our opinion was that he would certainly die from it. But when it had remained in him for the space of thirty days or thereabouts, and his condition was unimpaired, I cut down upon the arrow and manoeuvred it out and extracted it; and he recovered, nor did any harm befall him.	0.89755464
And I saw another man in whom an arrow struck his back, and the wound healed over it, and after nearly seven years, the arrow emerged at the root of his thigh.	I also saw a man who had been struck in the back by an arrow and the wound had closed over it; and when the space of seven years had elapsed the arrow came out at the root of the hip.	0.89279616
And I saw a woman in whom an arrow struck her abdomen, and the wound healed inside, and nothing changed in her condition, and the woman found no harm in any of her natural functions.	And I saw a woman who had been struck in the abdomen by an arrow and the wound healed with the arrow remaining in it, and her condition was unimpaired; she felt no harm from it and her natural functions were not harmed.	0.91247255
And I saw another man in whom an arrow struck his face and the wound healed over it and the arrow remained, finding no pain there, and many similar cases to these.	And I saw a man who had been struck by an arrow in the face, and it had healed over, and he did not feel much pain from it. And many such have I seen.	0.8337478
And I extracted an arrow from the man of the prince of the king which had struck the middle part of his nose and had already shifted a little to the right side, and the whole arrow was hidden.	I once drew out an arrow from one of the officers of the State, that had struck him in the middle of the nose and was inclining a little to the right, and the whole arrow was buried.	0.78016675
And I was called to the treatment of him soon after the arrow struck within three days.	I was called to treat him three days after he had received the arrow wound; and I found the arrow wound very narrow.	0.7419625
And then I found the wound from the arrow very narrow; and then I examined it with a fine probe, and I did not feel it; but he felt a prick under his right ear, and then I suspected that the prick was from the tip of the arrow.	I explored it with a fine probe but did not find it; but the patient felt a pricking and a pain beneath the right ear, and I hoped that the pricking was due to the arrow.	0.7920508
And I applied a plaster to the location with an attractive and digestive virtue, trusting that the place would form an abscess so that the location of the arrow would appear to me, and so it could be accessed.	So I applied a poultice to the spot, a poultice with power to draw out and cause suppuration, desiring that the place should swell and that a sign to indicate the arrow should appear so that I could cut down upon it.	0.7236682
And no significant accident occurred at the location indicating that the arrow had reached that place; and I continued with the plaster on it for many days and no accident occurred; and the wound healed meanwhile, and the patient remained without extraction for many days until one day he felt the arrow in his nose and reported it to me.	But nothing happened at that place to indicate that the arrow had come through to there; so I persevered with poulticing it for many days; yet nothing fresh manifested itself and the wound healed up meanwhile, and the patient despaired for a time of its extraction.	0.81847715
And then I applied a sharp corrosive medicine to the wound for many days until it was opened, and with a probe, I examined it, and I found the fine tip of the arrow, which was attached to the shaft.	Then one day he felt the arrow inside his nose, and he told me of this; so for a number of days I applied a caustic medicine to the wound until it opened.	0.6840429
And then I continued applying the medicine to the opening of the wound until the tip of the arrow appeared visibly to me, and I spent time on this for a period of four months.	I explored it, and felt the slim end of the arrow which is fastened to the shaft; then I enlarged the opening of the wound by the use of the caustic until the tip of the arrow was plainly visible to me. About four months passed.	0.7378267
And then, after the wound was enlarged, and it was possible for me to insert the forceps into it and remove it, and if it did not obey extraction, then I did not cease to handle and work on it with various techniques, until one day I started using techniques to grasp it with properly made forceps, according to the form that will come at the end of the chapter, until I extracted it; and then I restored the wound.	Then when the wound was enlarged and I was able to introduce forceps into it I pulled on it and moved it, but it would not come out. And I went on skilfully and gently trying for it with various instruments until one day I caught hold of it with a pair of strong forceps (their shape will be described at the end of the chapter) and drew it out; then dressed the wound.	0.82769084
And some doctors judged that the cartilage of the nose could not be restored, and I restored it and the wound healed, and the patient was completely healed, and it did not harm him in any way.	The medical men judged that the cartilage of the nose would not be restored, but I restored it and the wound healed up and the patient made a complete recovery nor did he suffer any harm.	0.8255906
And I recount to you the quality of the extraction of some arrows so that you set a rule and understanding about what I have not said, because the parts of this art and its definitions are not comprehended with narration nor do they comprehend the book.	Now I shall tell you the method of extracting certain arrows so that you may take it as a guide and an analogy for others that I have not mentioned; since all parts and details of this art cannot be comprehended in any description, nor can any book include them.	0.7647245
And the wise practitioners compare little over much; and from what is present over what is absent; and find new operations and new instruments for the descent of the external causes of the art when it happens.	A skilful worker will form a judgement on much, from little; and on what is not present from what is before him; and he will think out a new method and a new instrument for an unaccustomed case when it occurs in the practice of this art.	0.7533324
And so I say that arrows are not extracted from the limbs where they are stuck except in two ways: either by pulling from the place where they entered; or by the opposite side.	So I would state that arrows come out from the parts of the body they have transfixed, in two ways: either by drawing out from the site of entry; or from the opposite side.	0.8689613
And the one that is extracted from the place where it entered, it is an arrow stuck in a fleshy place, and it is pulled and extracted.	An arrow that comes out by the track of its entry: the arrow may be visible, standing out from a fleshy part, in which case it may be extracted by pulling.	0.54650927
And if it does not obey extraction from the hour it struck, then you must leave it for some days until the flesh around it decays, and the extraction and egress are eased.	If it does not respond to traction immediately it strikes, you must leave it for a few days until the surrounding tissues have suppurated, when the pulling and extraction of it will be made easy.	0.70491743
And similarly, if it is stuck in bone and does not obey extraction, then leave it for some days and repeatedly pull and move it each day, and then it will be extracted.	Similarly if it has stuck fast in a bone and will not come out, leave this also for a few days, repeatedly pulling on it and shifting it day by day, and then it will come out.	0.8760961
And if it does not obey extraction after some days, then you must perforate around the arrow in that bone on all sides with a fine drill until the place around the arrow is enlarged, and then extract it.	But if it will not come out after some days, you will have to drill away the bone from all round with a fine drill so as to make room for the arrow; then draw on it and pull it out.	0.78695834
But if the arrow is already hidden in the body, and hidden from sensation, then you search for it with a probe, and if you feel it, then pull it with some instruments that are suitable for its extraction.	If the arrow is buried in some part of the body and is quite lost to sight, explore for it with a probe, and if you can feel it then draw it out with any suitable instrument.	0.81250536
And if you cannot manage it because of the constriction of the wound and the length of the arrow, and there is no bone or nerve or vein there, then you work on the wound until it is enlarged and it is possible to extract the arrow.	But if you cannot get at it on account of the narrowness of the wound and the depth at which the arrow is, and there be no bone nor nerve nor blood-vessel, then cut round it until the wound be sufficiently wide to enable you to take hold of it and extract it.	0.82265383
And if it has barbs by which it is held, then you release the flesh in which it is stuck on all sides with all the skill you can manage; and work on it, if you cannot manage the evasion of the flesh with the fracture of the barbs and their twisting until it obeys.	And if it have two barbs by which it is held, free them from the adherent flesh all round, in any way you can; or, if you cannot free the tissues, try skilfully to break off the two barbs and twist them about until the arrow comes free.	0.7410155
And when you manage the extraction of the arrow in any place where it is, then you use twisting of your hand with forceps on all sides until it obeys; and work with utmost subtlety so that the arrow is not broken and its extraction is not made difficult for you.	Whenever you try to extract an arrow from any part, employ a twisting motion of your hand with the forceps in all directions until you free it; and use the utmost gentleness not to break the arrow and thus make it hard to draw it out and remove it.	0.8772336
And if you cannot manage it at that time, then you leave it for a few days until the parts around it decay, and then work on it again because then it will be eased. But if you encounter a flow of blood, then you manage it as we have discussed in its chapter.	If you are unable to get it out at once then leave it for some days until the tissues that surround it putrefy, then return to it, for then the extraction will be easy; and if haemorrhage interfere use the remedies prescribed in the chapter dealing with that.	0.8214395
And guard your skill from cutting a vein or nerve, or tendon, and manage it with every technique you can for the evasion of the arrow; and do this with ease and tranquility and slowness and firmness as I have recounted to you.	Exercise the utmost care not to cut a blood-vessel or nerve or tendon; and employ the greatest skill in freeing the arrow; it should be done gently and unhurriedly and with perseverance, as I have told you.	0.8349909
And so you contract the arrow so that the patient is according to the shape according to which it was when the arrow struck him, because it is more helpful. But if this is not possible for you, then you manage with what is possible for you with the shapes.	When extracting an arrow you should place the patient in the same position he was in when the arrow struck him, for that is more convenient; but if you cannot do this then let him be in whatever position is possible for you.	0.7240796
But the arrows that are extracted by the opposite side, or where some part of it already protrudes outward, or the tip of the arrow causes swelling by sensation of the part above the close flesh and sometimes that part is prominent; then you cut over it; and the cutting should be according to the quantity that the forceps can grasp; and then you pull it, because it is made easier to extract.	The arrow that is to be extracted from the opposite side either has some part protruding through or else the tip of the arrow gives rise to a palpable swelling just beneath the skin and you see it sticking out; then cut down upon it; the incision should be wide enough to admit the forceps. Then pull on it, for the extraction of it will be easy.	0.8351583
But if it is held in the bone, then you twist the blade counter to the way until the arrow presses into the bone, and enlarges itself, and then extract it.	If it is stuck in bone, twist it round with your hand until the arrow makes an impression in the bone and opens up a way for itself; then pull it.	0.7381165
And if not, leave it for some days, and then work on it until it comes out.	If it does not come out, let it alone for some days, and repeat until it does come out.	0.8354373
And if the shaft of the arrow is in it, then you push it with it.	If the arrow-shaft be in the wound, then thrust the arrow out with that.	0.75250375
But if the shaft is broken and you want to push, then you insert into it, if it is broken, a concave instrument so that it fits into the concavity of the arrow's tail and then push it with it.	But if the shaft has fallen out, and you wish to employ thrusting, introduce down to it the hollow instrument whose cavity will enter upon the ferrule of the arrow, then push it forward with that.	0.8349205
But if the arrow is concave, then you push it with a strong instrument inserted into it, because the arrow is eased by it.	If the arrow be hollow, thrust it forward with an instrument that will enter into the cavity, for the exit of the arrow will thereby be made easy.	0.6609671
And if the arrow is poisoned, then you must excise all the flesh where the poison is, if this is possible for you, and then treat it with what is appropriate.	If the arrow be poisoned you must, if you can, cut out in a circle all the flesh into which the poison has entered; then treat it with what is appropriate.	0.8656001
And if the arrow falls in the chest, or in the abdomen, or in the bladder, or in the side, and is close enough for you to touch it with the probe, and it is possible for you to cut over it, then cut over it and guard against cutting a vein or nerve, and extract it, and then sew the wound if needed, and treat it until it is healed.	If the arrow that has struck be in the chest or abdomen or in the urinary bladder or in the flank and it be close enough for you to explore it with the probe and you can cut down upon it, then do so, but beware of cutting into a blood-vessel or nerve. Then remove the arrow. Afterwards suture the wound, if suture be necessary, and dress it until it heals.	0.86748356
The form of forceps with which the arrows are extracted:	Forceps for extracting arrows.	0.56255996
Let their ends be like a bird's beak which are made with a saw so that they do not let go of the arrow.	The extremities resemble the bill of a bird and are engraved like a file so as not to lose grip when you close them upon an arrow or some other object.	0.57391644
And many types of these are made, large, small, and medium, according to the size of the arrow and its thinness, and the width of the wound, and its constriction.	They are made in several kinds, large, small, or medium, all according to the bigness or smallness of the arrow and the breadth or narrowness of the wound.	0.80894375
like a ray so that the insertion of it into the concave arrow is eased and it is pushed with it.	The extremity is solid like a probe, to facilitate entry into, and pushing, the hollow arrow.	0.61111283
Of phlebotomy of the veins.	On venesection.	0.42084005
The veins for phlebotomy from which the usual places to perform it are as follows: two pulsating veins near the ears, called alhasisain; two veins in the temples; two veins in the tear ducts of the eyes called aspicientz; a vein in the middle of the forehead; a vein at the tip of the nose; two veins at the neck; two veins in the upper lip; two veins in the lower lip; — these are the veins called algelic —; and two veins under the tongue. But the veins that are phlebotomized in the arms are five: One of these is the cephalic vein, which is on the outer side; and people call it "the head vein," also known as the middle vein, composed of a branch of the basilic vein and another branch of the cephalic vein; people call this "the vein of the whole body," and the basilic vein is on the inner side, known as “citillar,” called by common people "the vein of the belly"; the funis of the arm, located over the elbow, is the one where phlebotomy is performed, appearing over the pulse by clear manifestation; and salvatella, which is the vein between the ring finger and the little finger, located in two branches.	There are sixteen of them in the head, and they are: two pulsating vessels behind the ears that are called the two occipitals; the two external arteries in the temples; and the two veins in the two internal angles of the eyes, called the vessels of sight; and the vein running up the middle of the forehead; and the vein situated at the tip of the nose; and the two jugular veins in the neck; and the two veins in the upper lip and the two in the lower lip; these being the veins known as 'the four vessels'; and two veins beneath the tongue. As for the veins that are bled in the arm and hand, they are five. One is the cephalic, which is on the outer side; popularly they call it the 'headvein'; then there is the 'blue-black', that is, the median vein, which is made up of a branch from the basilic and a branch from the cephalic; popularly they call that the 'body-vein'; then the basilic vein; this is the one situated on the inner side and is termed also the axillary vein, but popularly it is called the 'belly-vein'; and then the cord of the arm; this is situated over the radius and is the one that is contiguous to it; this is the one that is clearly visible on the thumb. And the salvatella which is the vein between the little and ring fingers; it has two branches.	0.92303455
In the foot and leg, there are three veins; one is under the curve of the knee on the outer side; the second is the saphenous vein, located under the leg on the inner side; and the sciatic vein, located under the leg on the outer side; in the leg, there are other veins similar to these.	There are also three veins in the leg and foot; one of these is the sciatic vein on the outer aspect; the second is the saphena situated near the heel on the inner aspect; and there is the external saphena situated near the heel on the outer aspect. And there are three veins, counterparts to these, in the other leg.	0.9541056
The benefit of the veins near the ears is for old catarrhs and migraines and scurf and old head ulcers.	Venesection of the two veins behind the ears. Bleeding from both of these will give relief in cases of chronic catarrh, migraine and chronic foul pustules, and scabs of the head.	0.61281943
The method of bleeding these veins is as I tell you: shave the head of the patient, and rub the back of the patient's head where both veins are with a large cloth with good friction; then tighten the patient's neck with a band until the two veins and their places appear near the ears at two pressed places on the head; and find them with your finger, and if you feel their pulse with your finger, mark the spot with a probe.	The method of venesecting these two is as I shall now describe: the patient's head should be shaved and the hinder part, in the region of the two veins, should be strongly chafed with a rough cloth; then the patient should bind his neck with his turban until the two veins are visible; their position is behind the ears in the two flattened places of the head; feel for them with your finger and when you feel their pulsation beneath your finger then mark the place with ink.	0.90643
Then take the lancet knife, which is for incision, and insert it under the vein in the skin until the phlebotomy reaches the bone. Then lift your hand with the vein and the skin upwards and incise the vein with an incision knife. And let the length of the incision be the width of two fingers joined or around that; and let as much blood flow out as you want.	Then take a knife-scalpel, known as a lancet, and insert it beneath the vessel into the skin until the scalpel reaches the bone; then lifting with your hand both vessel and skin make an incision dividing both skin and vein; the length of the incision should be about two fingers side by side; then draw off the quantity of blood you wish.	0.89022845
Then press it with powders and leave it until it is healed.	Then bind them up with dressings and leave it until healed.	0.80366397
And it is already mentioned at the beginning of the book the incision of these and their cauterization.	The incision and cauterization of these two vessels has been discussed earlier in the book.	0.7306389
But for the two arterial veins in the temples, the benefit of phlebotomy is for chronic and severe migraines, persistent ophthalmia, and acute excessive discharges from the eyes.	The section of the two arteries in the temples gives relief for chronic migraine and severe headache and constant ophthalmia and the flow of acrid superfluities into the eyes.	0.6744057
And the method to phlebotomize them is as I tell you: have the patient tighten their neck greatly until the two veins appear by sensation through clear manifestation and their pulse is felt under your finger; then mark with a probe.	Now the manner of incising them is as I shall describe: the patient should bind his neck with a sash until the vessels stand out clearly to the eye and their pulsation is manifest under your finger; then mark with ink.	0.81708264
Then lift the skin above the vein upwards with your index finger, insert the incision phlebotomy tool underneath, lift the vein upwards; and incise it as you did with the other two veins; and let the blood flow according to the amount you need.	Then with your forefinger raise the skin over the vessel and introduce a lancet beneath and lift up the vein and divide it as you did the other two; and draw off as much blood as you need.	0.8495752
Then loosen the patient's constriction, and place your finger on the vein for an hour, then place cotton and powders on it and press it tightly, and leave it until it is healed.	Then loosen the band round the patient's neck and put your finger on the vein for a while; then apply cotton wool and a pad, bandage securely, and leave until it heals.	0.84615636
And the remembrance of them, and their incision, and the extraction is already mentioned at the beginning of the book.	They and their incision and extraction have been mentioned earlier in the book.	0.8142482
And thus the benefit of phlebotomy of the forehead vein is similar to the phlebotomy of the cephalic vein for chronic facial diseases and migraines and redness and foul ulcers.	Venesection of the vein in the forehead is, after venesection of the cephalic, a relief to chronic diseases of the face such as pustules and scabs and erysipelas.	0.60065305
And the method of phlebotomy there is as I tell you; that is, the patient tightens their neck with a band until the vein appears; then take the instrument called fossori of which this is its form:	Now I shall relate to you the method of cutting: you bind the patient's neck until the vessel stands out; then you take the instrument called the 'pickaxe'.	0.66787744
Place the prominent point which is at the head of the fossori on that vein and strike it with a hammer or other object in that manner, and let the blood flow as much as you want; then loosen the patient's constriction and press it until it is healed.	The spike in the head of the instrument you place on the vessel itself and then strike with a comb or some similar thing; and let the blood flow to the extent you wish; then loosen the band round the neck and bandage the vein until healed.	0.83021533
And sometimes it is opened with a wide phlebotomy tool, but the phlebotomy tool should not be of sharp extremity like the other phlebotomy tools, rather it should be of wide extremity, and phlebotomize it transversely, because the bone is close and it would easily break the phlebotomy tool if it is fine.	Sometimes it is opened with a broad scalpel; the scalpel, however, should not have a sharp point like other scalpels but should be a little broader at the tip, and the vein is cut obliquely, because the bone is close and the scalpel, if it is too fine, may be broken on it.	0.71462107
But the benefit of the two veins in the tear ducts of both eyes is for scab in the eyes, redness, and inflammation in the eyes, and facial diseases.	Venesection of the two lachrymal veins gives relief in diseases of the eyes such as granular conjunctiva and inflammation and pannus, and in diseases of the face.	0.64289784
And the method of phlebotomy is that the patient tightens their neck with a band, then phlebotomize those, and you stand over the patient's head.	Now this is the method of incising: the patient binds a sash round his throat, then you cut open both veins, standing in front of him.	0.5280635
And perform the phlebotomy transversely a little with a small phlebotomy tool, because there is no flesh in that area; and if the phlebotomy tool is fine, its extremity will break easily.	The incision should be oblique, slightly longitudinal, with a small, rather broad scalpel, for in this place there is no flesh; so if the knife have too narrow a point it may be broken on the bone.	0.5916697
And then let the blood flow as much as you need, place cotton on them, and press them for one night, and then loosen them.	Then let flow what blood you wish, put cotton wool on both, tie for one night, then loosen.	0.8310405
But the phlebotomy of the vein of the nose is beneficial for acute fever and sudden severe fever, facial diseases, migraines, and redness that occur on the face, especially when chronic.	Venesection of the vein of the nose helps in acute fevers, in violent headache, and in diseases of the face such as the red pustules that arise on the nose, especially if they are chronic.	0.5677949
And the method of phlebotomy there is that the patient tightens their neck and you hold their nose with your left hand, take the fine long phlebotomy tool and insert it in the middle of the nose tip straightly, because the vein does not appear by sensation there, and because the blood starts to flow immediately.	This is how you make the incision: the patient binds his neck and then you hold his nose with your left hand and take a long fine scalpel and stick it in the middle of the very lobule of the nose, perpendicularly in the nasal septum (for the vein is not obvious at that spot) and blood will immediately flow out.	0.6960286
You should gradually withdraw your hand with the phlebotomy tool and let the blood flow according to your need; then bind it for one night, because it heals quickly.	You should advance the scalpel a little and cause the blood to flow as required; then bandage for one night, for it will quickly heal.	0.74910057
But the benefit of phlebotomy of the two guidegui veins is for nasal constriction, the onset of leprosy, many diseases, impetigo, and corrosive ulcers like herpes.	Venesection of the jugular veins helps tightness of breath and the early stage of elephantiasis, and the melancholic diseases arising on the surface of the skin, such as the black vitiligo and impetigo and malignant ulcers and cancrum oris.	0.4995005
And the method of phlebotomy for those is that the patient tightens below each vein in their neck with a band; the practitioner should stand over the patient's head, and the patient should sit on a chair.	Now the way to venesect them is for the patient to bind his neck below them both with a band; let the operator stand behind the patient and let the patient be seated upon a chair.	0.7524576
Then phlebotomize the vein lengthwise with a wide phlebotomy tool little by little; then extract blood in a moderate amount or according to what is necessary for that; then do the same with the other vein.	Then incise the vein longitudinally with a rather wide opening; then let a moderate amount of blood, or according to what you think necessary; then do the same with the other vein.	0.8579026
Then loosen the band and press the two veins with moderate pressure so that the patient is not suffocated, and leave it until the morning because the wound is healed.	Then loosen the band and tie the veins with a moderate pressure lest the patient be suffocated; leave him until the next day and the wound will be healed.	0.8785367
And the benefit of phlebotomy of the algelic veins is for small abscesses and pustules of the mouth, gum decay, bad ulcers, and fissures, and bad ulcers in the nose and its surrounding area.	The four veins of the lips: venesection of them is effective, second to section of the cephalic vein, for pustules on the mouth and rotting of the gums and malignant ulcers and fissures of the lips and for malignant ulcer in the nose and round about.	0.5758844
And the method of phlebotomy for those is that you make the patient sit in front of you, tighten their neck with a band, then turn their lips and look at the two veins, one on the right side of the lip and the other on the left side; and the identification of each is by the blackness of each of both, and more so because around them are small black veins; then incise each with an incision tool.	The way to venesect is to seat the patient in front of you and bind a sash round his neck, then roll back his lips and look for the two veins, one of which you will see to the left and the other to the right; their dark colour will show them up against the lip and also the fact that round them are fine dark veins; so cut down upon both, dividing them.	0.79816514
But if you have doubt, and do not know which one it is, then you should proceed to incise the largest of those, and the most apparent of those.	But if you are in doubt about the matter and are not sure what they are, set about incising the largest and most obvious.	0.8714875
And do the same with the two veins in the upper lips.	Do the same with the two veins in the upper lip.	0.93298995
But the benefit of the phlebotomy of the two veins under the tongue is similar to the phlebotomy of the cephalic vein for inflammations in the throat, diseases of the uvula, and mouth diseases.	The two veins under the tongue: their venesection is, after section of the cephalic, of good effect in the quinsy arising in the throat from disease of the uvula, and diseases of the mouth.	0.6313795
And the method of phlebotomizing those is that you hold the patient between your hands facing the sun, lift their tongue, and look under the tongue, from one side to the other, and the color of each is leaning towards blackness.	The way to venesect them is to seat the patient before you in the sunlight and raise his tongue, and look, and you will see beneath the tongue one vein on each side, blackish in colour.	0.726162
And then phlebotomize each; and be careful not to keep your hand too long in phlebotomizing those, because there are arteries underneath them.	Cut them; but be careful not to go too far in your incision, for beneath them lie arteries from which there may be haemorrhage.	0.70527685
And the veins that are phlebotomized in the elbow are the ones where blood usually flows in all men, and their phlebotomy is done in two ways, either puncture with the myrtle or olive phlebotomy tool with a declining subtlety; or cut with a knife-like phlebotomy tool, called alnessil, and this is its form:	The three veins that are opened in the elbow are the veins which universal custom has used for bloodletting. There are two ways of venesecting these: either by piercing with a broad myrtle-leaf scalpel or a rather fine olivary; or by cutting with a knife-edged scalpel, the lancet whose figure follows. The broad myrtle-leaf scalpel.	0.74776363
it is wide like some, and suitable for opening concave veins that are visibly large, and for those that contain thick, turbid blood.	As you see, it should be broad so as to serve for opening hollow, full, outstanding, obvious and thick veins, and those containing turbid blood.	0.7280131
And this phlebotomy tool is narrower and has a finer tip, and is suitable for phlebotomy of fine veins that contain fine, yellowish blood.	This scalpel is less broad and finer-pointed. It is suitable for venesecting fine veins that contain thin jaundiced blood.	0.7015532
But the benefit of the phlebotomy of the basilic vein, which is one of three veins, is that it extracts the blood from the diseases that are below the throat and neck, and from what follows to the chest and abdomen.	The basilic vein, which is one of these three vessels, helps, when cut, by extracting blood from disorders below the throat and neck, in the parts neighbouring the chest and abdomen.	0.7044761
And it is necessary for the phlebotomist, when performing that phlebotomy, to be very careful and cautious because there is an artery underneath, and if he makes a mistake and hits the artery with the phlebotomy tool, it will cause blood flow, so he should not phlebotomize it with a puncturing tool, but rather cut with the alnessil.	When one venesects it one must be careful and wary of it, for beneath the vein is an artery, so that if one is inaccurate and sticks the scalpel in too far one will cut the artery and cause a haemorrhage; therefore venesection of it should not be done with a transfixing scalpel but should be an incision with the lancet.	0.75723803
And if the basilic vein does not appear clearly, then you should leave it and move to another, or look for one of its branches; or phlebotomize in the place at the end of the arm, because it is visible; and cut it with the alnessil phlebotomy tool as we have said.	If the basilic vein is not clearly discernible, leave it and turn to another, or look for a branch of it; or venesect the brachial cord instead, for that is evident; incise it with the lancet as we have said.	0.828061
But if you want to perform the phlebotomy yourself, then you should first tighten the arm and find the pulse point, then mark it with ink; and then bind the arm and cut the vein with a concave incision with the alnessil phlebotomy tool as we have said; and be careful not to let the cut fall in the area of the artery.	But if you wish to open the basilic vein itself you should, before you bandage the arm, palpate the place till the site of pulsation is found; then mark it with ink; then bind the arm and cut the vein obliquely with the lancet as we said, and take care that the stroke fall some way from the artery.	0.8165154
And when you see, while tightening the binding, swelling in the place you marked with ink, that swelling is from the artery, and then you should avoid it.	If, when tying the bandage, you see a swelling in the place that you have marked with ink, that swelling is the inflation of the artery, so avoid it.	0.8045132
And if you see the blood flow in the phlebotomy like the urine of a child, and the blood is thin and red, then you know it is arterial blood; and then you should quickly place your finger over it for a long time; and then remove your finger, and if the blood stops, because often it does, then you should bind the arm and leave it.	And if, on section, you see the blood spurt out like a child's urine, and it is clear and red, then you may know that it is arterial blood; so then be quick and put your finger upon it for a long while; then remove your finger and if the bleeding stops, as it often will, then bind up the arm and leave it.	0.88801533
And protect the patient from movement, be cautious with him and do not disturb him for some days until it is healed.	Caution the patient against neglecting it; let him be careful and not move it for some days, until it heals.	0.83179027
But if the blood does not stop, and you see that you do not have the necessary medicine, then you cut the artery if it appears; because its end is constricted, and the blood is stopped; or you take the bark of pistachio, prepare it, take one half and press it on the vein with a descending tightness with a bandage and powders until the next day.	But if the bleeding is not stayed but resists your treatment and you have no medicament there at the time, then cut the vessel through if you can see it; for the two ends will contract and the haemorrhage will stop. Or else take a pistachio nut shell and split it and take one half and bind it over the site of the haemorrhage with a pad and bandage until next day.	0.87330747
And then if the blood stops, good; if not, then treat it with what is previously mentioned about the powders that stop blood flow.	The bleeding may stop; if not, then treat by those means mentioned previously, namely the application of styptic powders.	0.6605463
And stopping the blood there is difficult in many cases because of the small area of the wound and the possibility of binding the arm.	It is not difficult in most cases to stop the bleeding, because the wound is small and it is easy to bandage the arm.	0.75154746
But the phlebotomy of the fusca vein benefits by extracting the blood from the upper part of the head and the lower part of the body; because it is composed of a branch of the basilic vein and a branch of the cephalic vein, as we have said.	So get to know it. Venesection of the median vein results in drawing off blood from the upper part of the head and the lower part of the body; this being due to the fact, as we said, that it is composed of a branch of the cephalic and a branch of the basilic veins.	0.81994313
And it is necessary for the phlebotomist to be cautious when performing phlebotomy on it, because there is a nerve underneath it; and if he punctures with the phlebotomy tool and hits the nerve, it will cause numbness, and its healing is difficult, and it may never heal completely. And this nerve is sometimes felt; and if it is hidden in some people and is thin and not visible, then you should place the phlebotomy tool with which you perform the incision with the alnessil, and avoid the nerve with your skill.	The venesector should be very careful in opening it because there is a nerve beneath; and if he takes the scalpel too deep and hits that nerve it will cause stupor, the healing of which will be difficult and perhaps even impossible. Generally this nerve can be felt, but if in some persons it lies hidden and is slender and not discernible, then you should make your venesection an incision with the lancet and diligently avoid the nerve.	0.7974549
And if the vein is between two nerves, then you make the vein longitudinally.	If the vein lies between two nerves you should cut it longitudinally.	0.76465917
The benefit of the phlebotomy of the cephalic vein is that it draws blood from the head and is beneficial for diseases of the eyes.	The cephalic vein: section of it is effective in drawing blood from the head and in diseases of the eyes.	0.70969164
And it is necessary in this one specifically, if you want to phlebotomize it, to use the olive or myrtle phlebotomy tool; because it is the safest of all veins, since there is no artery or nerve underneath it.	Particularly in this vein you ought, if you wish to incise it, to make your incision by puncturing with the olivary or the broad myrtle-leaf scalpel, for this is the safest of all veins as there is neither artery nor nerve beneath.	0.7779238
But nevertheless, it often becomes inflamed in some people, when it is not phlebotomized with the first percussion, but this inflammation does not harm at all.	It will not injure it, if at the first cut you miss the vein, to repeat the incision several times; except that in some people it will sometimes swell up if the section is not made at the first stroke; nevertheless that swelling will do him no harm.	0.6438089
The first thing you need to know is that phlebotomy is not administered except in the preservation of health and with the hope and caution of preventing diseases, and that phlebotomy should be done in one of the veins in the elbow, that is: cephalic, fusca, and basilic; and that phlebotomy should be done at the beginning of spring, on an empty stomach in spring and autumn, and in winter after a meal, when there are signs of fullness.	First you should know that venesection may be employed either for the preservation of health or in cases of disease. When used for the preservation and maintenance of health and for guarding against the occurrence of disease, the venesection should be in one of the three vessels at the elbow, cephalic, median, or basilic; and it must be performed at the beginning of spring when the signs of repletion appear.	0.73848593
And phlebotomy should be done on the third day or the first after three hours of the day have passed.	The venesection should be done on a Sunday or Tuesday, after three hours of the day have passed.	0.6635622
But phlebotomy that is administered, when it causes convenience and necessity, whether by night or by day, at any hour and at any time.	On the other hand, venesection administered for diseases has no fixed hour but when need and necessity arise, either by night or by day, at any hour, in any season.	0.6591201
And it is necessary that a child is not phlebotomized until they are fourteen years old, and a pregnant woman is not phlebotomized except from the fourth month to the seventh, and the elderly are not phlebotomized who have already passed sixty years.	Children should not be venesected until their fourteenth year, nor should you venesect old men of over sixty years.	0.6945758
And when someone wants to be phlebotomized in any manner, it is necessary to cleanse their bowels before the phlebotomy with a leon enema, if there is much retained feces, so that the veins do not draw the impurities in the phlebotomy from the bowels, which are putrid, and do not harm the principal organs.	When anyone has decided to be bled, for whatever reason, first of all his bowels must be purged with a gentle enema if they contain much excrement, lest at the venesection putrid superfluities be drawn from the bowels into the veins, that might harm the chief parts of the body.	0.7355763
And patients with excessive nausea and hangover should not be phlebotomized, nor those recovering from illness or drunkenness until it has passed, nor those suffering from dropsy, and phlebotomy should be avoided near colic pain and vomiting, and near bowel conditions, and near excessive coitus and work and exercise from fasting or vigils and any cause that weakens the strength, whether bodily or animal.	No one suffering from indigestion or surfeit or drunkenness should be venesected until recovered from these; nor a dropsical patient. Beware also of venesection after stomach-trouble or vomiting or diarrhoea or much intercourse or fatigue or exercise or sleeplessness or fasting and anything else that diminishes the strength both bodily and spiritual.	0.7809262
And also consider the thinning of humors before this if the blood is thick, with foods and drinks, and with medicines if it is possible to do so.	Then, beforehand, see to the refining of the humours, if the blood be thick, by means of food and drink and medicines, if that is practicable for him.	0.826234
And take a bath beforehand if no cause prohibits it, or exercise in some way so that the blood is thinned.	Then, if there is no contra-indication, let him enter the bath; or let him take a little exercise to make the blood thin.	0.72747993
And perform the phlebotomy in the morning, that is, around the third hour, as we have said.	Then perform the venesection in the early part of the day, as we have said.	0.6610869
And make sure that the patient's peace is guarded on that day from all bad animal accidents, such as anxiety, anger, fear, and all bodily accidents, such as excessive work, pain, coitus, and similar things.	Let him endeavour on that day to have his mind free from all such evil spiritual affections as anxiety, anger, or fear; and from all bodily affections such as excessive fatigue and weariness and intercourse and the like.	0.724426
And at their side, have present the things that men usually use with aromaticity and fragrance, and with balm and similar things according to the quantity possible.	There should also be in the place where he is sitting such things as are customary for men to enjoy, such as various perfumes, aromatics, and music, and the like, as each one may.	0.61386746
And the phlebotomist should sit on a stool that is higher than the stool of the one who is to be phlebotomized.	Then the venesector should sit on a cushion raised above the cushion of him whose vein is to be opened.	0.5844146
And then, extend their arm, and the phlebotomist should rub it with their hand two or three times; and then tighten the ligature with a strap and wrap it around twice.	Then let him stretch out his arm, and let the venesector chafe it two or three times with his hand; then he should bind a bandage round it by means of thongs twisted two or three times.	0.874019
And let the tightness be moderate, because if the tightness is not equal, or if it is too tight, it prevents the flow of blood; or if it is too loose, it prevents the proper flow of blood outward.	The ligature should be moderately tight, for any other sort of ligature, be it too tight or too loose, will hinder the flow of blood.	0.6620971
And after the tightening, the one who is to be phlebotomized should rub their hands together until the veins are swollen and become visible.	After putting on the tourniquet the patient about to be venesected should chafe his own hands together until the veins swell up and become obvious.	0.65146196
And then the phlebotomist should anoint the phlebotomy tool with a bit of old oil; and then place the index finger of the left hand on the vein, below the spot where the phlebotomy is to be done, so the vein moves slightly, and the tapping ceases because some veins act like a fleeing string towards the phlebotomy, and some are full of air and when you place the phlebotomy tool on them, they contract towards the tool, and the phlebotomist is deceived; and the tool does not open the vein, and if it does, the vein becomes narrow.	Then the venesector should wipe over his knife with a little olive-oil, preferably old. Then he should place the forefinger of his left hand on the vessel itself below the place where he wishes to cut, lightly, so that the vein does not slip away and elude the stroke; for there are some veins that you may find like cords slipping away at venesection, while others are filled with flatus and when the knife is applied to them they contract under it and deceive the operator and the knife fails to open the vein or makes only a narrow opening.	0.8212181
And therefore, the phlebotomist must be firm and diligent in all these matters.	Wherefore it behoves the venesector to be firm and deliberate in all these cases.	0.70587575
And then place the phlebotomy tool, but if the vein is not opened at once, then it is good; otherwise, you should try again a little below that spot, or above it with speed, if the spot is not inflamed.	Then he should apply the knife and if the vein is opened first time, good; but if not, let him repeat a little lower down or a little above, quickly, if the place does not swell.	0.7632624
And if the spot is inflamed, or the patient is scared, then leave it for a day or two, and do not tighten the ligature, as it may quickly attract a cautious inflammation, and do not take a bath.	If it does swell or the patient be anxious, then leave him for a day or two and do not bandage, for that might perhaps provoke an abscess; nor let him go to the bath.	0.8067842
And then repeat the phlebotomy if it is necessary.	Then if he likes, let the venesection be repeated.	0.5515074
And if the opening is small and the blood flows subtly, and you fear that the quantity of blood desired will not be released, then you should repeat the phlebotomy in that hole with precision and enlarge the opening a little, and do this quickly before the spot becomes inflamed, because the spot becomes inflamed in many people due to a small opening.	If the knife has made an opening but it is small and the flow of blood is feeble and you fear that the amount of blood you require will not come out, then gently insert the knife again straight into the same opening and widen it a little. Do this speedily before the place swells up; for in many people the place swells up at once from a small opening.	0.7503556
But if you see it already inflamed, then do not repeat it there, as there is no reason; and place some portion of the oil bandage on it, as it alleviates the blood flow. And it is better in this case than oil and other oils.	But if you see it swell up, on no account make another incision for it will be ineffectual; but apply to it a little lees of oil, for that will facilitate the flow of blood; it is superior in this situation to the oil itself and to all other unguents.	0.8686282
And similarly, administer an oil bandage in every phlebotomy in which you phlebotomize the veins to prevent blood flow, and use this theriac alfadoc and sagzenea when placed on the spot, as the blood becomes thinned and mixed when it is thick.	Therefore use lees of oil in all cases of venesection when the flow of blood is hindered. The great theriac and shakhzanaya both have the same effect, for when the blood is thick it is rendered thin and running.	0.6380044
And if a large abscess forms at the phlebotomy site, which often happens, especially to one who has not been bled before, or if the vein's opening is small, then hurry, and place on the spot a sponge soaked in water and salt, slightly heated, and tighten it for an hour, because it will dissolve.	If there occur a big tumour at the site of venesection, as often happens, especially with a man who has not previously undergone venesection or if the opening in the vein be small, then quickly apply to the place a sponge soaked in lukewarm salt and water and bandage it for a while, then it will go down.	0.7539094
And it is necessary to do this after the blood has flowed from that vein, with the closure of it or another vein.	You should do this after the blood has gone out altogether from the same vessel or from another one.	0.769544
And if there remains some darkness or greenness at the spot for a few days, it does not harm; and if you wish, place on it something made of aloe and dissolved myrrh, or something of mint or calamint juice or something similar.	If there remain after some days some discoloration or greenness at the site it will not hurt; if you like, apply some solution of myrrh and aloes, or juice of penny-royal or something similar.	0.8405713
And often abscesses and swellings occur due to phlebotomy of the basilic vein.	Often in section of the basilic vein there occurs tumour and swelling.	0.6986891
And then place your hand on it, and if you find softness under your compression on it, then that swelling is bad and harmful; and then be careful not to place on it any of the things we have mentioned, because it may quickly cause blood to flow from the artery.	Put your hand upon it, and if you find that it sinks when pressed then it is a harmful swelling; be careful not to apply to it any of the things we have told you; for often arterial blood comes from it.	0.8382567
And make a plaster with something that has astringency, so that the spot is hardened, and then treat it with other care until it is healed.	But apply a poultice with some styptic qualities, to harden the place; then treat in the usual way until healed.	0.67941993
And you need to extract blood from everyone according to the amount of their strength and according to the dominant color of the blood as it appears.	Now in each case you should extract blood in proportion to the person's strength and to the prevailing colour of the blood.	0.736997
Because if the blood is black, then you let it flow until it is red; and similarly, if you see it is thick, then you let it flow until it is thinned; and similarly, if it is sharp, until its sharpness is removed.	If the blood be black, let it flow until it becomes red; in the same way, if you see it is thick, let it run until it is thin; and again, if it be sharp, until its sharpness is gone.	0.9342685
And it is necessary for someone who is full and strong and needs a single blood extraction, that the phlebotomy of the vein be enlarged and the opening wide.	In the case that is plethoric, robust, and requiring venesection just the once, the incision should be wide and the knife should be broad.	0.59910285
And in someone who is frail, do the opposite, and the blood should be extracted in multiple sessions, and the opening should be narrow.	And on the contrary for the debilitated person, in whose case you should venesect several times and the opening should be small.	0.7666368
And the best way to administer vein phlebotomy is that the cut be transverse, not punctured.	The best method in venesecting is if the incision be at an angle, oblique, cutting, not piercing.	0.6417085
And this method of phlebotomy is safe from blood flow and nerve incision, and it is more praiseworthy and safer than phlebotomy along latitude and longitude.	This manner of venesecting is safe from haemorrhage and from cutting the nerve; it is better and safer than cutting straight across or straight along.	0.6922127
And for those prone to fainting from phlebotomy, it is necessary to treat them before phlebotomy with a little bread soaked in pomegranate wine or simple heated oxymel; and extract a little blood in three or four sessions.	To the patient who habitually faints during venesection you should give to eat beforehand a little bread macerated in the juice of unripe pomegranates or oxymel, if he be of a warm temperament; and draw off the blood in three or four instalments.	0.77988124
And if there is a cold constitution, then before phlebotomy take bread soaked in myrrh syrup or honey syrup flavored with spices like pepper, cinnamon, ginger and similar, or in a very fragrant aromatic syrup.	And if he be of a cold temperament let him take beforehand bread macerated in syrup of quinces or in aromatic syrup of honey or in fragrant syrup of basil.	0.6694325
And if fainting occurs due to phlebotomy, and it is caused by a lot of blood loss, then it is necessary to drink meat broth and very fragrant subtle syrup; and use aromatic substances with aloe, and rub their chest with it.	If the patient faints during venesection and the cause is great loss of blood, then be should be given to drink meat-juice and thin syrup of basil; and he should perfume himself with galia moschata and anoint his chest with it.	0.7176955
And use other remedies that we have mentioned in the section on fainting due to evacuation.	And for the rest, use what we have spoken of in its place in the chapter dealing with fainting due to evacuation.	0.8154937
And anyone who wants to vent their arm and dissolve their blood a second time, it is necessary for those whose phlebotomy is for large evacuation, and their strength is weak, to evacuate the blood little by little, that is, according to their strength, in continuous days.	As for him who wishes to ease his arm and draw off blood a second time, when he is undergoing the venesection on account of great evacuation and the lowness of his strength, you should let the blood slowly, in proportion to his strength, on successive days.	0.7973445
But anyone who wants to vent their arm and expel their blood a second time, and their body is strong, should do this around seven or nine hours after the first phlebotomy.	For him who wishes to ease his arm and draw off blood a second time, being of robust body, it must be done seven or nine hours from the first venesection.	0.82497686
But anyone who wants to draw blood from their body to the opposite side of the part to which it flows should be vented on the second or third day.	He who wishes to draw blood from his body to the side opposite to that toward which it tends, should be eased on the second or third day.	0.88989294
But a body in which there is a lot of blood already heated and acute and causing fever, it is necessary to expel a large amount of blood at once, and the opening should be enlarged until fainting occurs, after you have maintained all the conditions of phlebotomy; and place your hand on the pulse to prevent death instead of fainting, as this often happens when the phlebotomist is ignorant and negligent.	He who has abundant blood that has become hot and sharp and has produced fever should be bled at one time, and a large amount should be taken with a wide opening, until he faints (all the rules of venesection having been observed by you); but you should keep your finger on the pulse while the blood flows lest death take the place of fainting, for that often happens when the venesector is ignorant and there is carelessness.	0.79393536
And it is not necessary when you want to untie the arm and evacuate the blood a second time, as the opening of the vein is already closed and the blood flow is difficult, to press on it with force and the bent arm is slightly extended, as this is very bad.	If you wish to loosen the arm and let blood a second time and you find that the opening of the vein is now closed up and the outflow of blood is difficult, you should not press hard upon it nor twist the arm violently, for that is very harmful.	0.87049145
First, leave it until it can be phlebotomized a second time; or remove the coagulated blood at the opening of the vein with the sharpness of the phlebotomy tool; or apply theriac alfarach, or sagzenea on it, and compress it lightly until the blood flows out.	Either you must leave him a while and then bleed him again; or the clot of blood can be removed from the opening of the vein by using the blade of the scalpel, or by applying some salt dissolved in water; or apply some of the great theriac or shakhzanaya; and put light pressure upon it until the blood comes out.	0.74040306
And if the vein is inflamed, then leave it and do not touch it until the inflammation has subsided.	But if the vein has begun to swell, leave it and do not touch it until the swelling has subsided.	0.8293307
And if you are forced to evacuate the blood a second time, and there is no other option, then you bleed from that spot or from another vein in the other arm.	And if you are unavoidably called to let blood again, venesect either above the place or in the other arm or another vessel.	0.78141487
And the vein called "funis del bras" is phlebotomized instead of the fusca or the basilic vein when they are not found or are hidden, because it is composed of those.	Section of the cord of the arm: this is cut in place of the median and basilic veins when these are not to be found or are hidden; for this vein is composed of those two.	0.5782597
And the quality of the phlebotomy of it is that the patient immerses their hand in warm water until the skin reddens and the vein becomes clearly visible.	The way to venesect it is for the patient to dip his hand in hot water until the forearm is red from the warmth and the vessel stands out distinctly.	0.5869066
And then it should be tightly bandaged with moderate tightness; and then phlebotomize it with a small transverse cut, not longitudinally.	Then bandage a little above it with a moderate pressure, and then cut the vein a little obliquely, neither transversely nor longitudinally.	0.73227555
And the opening should be wide and your phlebotomy should be done on the vein a little above the wrist.	The incision should be broad, and you should make the cut a little above the wrist.	0.6976055
And if the blood flow is restricted, then immerse the hand in warm water again and let the blood flow into the water until you achieve the desired amount.	If the blood does not flow easily, have the hand again put into the vessel of hot water and let the blood flow into the water until you have extracted what is needed.	0.7448468
But if it is during the summer, then you are excused from immersing the hand in warm water again, and it is better to immerse the body of the blood in warm water during the winter.	If it be in the summer time you may be able to dispense with putting the hand back into the hot water; it is mainly in winter that you let the blood flow into hot water.	0.8137802
And the phlebotomy of this vein is safer than all other veins because there is no pulsating vein or nerve beneath it.	Venesection of this vessel is safer than all others for beneath it there is neither artery nor nerve.	0.76495975
And the phlebotomy of the right hand’s vein is beneficial for liver diseases.	Section of the salvatella of the right hand is efficacious in case of diseases of the liver.	0.61166185
And the quality of the phlebotomy of it is that you tightly bandage the hand or use your hand, after immersing it in warm water, until the vein is swollen and clearly visible; and then phlebotomize it transversely; and if you cut it completely, it will not harm in any way.	The method of venesecting it is to tie a band round the wrist or grip it with your hand, after you have put it in hot water until the vein is swollen up and is plainly to be felt; then cut it somewhat obliquely; if you cut it right through that will not matter at all.	0.73817486
And make sure not to press the hand too much with the phlebotomy tool, because beneath it are the nerves of the fingers stripped of flesh.	But be careful not to go too far with the knife, for underneath there are the tendons of the fingers and the place is bare of flesh.	0.5782229
And then immerse the hand in warm water again and let the blood flow into it, because if you do not immerse it in warm water again, the blood will coagulate in the opening of the vein and restrict the flow.	Then put the hand again into hot water and let the blood flow; for if you do not put it into hot water again the blood will clot in the opening and will be prevented from flowing.	0.8960898
And when the blood is extracted according to the needed amount, then apply oil and salt on the vein to prevent it from closing too quickly; and similarly, this should be done on all narrow openings.	When you have extracted the required quantity of blood, put oil and salt on the vein so that it does not heal too quickly. You should act thus with every narrow branch.	0.83552134
But the benefit of the phlebotomy of that of the left hand is that it is beneficial for spleen diseases.	Incision of the salvatella of the left hand is of value in diseases of the spleen.	0.5516603
And do similarly in the phlebotomy of it as you did in the other.	Venesection of it should be carried out in the same manner as you did in the other.	0.6661058
And the benefit of the phlebotomy of the saphenous vein is for diseases in the lower part of the body, such as diseases of the uterus, and menstrual retention, and diseases of the kidneys and chronic ulcers of the thighs and legs, and similar diseases.	Venesection of the saphena is beneficial in diseases of the lower part of the body, such as afflictions of the uterus and retention of the menses, and for diseases of the kidneys, and for chronic ulcers of the hips and legs, and similar diseases.	0.7898798
And the quality of the phlebotomy of it is that the patient immerses their foot in warm water and rubs it until the veins are clearly visible; and bandage above the ankle with a strap; and the location of the vein on the heel is visible towards the big toe, and from it branch many veins on the surface of the foot.	Now the manner of venesection is for the patient to put his foot in hot water, then friction should be applied to it until the veins fill up; then bind a thong over the joint of the foot; then the site of the vein at the ankle is shown up running toward the big toe and forming many branches on the surface of the foot.	0.7265128
And then phlebotomize the widest branch or below the calf towards the heel towards its junction, as it is better and safer.	Then make your incision either in the broadest branch or at the ankle before it ramifies, for that is better and safer.	0.748935
And if you phlebotomize it on the surface of the foot, then beware of the nerves beneath it on the surface of the foot, and apply the phlebotomy transversely, almost as if you were cutting it.	If you venesect it on the surface of the foot, be careful of the tendons that are beneath on the surface of the foot. Make the incision obliquely as though you were cutting the vein through.	0.7022172
And the phlebotomy should be gentle.	The knife should be a lancet.	0.40113884
But if the blood flow is restricted, then immerse the foot in warm water again and let the blood flow into it until it is evacuated.	If the flow of blood be impeded, put the foot back again into hot water and let the blood flow out into it until it is evacuated.	0.8856875
And if the phlebotomist makes a mistake the first time, then try again a little higher, as the location is safe; and do not fear harm, but beware of the nerves as we have said.	If the venesector makes a mistake the first time in the vein to be cut, let him repeat the section a little higher up, for the.place is safe; you need fear no mischief as long as you are careful of the tendons, as we said before.	0.7071618
And similarly do the phlebotomy of the saphenous vein of the other foot equally.	In the same way you may deal with the saphena of the other foot.	0.66301334
And for the sciatic vein, the location as we have said is towards the heel below the outer ankle.	Now the position of the sciatic vein is, as we said, on the outside near the heel.	0.75425386
And the benefit of the phlebotomy of it is for hip pain when it is due to bad blood.	Section of it is effective in pain in the hip when it arises from hot blood.	0.5309243
And the quality of the phlebotomy of it is that the patient enters a bath, and quickly and tightly bandages the thigh from the side of the hip down to the heel about four fingers in width with a long, thin bandage, because it is only visible in this way.	The way to venesect it is to make the patient get into the bath. Then hasten and bandage his leg from the hip to a distance of four fingers above the heel, with a long narrow bandage; for only this will cause it to appear.	0.63129115
And then when it appears, phlebotomize it with whatever tool you can and transversely, as it is better; or cut it by incision or section, as the location is safe.	When it has appeared then open it in whatever way you can; at an angle, which is best, or right through, or only cut it open, for it is a safe place.	0.7216333
And it is very hidden in many people; and if you find it, and it is not visible by touch at all, then phlebotomize any branch of it, which is the one that appears on the back of the foot towards the little and ring toes.	But in many people it is very hard to find; and if you do not find it or it is in no way palpable, then venesect one of its branches, which will be seen on the surface of the foot towards the fourth toe and the little toe.	0.7874645
And beware of the nerves, and let the blood flow the desired amount.	Be careful of the tendons, and let the amount of blood you require.	0.8075777
And then untie the bandage and apply cotton on the phlebotomy site and press the spot, as it heals quickly.	Then loosen the bandage and apply cotton wool to the site of the section and bandage the place; it will heal quickly.	0.75688595
On cupping and the qualities of using them.	On cupping and the manner of employing it.	0.789678
Cupping glasses are made of horn, or brass, or glass.	Cupping-vessels are made of horn, wood, bronze, or glass.	0.7692393
And cupping is done in two ways: one of them is with scarification and blood extraction, and the other is cupping without scarification.	Cupping is carried out in two ways: one with scarification and drawing blood, and the other without scarification.	0.92196256
And this cupping without scarification is done in two ways, either with fire or without fire.	The latter, cupping without scarification, may be carried out in two ways: with fire and without fire.	0.8249923
And the cupping with scarification and blood extraction is applied to fourteen places on the body, of which one place where cups are applied is the alnocrati, and it is the back part of the head; and the middle part of it on both sides of the neck together; and cupping of the chin below the mandible further below the mouth; and cupping of both shoulder blades; and cupping of the alohoster, which is over the end of the tailbone; and cupping of the two upper arms, which are the two arms; and cupping of both ankles; and cupping of both thighs.	The points at which cupping with scarification and extraction of blood is performed are fourteen places in the body: the occiput, which is the back of the head; the interscapular region, which is the middle of the back of the neck; the two sides of the neck, equally on both sides; the chin, that is, beneath the lower jaw; the two shoulders; the coccyx, at the base of the tail; the antibrachium, the middle of the forearms; the two legs; and the two heel-veins.	0.8637856
And cupping does not extract blood except from the small veins scattered in the flesh, and therefore does not lose its effectiveness through these, unlike phlebotomy; nor should cupping be done with fire or without fire in any illness caused by repletion until the whole body is evacuated.	What cupping does is to draw blood out of the fine vessels dispersed over the flesh; for this reason it does not cause the strength to decline as does venesection; nor may you use cupping, either with fire or without fire, in any disease due to plethora, until the whole body has been evacuated.	0.8361572
But if necessity forces cupping due to illness or continuously, administer it at any time at the beginning of the month and at the end of it, and in the middle of it and at any time.	If disease or custom prescribe cupping we may apply it at any hour, at the beginning or end or middle of the month, at whatever time it may be.	0.76241946
And then when you see any of those causes, and especially if it is on the third or middle of the month, then we command cupping to be done after two or three hours of the day have passed.	So when we see anything of this kind, and especially if it be in the middle third of the month, we thereupon prescribe cupping after the second or third hour of the day has passed.	0.8813174
And the benefit of cupping on the nape is that it helps with heaviness in the head and those who are sunken around the eyes; but this should be done after evacuating the whole body.	The effect of cupping the nape of the neck is to help in heaviness of the head and in a fluxion of humours into the eyes; but it should be done after a complete evacuation of the body.	0.83921885
And this cupping is in the location of the cephalic phlebotomy.	This use of cupping may take the place of venesection of the cephalic vein.	0.54246306
And it is not lawful to use it on someone with a cold complexion, or who has catarrh, because it does great harm to them.	But anyone suffering from coldness of the brain or catarrh should beware of using it, for this will cause serious harm.	0.7031653
And therefore it should not be used on the elderly, and on those whose heads have cold diseases.	So it should not be employed on old men or on anyone suffering from a cold disease of the head.	0.87680423
But for those who continue with it, it causes forgetfulness; and therefore you should command the cupper to lightly place their hand with the cup on the lower parts, fearing the generation of forgetfulness.	If anyone becomes addicted to it it brings about oblivion. You should therefore bid the cupper bring the cupping-vessel a little lower down lest oblivion supervene.	0.64596736
But cupping of alkehel is in the location of the phlebotomy of the dark and basilic veins: and therefore it helps with asthma, and the constriction of the chest and the splitting of the chest instrument, and cough, and repletion.	Now as to the application of cupping-vessels to the interscapular region: it is instead of venesection of the median and basilic veins; so it is effective for asthma and dyspnoea and for rupture of the organ of respiration, and for cough and plethora.	0.58255094
And it should be pressed a little, because if placed lower, it causes weakness in the body and stomach.	The cupping of the interscapular region should be made a little high, for if it is too low it will bring about weakness of the heart and stomach.	0.5391233
And the cupping of alhagdahan helps with accidental headaches and ophthalmia, and migraine, and preoccupation, and pains in the roots of the teeth; and it is in the location of the basilic phlebotomy.	Cupping the sides of the neck helps in pains occurring in the head, ophthalmia, migraine, and in quinsy and in pain at the roots of the teeth; it replaces venesection of the basilic vein.	0.7049643
And you should command the cupper not to press with the scarification so as not to cut the artery and cause a flow of blood.	And you should bid the cupper not to scarify very deeply lest he cut an artery and cause haemorrhage.	0.84558094
And cupping below the chin helps with ulceration in the mouth, and gingival corruption, and similar diseases in the mouth, and it stands in the location of the phlebotomy of the sublingual veins which are in the two lips.	The application of cupping under thé chin helps against ulcers in the mouth and corruption of the gums and similar diseases of the mouth ; and may replace venesection of the four labial vessels.	0.7113974
But cupping done on both shoulder blades helps with headache caused by repletion of heat.	The application of cupping to the shoulders helps in palpitation of the heart arising from plethora and heat.	0.6882025
And cupping of the two parts inside the thighs helps the phlebotomy of three veins, which are the basilic, dark, and cephalic veins, because it attracts the blood from all those smaller veins in the flesh, and those small veins from the other larger veins until the attraction reaches the three veins.	The application of cupping to the inside of the forearms helps in place of venesection of the three veins, namely the basilic, median, and cephalic; for it draws blood from all the capillaries of the flesh. These capillaries draw blood from other larger veins till the drawing reaches those three great veins.	0.79540634
And command the cupper not to proceed too much with the scarification, because the location is devoid of flesh, and beneath it are nerves and arteries.	You should bid the person who applies the vessels not to scarify deeply; for the place is bare of flesh and there are tendons and arteries beneath.	0.78875315
And it is a cupping glass with which cupping is done over the sacrum and helps with hemorrhoids of the anus and lower ulcers.	The application of a single cupping-vessel to the coccyx is effective for haemorrhoids of the anus and ulcers of the lower abdomen.	0.6016027
And you should command the cupper to use a large cup, and it should be made of brass, because the location needs strong sectioning; and quickly small cups are placed and scarified with scarification.	You must tell the cupper that the cupping-vessel should be large and of bronze, for the place requires strong suction, and a glass cupping-vessel may break; and he should scarify deeply.	0.7641712
But cupping of the legs decreases by clear diminution, because it draws the blood from the whole body, and helps with old pains in the kidneys and uterus, and the bladder; and it provokes menstruation, and helps with swelling and dropsy; and it stands in the location of the phlebotomy of two saphenous veins, and alahorcoben, and both ankles.	Cupping applied to both legs reduces plethora manifestly, because it draws off blood from the whole body, and so is beneficial for chronic pains in the kidneys and uterus and bladder; and brings on the menses. It also serves for pustules and boils; and takes the place of venesection of the saphenous veins and the heel-veins.	0.81330615
However, it greatly weakens the whole body and causes fainting in many people.	But it greatly exhausts the body and causes fainting in most people.	0.9022384
And the benefit of cupping alahorcoben is similar to the benefit of cupping both legs.	The advantage of cupping of the heel-veins is much the same as that of the legs.	0.61659884
And the quality of the position of the cups is that you place the cup at first empty and suck with moderate suction, and do not prolong the position of the cups, but place them lightly, and remove them quickly, so that the humors come to the location evenly. And do not stop repeating this and continue until you see the location redden and swell and the redness of the blood appears.	The way to apply the cupping-vessels: the vessel is first put in position empty; then you suck moderately; do not long hold the cupping-vessel in place, but apply it quickly and remove it quickly so that the humours gather evenly at the place; and go on doing it time after time until the place is seen to redden and to swell, and the redness of blood is manifested.	0.7824737
And then you scarify and repeat the suction little by little, and carefully consider the condition of the bodies.	Then scarify, and repeat the suction very gently; then consider the bodily condition.	0.8612202
For the person with tender flesh and sparse pores, you should scarify once and no more, so that the location does not become ulcerated.	The person who is tender of flesh and porous of skin you should scarify once only, not more, lest the place ulcerate.	0.8861675
And command the cupper to make the scarification larger and a little deeper, and adjust the suction with ease.	Tell him who applies the cupping-vessels to scarify rather widely and deeply, and to control the suction with gentleness and a delicate motion.	0.6586
And if the blood is thick, then scarify twice, because the first time opens the way for thinning the blood and its watery part. But the second time it scrutinizes the acquired extraction of thick blood.	If there be a thickness of the blood he should scarify twice; the first time to make a way out for the thinner blood and serum; and the second time to complete the extraction of the thick blood.	0.7785295
And if the blood is very feculent, then do the scarification a third time to achieve the final result.	If the blood be very turbid let him scarify a third time for completion.	0.7620567
And finally, when we want to extract the blood little by little or just a little, one scarification is enough.	In general, one scarification is enough when we wish to draw a little thick blood; but if we wish to draw much blood we make more scarifications.	0.6752964
And if we want to extract a lot of blood, we scarify with many scarifications; and if we know that the blood is thick, then we should scarify deeply.	If we judge that the blood is thick we should scarify deeply.	0.6682036
And the limit of scarification is just the depth of the skin.	A fair depth for the scarification is the thickness of the skin, and no more.	0.6236081
And if that of which the skin is thick, hard, dark, and its pores are tight, the places for the cups should be smeared with softening, opening, and resolving agents; if it is in summer, such as aloe oil or violet oil, or sweet almond oil, or gourd seed oil; and if it is in winter, then narcissus oil, or lily oil, or chamomile oil, or blood oil, and similar ones.	He whose skin is thick, solid, desiccated, and narrow of pore: the operator should anoint the place with opening and emollient and resolving oils; if it be in the summer season, with, for example, oil of yellow gilliflower or of violets or of sweet almonds or of pumpkin-seeds. If it be in winter, with narcissus oil or oil of lilies or camomile oil, or of jasmine, or the like.	0.8745278
And if the excess is thick and cold, then the oil should be amaranth oil, or balsamite oil, or aloe oil, or dill oil, and similar ones.	And if the superfluity be thick and cold, then with oil of marjoram or oil of wild thyme or oil of ben or oil of dill.	0.72821033
But if the cupping patient has wide pores and tender flesh, then they should avoid oil, and it is advisable that the places for the cups near the cupping are washed with rose water or cold water of nightshade, or gourd water, or purslane water, and similar ones.	If he who is to be cupped has wide-open pores and tender flesh, he should be forbidden oil. After cupping, such people should wash the sites with rose-water or cold water or water of black nightshade or of gourds or of garden purslain, or the like.	0.8260592
And those whose blood is very humid should wash the cups with vinegar, or water of myrtle and sumac and similar ones.	But he whose blood is very humid should wash the sites of his cupping with vinegar or water of myrtle or sumac, and the like.	0.86336744
And those whose excesses are thick should wash the cups with old wine, or water of savory, which is marjoram, or decoction of dill, or chamomile, and similar ones.	He that has thick superfluities should wash the sites of his cupping with old wine or water of purslain or decoction of dill or of camomile or the like.	0.81571734
And it is advisable that cupping be done before bathing; beforehand it should be administered near the bath for one or two hours, and it is advisable to sleep near the cupping.	One should beware of cupping in the bath or just after the bath, but should use the vessels one or two hours after leaving the bath. And no one should sleep after cupping.	0.7457512
What is it that needs to be regulated for cupping or bloodletting before cupping.	The correct procedure to be observed before and after cupping by him who is to be cupped or venesected.	0.62854934
You should consider at the beginning: if the cupping patient or the one who should be bloodletted is choleric and full of acute blood and inflammation, then they should take cooling agents, such as sour pomegranates, and endives with vinegar, and lettuce, and chicory, and julep, and similar ones.	It is necessary for you first to consider, and if he that is to be cupped or venesected be bilious, and bitterness and inflammation prevail in his blood, he should take cooling things such as pomegranates and endive with vinegar and lettuce and oxymel and julep, and the like.	0.8054193
And give them foods such as chickens, and game bird meats, and foods prepared with sour agents, and similar ones.	His diet should be chicken and mutton made into stews with vinegar, and soups with verjuice, and the like.	0.5859485
And for those whose complexion is cold, they should drink syrup of honey, or syrup of chicory seeds, and sumac, and very fragrant wine mixed between old and new; and it is recommended that they use little to drink and eat, and give them foods such as chickens, and partridges, and pigeons, and small birds.	The man of frigid constitution should drink syrup of honey or syrup of quince or spiced oxymel; he should also take perfumed raisin wine, not too old and not too new; he should be bidden to be moderate in eating and should make his diet young pullets and larks and sparrows and young pigeons in white stews.	0.7522794
And it is advisable that on the day of cupping and bloodletting the drink is more than the food.	And on the day of cupping and venesection he should drink rather than eat.	0.70402324
And it is advisable to give at some hours to some people to drink theriac alpharac, or musk medicines, that is nutmeg, or alcelite before cupping or before bloodletting or nearby, so that the principal members are strengthened and the blood is thinned; and they should not take it heated.	It may sometimes be necessary to have some people drink the great theriac or musk-medicine or shllitha before cupping and before or after venesection, to strengthen the chief parts and to render the blood thin; but these draughts should not be given to the feverish.	0.7645294
But the cups without scarification are placed on the liver, and on the spleen and gout, and on the navel, on the knee joints, and the hip, because these members do not tolerate scarification on themselves.	Cupping without scarification is the cupping practised on the liver, the spleen, the breasts, the belly, the umbilicus, the region of the kidneys and the acetabulum of the femur; for these parts do not tolerate scarification.	0.6646881
And it is not intended for those except to attract blood from the member, as we place a cup on the breast in the disease of blood flow from the nose; and we use it to dissolve cold viscosity of the member, as we place it on the belly and navel; because it thins the member and warms it and removes the pain because it resolves wind.	Now the purpose of the vessels is either to draw blood from one part to another, as when we apply cups over the breasts in the case of nose-bleed; or to loosen from the part a frigid vapour that has become fixed in it, as when we place cupping-vessels on the abdomen and umbilicus; for they stimulate the part and warm it and remove the pain because they loosen the vapour.	0.8267424
And it is placed on the kidneys when obstruction or pus occurs in them, because by the virtue of strong attraction it quickly opens the obstruction and eradicates the pus from its place.	Sometimes they are applied over the kidneys when there is an obstruction or stones in them; for often, by virtue of their drawing, the obstruction is opened up or the stones are dislodged from their site.	0.7204488
And similarly it acts when placed on the liver and spleen against wind enclosed in them.	They act in the same way when they are applied over the liver and the spleen when flatus is permeating them.	0.7067777
And these cups are administered empty with suction only; and sometimes they are administered with fire.	These cupping-vessels may be used empty with suction only; or they may be used with fire.	0.7425946
And sometimes they are administered filled with warm water in diseases of the spleen.	Sometimes in pleuritic complaints they are applied filled with tepid water.	0.7125447
And this is so that the cup is filled and is larger, that is hot water alone or water in which herbs suitable for this are cooked.	This is done by filling the vessel, which should be large, with plain hot water, or with hot water in which suitable herbs have been boiled.	0.76425004
The form of the cup administered with fire: let the opening be two fingers wide, as we have formed it; and the depth be half a palm; and let it be on the side of it, in the place that is in the circuit, half of it, the hole be small as the amount that a needle can enter.	This is the figure of the cupping-vessel for use with fire. Its mouth should be the width of two opened fingers, as we have illustrated; the depth should be half a span; and in the side about halfway down there should be a small hole of a size to admit a needle.	0.84261215
Let it be made of red brass or citrus, with thick edges, smooth, equal, and clean so that it does not harm the member upon its position on it.	It should be made of Chinese bronze or of brass. The edge should be thick, smooth, even, and polished, so as not to injure the part to which it is applied.	0.75880474
And let it be in the middle of it a transverse rod of brass or iron, on which a candle with fire is placed.	And in the middle there should be a transverse rod of bronze or iron to carry the lighted lamp.	0.80833125
And let this cup be much larger than the one we have mentioned; and a little smaller than that according to the diseases and the age of the one who uses it.	You may make this kind of cupping-vessel in a large size, larger than we have described; and in a small size too, to suit various ailments and the age of the user.	0.6999365
And the cups for children and the exhausted are different from the cups for the young and robust bodies.	For the cupping-vessels for boys and thin persons differ from those for men and stout persons.	0.72874784
And the quality of placing this cup with fire on the member is that it stretches the wick with the fire of decent wood in front of a little wax candle, and place it on the middle of the transverse rod in the middle of the cup, so that the fire is lit around the lower part so that the body of the patient is not burned.	Now this is the manner of applying this cupping-vessel with fire to a part of the body. You set light to a strongly twisted wick of linen or a small wax candle, and you set it on the middle of the cross-piece in the middle of the vessel so that the flame be directed toward the lower part of the cupping vessel and not burn the patient's body.	0.7736565
And then place it on the member of the patient, and the finger be on the hole that we mentioned, until when we hold the cups and do not need to hold the finger and let the steam out through that hole, then the cup will soon be released.	Then the vessel should be placed on the part with the finger kept over the above-mentioned hole; then when we have held the vessel sufficiently long there the finger is taken away, the vapour will come out through the hole, and the vessel will become loosened at once.	0.77306485
And ignite the wick properly, and repeat it if necessary.	Then light the wick as prescribed and repeat if necessary.	0.7870338
But in a cup that is administered in the disease of pleurisy, with water, in which there is no transverse rod nor hole, and it is administered only by being filled with water, and it is placed on the member only.	But the cupping-vessel that is used in pleurisy, with water, has no cross-piece nor hole; it is used by simply filling with water and applying to the part.	0.813445
And this is its form: And this cup, the larger it is, the better, so that it can receive a large amount of water.	This is the figure of it. Now the larger this cupping-vessel is, to hold much water, the better.	0.7080614
Chapter 97.	CHAPTER NINETY-SEVEN.	0.5317708
Leeches are not applied to many parts except to parts where it is not possible to place cups, due to the small size of those parts, such as the feet and gums and similar to them; or on parts devoid of flesh, such as the finger and the nose and similar to them.	Leeches are mostly used on those parts of the body to which application of cupping-vessels is impossible, either because of their smallness, such as the lips, the gums, and so on; or because the part is bare of flesh, like the finger, the nose, and so on.	0.8489143
And the quality of using those is that you have found leeches in clean freshwater ponds.	This is the way to use them: you seek some leeches that are in fresh water free of dirt.	0.601466
And then they should be left for a day and a night in fresh water until they are hungry, and no substance remains in their stomachs; and then the body should be evacuated at the beginning with bloodletting and cupping; and then rub the patient's part until it reddens; and then place them on it.	Then you leave them in fresh water for a day and a night until they are hungry and nothing is left in their bellies; then you purge the patient's body, either by venesection or by the application of cupping vessels; then you scrub the afflicted part until it is flushed; and then place the leeches on it.	0.8881762
And when they are filled and fall off.	When they are full they will fall off.	0.77108645
And if it is possible to suction the place with a cup, it is more beneficial afterwards.	If it is possible to make suction with a cupping vessel, the effect will be greater.	0.6517423
And if not, then wash the place with vinegar and then with plenty of water; and it should be rubbed and squeezed.	But if not, wash the part with vinegar followed by much water; then rub and put pressure on it.	0.79512084
And if the blood continues to flow after the leeches fall off, and this happens, then soak a linen cloth in cold water, and place it over it until the bleeding stops.	If the blood continues to run after the leeches have fallen off, and becomes an ooze, let linen dressings be wetted with cold water and apply them over the place until the oozing stops.	0.86864465
And if the blood is abundant, then sprinkle over it crushed vitriol, or galls and similar astringents, until the blood stops; or place on the site halves of cooked beans, and leave them until the beans adhere to the site, and the blood stops.	But if the bleeding be serious then sprinkle upon the place powdered vitriol or gall or similar styptics, until the haemorrhage is stopped. Or let split shelled beans be applied to the place and left until they stick there, and then the bleeding will stop.	0.83678716
And if necessary, repeat the application of leeches, as often as you can replace them.	If it is necessary to repeat the application, the same leech should not be applied but another one if you possibly can.	0.6947289
And if leeches are prohibited from being suspended, then rub the site with fresh blood or insert a needle into the sites until blood comes out; and then place them, because when they sense any blood, they will attach immediately.	If the leeches fail to stick on, the place should be wiped over with fresh blood or pricked with a needle to bring out a little blood; then apply them, for if they smell any blood they will immediately adhere.	0.85818315
And when you want them to fall off, sprinkle a little crushed aloe, or salt, or ash on them, and they will fall off immediately.	When you wish to remove them, sprinkle over them a little powdered aloes or salt or ashes, then they will at once fall away.	0.8677943
Thus begins the prologue of the third part: on restoration. This chapter is often necessary in the art of medicine; it is the restoration of fracture and dislocation incidents in the bones.	This third part of the book, too, is an essential necessity in the practice of medicine; it concerns the setting of the fracture or dislocation occurring in bones.	0.7501532
Oh, son, know that foolish doctors and laypeople boast of this chapter and those who have never regarded the books of the Ancients nor read a single letter of them.	You should know, my sons, that ignorant practitioners and laymen and those who have never turned the pages of a single book of the Ancients about it, nor studied a single letter of it, arrogate this part of the art to themselves.	0.820457
And for this reason, this manner of the learned in our land is private; and I have not forgotten this at any time; and I have not adopted this except through long study of the books of the Ancients and study on the understanding of them, until I extracted the knowledge from them.	For this reason this section of the science has died out in our parts; I have myself found no one competent in it; and whatever skill I have, I have derived for myself by my long reading of the books of the Ancients and my thirst to understand them until I extracted the knowledge of it from them.	0.75039357
And then I applied it to experiment and study throughout my life.	Then through the whole of my life I have adhered to experience and practice.	0.8409373
And I have already described in this chapter all that my knowledge contains and on which my experiment is based; as I have abbreviated this for you and freed it from lengthy occupation; and I have abbreviated this to the end of abbreviation; and I have shown this at the end of clarification; and I have formed in this many forms of the instruments that are administered in it, as it is done by adding clarification, as I have done in the previous two chapters.	So now I have described for you in this book all that my knowledge has encompassed on the subject and that my experience has encountered; I have made it accessible for you and rescued it from the abyss of prolixity; I have reduced it to a brief outline; and have explained it most clearly. I have made for you many drawings of the instruments that are used in it, which is an adjunct to explanation, as I did in the two previous books.	0.8751467
First chapter.	CHAPTER ONE.	0.7659606
Summaries and collections of the nature of bone fractures, from those whose preface is necessary, before we begin the recollection of broken members and the diversity of each. Therefore, we must state in the preface of this chapter the summaries of the discourse; and the chapters to the understanding of which at the beginning the practitioners are forced and to dwell on the truth of them; that is, you and those who are eager to know or learn this noble art among you.	In which is given the necessary compendious preliminary information on fractures. Before we begin to speak of the fractures and dislocations of individual members we must, as an introduction to this book, give the general and particular information which compels your understanding and your being versed in it; both you and anyone else beside who is eager to learn this noble art.	0.82474816
And thus I say that when a fracture or dislocation or twisting or falling occurs, then you must hasten at the beginning with bloodletting or alleviating that, or both together, if no cause prohibits it, such as weakness of strength, or if it happens to a child, or an old person in decrepitude, or if it is a time of intense heat, or intense cold.	So I say that when anyone has sustained a fracture or dislocation or luxation or fall, you should first hasten to venesect him, or get his bowel open, or both, if there be nothing to hinder such as physical weakness, or unless it be a small boy or a very old man to whom an accident of this kind has happened; or unless the weather be excessively hot or cold.	0.8403596
And then be content with a diet of fresh herbs and meat of birds and goats; and prohibit heavy meats and filling oneself with food and any food that fills the veins with blood, until you are assured of preventing abscess, and if you do not fear the effusion of material to the part.	Next, let his diet be restricted to cold vegetables and the flesh of fowl and kids; he is to be forbidden wine and rich meat and gluttony and all foods that fill out the blood-vessels, until you are sure that there is no abscess and see no reason to suspect a flux of matter to the place.	0.81882393
And then return the patient to their previous regimen with which they are accustomed.	Then let the patient return to his former diet according to his custom.	0.8654464
And thus when the broken bone begins to be restored, then the patient must be fed with nourishing food of substantial and heavy nutrition in which there is viscosity, such as foods made of wheat cooked with water, and rice, and heads, and feet, and bellies of cows, and eggs, and fresh fish, and thick wine and similar to them, and with this regimen, the coagulation of the fracture is made more easily and better.	When the broken bone has begun to mend, the patient should be nourished with very nourishing food, fat, strong, having some glutinous property, such as porridge, rice, heads, trotters, the tripe of cows, eggs, fresh fish, heavy wine, and the like; for on this diet the mending of the fracture will be quicker and better.	0.8595455
And know that broken bones in people who are in their prime and in the decrepit, it is not possible for them to be continued and consolidated according to their nature due to the dryness of their parts.	You should know that fractures occurring in mature and old people cannot join and mend into the original condition, on account of the dryness and hardness of their bones; though any bones that are extremely soft, like those of infants, may make a union and heal.	0.70054185
But still nature joins and amends over the broken bone from all parts some substance similar to glue in which there is thickness that adheres and tightens it until they are glued together and bound together, until they come to the end of strength and firmness, just like fire at the beginning, until no cause prohibits it from its work.	Yet nature produces around the bone on all sides something like glue, with a certain viscosity, with whose help it joins, and it binds so that one part adheres to the other and they are linked to one another until it be good and firm as it had been before; so that there is no impediment to any of its functions.	0.82767797
And for this reason, it is necessary to provide the patient with food, food in which there is gravity and viscosity and thickness, as we have said.	It is on this account that the patient's food should be the sort that has solidity and glueyness and thickness, as we have said.	0.846129
And know that the types of fracture are diverse according to the diversity of the parts, for a fracture of the leg bone is different from a fracture of the head bone; and a fracture of the chest bone is different from a fracture of the back bone; and similarly, all other parts are different among them.	You should know that there are as many different types of fracture as there are members. Thus a fracture of the leg bone differs from a fracture of the cranium; and a fracture of the breast bone differs from a fracture of the bone of the back; and similarly there are differences among the other parts.	0.8965715
And I come with the recollection of every type of fracture, explained in its chapter distinct from the other.	We shall give an exposition of each kind of fracture, each in its own chapter and distinguished from the others.	0.7548398
Great diversity of fracture in itself. And the types of fracture of the bone are diversified in themselves; for there is an arched fracture different from what occurs in stars; and sometimes there is a fracture along the length of the bone: and these are fractures of splinters and splinters and protruding and non-protruding additions, just as is done in the pen when it is prepared for writing, and there is a fracture with a wound and disruption in the head, and there is a small fissure fracture.	The fracture of each bone also has its own variations; for the fracture may be a clean break without splintering; or the fracture may be along the bone, with splinters and projections which may be sharp or may not; and the fracture may involve a wound and a laceration of the skin; and the fracture may be a crack.	0.7249272
And for each type, there is its own method or instrument in the restoration of it as will be remembered distinctly in its places.	Each kind has its own special technique of setting which will be mentioned in detail, each in its place.	0.6854351
Great signs of bone fracture. And by this is a bone fracture known: it is the tortuosity of it, and its prominence and appearance to the touch, and it is that when you compress it with your hand.	Among the diagnostic signs of a broken bone are: distortion, protrusion, the aspect of it, and the crepitus when you press on it with the hand.	0.62077767
And thus when there is no apparent tortuosity in the place and it is not done by your touch when you touch the bone with movement and the patient does not find great pain, then there is no fracture here.	When there is no obvious distortion or crepitus at the site, nor do you feel movement when you manipulate the bone, and the patient does not experience severe pain, there is no fracture there.	0.8156605
However, it is possible that there is tortuosity or a small fissure, then you must not harm it with your hand and with complete compression; then apply to it the medicines which will be remembered at the appropriate moment for the place; and then it should be tightened with a subtle constriction.	But it is possible that there is a luxation or a slight fracture or a little crack; so you must not disturb it with any extension or pressure, but apply one of the remedies suitable to the site, such as will be described later; then bind up gently.	0.795283
And know that the place when it is arched and not split in two or different from what does not happen in splinters, as every part of its counterpart is kept, then you must begin immediately to rectify it before it gets a hot abscess.	If the bone is parted and broken in two and there is no fragmentation but a simple separation of one part from its fellow, then you should lose no time in straightening and aligning it before an abscess sets in.	0.6272385
And if it gets a hot abscess, then leave it for a few days until the abscess ceases; and then straighten it in every way you can with lightness and skill.	If an abscess does set in, then let a few days pass until it has subsided; then gently and skilfully straighten it in whatever way you can.	0.8197495
And know that the restoration of it and the healing of it is easier than that of the bone in which splinters occur.	You should know that the setting or alignment of this is easier than that of a splintered bone.	0.6661906
And then tighten it according to the remembrance of it.	Then bandage as will be prescribed.	0.5707195
But if there are splinters in the bone, then extension of the broken part from two sides is necessary, if it is the hand or the foot; or with your hand if the part is small; or with two ropes or with one rope and the hand.	But if the bone is splintered, extension from either side is necessary, whether it be hand or foot; with your own hands if it be a small member, or with two ropes or with one hand and a rope.	0.9525142
And be your position with which you place the part equal according to its natural shape, while the parts of the broken part are extended, then you must return those additions with skill and in every way you can in their places.	You should place the part on a flat surface in its natural attitude so that when both parts of the broken bone have been extended you can try to restore the fragments to their proper place with all the skill and gentleness possible; and do your utmost to ensure that the patient experience no pain or distress as you operate.	0.7050086
And guard yourself according to your strength that no pain or injury happens to the patient by your operation; and force yourself according to your ability to apply one bone with the other its companion according to their best forms.	Try diligently to get one part of the bone fitted in the best form to the other.	0.49725378
And it is necessary that at that time you skillfully touch it with your hand, and if you see any deviation, correct and align it according to your ability.	At the same time you should palpate and investigate both of them with your hand, and if you find anything wrong then mend it and straighten it to the best of your ability.	0.7139936
And strongly avoid excessive extension and compression, as many foolish doctors often cause a hot abscess by their operation, or cause contraction in the part, as we have seen happen many times by their operations.	But avoid violent extension or compression which many ignorant people apply; for by doing so they often cause abscess or crippling in the limb, as I myself have many times seen.	0.7656961
And the quality of the constriction of the broken part is what I recount; so you know that broken parts are diverse in their smallness, greatness, and shape.	As to the way to bandage a broken limb, it is as I shall now describe to you. You should know that limbs which may be fractured vary in their size and shape.	0.6756841
And for those that are small like the arm and the finger and the joint and similar to them, then the wrapping must be of very fine cloth.	The strips of bandage for those that are small, such as an arm or finger or forearm or the like, should be soft and fine, while those that are thick, such as the hip, back, or breast, should have broad and strong bandages.	0.6885046
But for those that are large like the thigh or the leg, they must be wrapped with broad and hard material, because the broad binding connects the large part and tightens it equally from all sides, so that no blemish enters.	For a broad bandage holds fast to a big limb, binding it all round with an even pressure so that no defect may occur.	0.6476277
And then begin, with your equable evacuation, to place a suitable binding on the site of the fracture with three or four wrappings as the part requires; and tighten your hand a little with the binding.	Then, after you have finished the setting, begin by applying a suitable liniment on soft tow over the site of the fracture, then start to wrap the bandage over the actual site, three or four turns of bandage as the part may require, winding it fairly tight.	0.80987865
And then go with that to the upper part of the fracture site, and tighten less than the constriction with which you tightened the fracture site. And then extend the wrapping of the fracture site a little, and gradually loosen the constriction, until you take a large part from the site.	Then carry on the bandage above the site of the fracture, winding it more loosely than on the fractured place, and continue a little with the bandaging beyond the place of fracture, loosening the tension gradually, until you have taken up a good amount of the sound part.	0.83038414
And then take another bandage and wrap it again over the broken site with wrapping, and then go with the wrappings to the lower part of the fracture; and let your operation be in the constriction of the wrapping and in the loosening of it as we have said in the first wrapping above.	Then take another bandage and wind it several turns over the fracture and then carry it over the part below the fracture, the tightness and looseness being arranged in the same way that we prescribed for the first covering, of the upper part.	0.8141078
And then place between the wrappings flax tow or cloth with which the tortuosity of the fracture is equalized, if there is tortuosity; and if not, place nothing there.	Then put between the bandages enough soft tow or soft rags to correct the curves of the fracture, if any; otherwise put nothing in.	0.7764081
And then place another bandage over it, and then properly align splints over these wrappings immediately, if there is no swelling or hot abscess at the site, and then place over it what soothes the abscess and removes the swelling; and leave that for a few days; and then you tighten the splints over it.	Then wind over it another bandage and at once lay over it strong splints, if the part be not swollen and effused. But if there be swelling or effusion in the part, apply something to allay the swelling and disperse the effusion; leave it on for several days and then bind on the splints.	0.8640179
And let the splints be made of half a broad split reed, and well shaped wisely; or they be of pine wood; or of palm branches; and let the width of each splint be according to this shape and figure:	The splints should be made of broad halves of cane, cut and shaped with skill; or the splints may be made of the wood used for sieves, which are made of pine; or of palm branches; or of brier or giant fennel or the like, whatever wood be at hand.	0.7809778
However, the splint placed over the fracture must be thicker and broader than the other splints, and the length of the splint according to what is suitable to the part in size and smallness; and then tighten over the splints with another bandage according to your initial constriction; and then bind it decently with thread according to what we have said about constriction, and it is that your constriction be according to the site of the fracture mostly, and the further from the fracture, the lesser the constriction.	Then bind over the splints another bandage just as tightly as you did your first; then over that tie it up with cords arranged in the way we have said, that is, with the pressure greatest over the site of the fracture and lessened as you move away from it.	0.7036494
And the threads must be moderate in thickness and subtlety, and be of soft linen; and if the threads are thick, as I have seen by the operation of some foolish ones placing their threads of twisted linen rope, and it is a great error, because the constriction would be uneven.	The cords should be of medium thickness, of linen supple of quality. For if the cords are too thick, such as I have seen ignorant people use who made their cords of twisted bands of linen, that will be a grave error, for moderate tension with these is impossible.	0.836767
And likewise thin threads are not suitable, because you will not achieve with them the constriction that you want, and there must not be less than a finger's width between splint and splint.	Nor are fine threads suitable either, for with these you cannot achieve sufficient tension. Between splints there should be a space of not less than a finger's breadth.	0.82724905
And if the patient is hurt by the ends of the splints near the constriction in their places, then place flax tow or combed wool under them so that it does not cause injury.	If, after bandaging, the patient is hurt in the sound parts by the ends of the splints, then put a little soft tow or carded wool under them until they no longer hurt him thus.	0.76998323
Sometimes a fracture is with a wound, and there is disruption in the skin, and I will remember this in the chapter on special cases.	As for the case of a fracture accompanied by an open wound, it will be mentioned in a special section on its own.	0.5770548
And know that not every broken part is constrained with splints on the first day; the reason is that when the part is large, you must not place splints on it for about five or seven days or more, according to your certainty of the coming of a hot abscess.	You should know that not every fracture should be bound up with splints on the first day; that is, when the part is big you should not apply splints until five or seven days after, or more, depending on when you are satisfied that there is no effusion.	0.878865
And this is the way of the poultices with which the Ancients restored, which are placed over fractures, dislocations, and twists.	This is a description of the plasters that the Ancients used for repair, applied to a fracture, dislocation, or sprain.	0.6545347
Way of common poultice for the quick restoration of fracture, suitable for many complexions and mostly for women and children, because it is of that upon which neither heat nor cold prevails: and it is that you take mill dust, which is the fine part of the flour that hangs near the movement of the millstone on the walls of the mill.	Description of a common simple plaster for the repair of fractures, suited to most constitutions, particularly for women and children, because in it there predominates neither hot nor cold. Take mill-dust, that is, the fine flour that sticks to the walls of a mill as the grindstone moves.	0.8011042
And make it as it is, but sift it with egg white, and prepare the mixture not too thick nor too thin; and then use it.	Pound it as it is without sieving, with egg-white, to a medium consistency; then use.	0.6522998
Another method of a poultice for restoring fractures, dislocations, and twists: take asafetida, labdanum, acacia, elecampane, and migrach, which is the root of wild pomegranate, each 10 drams; myrrh and aloes, each 5 drams; alochil 20 drams; all should be ground and sifted and mixed with aloe water or egg white if the patient's complexion is warm; and then use this poultice, because it is well-composed and easily restores broken bones, and is suitable for many people.	Description of another plaster for the repair of a fracture, luxation, or dislocation: take ten drachms each of pulse, gum-mastic, acacia, elecampane, mughath, and sukk; five drachms each of myrrh and aloes; twenty drachms of tamarisk and twenty drachms of clay of Armenia or Asia Minor; all should be pounded fine and mixed with water of tamarisk, or with eggwhite if the patient be of a warm constitution; then use this plaster, which is excellent for uniting, quickly repairing broken bones, and suits most people because of its mildness.	0.8261077
Another method of poultice which helps with fractures and twists: take migrach and marshmallow root each 10 drams; myrrh and aloes each 5 drams; acacia 6 drams; Armenian bole 20 drams.	Description of another plaster valuable for a fracture or sprain: let there be taken ten drachms each of mughath, pulse, and white marsh mallows, five drachms each of myrrh and aloes, six drachms of acacia, and twenty drachms of Armenian clay.	0.7068877
All should be ground in a mortar until well crushed, sifted, mixed with water or egg white, and then applied.	Let them all be well beaten up and passed through a sieve and made into a paste with water or egg-white and used.	0.7482219
Method of poultice for joints and bones separated from their places, to relieve pain in them and for fissures and fractures: take dirty wool, submerge it in sour wine and boiled oil, and place it on the affected area.	Description of a plaster for dislocated joints or bones, soothing the accompanying pain, and for a crack or fissure of bone: let unwashed wool be taken and soaked in a decoction of oil and vinegar and applied to the place.	0.7976398
But in this poultice there is no restorative virtue, it does not treat abscesses and properly expels pains.	Now this plaster has no power of repair but it is outstanding for reducing effusion and dispersing pain.	0.65256476
Another method of poultice that restores broken bones: take leaves of a wild fig tree and leaves of wild poppy; grind them all and make a poultice from them.	Description of another plaster for the repair of a broken bone: let there be taken the leaves of the hard fig and of the wild poppy and both be beaten up together and a plaster made of them while still fresh and damp.	0.7270265
Method of a quick poultice administered for the restoration of bone fractures and when you want resolution of remaining abscess: take roots of marshmallow, chamomile and violet flowers, flour of vetch, each part equal; all should be ground and cooked with wine, if the limb is not warm.	Description of another simple plaster used when a fracture is mending and you wish to disperse residual swellings: take one part each of marsh mallow root, chamomile, violet flowers, and flour of vetch; pound it all and make a paste with decoction of wine, if the part be not inflamed.	0.84186983
But if it is warm, then make it with water from wet coriander or water and use it.	But if it be inflamed make it up with water of fresh coriander or plain water, and use.	0.87630504
Another method of a stronger poultice for resolution than the first one, when a hard abscess occurs during the restoration of the limb: take roots of marshmallow and linseed, and pomegranate peel, sweet clover, marjoram, violet flowers, chamomile, each part equal; all should be ground and cooked with willow water or sweet water or wine, all according to the quality of the limb and the rest of its color.	Description of another plaster stronger than the former for resolving, used if a hard swelling arises as the bone sets: let there be taken equal parts of each of marsh mallow roots, linseed, fenugreek, melilot, sweet marjoram, violet flowers, and chamomile; they should all be beaten up together and made into a paste with willow infusion or sweet water or wine, according to whether the part is inflamed or its heat has subsided.	0.84789574
But Hippocrates did not say in his book that anything should be placed on the broken limb during its restoration except for a cerate made of wax and oil and nothing else; and he recommended that it be of medium thickness and consistency.	Now Hippocrates in his book did not mention any application for the repair of a fractured part except a wax plaster made of wax and oil, nothing else. He prescribed that it be of a consistency midway between thick and thin.	0.86269486
But in Gaul it has been seen that substances with drying properties and a little warmth, like myrrh, incense, and similar things we have mentioned, are placed on the broken limb during its restoration.	Galen, on the other hand, thought it good to apply to the broken limb, when it is mending, things which have a certain power of drying, with some heat, such as myrrh, aloes, olibanum, and the sort of thing we have mentioned.	0.6977479
Method of a poultice that relieves injury and pain: take breadcrumbs, chickpeas, human hair cuttings or bird feathers, and marshmallow, and salt, equal parts; all should be ground and sifted and cooked, and made into a poultice.	Description of a plaster valuable for debility and pain: let equal parts of each be taken of mughath, chickpease, minced human hair or birds' feathers, marsh mallows and salt; grind it up and pass through a sieve and make into a paste and use as a plaster.	0.84920156
But the quantity according to which the binding should remain and then be loosened is that you consider if no pain or itching occurs and the bone is not broken or out of place, then do not loosen it for many days. And if severe pain or itching or swelling occurs in the area, then immediately loosen it and remove the poultice.	As to the length of time the bandages should remain on before being loosened: you should keep an eye on the patient and if he suffers no pain or itching or any shifting of the broken bone, then they should not be loosened for a number of days; but if he experiences at the place a violent itching or a disturbing pain or swelling, then hasten to loosen them and make no delay; and remove the plaster.	0.779971
And take a linen cloth and a damp sea sponge, submerge it in warm water, and use it to wash the area until the itching stops and the pain subsides; then let the limb rest for an hour; then place dirty wool soaked in sour wine and oil or rose oil on it, and bind it for a night until you are sure there is no abscess, and the swelling of the limb has subsided, and the pain has gone away.	Then you must take a soft cloth or a soft marine sponge and dip it in tepid water and bathe the place until the itching subsides and the pain settles; then let the limb rest for an hour; then apply to it raw wool soaked in oil and vinegar or oil of roses, and bandage it on for one night until you are sure there is no effusion and the swelling of the limb has subsided and the pain has gone.	0.9302805
And then repeat that gentle binding and small poultice and do not tighten it as much as you did at first, and continue until it is healed.	Then put the bandage on again gently, and a light plaster; do not bind it up as you did at the first but go gently with it until it heal.	0.7745311
And if you see that the abscess, redness, pain, and swelling and all symptoms have completely disappeared, and you need a poultice and binding, then repeat it just as you did at the beginning in the same manner.	If you see that the effusion, inflammation, pain, swelling, and other symptoms are totally gone, and you need to plaster and bandage it, then repeat just as you did at first.	0.87882066
And if none of those symptoms occur in the limb, then do not loosen it for three or four or five or seven days; and sometimes all this is left for twenty days according to how it appears to you by the binding of the limb, as we have said, until the fracture adheres and the flesh begins to coagulate over it.	But if none of these things that we have mentioned occur, then do not loosen it until after three, four, or five days or a week; sometimes it may be left up to twenty days, depending on how the limb appears to you, as we said, until the fracture be united and the flesh over it be near to joining.	0.88889515
And then adjust the binding more than your initial binding, and adjust the patient's diet, as previously mentioned.	Then bandage more tightly than before, and increase the heaviness of the patient's food as has been mentioned.	0.81770015
But if you see that the fracture site is drying and thinning more than it should, then know that nourishment is not reaching it; and then wash it with warm water every time you loosen it; and do this every three days; and slightly loosen the binding, and through this operation, nourishment will flow to the limb, and it will heal more easily.	If you see the place of the fracture getting more dry and thin than it should, you may know that nourishment is being prevented from reaching it; so foment it with tepid water each time you loosen it; do this every three days, and ease the bandaging somewhat. This action makes nourishment flow to the limb and it will quickly heal.	0.9126894
But what foolish bone-setters do when the fracture is not set properly from the beginning, and it heals crookedly, is a mistake according to their operation, and a great fear, and if it were correct, the Ancients would have mentioned it in their books and worked with it.	What some ignorant bone-setters do is to break the bone again if at first the repair is not as it should be and has mended crookedly. This operation of theirs is mistaken and dangerous; if it were right the Ancients would undoubtedly have spoken of it in their books and would have used it.	0.77917325
And I have not seen any of them do this, which is why it is more reasonable not to do it.	But I have not found a trace of it in a single one of them; and the right course is not to use it.	0.5608543
Chapter Two: On Fracture When It Occurs in the Head.	CHAPTER TWO. On a fracture occurring in the head.	0.83576405
The types of fractures are many, and their shapes are diverse, and the causes are distinct. Some fractures are caused by a blow from a sword, and the impact breaks the bone all the way to the membrane beneath it, like cutting into wood. This type is called 'ascial.' Or the sword cuts part of the bone and the flesh but does not go all the way through. This type of fracture is called 'levatio absoluta.'	The kinds of fracture occurring in the head are many, of various forms and differing causes. Some fractures are due to a sword-stroke which may cut right through the bone and reach the membrane beneath the bone, like an adze-cut in wood, for which reason this kind of cut is called 'ascial'. Or the sword may cut through part of the bone, only slicing through the surface and not reaching the depth; this kind is called an absolute avulsion.	0.901685
And the wound from these two fractures can be large or small. There are also fractures caused by crushing or grinding, from a blow with a rock or a fall onto a stone, and similar causes.	The wounds in these two fractures can be either big or small. There are also some fractures accompanied by smashing or crushing; such as by a blow from a stone or by falling on a stone, and the like.	0.9008368
And this fracture can either penetrate deeply, approaching the membrane beneath the bone, or it can be on the surface of the bone, and the wound from these two types of fractures can be large or small.	A fracture of this kind will be either penetrating, reaching the membrane beneath the bone; or superficial; the wound in these two fractures may be either big or small.	0.87401515
And there is a type of fracture that is hidden within the bone, as thin as a hair, and thus this type is called a 'capillary fracture.'	Then there is a type of fracture that is hidden in the bone, as fine as a hair, a thin crack; therefore this kind of fracture is called 'capillary'.	0.9437746
And there is a fracture caused by a fall or a blow with a stone and similar impacts, which causes a piece of bone to press inward, creating a concavity as happens when a bronze pot is struck and its surface is pushed inward.	There is a fracture due to a fall or a blow from a stone and the like, making a dent in the surface of the bone and a hollow at the site as occurs in a bronze bowl when a blow falls on it and a portion of it is pushed in.	0.8493928
This happens mostly in soft bones, like the heads of children.	This mostly occurs in heads whose bones are soft, as those of children.	0.9513547
All these types of fractures create fragments, like pieces separated into stars. I will return to explain all this in its proper place.	Any of these kinds of fracture may also have splinters, jagged or otherwise; we shall deal with the treatment of all these in their place.	0.50953823
We identify all these types of fractures by examining them and probing them with tools and observing any decayed flesh over them.	All these kinds of fracture are diagnosed by laying them bare and investigating them with probes and removing all the lacerated tissues over them.	0.81862736
A capillary fracture is identified by cleaning and rubbing the bone with a probe, making the fracture appear black.	The 'capillary' kind is diagnosed by laying bare the bone, wiping it clean, and rubbing ink on it, when the fracture will appear black.	0.7401559
But in the treatment of fractures, first consider the symptoms of the patient. If you see symptoms indicating severe distress, such as vomiting bile, convulsions, loss of consciousness, loss of voice, fainting, acute fever, bulging eyes, and redness of the eyes, and similar severe symptoms, there is no doubt the patient will not recover.	As to the treatment of the fracture: begin by paying attention to the patient's symptoms. If you observe any symptom clearly indicating something dangerous, such as bilious vomit, convulsion, mental derangement, loss of voice, fainting, high fever, protrusion and inflammation of the eyes, and similar symptoms, then leave the patient alone and do not treat him; for in the majority of cases these symptoms undoubtedly indicate the approach of death.	0.8232212
If you see no severe symptoms, you can hope for recovery and start the treatment.	But if you find symptoms that do not alarm you and you see hope of recovery for him, then begin treatment as follows.	0.7416924
The reason is that if the injured person comes to you in the early stages of the injury, and it is winter, you should examine the bone by the fourteenth day according to all conditions.	If he be brought to you immediately after his injury and it be the season of winter, you should try to remove the bone, at all events before the fourteenth day.	0.7611717
If it is summer, you should hurry to remove the bone before the seventh day, before what is beneath the bone is corrupted by the membrane, and before the symptoms we mentioned occur.	If it be summer you must hasten to remove the bone before the seventh day, before the covering membrane beneath the bone and over the brain be infected, and before the above-mentioned symptoms occur.	0.91688746
If the fracture has reached the membrane covering the brain and has small fragments and abrasions, you should cut the crushed and abraded part, as I will explain to you.	If the fracture has already reached the cerebral membrane with fragmentation of the bone and depression, then you must cut out the splintered and broken part as I shall now describe to you.	0.8325492
You should shave the head of the injured patient, expose the bone according to the customary manner and according to the shape of the wound, and do this gently on the patient.	Shave the head of the injured patient and lay the bone bare in any way you can, following the course of the injury and in the manner least grievous to the injured man.	0.7589029
If, after exposing the bone, you encounter blood flow or a hot abscess, you should treat it by filling the area with cloths soaked in wine and rose oil, and let the wound rest until the abscess subsides, and ensure the blood flow is controlled; then start working around the bone and removing it.	If, when you lay the bone bare, you encounter a haemorrhage or abscess, meet the case with suitable remedies; that is, pack the place with dressings soaked in wine and oil of roses, and cleanse the wound until the swelling subsides and you are safe from haemorrhage; then begin the trepanning and removal of the bone.	0.84665823
This should be done according to one of two methods of operation.	This may be done in one of two ways.	0.78949887
One method is to cut the bone with a narrow chisel, and this is its shape: then use another chisel that is a little wider than the first; and this is its shape:	One way is to cut the bone with a fine-bladed chisel, this being the figure of it. Then after this one employ another chisel, a little broader. It is figured here.	0.89019704
Then use a chisel that is wider than the second one.	Then use yet another chisel still broader than the second.	0.93251634
You should have a number of different chisels, some wider than others; some shorter than others, with the tips of their ends sharp, made of Indian iron or steel.	You should have by you a number of different chisels, some broader than others and some shorter than others; their tips should be exquisitely sharp; and they should be made of Indian iron or best steel.	0.95097417
Use them gently, striking the chisel in such a way that it does not shake the head or injure it.	Let the strokes upon the chisel be gentle lest the head be shocked or injured.	0.7052337
If the bone is strong and hard, you should first drill around it before using the chisels with the augers, which are called non-penetrating augers.	If the bone be strong and hard you should, before you use the chisel, make perforations round about it with drills called 'non-sinking' drills.	0.86184305
They are called non-penetrating augers because they do not go through the entire thickness of the skull, as the auger has a rounded tip or margin that prevents it from sinking too deep and passing through the bone.	Their name of non-sinking drills is due to their not piercing the cranial bone through to what is beneath, because the drill has a circular margin beneath its sharp head like a small collar or wheel, that prevents it from sinking in and going beyond the thickness of the bone.	0.7853477
It is advisable to have a large number of these augers, each suited to the thickness of the respective bones, so that you have on hand the right one for each part of the skull, the tip of which should be sharp, and the length and shortness should match the thickness of that part of the skull.	You must obtain a large number of these drills each of which will suit a certain thickness of bone; so that for each skull you have a drill whose pointed extremity is of a length to suit the thickness of that skull.	0.8275896
This is the form of three types of augers: The quality of drilling around the fractured bone is to place the auger on the bone and turn it with your fingers until you know the bone is penetrated; then move the auger to another place, and leave between each hole the amount equal to the thickness of the ray or around that.	Here are figured three kinds of drill, large, medium, and small. As to the manner of perforation round the fractured bone, you apply the drill to the bone and revolve it with your fingers until you know that the bone is pierced, then you transfer the drill to another place, making the distance between the perforations about the thickness of a probe.	0.7477844
Then cut with chisels what is between each hole in the bone, making it as thin as possible to facilitate removal, as we said, until you can extract the bone, either with your hand or with some other tool such as forceps or fine pliers prepared for this purpose.	Then with the chisels cut out the bone between the perforations, using the utmost delicacy, as we have said. Then take out the bone, either with your hand or with some other instrument you have ready for the purpose, such as forceps or fine tongs.	0.872497
Take care that the chisel does not touch any part of the membrane.	You will have to observe the utmost caution that neither drill nor chisel touch any part of the membrane.	0.7669917
Then when you have drilled around the bone and it is separated from the membrane if it was attached to it, and you have extracted it, you should scrape and smooth the rough edges of the bone with another tool similar to a chisel, but it should be thicker and finer than the other chisels.	When you have cut the bone circularly, free from the membrane if adherent to it, and have removed it, then you will have to scrape away and smooth out all the roughness in the remaining bone with another instrument, resembling a chisel, except that it must be finer and slenderer than any of them.	0.87313163
If any small bone fragments remain, remove them carefully with the tools at hand; then treat the wound with ointments and bandages as we have described.	If there are any little bits or spicules of bone left, pick them out with whatever instrument you can, gently; and then treat the wound with dressings and ointments as we shall describe.	0.8618494
The other method of operation is lighter, free from fear, as described by Gualia and praised greatly; his teaching is: you must first uncover the part of the bone where the fracture is most severe and obvious until you have exposed that part and placed beneath it the end of this gentle and precise chisel, which has this shape:	The other way of operating is altogether easy and free from danger; Galen mentioned it and greatly praised it; these are his words: You should begin by laying bare that part of the bone where the fracture is severest and most obvious; when you have done so, place under it the tip of this lenticular chisel figured here.	0.822123
The lenticular part is smooth and does not cut anything, while the sharp part extends on both sides longitudinally, like this; the lenticular part is placed against the membrane, with the sharp face cutting into the bone.	The lenticular part of it should be smooth and not for cutting, the sharp part of it being on both sides longitudinally, as you see; so that the lenticular part is resting upon the meninges while the cutting surface is on the bone.	0.821651
Then, strike the chisel gently with a small mallet until you cut through the bone easily as it is turned, ensuring the membrane is not harmed by any accident you fear, even if the healer was the most foolish and ignorant of men, or even if he was asleep.	Then with a small hammer strike the tool on one side until you gently cut through the bone in a circle, in the confident knowledge that nothing untoward can happen to the membrane even though the operator be the most ignorant and cowardly of men; yes, even if he be sleepy.	0.80261844
If any part is attached to the bone in some places, separate it with the lenticular chisel tip, releasing it easily, without harm or fear.	If any membrane stick to any part of the bone, strip it off with the lenticular tip of the chisel and free it gently from it, for it will come away without harm or danger.	0.8311595
If the fracture does not penetrate the membrane, and what is cut or removed is the bone's surface, leaving rough edges and fine fragments, then you should scrape those rough edges and remove the fragments with fine razors, for which you have prepared various sizes, so you can use the most appropriate one for each place, based on the requirements of your operation on the broken bone and its shape.	If it be a fracture of the bone not reaching to the meninges, only the surface of the bone being separated, and there remain some roughness and fine splinters, you should smooth down the roughness and remove the splinters with fine scrapers, of which you should have a number, of varying sizes so that you can use the one best fitted and most suitable, in the light of what is suggested by your operative method and the broken bone itself and its shape.	0.86141396
You should start with the widest razor and then use the finer one, continuing until you reach the finest and thinnest razor of all.	When you smooth the bone you must first use the broadest of the scrapers and then a finer one, and so on until you come to use the finest and slenderest of all.	0.81747955
But in all other small fractures and subtle fractures, you should treat according to what is needed to correct them.	As to the rest, the little capillary fractures and fine fissures, you will have to apply to each of them that treatment that will bring about a perfect repair.	0.71985316
This is a method known to all who have studied this art. I will stand by what we have written and shown for major fractures.	This is obvious to anyone who has the least practice in this art and is acquainted with what we have written in explanation of the big fractures.	0.7055596
If the membrane is intact when you remove the bone, take a linen cloth according to the size of the wound, soak it in rose oil, and place it over the wound opening; then take another cloth, folded or tripled, soak it in wine and rose oil, and place it over the first cloth, doing this as gently as possible so as not to burden the membrane; then apply a wide bandage, but do not tighten it, only enough to hold the wound.	If the meninges are left bare when you remove the bone, you should take a linen dressing measured to the wound, soak it in oil of roses, and apply it to the opening of the wound; then take another dressing, folded in two or three, soak it in wine and oil of roses and apply it over the first with the utmost gentleness so as not to press upon the meninges; then employ a broad bandage on top, but tighten it only enough to keep the wound covered.	0.8986154
Leave it with this care for a day or two until you are sure there is no pus; then untie it and apply medicines that have drying properties, such as linseed roots and barley flour, and powder of incense and aristolochia, and similar things.	Leave it with this dressing on for a day or two until you are sure there is no abscess; then loosen it and apply desiccant remedies such as lily roots, vetch-flour, powdered frankincense, birthwort, and the like.	0.84487927
Make a powder from these medicines to sprinkle on the wound, as they are dry; generally, apply any medicine that cleanses and does not irritate.	The method is that you make a powder of these drugs and sprinkle it, dry as it is, upon the wound; in short, in these cases use drugs whose nature is cleansing and not irritating.	0.79378855
Ensure according to your ability that the wound remains clean during treatment; do not let it become dirty with ointment or anything else; do not let any virulence accumulate in it; for when it is on the brain membrane, it corrupts it, causing rot, and leads to severe complications for the patient.	In this be most diligent, that the wound, while you are treating it, be clean; nor let there be any dirty vestiges of ointment in it or any filth; and let no pus collect in it; for when pus collects on the meninges it corrupts them and renders them necrotic, which causes great harm to the patient.	0.81858814
This occurs in the head membrane when the bone is cleaned from it, especially when its care is neglected, and it blackens on the surface; then consider if the patient experiences the symptoms we have mentioned, knowing it is harmful beyond doubt.	Sometimes the surface meninges go black when the bone is removed, especially when the treatment of them is neglected; so observe, and if the patient exhibit any of the symptoms that we have mentioned you may know that he is undoubtedly doomed.	0.7832726
If the blackening is not due to the medicine applied on top, and it is the medicine that causes it, then you should take one part honey and three parts rose oil, soak a cloth with them, and place it on the membrane; then treat it with the appropriate healing methods until it is healed.	But if the blackness be due to some medicament applied to it, which has the power to produce blackness of that kind, then you should take one part of honey and three parts of oil of roses, beat them well up together, spread on a cloth and apply it to the membrane; then treat as necessary until cured.	0.8742622
Chapter 3:	CHAPTER THREE.	0.6544272
On the Restoration of the Nose when it is Broken.	On the repair of a broken nose.	0.7157666
Know that the nose is not broken except in the two uppermost parts, or sometimes one of them, because it has two bones, while the lower part is cartilaginous and does not break but may suffer abrasion, twisting, and curvature.	You should know that the only portion of the nose that can break is the upper portion in its entirety or in one of its two parts; for it consists of two bones. The lower portion is cartilaginous and unbreakable; what can happen to it is contusion, twisting, or flattening.	0.8358699
But if one of the two parts is broken, you must insert your little finger into their nose and align the fracture from inside with your index finger and from outside with your thumb until the nose returns to its natural shape. Do this gently and ensure that your operation does not cause the patient pain.	If one of the two (upper) parts be broken you should pass your little finger into the nostril and straighten out the fracture from inside, with your index and thumb outside, until you reduce the nose to its natural shape; do it gently, and take care that you do not cause the patient pain in doing it.	0.8500931
If the fracture is in the uppermost part of the nose and your finger cannot reach it, you must align it with the tip of a small rod.	If the fracture be in the upper part of the nose and your finger does not reach it, it should be evened by means of a probe with some thickness to it.	0.86402595
If the fracture is in two parts, you must do the same for both.	If the break be on both sides, follow the same course.	0.7077473
Try to restore it on the first day of the fracture if possible; if not, then within seven or ten days after ensuring no pus forms.	Haste must be made to set it on the first day if possible; but if not, after the seventh or tenth day when the effusion has subsided.	0.78918815
Insert a piece of linen cloth into the end of the nose if the fracture is in one part, or two tampons if the fracture is in two parts, and make the tampon thick enough to fill the nasal cavity.	Then introduce into the nasal foramen a linen pad, if it be a unilateral fracture, or two pads if it be bilateral; the pads should be thick enough to fill the nasal foramen.	0.80336237
Some ancient restorers say that the tampons should be soaked in vinegar and changed daily, but I have not seen this; rather, the cloth should be soaked in egg white mixed with flour, and left in place until the bone is set and the cartilage hardens.	Certain of the ancient bone-setters suggest that you should soak the pads in butter and change them daily, but I do not think so; you should rather soak them in egg-white made up into a paste with mill-dust; then leave the pads in until the bone is firm and the cartilage hardens.	0.8860509
Sometimes, instead of a tampon, insert goose feather wrapped in linen, especially for more severe nose fractures, ensuring it does not obstruct the patient's breathing.	Sometimes, instead of pads, the stems of goose-quills are introduced into the nose after being wound round with a piece of soft cloth, so as to make a stronger support for the fracture of the nose and not to hinder the patient's breathing.	0.75748456
This is not necessary; if you prefer, use this method, or use tampons.	This is not absolutely necessary; do it if you prefer; or, if you prefer, put in pads.	0.8059963
If an abscess forms, plaster the nose with cerate or cotton soaked in vinegar and rose oil, or with diachylon.	If during your operation an abscess occurs, apply to the nose a wax plaster or cotton wool soaked in vinegar and oil of roses or a little diachylon ointment.	0.79657114
If no abscess forms, apply a plaster externally with sesame flour and incense powder mixed with egg white; then place cotton over it, but do not bind the nose for any reason.	If no abscess occurs you should apply externally a plaster of white flour and frankincense made into a paste with egg-white; then put on top some soft tow, but do not bind up the nose at all.	0.86573076
But if the nose bones are broken with a small fracture or are shattered, you must incise over them, extract them with appropriate instruments; then suture the incision, and treat it with substances that heal and solidify, and with suitable plasters.	If the nasal bones are broken into small pieces or crushed, you should cut down upon them, remove them with a suitable instrument, and then suture the incision and dress with suitable ointments which encourage granulation and scarring.	0.8535198
If a wound forms inside the nose, treat it with tampons and insert lead canulas until it is completely healed.	If there occur an internal wound of the nose, you should dress it with pads and employ leaden tubes until it heals.	0.8072816
Chapter 4:	CHAPTER FOUR.	0.6335811
On the Restoration of the Jaw when it is Broken.	On the repair of a broken lower jaw.	0.6569004
When the lower jaw is broken without a wound, if the fracture is only external and not split into two, and is bent inward, it is easily recognized.	When the lower jaw is broken and it is a fracture without an open wound, examine it.	0.6508383
If the fracture is on the right side, insert your left index finger into the patient’s mouth; similarly, if the fracture is on the left side, insert your right index finger; push the bulge of the fracture inward easily to the outside with your other hand on the outside of the bone; gently align it.	If it is merely an external fracture, not broken in two but sunken inwards, which is easily recognized, you should introduce the index of your left hand into the patient's mouth if it be a right-hand fracture; but your right index if it be a left-sided fracture; and with this, from within, push the concavity of the fracture gently outwards, with the other hand outside, regulating the correction.	0.8386652
If the jaw fracture is already split into two, administer extension of both parts in a straight line until it is possible to align them.	If the break in the jaw be total, into two, traction must be employed, in a straight line on both sides, until it can be set.	0.7865167
If the teeth are dislocated or disrupted, tighten those you hope will stay in place with a thread of gold, silver, or silk; then place cerate over the broken jaw, then place a folded cloth, and over the cloth a large, properly made splint, or a piece of sole the length of the jaw; bind it appropriately so it stays secure.	If any of the teeth be loosened or broken away, bind those that you hope may be preserved with a gold or silver or silken ligature; then put wax upon the fractured mandible, and upon that a doubled dressing, and upon the dressing a large and strong splint or a piece of shoe-sole leather, the length of the jaw; then over that bandage in such wise as you conveniently can and as will conduce to drawing it together so as not to loosen.	0.9048283
Instruct the patient to rest and keep calm, and provide them with liquid food.	Bid the patient hold himself quiet and still, and let his food be soft broths.	0.8256122
If you think the shape has altered in any way, untie it on the third day; then correct the alteration and apply plaster with flour, egg white, or sesame flour, after removing the cerate, and place cotton over the plaster.	If you think there is any change of form at all, hasten to loosen it on the third day; then correct the change and apply a plaster of mill-dust and egg-white, or of white flour, after you have removed the wax from it, applying soft tow over the plaster.	0.8972932
Once the plaster is set and the bone’s position is not altered, leave it in place until it is healed and the fracture is secured, which often happens within three weeks.	So long as the plaster sticks on it and the bone undergoes no change of state, let it be and do not loosen until it heals and the fracture mends, for often a fracture of this kind mends in three weeks.	0.86443126
If another abscess forms, apply the same treatments we mentioned for healing until it is completely healed.	If during that time an effusion occurs, employ those means of allaying this that we have often mentioned, until the swelling subsides.	0.5730049
If the fracture involves a wound, check if a piece of bone is separated or splintered, then delicately remove the splinters with appropriate instruments.	If the fracture be with an open wound, examine it, and if one or more splinters have been detached from the bone, gently remove the pieces of splinter with any suitable instrument.	0.8279504
If the wound opening is narrow, enlarge it with a phlebotomy instrument as needed.	If the opening of the wound be narrow, open it up with a scalpel as much as you need.	0.6976792
After removing the splinters, if nothing remains, suture the wound if it is wide; if not, apply a suitable plaster to heal it until it is fully healed.	When you have removed these pieces, letting no trace of them remain, suture the opening of the wound if it is wide; otherwise apply one of the ointments that are suitable for that purpose and will encourage the growth of flesh over the wound, until it heals.	0.76190764
Chapter 5:	CHAPTER FIVE.	0.6759796
On the Restoration of the Collarbone when it is Broken.	On the repair of a broken collar-bone.	0.7112833
Often the collarbone breaks in front near the muscle, and this fracture happens in one of three ways.	The collar-bone is very often broken from the end of the humerus anteriorly, and the fracture of it may be in one of three ways.	0.76917315
It can either be broken, separated, or split into two parts without splinters; this is easy to restore; or it can involve splinters, making restoration difficult; or it can be with a wound.	It may be broken and separated into two without splintering; this is the easiest to repair. Or else splintering occurs, which is most difficult to repair. Or it is a compound fracture.	0.85061336
In cases without a wound, have two assistants present, one to hold the assistant and the broken collarbone, and the other to extend the neck towards the fracture.	When it is a simple fracture the operation involves having two assistants present; one of them to hold steady the arm adjacent to the fractured clavicle, and the other to stretch the neck in the opposite direction.	0.7886009
Align the fracture with your fingers until it takes the proper shape, without any bulges or concavities.	Then level the fracture with your fingers until it is reduced to its proper form and there is neither prominence nor concavity.	0.8002783
If more extension is needed, place a pad of cloth or wool under the patient's armpit, of appropriate size; extend and elevate the collarbone and compress the pad with your hand until the fracture is properly aligned.	If there is need of still greater extension, place in the armpit of the patient a ball of cloth or wool made to a suitable size; and stretch and lift up the clavicle and squeeze the roll with your hand until the fracture is set in the proper way.	0.9379622
If you cannot pull the collarbone outward because it is pressing against the skin, the patient should lie on their back, and you should place a small cushion under the muscle of the affected side.	If you are unable to draw the extremity of the clavicle outwards on account of its being depressed, the patient will have to lie on his back and there must be put under his shoulder a medium-sized bolster.	0.8167962
The assistant should press the muscle downward until the collarbone is elevated from the skin, then you can correct and align the fracture with your fingers.	The assistant is to press the shoulder down until the depressed collar bone is elevated, and then you can set the fracture and even it out with your fingers.	0.84189856
But if you feel splinters from the collarbone and they are stuck, you must make an incision over it and easily remove the splinters.	If you feel a splinter separated from the clavicle and movable, you must cut down upon the splinter and gently remove it.	0.7397681
If they are stuck in the bone, make an incision with one of the incising instruments you have prepared for this, after placing under the collarbone the instrument that serves the ciphac; it is a wooden or iron instrument shaped like this:	If the splinter sticks to the bone, you must contrive to cut it with one of the chisels you have prepared for that, having first put beneath the clavicle the instrument to protect the membrane; an instrument made of wood or iron, of which this is the figure.	0.7982929
It resembles a spoon with this concavity; its width should match your need, depending on the bone's size or narrowness.	It resembles a spoon but without a hollow. It should be as broad as you need, having regard to the size of the bone, and as long as you can use at operation.	0.67808807
Its length should be suitable for your operation, with two ends, one wide and the other narrow.	As you see, it should be provided with one wide and one narrow extremity.	0.5959079
If the incision made to remove the splinters is wide and you are sure of no pus forming, suture the wound's lips.	If the opening you made when you extracted the splinter of bone be wide and you feel safe against an abscess, suture the edges together.	0.73011404
If the incision is small or you fear pus formation, fill the wound with cloth and powders as needed.	But if the opening be small or you fear an abscess, pack the wound with material and pads proportional to the opening.	0.77798676
If an abscess forms, soak cloth in vinegar, rose oil, and wine, and place it on the wound.	If an abscess occur, soak the dressing with oil of roses and vinegar or wine and apply.	0.83868
Ensure the splint stays in place over the broken bone; check the patient daily, and if the binding loosens or the splint moves, correct and tighten it.	The whole point is that the splint should not slip from over the fracture; so you should examine the patient every day, and whenever the bandage has loosened and you see the splint has shifted, then put it right and tighten the bandage.	0.76624715
When the patient sleeps, place a small pillow under their head to elevate the injured side, lifting the broken collarbone. Alternatively, tie their arm to their neck.	Make the patient sleep lying on his back, and at night when he is asleep place a small bolster under the axilla so as to raise his arm from his side, for with the raising of the humerus the fracture of the clavicle will be elevated. Or bind his arm to his neck.	0.8042189
Do not remove the binding unless there is swelling or an abscess, for twelve days.	Do not loosen the bandage for twelve days unless there arise at the place any pruritus or swelling.	0.90907466
Renew the plaster if needed, adjust the binding, and leave it until the fracture is healed and solidified.	Then renew the plaster if you think it necessary, and bandage again and leave until the fracture of the collar-bone is set and knits.	0.71491575
The fracture usually stabilizes and strengthens within 28 days, though it can take less time in some people.	The majority of these cases are firm and strong in twenty-eight days, though in some people it takes less.	0.68408763
Chapter 6:	CHAPTER six.	0.7419163
Restoration of a shoulder fracture.	On the repair of a fracture of the scapula.	0.77369404
The shoulder blade is broken in its central part and not in the margins but the edges.	The scapula is rarely fractured in the broad part but it does break at its margins.	0.6628816
So, when the fracture is in the middle of the blade and is only detectable by touch, you must prepare and reduce it according to the natural shape in every way possible.	When any part of it is broken or it breaks in the middle (which is recognized by palpation) you should attempt the correction of the fracture according to the shape it takes, and its restoration to its natural form, by whatever means you can.	0.5714926
Then, place on the area powdered flour with egg white and wool; then place a folded cloth; and then place a thin wooden splint according to the size of the shoulder blade or slightly more.	Then apply over the place mill-dust with eggwhite, and soft tow; and over that a dressing made of a folded cloth; and over that a broad splint made of thin board to the size of the whole scapula or a little wider.	0.85568464
But if there is a concavity under the splint in any part of the shoulder blade, then fill that concavity with wool and adjust the splint accordingly.	If there be beneath the splint a hollow in any part of the scapula, level it with soft tow so that the splint rests evenly.	0.63647866
Then tighten with a long bandage with appropriate constriction and firmness of the splint so it does not move from its place.	Then bind tightly over it a long sling and make sure that the splint does not slip out of place.	0.7866998
Check the bandaging every day; whenever it becomes loose, re-bandage and tighten it and adjust the splint if it has moved.	Examine the bandage daily; and whenever it gets loose tighten it and adjust the splint if it has shifted.	0.95199513
Make the patient lie on their healthy side.	The patient should lie on his sound side.	0.78554785
The shoulder blade will be restored in 20 or 25 days.	The scapula mends in twenty or twenty-five days.	0.7725265
When this time is completed, then remove the bandaging, knowing that the shoulder blade is one of those bones whose healing is not feared nor its dissolution.	When this time has elapsed you may safely loosen the bandaging, for this is one of the bones in which there is no danger of fragmentation or cracking.	0.78655744
And if any piece of bone protrudes and pricks under the skin, then cut over it, remove it, and treat as we have mentioned in the fracture of the collarbone if this condition occurs.	If a splinter of bone protrudes and starts to prick under the skin, cut down upon it and remove it, and do as I said under fracture of the collar-bone, to allay the effusion, if anything of that kind happen.	0.82489866
Chapter 7:	CHAPTER SEVEN.	0.6037252
Restoration of a chest fracture.	On the repair of a fracture of the breast.	0.7990259
The chest sometimes breaks in the middle and this often happens; but its edges are very often crushed and fragmented.	The breast is sometimes fractured in the middle but this happens rarely; more often it is the extremities of it that are broken and comminuted.	0.9386875
And one of the accidents of a middle fracture is that it leans inward, causing great pain, difficulty in breathing, coughing, and often spitting blood; this is evident in the cavity of the broken bone and is not hidden from feeling.	The symptoms that occur when it is broken in the middle are that he bows downwards and suffers violent pain, difficulty in breathing, and coughing, and sometimes he vomits blood; and there is an obvious and palpable concavity in the bone.	0.7925919
The restoration involves having the patient lie on their back and placing a cushion between their shoulders; then press the muscles, adjust the ribs with hands on both sides, and work gently in the operation and alignment in every possible way until the bone's shape is restored.	Now the way to mend it is for the patient to lie on his back, and you place a pillow between his shoulders; then his shoulders are squeezed, and with your hands you press together his ribs from both sides and skilfully try to equalize them in any way you conveniently can, until the bone is reduced to its proper form.	0.8776027
Then place a plaster and wool on it, followed by a thin wooden splint made of willow or similar light wood, wrapped in cloth; gently bandage it over the broken bone so it does not move; wrap it round the back several times, and tighten it decently; check the bandage regularly and tighten it when it loosens.	Then apply over it a plaster and a pad and place over that a splint of thin willow board or brier or similar light wood, first wrapping it in cloth; then gently bind this upon the fractured bone so that it does not slip; and carry your bandage round about the back several times, tying it firmly; then inspect it constantly, and whenever it loosens tighten it.	0.94268644
If a need arises to remove the bandage due to erosion, itching, pain, or abscess, quickly remove it, clean the plaster, rectify the situation with appropriate treatment, and then replace the plaster and tighten it until it heals.	If you are compelled to loosen it on account of itching at the place, or pain or swelling, loosen it quickly and remove the plaster and correct whatever has occurred with the appropriate treatment. Then renew the plaster if you think fit, and keep it bandaged until it heals.	0.8505868

Restoration of fractured ribs.	On the repair of ribs when they are fractured.	0.69901335
Know that rib fractures occur only in thick parts near the back; fractures in the front do not happen because they are cartilaginous. Detection of a fracture is not hidden from touch with fingers.	You should know that fracture of the ribs occurs only at the thick parts bordering on the vertebrae, whereas the anterior extremities are only contused, because they are cartilaginous; this is easily diagnosed on examination with the fingers.	0.8412564
Restoration involves aligning the fracture with fingers as much as possible until it is set, then plastering and tightening the broken bone with a splint, if needed.	They should be set by levelling out the fracture with the fingers in any manner you can so that the form is as it should be; then apply the plaster and bind the broken bone with a splint, if necessary.	0.7924672
If the rib fracture leans inward, the patient will have severe pain and puncture similar to pleurisy, because the bone pricks the membrane; causing difficulty breathing, coughing, and often spitting blood; this is hard to cure.	If it be a depressed fracture of the ribs, then the patient will have a vehement pain and a piercing sensation like that of pleurisy, since the bone is piercing the pleura; in addition he will have difficulty in breathing and will cough, and vomit much blood; the treatment of this is difficult.	0.9047979
The Ancients have worked on this with many inventions.	In this the Ancients practised many devices.	0.7545037
Some said the patient should eat foods that cause bloating and gas, so the abdomen swells and the fracture is pushed outward.	Some said that the patient should have food of such a kind as to generate wind and inflation to blow out and stretch the belly and so push out the fracture.	0.87140226
But we avoid this as it may cause an abscess, and if it happens, it is helpful.	We, however, reject this, since it will excite an effusion if one has not already arisen; and if one has arisen it will increase and confirm it.	0.55770266
Some said to use a cupping glass to suck forcefully; this seems reasonable but feared to draw impurities to the area due to weakness.	Some of them said a cupping-vessel should be applied to the place and strong suction be made; this seems more reasonable except that there is a risk of the vessel's drawing superfluities to the place on account of his weak state.	0.7623288
Some said the area should be covered with wool soaked in hot oil, with padding between the ribs to fill it, wrapped with bandages in a rounded manner; and the patient should be treated as for pleurisy with diet and medicine.	Some of them said that the place should be covered with wool soaked in warm oil and that a pad should be placed in the intercostal space to fill it up so as to make the bandaging level when you wind it round. Then treat the patient with diet and medicines as for pleurisy.	0.8628539
If severe pain constrains the patient, with the bone puncturing the membrane and causing distress, cut over the area, expose the broken rib, use the instrument to hold the diaphragm (mentioned earlier), cut the bone, and extract it.	If the patient is in such a bad way that he cannot bear it, the bone painfully piercing the pleura, and we are afraid for him, then we shall have to cut down upon the place and lay bare the broken rib; then we place under it the instrument to protect the membrane, which has been described, and gently cut out the bone and remove it.	0.65765727
Then align the wound edges if large, with stitching, and treat with plasters until healed.	Then the edges of the wound should be joined, with a suture if large, and dressed with ointments until healed.	0.8719343
If an internal abscess occurs, quickly apply soaked pads in rose oil to the area, and treat the patient appropriately for the internal abscess.	If meanwhile there arise an abscess, quickly soak pads in oil of roses and apply them to the place and treat the patient with internal remedies against abscess too.	0.88733673
Have the patient lie on the side they usually sleep on until healed.	Let him lie upon the side which is easier for him to sleep on, until it heals.	0.7089508
Chapter 9:	CHAPTER NINE.	0.5930028
Restoration of spinal fractures and neck bones.	On setting the vertebrae of the back and neck.	0.659211
Sometimes the bones of the neck fracture, often by pressure, and similarly with the spine. When this happens, and you want to know if it will heal, consider: if the patient's hands are softened, stupefied, and lifeless, unable to move, extend, or grip, and when you press or prick with a needle, there is no pain, then know it will not heal, and this condition is mostly fatal.	When a fracture occurs in the bones of the neck, which is rare, as mostly they suffer contusion, as do the spinal vertebrae—when it happens to anyone and you want to know whether it will heal or not, then look and if you see both his hands relaxed and numb and dead and he has no power to move or stretch or close them, and when you pinch them or prick them with a needle he does not notice it or feel any pain in them, you may know, as a general rule, that it will not mend, for he is doomed.	0.7998531
If there is movement and sensation when pressed or pricked, then know the spinal cord is intact, and the patient will recover with treatment.	But if he moves them both and feels in them the pinching and pricking, you may know that the spinal medulla is still intact and that under treatment the patient will recover.	0.72025967
If the same occurs with neck vertebrae, and you want to know if it will heal, examine the patient's feet.	If anything of this nature happens to the vertebrae of the back and you wish to know if he will recover or not, then pay attention to his feet.	0.6833747
If the feet are softened and experience the same as the hands, and when lying on their back, the patient passes gas and stool involuntarily, or if they try to urinate and cannot, know it is fatal, and do not attempt treatment.	If you see them relaxed and in the situation we described in the case of the hands, and when he lies on his back he passes flatus and faeces involuntarily, and lying prone he passes water involuntarily and lying on his back he cannot pass water if he wishes, then you may know his case is hopeless, so do not concern yourself with his treatment.	0.65885943
If none of these conditions occur, the prognosis is better and easier.	But if nothing of this kind occur then the case is easier.	0.59006786
The treatment involves sedating the inflamed area by applying rose oil alone or with yolks of roasted eggs several times a day until the inflammation subsides.	The way to treat this latter kind of case is to try to reduce the swelling by applying over the injured vertebra oil of roses, alone, or with roasted yolks of egg; apply three times a day until the swelling has gone down.	0.75790226
Then apply one of the comforting and stimulating plasters, bandage tightly, and advise the patient to rest and avoid lying on the painful side until healed.	Then apply to the place one of the strengthening and absorbent plasters and bind it on; bid him keep quiet and still and sleep only in the attitude in which he has no pain, until he is well.	0.78183675
If a bone fragment or cause is separated from the pressure, cut over the area and remove the bone; align the wound edges with stitching if large; then treat with healing ointments until healed.	If the injury is accompanied by fragmentation or a separation of part of the bone, you must cut down on it and remove the bone; then bring together the edges of the opening, by suture if it be wide; then treat with granulating ointments until it heals.	0.8653337
If the last vertebra is broken and at the end of the tailbone, insert the thumb of your left hand into the anus, and align the broken bone with the other hand as possible; then apply plaster and splint if needed, and tighten.	If the last bone of the coccyx, which is the sacrum of the tail, breaks, introduce the thumb of your left hand into his anus and reset the bone with the other hand in whatever way is possible and affords the best setting; then apply over it a plaster, and a splint if necessary, and bind it up.	0.8812473
If you feel broken fragments, cut over them, remove, and treat the wound as previously described until healed.	And if you perceive a fragment in the fracture, cut down upon it, remove it, and dress the wound as before said, until it heals.	0.81781113
Chapter 10:	CHAPTER TEN.	0.65388054
Restoration of hip fractures.	On setting a fractured hip.	0.5599161
The hip bones rarely break, but when they do, the fracture is usually at the ends, extending lengthwise and inclining inward, causing pain and puncture in the area, and the leg becomes stupefied.	It is rare indeed that hip-bones are fractured, and if they are fractured the fracture consists of a comminution of the extremities of them and a longitudinal splitting and a bending inward; and the patient feels a pain and a piercing at the site, and the leg on the fractured side is benumbed.	0.7767943
The restoration involves extending your hand over the fracture to align it as it should be.	To set it, you pass your hand over it and ascertain what the shape of the fracture is.	0.48750126
If the fracture is only at the end, align it as much as possible until it resembles its natural shape.	If it is a fracture of the extremity only, set that fracture in whatever manner is convenient for you until it answers to its proper shape.	0.74657834
If the fracture extends lengthwise or inclines downward, have the patient lie on their belly until the fracture is prepared for restoration. Once aligned, apply plaster, then a wooden or leather splint, and tighten without fearing fracture puncture or splint movement.	But if it be a longitudinal fracture or it has bent inwards, have the patient lie on his stomach so as to make it convenient for setting the fracture; and when you have set it apply over it a plaster and over that a splint of wood or leather, and bandage it in such wise that you have no fear that the fracture may extend or the splint slip.	0.8113059
Fill any concavity to maintain even pressure, and advise the patient to sleep on their back or healthy side.	Level out the cavity of the lumbar region with some filling so that it may take the bandage evenly, and bid the patient sleep on his back or on his sound side.	0.69524276
If an abscess occurs, stop extending and restoring until the abscess subsides; apply treatments to sedate it, then resume restoration and tighten as needed.	If there occur an effusion, then refrain from bandaging or setting it until the effusion subsides; and apply to it something to allay it as before said; then return to setting it and bandaging it as it should be.	0.7967044
If bone fragments are present or comminuted, remove them.	If there be any splinters in the bone or anything crumbles away from the extremities, it must not be pulled out or touched, but set externally as we have said, and the bandaging should be left until it heals.	0.5067487
Chapter 11:	CHAPTER ELEVEN.	0.5134411
Restoration of fractures of the elbow.	On setting a fracture of the humerus.	0.57924736
The elbow is what is between the elbow joint and the shoulder.	The humerus is what lies between the elbow and the head of the scapula.	0.8098878
If it is broken, the restoration is done in one of two ways, the first being to take a flat piece of wood of moderate thickness shaped like this:	If it is fractured it may be set in one of two ways. One is to take a smooth bow-shaped piece of wood of medium thickness, like this.	0.8762702
Tie two bandages at both ends and suspend it from a high place.	You tie two bands at the two ends and then it is hung from above.	0.7974771
Have the patient sit on a chair and extend the broken arm over the wood until it reaches the middle, where the curvature of the wood attaches.	The patient is to sit on a seat; then his broken arm is folded upon the piece of wood in such a way that his axilla fits into the middle of the curve of the piece of wood.	0.7872906
Then suspend a heavy object from it, or have an assistant extend it downward; the doctor aligns the fracture with their hands until the fracture returns to its proper position.	Then hang a heavy weight from the arm, or have an assistant pull it downwards; then the doctor should straighten out the fracture with both hands together until it is properly reduced.	0.85235476
The other method involves the patient lying on their back, with the hand suspended by a bandage from the neck; instruct two assistants to hold above and below the fracture, each extending in their direction.	The other way is to make the patient lie back and to suspend his hand from his neck by a band, then you instruct two assistants. One is to grasp with both hands the arm above the fracture, and the other the arm below the fracture; and each should make extension toward himself.	0.88184774
If you want stronger extension, tighten the bandage over the fracture with another bandage, and have each assistant extend in their direction.	And if you wish to extend more strongly, tie a band below the fracture and another above, and let each assistant pull toward himself.	0.8003377
If the fracture is near the end of the muscle, place half the bandage over the shoulder and the other below the fracture towards the elbow.	If the fracture is near the extremity of the shoulder you will have to put one band beneath the axilla and the other below the fracture near the elbow.	0.8149076
Similarly, if the fracture is near the elbow, place the bandage over that area and the elbow.	Similarly, if the fracture be near the elbow you will have to put a band over the place and over the elbow itself.	0.9086293
Align it easily without effort, and once properly aligned and applied, tighten unless an abscess occurs.	Then gently and without violence straighten out the fracture until it is restored to its proper shape and fits together well, and then tighten it if no abscess occur.	0.73382866
If an abscess occurs, leave the tightness until the seventh day, then apply dirty wool soaked in vinegar and rose oil until the abscess subsides, then tighten again.	But if an abscess occur, leave the bandaging until the seventh day and apply raw wool soaked in vinegar and oil of roses until the abscess subsides; then bind it up.	0.8849292
To tighten, apply plaster over the fracture, wrap it with a clean cloth, adjust the arm over the elbow, and place the hand open on the muscle.	The method of binding it is to apply a plaster to the fracture; then wind round the plaster a bandage of new material; then bind the forearm to the humerus, placing his hand open on his shoulder.	0.6678947
Wrap and tighten the cloth around the elbow so that the arm acts as a splint, unless prevented by a broken bone.	Then apply pads and bandages to the arm and forearm so that the forearm serves instead of splints, if there is no contra-indication and you see no pathological change in the broken bone.	0.575181
Then use splints.	But should you fear any such change then use splints.	0.5138111
Place the widest and strongest splint over the fracture, with the width of a finger between each splint, and the length of the splints extending three fingers beyond the fracture.	The way to use these is to place over the fracture itself a splint that is broader and stronger than the rest; and leave a space of a finger's breadth between splints; the splint should be of a length to suit the fracture with the addition of three fingers' breadth all round.	0.8037735
Tighten the splints with the bandage as described at the beginning of the chapter.	Then bandage over the splints in the manner mentioned at the beginning of the chapter.	0.7968359
Ensure the bandage over the fracture is the tightest. The longer the fracture, the looser the bandage should be.	That is, you should bandage more tightly over the fracture itself and more lightly as you get away from the fracture.	0.59012693
When positioning the splints and bandages as described, restore the limb to its proper alignment.	If you decide to put on splints and bandage, as we have said, at the time you set the limb, do so.	0.63679546
If you fear an abscess, leave the bandage and splints in place until the seventh day as described.	But if you fear an abscess, leave the splinting and bandaging until the seventh day as we have said.	0.8798567
Check the bandage in all areas for three days to prevent itching or swelling, or the restriction of food to the limb due to excessive tightness; then adjust as needed.	Then examine the bandaging every third day lest there be itching or swelling at the place; or nourishment be prevented from reaching the limb on account of excessively tight bandaging; treat all these in the proper manner according to our prescriptions.	0.81803656
If confident that none of these issues occur, do not loosen the bandage for about three days or more.	But if you are confident that nothing of this sort is happening then do not loosen the bandaging until after many days.	0.72830886
Have the patient sleep on their back with their hands on their stomach.	The patient should be made to sleep on his back with his hand on his stomach, and under the humerus there should be placed a cushion evenly filled with wool.	0.6094114
Place a wool-filled cushion evenly on the elbow, and regularly check that the limb's alignment and bandage are intact; adjust if necessary.	And examine it at all times of the day and night lest the shape of the broken limb suffer any deformity or the binding loosen; do your utmost to put any such thing right.	0.5024117
Feed the patient according to the prescribed order, starting with light food until tightening begins; then increase the food's substance.	You should also direct the patient's diet along the line that we have given earlier; namely, at first the food should be light until the bone has begun to knit; then you should order heavier food.	0.76592565
The usual treatment for the elbow and leg takes forty days; then loosen, bathe, and apply ointments to heal.	Now it is the nature of the humerus and of the leg to knit in forty days; then they should be loosened and the patient should go to the bath and be treated with suitable ointments.	0.7251426
If the fracture is severe, do not loosen the bandage and splints for thirty to sixty days.	If the fracture be ugly and contused, do not unfasten it for fifty days or even two months.	0.7487135
Chapter 12:	CHAPTER TWELVE.	0.47203076
Restoration of fractures of the arm.	On setting a fracture of the forearm.	0.5784143
The arm consists of two bones called the forearm bones; one is small, located near the thumb, and the other is larger, located near the little finger, on the lower side.	The forearm consists of two bones and is sometimes called 'the two firesticks'. One of these bones is small and is in line with the thumb, the other is large; this is the one placed lower, under the smaller one.	0.84941053
The larger bone often breaks alone or with the smaller bone.	The larger alone may be broken, or the smaller alone, or both broken together.	0.7094945
When the small upper bone breaks, the restoration and healing are easier.	When the small upper bone (radius) is broken it is easy to set and its mending is rapid.	0.76221114
When the lower bone breaks, the fracture and healing are more difficult.	When the lower bone (ulna) breaks it is bad and its mending is difficult.	0.7836429
The worst case is when both bones break together.	Worst of all is when both bones break together.	0.9646193
If the small upper bone breaks, it is advisable for the doctor to apply gentle extension until it is aligned.	If the broken bone is the radius, the doctor when setting it must use light traction, gently, until he has it straight.	0.66733027
If the larger bone breaks, a stronger extension is needed.	If it is the ulna that breaks, he must employ stronger traction on it.	0.68418145
If both bones break together, apply a much stronger extension.	If both bones break he must employ very strong traction.	0.8020798
The hand should be positioned with the thumb higher than the other fingers, resting on a cushion, and the patient sitting on a square seat.	During setting and extension the hand must be disposed on a cushion, spread out with the thumb uppermost, higher than all the fingers, and the little finger downmost, while the patient sits cross-legged upon the floor.	0.69246286
Place a cushion in front at the appropriate height to avoid discomfort.	The cushion should be on a level with him so that he does not suffer discomfort.	0.6070603
One assistant extends the lower part of the arm with their hand or a bandage, while another does the same for the upper part.	Then let an attendant extend the arm from below, either by hand or by means of a band, while another attendant extends it from above similarly.	0.7243825
The doctor aligns the bone to restore it to the best possible position.	Then the doctor may straighten the bone so as to restore it to the best possible shape.	0.81493914
If there are bone fragments, you must place each piece in its proper location with your skill.	If there be any splinters in the fracture he must do his utmost to restore each splinter to its place.	0.65744436
If a fragment appears separated and pierces the skin without hope of restoration, treat it as previously described.	If a detached splinter appears there and is piercing the skin and you have no hope of restoring it, cut down upon it and remove it in the manner we have mentioned earlier.	0.81581616
If the fracture involves a wound, refer to the specific chapter on this and follow its treatment.	If the fracture is accompanied by a wound, we have devoted a separate section to this, so take the treatment of it from there.	0.76609766
If an abscess occurs at the beginning of the restoration, apply a cloth with cerate made of rose oil and white wax, moderately thick, and tighten it gently until the abscess subsides; then remove the cerate, apply a plaster made of powdered herbs and egg white, and use the widest and strongest splint over the fracture.	If, when you begin to set the bone, an effusion occurs, smear a cloth with the wax made from oil of roses and white wax, of medium thickness, and bind the dressing on gently. When the effusion subsides, remove the wax and apply the plaster prepared from mill-dust and egg-white, then apply splints; the splint that goes on the actual fracture should be a little wider and stronger than the rest.	0.8745092
Know that the number of splints for the arm is six in major cases, whether one or both bones are fractured.	You should know that the number of splints for an arm is, as a rule, six, whether the fracture be of one bone or of both together.	0.8618666
Then apply the bandage most tightly over the fracture, loosening it slightly above and below as mentioned earlier.	Then bandage more tightly and strongly over the site of the fracture, and, as you wrap the bandage above and below the fracture, bind little by little more loosely according to the instruction given at the beginning of the book.	0.74145806
The cloths wrapped around the fracture should be soft and damp, not hard or rough, and the string used for tightening should be moderately thick, as described.	The dressings wound round the fracture should be gentle and soft, not very hard, while the cord for binding is best made of linen of medium thickness as we have prescribed.	0.8152522
Check the limb and bandage regularly for a few days. If an issue requiring correction arises, such as itching, soak the limb in warm water until it subsides.	Some days later, examine the limb and the bandaging and if anything has happened that should be put right, such as pruritus in the limb, the limb should be bathed in warm water until the pruritus has subsided.	0.8326684
Leave the limb untightened until it rests, then reapply the bandage.	Let the limb be unbandaged for one night so that he may rest, then put the bandage on again.	0.7737036
If the bandage has loosened and the bone is misaligned, correct it with your skill.	If the bandaging has become loose and the bone has shifted or anything of that sort, correct it all diligently.	0.6504613
Check if the tightness restricts nutrition to the limb; if so, loosen it slightly for a few days to allow nutrition flow, then retighten.	Look also to see if nourishment is being prevented from reaching the part on account of over-bandaging, in which case you will have to loosen it a little and leave it for a few days until nourishment flows to it; then bind it up.	0.7754741
If none of these issues occur, do not loosen the bandage for about twenty days.	But if none of those things that we have mentioned happens to the patient, it should not be loosened until after about twenty days.	0.7058943
Suspend the patient's hand to encourage movement and have them sleep on their back.	Then the patient's hand is to be suspended from his neck, the arm being level, and he should guard carefully against agitated movements, and should sleep on his back.	0.57414985
Know that this fracture heals in thirty to thirty-two days, or even twenty-eight days, depending on the individual's constitution and vitality.	You should know that this fracture of the arm mends in thirty or thirty-two days, and sometimes in twenty-eight, depending on the individual's constitution and the condition of his strength.	0.87257576
Chapter 13:	CHAPTER THIRTEEN.	0.5011494
On the restoration of fractures of the wrist and fingers.	On the repair of fractures of the palm and fingers.	0.9646006
Know that fractures of the wrist and knuckles of the fingers are rare, and they usually experience wear and tear.	Fractures of the metacarpus and of the small bones of the fingers very rarely occur; the only frequent occurrence is contusion.	0.6654938
When a fracture or wear happens to the hand, the patient should sit squarely and place their hand extended in front of them.	When a fracture or crushing of the palm of the hand occurs the patient should sit cross-legged with a chair of the right height in front of him, on which he should put his outstretched hand.	0.8556938
An assistant should extend the broken bones, and the doctor should align them properly.	Then an assistant is to extend the broken bones while the doctor straightens them so as to achieve a proper union.	0.7555252
Then, apply a plaster and cotton if there is no severe abscess, and place a splint according to the injury's location, wrapping it in a cloth.	Then a plaster and a dressing should be applied, if an effusion do not occur; then a splint over that, measured to the site and wrapped in a soft cloth.	0.8038387
If the fracture is on the inner side of the palm, create a cloth ball and instruct the patient to grasp it with the injured palm, securing it with a long cloth.	If the fracture be lower down, near the inner part of the palm of the hand, make a ball of cloth, bid the patient grip on it with the fractured palm of his hand, and then bind it up with a long bandage.	0.8456937
The splint should be padded with cloth to be gentle on the palm, and tighten it as necessary.	The splint should be of leather that is somewhat soft, so as to fit into all the folds of the palm; and bandage it on suitably.	0.69281894
If the fracture is on the outer side, place a splint on top and another on the palm side to keep the hand open and straight, and secure it with a bandage wrapped between the fingers.	But if the fracture be on the outside you will have to put one splint above and another beneath the palm of the hand, to keep the hand opened and straight; then put on the bandage, carrying it round the hand and in and out between the fingers.	0.83899045
If a fracture occurs in any of the knuckles, especially the thumb, align and secure it properly with the palm, and if desired, place a small splint to elevate the fracture and prevent movement.	The fracture may occur to one of the small bones of the fingers. If it be the thumb, then set it in the proper way and bind it down to the palm of the hand; if you like you can apply a small straight splint to it to keep the fracture straight so that it does not shift.	0.768986
For fractures in other fingers, like the middle, index, little, or ring finger, align and bind them to the adjacent healthy finger, or bind all together, which is better, or place a small splint as described for the thumb.	If the break be in any of the other fingers, such as the middle or index or little finger or the ring finger, straighten it out and bind it to the sound finger next to it; or let them all be bound up one to another, which is better; or apply a small straight splint, as we said for the thumb.	0.8842782
In the restoration process, consider the possibility of severe abscess and address it appropriately, following the methods previously described.	While you are setting it, and afterwards, look out for an effusion and counteract it with what is required if anything of this sort occur, according to what has been repeatedly prescribed.	0.45483243
Chapter 14:	CHAPTER FOURTEEN.	0.52723527
On the restoration of fractures of the thigh bone.	On setting a fracture of the femur.	0.70465064
The thigh bone often breaks and is identified by its misalignment forward and upward.	The femur is often broken, and this is readily discernible, for it will rotate forwards or backwards.	0.72767794
Restoration involves tightly bandaging the fracture and another bandage below it, with the patient lying face down.	It is set by binding a bandage above the fracture and another below, while the patient lies flat on his face.	0.7978187
An assistant should extend the entire bandage according to the injury's nature when the fracture is in the middle of the bone.	Then each assistant should make an even extension in his own direction, by the bandage. This is when the fracture is in the middle of the bone.	0.69812655
If near the hip joint, place the bandage near the knee on the thigh so that the extension is upward, and another bandage below the fracture.	But if the fracture is close to the root of the thigh, you should tie on a soft bandage of wool or something similar, at the root of the thigh toward the groin, so that extension may be applied above, and another bandage below the fracture.	0.7622062
Similarly, if the fracture is near the knee, place the bandage near the knee and extend it downward.	Likewise if the fracture is near the knee the bandage should be near the knee, so that extension may be made downwards.	0.88243455
The doctor should then align the bone with both hands to its natural position and ensure good alignment; then apply a plaster and bandage unless there is an abscess. If an abscess occurs, leave it for a few days until it subsides, then return to the treatment.	Then the doctor should straighten it out with both hands until he has reduced it to the pattern of the natural form and the bone unites neatly. Then you will have to apply the plaster and bandage if there is no effusion in the limb, but if there is an effusion leave it for a few days until the swelling has gone down, then resume your treatment.	0.8842833
The bandage should be applied firmly, doubled two or three times, and any excess removed; then wrap the leg from the foot to the hip.	As to the bandaging, you should wrap a firm broad sash two or three times round the fracture, leaving some over; then bind the leg up so that the heel is brought to reach the root of the buttock.	0.7376266
Place a long cloth between the thigh and leg near the knee, with the ends reaching the uppermost part of the leg, and wrap any excess cloth around the leg and thigh.	Then pass a long cord in the space between the thigh and the leg, low down near the knee, and let the ends of the cord come up on either side, then bind the rest of the sash over the leg and the thigh.	0.8247055
Place splints over the fracture on the thigh and another splint on the leg bone.	Then apply splints to the thigh at the very site of the fracture and put one of the splints on the leg-bone.	0.7403186
Fill the gaps between the leg and thigh with soft cloths to ensure firm bandaging.	Then pack soft material in the space between the leg and the thigh to make the bandaging even.	0.7150936
Start with a tight bandage in the middle of the fracture with three or four wraps, and as you move away from the fracture site, make the bandage looser and softer.	Then start with three or four turns of a strong bandage in the middle over the site of the fracture, and as you get away from the site of the fracture bind lighter and softer and looser.	0.8867333
Extend the ends of the cloth to the lower parts, reaching the ankle, and tighten both ends of the splints so the bandage stays in place.	Then turn to the two ends of the cord which you previously passed between the thigh and the leg, and with the cord bind the adjacent splints above, then carry the ends downward until you end up at the great tendon of the foot and with them bind also the extremities of the splints at the other end so that the bandaging will not shift from its place.	0.62644124
Leave the bandage as it is, ensuring it doesn't cause corrosion, severe abscess, or swelling; if any such issues arise, quickly remove the bandage and correct the issue as described.	Then let the bandaging remain on as long as no pruritus or abscess or effusion or anything of that sort happens to the limb; but if any of these occur loosen it quickly and put right whatever has taken place, in the manner we have often mentioned.	0.7505547
If there is a bone fragment, align it as much as possible; if not, remove it and treat it according to previous instructions until healed.	If there be a penetrating fragment of the bone, you must reposition it if you can; but if not then cut down upon it and remove it and treat the wound in the sort of way mentioned previously, until it heals.	0.84753597
Sometimes this fracture of the thigh is supported with splints as described for the forearm and arm.	This fracture of the thigh is sometimes bandaged without bringing the leg alongside with splints, in the way we spoke of for the humerus and the forearm.	0.76357377
In this manner of restoration, the patient does not develop a limp; if restored alone without the other leg's support, the patient will likely limp.	But setting after the former manner does not cause the patient any lameness; whereas if the femur is set alone without binding the leg to it the patient will inevitably be lame for always.	0.6828555
Know that the thigh should be bandaged for 40 days, give or take, depending on the patient's constitution and other factors.	You must know that the femur knits in fifty days or a little more or less, according to the different constitutions and other circumstances.	0.6472295

On the restoration of fractures of the kneecap.	On setting a fracture of the patella of the knee.	0.70869964
Know that fractures of the kneecap are rare but often suffer wear and tear.	You should know that the patella is rarely fractured, but crushing often occurs.	0.7948457
If a fracture occurs, it is usually a crack or break in its parts, either with or without a wound, identified by symptoms.	If a fracture does happen to it, it will be either a splitting or a shattering which may be simple or compound; and all these can be palpated.	0.6105086
Restoration involves aligning the broken parts with the fingers until they are joined as much as possible with proper adjustment and ease.	Now the way to set is for the separated parts of it to be put right with the fingers, so that they unite and join as far as straightening and gentleness and skill can serve.	0.64947724
Apply a plaster and a round splint if needed, and secure it with an appropriate bandage.	Then apply the plaster and put upon that a circular splint, if need be, and over that a suitable bandage.	0.7990651
Consider all the conditions described for other fractures, such as severe abscesses, and address any complications appropriately until healed.	Then keep an eye on it for all the conditions described for the other fractures, such as an effusion and the like, meeting whatever arises with what is good for it, until it is healed.	0.74836576

On the restoration of a broken leg.	On setting a fracture of the leg.	0.77259743
You should know that in the leg there are two bones, one of which is large and is called the leg bone; and the other is thin and is called the fibula.	The leg consists of two bones. One of them is thick and is called 'leg bone' (tibia). The other is slender and is called 'fire-stick' (fibula).	0.7874981
And what happens with each type of fracture also happens to the two bones of the arm, and therefore the restoration is done similarly to the restoration of the arm, and the operation is the same.	Both of these are liable to the same kinds of fracture as occur in the two bones of the forearm, therefore the repair of them will be like that of the arm, and the operation is one and the same.	0.8317849
And if both bones are broken together, the leg is turned in all directions.	If both bones are broken together, the leg will turn in all directions.	0.9383459
And if the thinner bone is broken, the leg is turned forward.	If the fibula is broken there will be a forward deformity of the leg.	0.65840876
And if the thicker bone is broken, you find it below, and it is for reasons that are not hidden from you.	If the tibia be broken, and that low down, it will be obvious to you.	0.51941025
And then administer extension, alignment, and binding of the splints according to that alignment.	Employ levelling and extension and binding on of splints similar to that (sc.	0.52755356
But it is necessary, if the leg fracture is extensive and has many splinters, that the extension is less and lighter, and ease it with your skill.	But it will be necessary, if the fracture of the leg be a serious one with much fragmentation, for the extension to be gentler and lighter; and you must employ the utmost gentleness in setting it.	0.79421043
And in the leg, there is some operation over the arm, and it is when you align the splints and complete all your operation, then you will take pieces of pine wood which are placed under the things which are usually placed on the ground, and they are made from palm branches; bind those of small thickness, and not those of the smallest ones, and their length should be according to the length of the leg, from the knee to the lowest part.	The operation on the leg involves one more process than that on the arm, namely, that when you have set the splints and have finished the task, you should take two strips of pine wood such as are used for roofing upstairs rooms, being put in the gaps of the planking, or they may be palm stalks; pick out such as are somewhat thick and not too thin; they should be as long as the leg from the knee down.	0.7471226
And then wrap around each cloth in two wrappings according to its length, and place one on one side of the leg and the other on the other side, from the knee to the lowest part of the foot.	Then wrap each of them in a cloth folded into two longitudinally, and put one on each side of the leg; they should reach from the knee to the extremity of the foot.	0.86825204
And then tie the two splints in three places, at both ends and the middle, because with this structure, the leg is prevented from bending to the right or left, and it stays in good position.	Then tie the two strips in three places, namely at the two ends and in the middle; this binding prevents the leg from bending to right or left and it will be held in a good straight position.	0.8832488
And a small wooden brace is already administered according to the length of the leg; and the leg is placed in it to prevent movement.	Sometimes a 'gutter-splint' is used, made of wood according to the length of the leg; the leg is placed in this and it keeps the leg motionless.	0.6367456
And it is especially necessary that you do this in a fracture, and when with it there is appropriate pain.	This is particularly necessary in a compound fracture.	0.56063616
And then examine the leg daily and study it thoroughly, and guard it from abscess and swelling or other similar causes; and if any of these occur, then treat it with what is necessary until it is healed.	Then carefully examine the leg every day and use the utmost care to guard against effusion or swelling or other like things; and when anything of this sort happens employ the means to meet the case until it heals.	0.87502646
Chapter 17.	CHAPTER SEVENTEEN.	0.6527891
On the fracture of the heel and the bones of the foot and the toes.	On fracture of bones of the foot and of the toes.	0.9331309
The heel does not suffer fractures often; but the bones of the foot sometimes do; and fractures of the toes are rare, and they usually only suffer from bruising due to their position.	The heel is never fractured; but the bones of the foot sometimes are. The toes too are rarely fractured; but mostly they get crushed.	0.8682966
And if a fracture occurs in the bones of the foot and sometimes these bones are elevated over one another, then the patient should place their foot on the ground as if walking.	If a fracture occurs to the bones of the foot, and you see the bones riding over one another, let the patient plant his foot flat on the ground as if walking.	0.85118574
And then place one foot on what is elevated from those bones, and then press, and align them until they return to their places.	Then stand and put the sole of your foot on the prominent bones and with your foot put pressure upon them and level them to their proper place.	0.7437211
And then place a plaster and a compress on top, and place under the arch of the foot a small board with two flat ends.	Then apply a bandage and some tow on top, and put under the inner part of the sole of the foot a small board with two flat heads.	0.8654916
And then secure it to the foot with a decent bandage, after wrapping it with cloth and other necessary things.	After you have wrapped them in material and so on, bind them tightly to the sole of the foot.	0.65160996
And when three or four days have passed, then untie the binding, because you will find the bones aligned, whether they were broken or dislocated, and the operation on them is as you know.	When three days or four have passed, loosen the binding and you will find the bones in position; whether they have been fractured or dislocated, the operation is (the same,) as you see.	0.88264513
But if any toes are broken, then restore them, and align them as I have told you in the restoration of the fingers of the hand. And then place a splint on the broken toe according to the length of the toe, and make it a bit wider; and then under the foot place the board that was recommended to you, and secure it with a decent bandage.	If one of the toes be broken, reposition and straighten it in the way that I described for the fingers; then apply to the broken toe a splint of a length corresponding to the toe and a little wider than it. Then under the sole of the foot put the board that I have just described, and bandage it on firmly.	0.8781843
But if what is broken are two or three or more bones, then place on each toe a splint of its size wrapped in soft cloth, and secure the board to the lower part of the foot, and let one of the ends of the board stand outside the arch of the foot to hold it in good retention.	If the broken bones number two, three, or more, then apply over each toe a single splint measured to it, wrapped in soft material, and bind the board on the sole and let the flat portion of each of the two heads extend beyond the end of the sole of the foot, so that it may be held firmly.	0.8549236
And it is necessary for you not to forget to consider all the causes that have been mentioned to you in other fractures of the accidents we have	And you must not forget to pay attention to all those contingencies that we have mentioned to you in other fractures; meet each contingency with the means proper to it.	0.70878136

On the fracture of the woman's pubic bone and the man's pelvic bone and penis.	On fracture of the female pudenda and of the pubic bone and of the male organ.	0.9097362
When the woman's pubic bone is broken, then make her sit in a square seat, and then incline her a little towards the back, and she should be held there.	When a woman's pudenda are fractured, make her sit cross-legged, then bend her backwards little by little, being supported from behind.	0.8100517
And then the midwife fills the pubic area with cotton, and it should be made in the shape of a sphere; and then the woman should be shaken, and raise her back little by little, because all of this is pushed out until the front part of the pubic area is spherical and the broken bone returns.	Then let a midwife pack the vulva with cotton wool so as to form a kind of spherical packing in the vulva. Then shake the woman and by degrees elevate the dorsal spine, for the cotton wool will emerge until it is like a sphere at the opening and the fractured bone will be reduced.	0.78613734
And then place powders on her back, and when she wants to urinate, remove the cotton easily and then she urinates, and replace it and return it in the same way you placed it at the beginning, and then return to her original powder.	Then put a pillow upon her back and when she wants to pass water gently remove the cotton wool so she may do so, then put it back in the same way in which it was put in at the first. Then she should return to her pillow as before.	0.79459536
And do this for seven days or so, because that is the time needed for it to heal.	She should do this for about seven days, then it will be mended.	0.6832069
And if you wish, take a sheep's bladder and attach to its opening a cane tube; and insert the entire bladder into the pubic area, and then blow into the tube with force until the bladder is inflated within the pubic area, because the fracture will return.	If you prefer, take a sheep's bladder and bind a hollow reed to the opening of it; introduce the whole bladder into the pudenda and then blow hard into the tube so that the bladder is inflated within the passage and the fracture will then be reduced.	0.86108387
And then fill it with cotton and let it stay for a few days as we have said, until it is healed.	Then pack with cotton wool and let her wait a few days as we have described, until it be healed.	0.89861333
And when the pelvic bone of a man or woman is broken, then administer in the restoration and alignment of it what we have recommended for the hip bone.	Now when a man or woman has the pubic bone broken you can use for the setting and repair of it the method we gave for a fracture of the hip.	0.77001166
And what is right is not hidden in these nearby fractures and which occur infrequently, especially to those who have some study and use and understand this book well; because that fracture shows you in the major dispositions a straight path in the restoration and alignment of it, so understand well.	The correct practice in these uncommon fractures, which very rarely happen, will be obvious, especially to one who has some experience and understands well this book of mine. For the fracture itself will in most cases indicate the correct way to repair it and bind it up, so use your intelligence.	0.80004835
But for the man's penis when it is broken, take goose grease, and place the penis in it; and then wrap it with cloth, and it should be bandaged, and then left for three days or so, and it will be healed.	When a man's organ is fractured, take a goose's neck and introduce the penis into it; then let it be wrapped and bandaged and left for about three days until it be healed.	0.79693437

On the restoration of bone fractures with wounds.	On the repair of fractures accompanied by wounding.	0.85473454
It is suitable for someone who has a fracture with a wound, especially if the bone is large like the thigh bone or the humerus, or similar, that you act quickly and perform bloodletting immediately if the conditions for bloodletting justify it as we have previously mentioned.	When a man has a compound fracture, especially when it is a large bone such as the femur or humerus or the like, you should at once venesect him if the conditions are suitable for venesection as set out above.	0.818096
And if the wound is bleeding, then you must quickly stop it by sprinkling powdered chalk on it if you have no other remedy available.	If there is bleeding from the wound you must hasten to stanch it by sprinkling it with powdered vitriol if you have nothing else at hand.	0.7720076
And then begin to restore the fracture on the same day, and do not delay this unless an abscess occurs.	Then begin on the reduction of the fracture the very same day; do not put it off unless an abscess occur.	0.89031625
But if an abscess occurs, then delay the restoration until the ninth day, until the abscess subsides, and do not approach it on the third or fourth day at all, as this could cause bad complications.	But if an abscess does occur, leave the reduction until the ninth day so that the abscess may subside, and in no circumstances touch it on the third or fourth day, for you will bring evil consequences on him.	0.90332246
But if the broken bone is protruding through the skin, then you must forcibly reduce and align it with your hands gently and with minimal extension.	If the fractured bone be overriding the skin you must try to reduce it and to straighten it out by hand, gently and with moderate extension.	0.8409314
But if the extension and alignment cannot be done with your hands alone, then reduce it with this instrument; it is an iron tool, seven or eight fingers long and its width according to the size of the wound; and it is necessary for the physician to have three or four of these according to what is needed for the treatment of each type of fracture.	If reduction and straightening by hand is unsuccessful, then reduce it with this instrument; it is made of iron, seven or eight fingers' breadths long, and wide in proportion to the size of the wound; that is why the doctor should have three or four of them in the sizes he may need for treating every kind of fracture.	0.9090028
And it should be round and slightly thick so that it does not bend under compression during the operation.	It should be round and somewhat thick so as not to bend when pressure is put upon it at the time of operating.	0.8810384
And it should have a sharp end with a margin at the extremities; and its upper part should be of increasing thickness from the middle towards the ends.	It should be sharp-ended with a bend at the end; the upper part should be of some thickness, but from the middle to the lower part it is a good bit thinner.	0.7553092
And this is its form:	This is its form.	0.7987968
And it is named in Greek “labre volentz atelarem”, which means small spatula.	It is called in Greek bayram, meaning a small lever.	0.65541893
So the sharp end should be placed over the protruding end of the bone.	You must place the sharp incurved end of it over the end of the protruding bone, and push it firmly with it.	0.6367224
And push it in one movement until the bone returns, and it is aligned properly.	When the bone is repositioned and straightened in some measure, try to straighten the ends of the fracture, one to another.	0.53930795
And then strive to align the fracture ends together, and if the broken end is thin and does not accept the instrument well, then you must incise the end of that bone until the instrument can hold it.	If the fractured end be very thin and the instrument does not grip it firmly you will have to cut off that end so as to give purchase for the instrument.	0.6869669
But if you cannot reduce the bone completely with what we have recommended, then incise it with a suitable instrument as we have mentioned; or saw it with one of the saws in whatever way is possible for you.	If you cannot reduce the bone at all by the means we have described, cut it off with any of the osteotomes we have mentioned that is suitable, or saw it off with one of the saws as best you may.	0.8229555
And then scrape away the remaining roughness and small scales from the bone.	Then strip away any remaining roughness of the bone and fine pieces of shell.	0.8971196
And when the bone is reduced, if the patient experiences severe pain afterwards, then know that the bone has not returned to its natural place; and then do this because you will give the patient great relief.	If, when you have reduced the bone, the patient feels severe and troublesome pain, you may know that the bone has not returned to its natural site. If you can restore it to its natural site, do so, for you will render the patient a signal service.	0.8325189
When you have completed the restoration of the bone, then soak a cloth in black astringent wine, especially if it is summer, and do not place a plaster or anything containing oil on the wound, so that it does not cause rot and corruption.	When your setting of the bone is complete, soak a dressing in dark sharp wine, especially if it be in summer, but do not put wax or anything oily upon the wound lest it cause putrefaction or corruption.	0.84675246
And then apply splints during the completion of the bone restoration, and leave the wound uncovered so that you can make incisions with scissors and use wrappings according to the size of the wound.	Then apply splints the moment you have finished setting the bone; and leave the wound open, that is, by making with scissors an opening in the coverings the size of the wound.	0.8295758
And be very careful not to tighten the wound with the fracture, as many foolish doctors have done this, causing their patients death or corroding disease or severe inflammation. And let your bandaging be light, soft, and different from the bandaging of other fractures.	And take the utmost care not to bandage up a wound with a fracture; for many ignorant doctors have done that, thereby causing their patients either death or ulceration or a defluxion; so make your bandage soft and loose, as opposed to that of other fractures.	0.9033638
And if the wound is large or a severe wound, and you fear any of the bad complications we have mentioned, and you find pain in the area, then you should not place splints over it, but wrap it with hard cloths instead of splints and secure it with them.	If the wound be severe or of great size and you fear for it some one of the grave accompaniments such as we have described, and the patient feels a disturbing pain at the place, then you should not put on splints; but instead of splints make wrappings of a stiff material and bind them on.	0.8755507
And after a day or two when the wound starts to form a scab, then remove the cloth you placed over it with wine, and then apply dressings and ointments with which we usually treat wounds, like tetrapharmacum ointment and similar ones.	If, after one or two days have passed, you see that the wound is beginning to suppurate, remove the dressing with wine that you had put on it, and then apply the pads and ointments with which it is our custom to heal wounds, such as Tetrapharmacon ointment and the like.	0.8724127
And you must loosen the bandage and examine the wound every day, morning and evening, until it is consolidated and firm, and the limb must be positioned in such a way that any rot drains away from it easily.	Every evening and morning you will have to loosen the bandaging and carefully examine the wound until it knits and is healed. You must also place the limb in such a position as to let the pus flow down easily.	0.80959284
If many days pass and the wound is not consolidated and the scab has not separated from it, then know that there are small fragments which you must search for in the wound with a probe. And remove and extract those fragments that are separated, and for those that are not separated and are causing pain and inflammation, you must incise them as much as is possible for you.	If, after many days, the wound is unhealed and it goes on suppurating, you may know that there are some little fragments of bone there; so you will have to examine the wound with a probe; and those fragments that are loose take and extract; and those that are not loose but nevertheless pierce the limb and cause pain, attempt to cut them out and extract them by whatever means you can.	0.8887347
And if the wound develops pus or discharge, such as abscesses, or any other type of corruption and putrefaction, then you must treat each of them with the appropriate remedies whose treatment has been previously described in its chapter.	If a defluxion or ulceration or other kind of corruption or putrefaction happen to the wound, you must meet all these occurrences with the proper remedy described before in its place.	0.8151961
And this is where my discourse must stay and you present your practice: when a large bone is broken, protruding over the limb like the thigh bone or the humerus and similar large limb bones, do not presume to pull or extract it because this often causes death; instead, leave it until it decays, as it will likely fall off by itself in around 20 or 30 days; and then treat the wound if you see fit, and if not, leave it alone.	One thing that is necessary is that you should comply with my words and keep them in mind: when a large bone is broken and protrudes from the limb, such as the femur, the humerus, and the other bones of the long limbs, do not meddle with pulling or extracting it, for this often causes death; but leave it to suppurate. It may come away of itself in twenty or thirty days. Then dress the wound if you find occasion; if not, let be.	0.8774916
Chapter 20:	CHAPTER TWENTY.	0.5619581
On the treatment of swelling that occurs at the site of a fracture.	On the treatment of the callus that remains from a fracture.	0.7001832
Many times this swelling occurs at the site of a healed fracture, especially if it is near the joints, and it deforms the shape of the limb; and it often prevents the limb from performing its natural function.	This callus often occurs after the healing of a fracture, especially one near a joint, and thereby the shape of the limb is spoilt; and sometimes there is limitation of the natural function of the limb.	0.8749899
Then consider if the swelling is recent and apply astringent medicines such as aloe, incense, myrrh, Serapias, and aristolochia, or similar; so take some or all of these and mix them with astringent wine, or egg white, or sour wine, and apply it to the swelling with tow, and compress it well.	Examine it, and if the callus be soft, apply astringent remedies to it, such as aloes, olibanum, myrrh, balsam of sarcocol, acacia, and the like. Take some or all of these; beat them up with a dry wine or egg-white or vinegar, apply to the callus on some tow and bind up firmly.	0.8190262
And leave the bandage in place without loosening it for many days; then loosen it and reapply another until the swelling is reduced; or compress it with a lead plate, because lead has the property of removing all swelling from limbs.	Leave the bandaging on for many days; then undo it and repeat until the callus is removed, God willing. Or bind on it a firm sheet of lead; for lead has the property of taking away lumps from limbs.	0.82461035
But if the swelling has already hardened and is tight, and it is necessary to remove it quickly, then cut it at the uppermost part, and incise the excess and prominent parts, or scrape it with some rasp until it is reduced; and treat it until it is healed.	But if the callus is stony hard and its removal is urgent, incise the place and cut away the superfluous prominence, or pare it away with a scraper until it is gone; and dress the wound until it heals.	0.8045685

On the restoration of a fracture when it is healed and the limb remains thin and fragile, not in its natural state.	On the treatment of a fracture when, after repair, the limb remains unnaturally thin.	0.7560027
When a bone fracture is restored, and afterwards the limb remains thin and fragile, this is due to several causes: one of which is the large number of bandages and their incorrect application; or excessive tightness of the bandages preventing nourishment from reaching the limb; or excessive embrocation; or excessive movement not at the right time; or lack of blood in the patient’s body and their weakness.	When a fractured bone has been repaired but the limb remains thin and weak, this may be due to many causes: the bandaging being too often loosened and not properly tightened; or excessive binding-up so that nourishment cannot flow to the limb; or excessive fomenting; or excessive and premature movement; or the thinness and weakness of the patient's blood.	0.88635874
The cure for this is to feed the patient and make their heart tender until their blood increases; and administer baths; and bring joy and happiness to them.	The treatment of this consists in the nourishing and restoring of his body so there be plenty of blood; and the use of the bath; and cheering the patient and making him happy, and so on.	0.8066827
And then apply a poultice to the limb, so that the poultice draws much nourishment to it, or continue embrocation with warm water, until the nourishment flows and the limb returns to its natural state.	Then apply pitch to the limb so that it may draw much nourishment to itself, or continue the massage to the limb with tepid water, so that nourishment flows in the limb and it returns to its normal shape.	0.8730687

On the treatment of broken bones when they are restored crookedly and inhibit their proper function.	On the treatment of fractured bones when they mend crooked and are inhibited from their proper functioning.	0.9601604
When it happens that a healed limb becomes crooked or prominent at the broken bone and swelling, and the shape of the limb is thus altered, but the limb is not inhibited from its natural function, you should not take the word of someone who thinks the limb is newly broken.	When a limb that has been set has some distortion after healing, or the bone that was broken has some prominence or callosity, so that the limb is deformed, but there is nevertheless no limitation of its natural movement, then you should not listen to those who think that the bone should be broken again.	0.76996195
But there have been many foolish doctors and restorers who have done this in our land; and this operation is very blameworthy, causing great fear, the sign of which is deadly.	In our parts there have been many ignorant doctors and bone-setters who have done this. The operation is most blameworthy and leads to great dangers, death itself not being the worst possibility.	0.7314497
But if the crookedness and swelling are recent, then they should be treated with warm water in which softening herbs have been boiled, such as marshmallow leaves and roots, mallow, and similar ones; and a poultice should be made with a softening plaster like well-made dyallachilon; or marshmallow root mucilage mixed with hen's fat or cerate oil, and applied as a plaster; or fatty figs mashed with pigeon dung, and similar medicinal substances that are named for consolidating.	But if the distortion and callosity be recent you should massage it with an infusion of the herbs that have an emollient quality, such as leaves and roots of the marsh mallow, and melilot and the like: and apply one of the emollient plasters such as carefully prepared diachylon. Or take mucilage of the root of the marsh mallow and beat it up with chicken fat and oil of sesame, and let a cataplasm of these be applied. Or take a fat fig and beat it up with pigeon's dung; and the like remedies that are termed 'inhibitors of scarring'.	0.8933837
And sometimes it is resolved with frequent gentle rubbing with wet hands, and the limb should be moved in all directions at all times.	Sometimes also the callosity is resolved by long-continued gentle friction with the hands; and constant movement in every direction should also be applied.	0.79447013
But if the crookedness has advanced and become hard and turned into a bony mass, and it needs surgical treatment, then the top layer must be scraped off and the continuity of the bone disrupted, and the excess swelling of the bone itself should be incised with fine instruments, and this should be done with care and diligence.	But if the deformity be long-standing and fixed and hardened and you are compelled to treat it operatively, you will have to cut down on it from above, and free the junction of the bone, and with fine chisels cut away the redundant callus or bone; be gentle in this, with diligence and care.	0.78425604

On the discussion of dislocation.	Discourse on dislocations.	0.8393214
Dislocation is the displacement of any of the joints from their place, preventing movement, and deforming the shape of the limb, causing the patient great pain and injury.	A dislocation is a displacement of any of the joints from its place, whereby the movement of the joint is hindered, the member is deformed, and the patient is caused violent pain and hurt.	0.89365077
So when a dislocation happens to someone, it must be immediately forced back, and not delayed, because if delayed, the area becomes inflamed, and very soon it becomes difficult to reduce the dislocation.	When anyone sustains a dislocation he should hasten to have it reduced, not delaying it at all. For if it is delayed the place will swell up and the reduction will be thereby made difficult.	0.81020105
Therefore, it should not be handled or stretched during the time of inflammation, because it often causes spasms and severe pain.	So it should not be delayed, nor moved or extended during the time it is swollen, for that often leads to spasm and excruciating pain.	0.90228564
But when this happens, you must quickly perform bloodletting on the patient, and then let it rest until the inflammation subsides; then the limb should be treated with warm water and oil, and it will be easily reduced.	Instead, when this occurs, you must hasten to venesect the patient, and then let be until the swelling has subsided a little. Then massage the member with hot water and oil and let it be gently reduced.	0.8393586
And every limb should be treated with the remedies appropriate for it, as will be described in their respective chapters.	And treat every member with the things that will be mentioned in their place.	0.64335597
And I have already organized the chapters on dislocation as preceded by the chapters on fractures; from the uppermost part of the body to the lowest part.	I have disposed the chapters on dislocations in the same order as the foregoing ones on fractures, that is, from the upper part of the body to the lower part.	0.8654418
Chapter XXIV	CHAPTER TWENTY-FOUR.	0.545584
On the treatment of dislocation of the lower jaw.	On the treatment of a dislocation of the lower jaw.	0.9936914
The two jaws are dislocated if they do not close properly; and the dislocation of both is caused in one of two ways: either they are slightly out of place and slightly loosened; or they are completely dislocated and entirely out of place, causing looseness at the joint, making the patient's saliva flow uncontrollably and preventing them from closing their mouth, and their speech is affected.	It is rare indeed for the jawbones to be dislocated. Their dislocation may be in one of two ways: either they may shift slightly from their place and be a little relaxed; or they may be completely and utterly dislocated so as to be relaxed down toward the breast so that the patient's saliva runs out and he cannot control it; nor is he able to close his mouth, and he stutters in speaking.	0.843863
But when the dislocation is slight, it often returns to its place by itself with minimal cause.	If it be only a slight displacement it will go back in most cases spontaneously without much trouble.	0.67239785
But if the dislocation is complete and entire, then the reduction must be performed gently and without delay.	But if the dislocation be complete and total it is necessary to set about the reduction of it at once without any delay.	0.8892067
The procedure involves the assistant holding the patient's head, while the physician inserts the thumb of one hand into the dislocated side of the jaw inside the mouth if the dislocation is on one side; or inserts both thumbs together if both sides are dislocated, with the other fingers outside to grip; and instructs the patient to relax their jaw and move it from side to side; the physician then aligns the jaw and pushes it back into place.	This is done thus: an assistant holds the patient's head and the doctor introduces into his mouth the thumb of one hand at the root of the jaw, if it be a dislocation on one side, or both thumbs if it be a bilateral dislocation, with the rest of the fingers outside to keep it straight. Then let him bid the patient relax his jaws and allow them to move in any direction; while the doctor sets the dislocation, thrusting the jaw until it return to its proper place.	0.92493606
If the reduction is difficult, especially if both jaws are dislocated, then apply steam with warm water and oil, making the reduction easier, and do not delay in reducing both as previously mentioned.	If the reduction be difficult, especially if it be a bilateral dislocation, administer a fomentation with hot water and oil, so that the reduction of both sides may be facilitated. And on no account delay the reduction, as we have said.	0.88366437
Once they are returned and aligned, and the patient's mouth is closed and not loosened, then place on them cloth dusted with a plaster made of wax and rose oil; and gently bind it with soft bandages.	When the reduction and straightening have been done and the patient's mouth closes and is not relaxed, then apply to both sides dressings steeped in wax prepared from wax and oil of roses. Then bind it up gently, with a loose bandage.	0.8215847
The patient should sleep on their back, with their head supported between two pillows, so it doesn't turn to the right or left; do not force them to chew anything; rather, their food should be liquid until the pain subsides and the jaws are set, then they can chew what they want.	The patient should sleep lying on his back with his head held between two pillows so that he does not move it either to right or to left; nor should he burden himself with chewing but should be on a diet of broth of corn starch until the pain is gone and the jaw is firm; then he may eat whatever he wishes.	0.893057
This should be managed with ease, and do not stress the opening of the mouth for eating, drinking, or yawning, until the jaw is set and healed.	Let him use it gently; let him not work his mouth heavily in eating or drinking or yawning until the jaw is firmly knit and healed.	0.7596948
If it is difficult to reduce both jaws when dislocated and they are not returned to their place, then often this causes fever and persistent sweating, and soon the patient's stomach becomes upset, and they frequently vomit pure bile.	If the reduction of both sides is hard when it is a simultaneous bilateral dislocation, and there is no return to the proper position, then thereby in many cases fevers and perpetual headaches occur; sometimes the patient's belly is loosened and he vomits actual bile.	0.8344995
When you see this, know that it is a bad sign; and often the person who experiences this dies within ten days.	When you see this you will know that he is doomed; in most cases in which this happens death follows in ten days.	0.8033716

On the reduction of dislocation of the collarbone and the extremity of the muscle.	On the reduction of a dislocation of the clavicle and of the head of the humerus.	0.8680266
The collarbone is not dislocated inward due to its connection with the chest; but sometimes it is dislocated outward, and this is felt by touch.	The clavicle is never dislocated inwards because of its continuity with the breast-bone; but sometimes it is dislocated outwards, and then it is detected by palpation.	0.84867334
The reduction is done by having the patient lie on their back and extend their arms. Then press the area firmly with your palm, and it will return to place.	The replacement is thus: the patient is to lie on his back and stretch out both arms; then with the palm of your hand press heavily upon the place and it will go back.	0.8423752
Then apply a plaster and powder to the area and bind it tightly.	Then apply to it the plaster and pads, and bandage it up.	0.7406102
But the extremity that follows the elbow and is connected to it is not easily dislocated; when it is, it must be reduced and aligned as previously described and according to the method prepared.	As to the extremity of the clavicle, which is close to the shoulder and joined to it, it is only rarely dislocated; but if ever it is dislocated you must reduce it and set it straight as we have mentioned, by any convenient means.	0.7321115
Then apply a plaster, powder, and binding, and instruct the patient to remain tranquil and at rest until it is healed.	Then apply the plaster, pads, and bandages, and bid the patient keep quiet and still until it is healed.	0.93256605
And the same treatment is applied to the muscle extremity when it is separated from its place.	By this same treatment you may also reduce the head of the humerus when it is displaced.	0.54030013
Chapter XXVI	CHAPTER TWENTY-SIX.	0.54115987
On the reduction of dislocation of the muscle.	On the reduction of a dislocation of the humerus.	0.83848035
Know that the muscle is dislocated in only three ways, one of which is that it is dislocated downward towards the armpit.	You should know that there are three ways in which the humerus may be dislocated.	0.66449344
The second is that it is dislocated upward, which happens rarely; it is not dislocated backward towards the shoulder blade, nor is it dislocated forward towards the nerves.	One is a dislocation down into the axilla, another is a dislocation toward the breast; it may also be dislocated upward, which is rare. It is not dislocated backward, because of the scapula; nor is it dislocated forward, on account of the tendons.	0.7540697
It is mostly dislocated outward and downward towards the armpit, especially in those with little flesh, where it dislocates easily; but in those with more flesh, it is more difficult to dislocate.	Mostly it is dislocated and displaced down into the axilla, and particularly in those of a spare build; in such it quickly comes out and quickly goes back. But in those of a fleshy build it is the opposite; it comes out with difficulty and goes back with difficulty.	0.7639086
Often, due to a blow or fall, the muscle becomes inflamed and is mistaken for a dislocation.	Sometimes a man suffers a blow or a fall, so that the upper arm swells up with an effusion, whence he forms the opinion that there is a dislocation.	0.59321624
Therefore, you must ascertain this before being certain, and then proceed with the treatment.	So you must examine it to make sure of it and then proceed to treat it.	0.87517476
The dislocation is recognized when it is downward towards the armpit; you distinguish between the dislocated muscle and the healthy muscle by noting a noticeable difference; you find a concavity at the head of the muscle and below the armpit towards the muscle head's touch like an egg, and the patient cannot bring their hand to their ear or move it in all directions.	A dislocation down into the axilla may be diagnosed by comparing the sound and the dislocated humerus; for you will find an obvious difference between them; you will find a hollow at the head of the humerus, and in the axilla the head of the humerus may be palpated like an egg, and the patient is unable to lift his hand to his ear, and full movements are restricted.	0.8124068
If it is dislocated towards the chest or upward, then you find a clear touch, and it is not hidden.	Similarly if it is displaced toward the breast or upward you will find it obvious to the touch and not hidden.	0.8303077
This dislocation is easily reduced when it is recent and the patient is a child.	The reduction of this dislocation will be quite simple if it be only recent or the patient be a child.	0.8299425
The reduction involves the assistant raising the patient's hand upwards; then placing the thumbs below the armpit, and lifting the joint forcefully to its place, raising the patient's hand and extending it upwards; then gently resting it as it returns easily.	To reduce it, his hand should be lifted up by an assistant, then you should put both your thumbs under his axilla and lift the joint up powerfully into its place, while the assistant lifts and stretches his hand upward; then he puts it down and the dislocation will at once go back.	0.8190978
But if it does not return as we have said, and many days have passed since the dislocation occurred, then the patient should be bathed in warm water and given a poultice to soften and relax as if it were made from marshmallow root, fenugreek, and melilot in water, and this should be applied.	If it is not reduced by the means we have stated, being a dislocation of many days' standing, the patient should take a hot bath and use relaxing and softening fomentations, such as decoction of marsh mallow root and fenugreek and melilot.	0.8237064
Then the patient should lie on their back and a woolen pad of moderate firmness be placed under the armpit, and the doctor places their heel on the pad, lifting the muscle head forcefully, and pulling the patient's hand to prevent downward movement, while another assistant holds the patient's head to prevent downward movement, so it returns to its place quickly.	Then the patient should lie on his back and you put under his axilla a ball of wool of moderately hard consistency. Then the doctor should put his heel on the ball and grasp the patient's hand and draw it downward, while pushing the ball with his foot, and it will straightway be reduced.	0.8287159
If you prefer, reduce it this way: have a person taller than the patient stand on the side and place their shoulder under the patient's armpit, lifting it upwards until the patient is suspended in the air, while another assistant pulls the patient's hand downward from their abdomen. But if the patient is light, they should be suspended with additional weight, so it adds enough weight, causing the dislocation to return quickly.	Or, if you prefer, reduce it in this way: get a man taller than the patient to stand on one side and pass his shoulder under the patient's axilla and lift it up until the patient is suspended in mid-air, while another assistant pulls the patient's hand down towards his lower abdomen (if the patient is light it will be necessary to hang a weight from him); then the dislocation will straightway be reduced.	0.8902446
Another easy method is to place a long wooden pole on the ground with a round top, like a pestle, not too thick or thin, and place it under the patient; then cover the top of the pole with soft cloths, have the patient lie along the length of the pole, and extend their arm downward from the other side; and stretch their body on the opposite side forcefully, so the joint returns to its place quickly.	It is also reduced by another method: that is, to fix in. the ground a long spar of wood; its head should be of a round shape like the pestle of a mortar, neither massive nor slender; then after a soft pad has been put on the head of the spar it should be placed under the axilla of the patient, who should be standing alongside the spar; then let his hand be drawn downward on one side and his body on the other, powerfully. Then the joint will immediately return to its place.	0.83461046
If reducing it is difficult despite all the mentioned methods, use this method: take a wooden pole about two arms long, four fingers wide, and its thickness reduced under the armpit according to this shape:	If it proves difficult to reduce it by any of the means we have stated, employ this treatment: take a wooden spar some two cubits in length, two fingers thick, and four wide; it should have a round head to facilitate its introduction into the hollow of the axilla; of this shape.	0.8208202
Then wrap the round top with soft cloth so the pole does not hurt the patient.	Then you bind on the round head soft rags so that the wood will not hurt the patient.	0.864043
Then place it under the patient's armpit, and extend their hand or arm over the pole downward, and tie the pole around the support and the arm and hand extremity.	Then it is placed under the patient's axilla, and his whole hand and arm are stretched down over the spar, which is to be bound down to the upper arm, the forearm, and the tip of the hand.	0.829762
Then place the arm on a step of a ladder horizontally, extending the hand downward, and suspend the body on the other side, so the joint repositions quickly.	Then let the arm be placed cross-wise over the rung of a ladder and the hand stretched downward, and let the rest of the body hang down on the other side; then the joint will very quickly go back.	0.8498098
Once the repositioning is complete by any method possible for you, place a wool pad of equal size under the armpit; then apply a poultice made of ground flour mixed with vinegar and egg white over the whole muscle, wrapping it, and bandage it tightly under the armpit; the bandage should be wrapped over the poultice, and the hand attached to the neck, leaving it immobile for seven days.	Once it has gone back properly, in whatever way is possible, there should be put under the axilla a ball of wool of moderate size; then apply the plaster prepared from mill-dust with olibanum and egg-white, all round the shoulder. Then firmly bandage the ball under the axilla and carry the bandaging round over the plaster. Sling his hand from his neck, then let him be left without moving his hand for a week.	0.8369691
The patient's food intake should be limited until the limb is strengthened, as this aids in recovery.	The patient's diet should be light until the limb gets strong, for that will hasten the cure.	0.79284203
Afterward, increase the food intake gradually after seven or five days and encourage some movement; if it stabilizes without softening, then it is healed.	After five or seven days it can be unfastened and he can make trial of its movement; if it is firm and not slack then it is healed.	0.72165
But if the joint frequently dislocates due to humidity or other causes, then it should be treated with cauterization with three burns, as previously mentioned in the chapter on cautery.	If the joint is frequently dislocated, on account of a humidity arising in it or some other cause, then use should be made of the cautery with three prongs spoken of earlier, in the book on cauterizations.	0.81175965
If after seven days the bandage is removed and the joint is not stable, and the poultice and bandage have been reapplied several times without success, and the arm cannot be raised upwards, know that the nerves at the muscle head are either cut, stretched, or softened, and the joint will never be set in its place.	If you do all this and loosen the bandaging after a week and the joint is still not firm, and you repeatedly plaster it and bandage it, and it is still loose and comes down and dislocates and you are unable to raise it up, then you may know that the tendons at the head of the humerus are either cut through or stretched or loosened; in which case you may know that the joint will never stay firm in its place.	0.80698377
For the dislocation towards the chest and the breast or the back parts, reduction is done by pushing and extending with the hands until it returns.	As to the dislocation toward the chest and breast, and posteriorly, the reduction of this is done by thrusting and extension with both hands until it goes back.	0.8761097
Apply the other bandage to it, and treat it until it is healed.	And apply the usual bandaging and treatment until it is healed.	0.6389634
If after healing, the limb feels heavy and movement is slow, the patient should take frequent baths until the heaviness is relieved and the limb returns to its original state.	If, after it has healed, a callosity arises in it, and it is slow in movement, the patient should take frequent hot baths until that callosity is softened and the member returns to its original condition.	0.81068516
Chapter XXVII	CHAPTER TWENTY-SEVEN.	0.5489913
On the treatment of elbow dislocation.	On the treatment of a dislocation of the elbow.	0.9822215
Know that the elbow joint is dislocated with difficulty and likewise returns with difficulty; it dislocates in all directions, mostly forward or backward, and its dislocation is not hidden from you as it is felt beneath the clothing or touch in whatever shape it is dislocated, and when you compare the dislocated elbow with the healthy one, it is clear to you, as the joint is concave and cannot bend the arm or touch the muscle with it.	The elbow is with difficulty dislocated and with difficulty put back. Now dislocation may be in all directions, and particularly forward and backward. Whatever way it is dislocated it will not be concealed from you, because it is both visible and palpable, and whenever you compare the dislocated elbow with the sound one it is quite openly and plainly manifested; for the elbow joint is hollow and the patient cannot flex the forearm back or touch his shoulder with it.	0.88680136
You must act quickly and reduce the dislocation before it becomes an inflamed abscess, for if it turns into an inflamed abscess, it is difficult to reduce, and it does not heal easily; especially when it is backward, as it is the worst type of dislocation, with the most pain, and often leads to death.	You must hasten and reduce the dislocation as rapidly as possible before an abscess occur. For if an abscess occur the reduction of it is difficult and maybe it will never be healed; especially when it is a posterior dislocation, for this is the worst and most painful of all the kinds of dislocation, and often it is fatal.	0.8886238
The restoration, when it is possible to reduce, is done by extending the hand with both hands, and the arm stretched out, with the doctor's hands on the elbow above and below, pushing the joint with the thumbs together, or with the palm's edge until it returns to its place.	Now when it is one of those that can be reduced, the way to reduce it is for an assistant to perform a two-handed extension of the patient's hand, the patient's forearm being opened out, while the doctor's hands are above and below the elbow joint and he thrusts the joint with both thumbs together or with the root of his palm, until it returns to its place.	0.82232785
But if the dislocation is forward, then it is returned by bending the hand with one's own hand until the elbow is struck with the palm's edge.	If it be an anterior dislocation, it may go back if the hand is bent sharply back until it strikes its own shoulder with the root of the palm.	0.78480023
If the dislocation does not yield to reduction, then administer vigorous and very strong extension.	If the dislocation does not respond to reduction, apply very strong and powerful extension.	0.9066236
Two assistants should extend the arm, holding it firmly so it is not moved during the extension.	For this, let two assistants pull on the arm while two other assistants hold the patient against the extension.	0.61434114
Then the arm should be turned in all directions after being wrapped in a long cloth or bandage.	Then the arm should be rotated in all directions after the limb has been wrapped in a long folded cloth or a broad wrapper.	0.9400395
When the doctor touches the joint with their hand, they should oil it to facilitate lubrication and ease, then push the joint forcefully until it returns.	When the doctor begins manipulating the joint he should anoint his hands with oil so as to assist, by its lubrication, the movement of the joint; then he should thrust the joint powerfully until it goes back.	0.8454632
After reduction, a poultice with astringency and drying properties mixed with egg white should be applied, bandaged tightly, and the arm suspended from the neck, left for several days.	After its reduction he should apply to it a plaster having some styptic and absorbent qualities, with egg-white; and put on a firm bandage and suspend the patient's arm from his neck and leave it for some days.	0.7833054
Then it should be unwrapped; if the joint is stable in its place, the bandage can be removed and left off.	Then undo it; and if the joint remains fixed in its place, then untie the bandaging and leave it.	0.84269595
If the joint does not seem stable, reapply the poultice and bandage, leaving it for several days until it stabilizes; then unwrap it again.	If you see that the joint is not thoroughly firm, replace the plaster and bandaging and leave it for a few more days until it is firm; then untie it.	0.88759995
If heaviness occurs after joint reduction, and movement is difficult, administer moistening baths, gentle rubbing, and compression until relieved; or apply fat-tail sheep’s rump, which is very fatty, to the joint; bandage it, and leave it on the bone day and night. Then remove it, bathe the joint; when dry, rub it with gentle friction, and reapply the fat-tail sheep’s rump, doing this once, twice, and three times, the corruption has already come over the knee from the bath entry, until it is smooth.	If, after the reduction and unbandaging of the joint, it becomes stiff and is difficult to move, soften it in the bath and apply gentle friction and massage until it is softened, or apply to the joint the tail of a fat-tailed sheep; bind it on and leave it on for a day and a night; then remove it and send him to the bath, and when he sweats apply moderate friction to the joint; then replace the tail and again and again, alternating with the bath, until the joint softens.	0.8890723
If you wish, apply a humid and heated cow's spleen to the joint, pressing it on; do this several times, as it is moist and helps restore its condition.	If you prefer, apply to it, and bandage on, fresh cow-dung lightened with butter. Do this a number of times and it will soften and return it to its original state.	0.7532643

On the treatment of wrist dislocation, which is the joint between the arm and the hand.	On the treatment of a dislocation of the wrist.	0.7188806
The wrist is sometimes dislocated, and the reduction of the dislocation is easy, unlike other joints, but it is important to reduce it quickly before it becomes an inflamed abscess.	The carpus of the hand is often dislocated. Unlike other joints, the reduction is easy, but there should be haste to reduce it as soon as it is dislocated, before the place swells or an abscess occur.	0.8079139
The reduction is done by placing the patient’s wrist on a table, with an assistant extending the hand, while the doctor presses on the joint prominence with his hand or palm, pushing until it returns to its place.	The way of reducing the dislocation is to place the patient's wrist upon a board while an assistant stretches the hand, and the doctor puts the palm of his hand upon the prominence of the joint and applies pressure on it until it goes back.	0.85510147
However, if the palm is already facing the forearm, the patient should place the back of the hand on the table for extension and reduction; if the dislocation is towards the back of the hand, the hand should be positioned palm down on the table so the doctor’s hand can press on the joint prominence.	But he should examine: if it is a displacement toward the ventral aspect of the hand, the patient should place the back of his hand upon the board for extension and reduction; but if it be a luxation toward the dorsum of the hand, then the inner part of the hand should be laid upon the board so that the doctor's hand may come upon the prominence of the joint itself.	0.8325921
If it returns quickly, it is good; if not, then apply a poultice to prevent abscess and leave it; do not repeat this, as it may not endure further reduction attempts.	If it go back at once, good; but if not, bandage it with a plaster that settles swelling and let it be. Do not revert to it, for it will not tolerate that, and you will not be able to effect its reduction after some days have passed.	0.7743982
But if the joint remains twisted, it does not harm the patient except the hand becomes weak and cannot grip; then know the nerves are cut or bruised, and the only remedy is cauterization near the injury, which may help somewhat.	But the joint will retain its deformity; and the patient will in no wise be harmed except if his hand is slackened so that he be unable to grip anything; then you may know that the tendons are either severed or bruised. In this situation there is no method but to strengthen it by cauterization; this sometimes helps but sometimes is of no use at all.	0.8332665
Once the wrist is returned, apply the poultice as recommended, leave it and bandage it for five days; then remove the bandage and exercise the hand.	When the reduction of the joint is complete, apply to it the plaster we have described, then bandage it and leave it for five days; then loosen it and try out the hand.	0.86096436
But if movement is restricted and heaviness occurs, relieve it with warm water and gentle rubbing several times until it is alleviated.	If movement be hampered and any hardness occur in it, soften it repeatedly with hot water and sweating until it be softened.	0.8348216

When a finger is dislocated towards the back or the palm, extend the finger and push the dislocation with your thumbs until it returns.	When one of the fingers is dislocated dorsally or ventrally, then extend the finger and thrust the dislocation with your thumb until it goes back.	0.91034186
Then support the finger tip and suspend it towards the dislocated direction, leaving it for two days.	Then bind the head of the phalanx, suspending it in the direction in which it was dislocated, and leave it for two days.	0.78196466
Then suspend it and extend it until it is straightened on that same day.	Then unbind it and extend it so that it may straighten out all that day.	0.8219876
At night, bandage it as described, and during the day, unwrap and exercise it, rebandaging it at night; do this for several days until it is stable.	Then at nightfall bind it in just the same way.

When any of the vertebrae of the back or the neck are completely dislocated or a number of vertebrae are displaced, there is no treatment in this case for death is hastening toward the patient.	0.83453166
A sign of this is involuntary excretion, and inability to retain it; often some limbs become paralyzed, such as both legs, both arms, or one of them; or one vertebra is displaced, which sometimes shifts to four directions.	The sign of this is that the injured man passes a motion involuntarily, being unable to hold it back; often too some of his limbs go limp, either both legs or both arms or one of them. If, as often happens, a single vertebra is displaced, the displacement may be in any of four directions.	0.8972691
This displacement to the back is called kyphosis.	When there is a displacement backwards it is called 'curvature of the spine'.	0.6105454
But treatment depends on whether kyphosis occurred in childhood, as then there is no cure or complete recovery.	As to its treatment: examine it; if the curvature dates from childhood then there is no treatment or cure at all for it.	0.5789295
But for kyphosis caused by injury or trauma, the Ancients have described detailed treatment methods, which mostly provide benefit; I have summarized these to avoid excessive detail, while aligning with my intent to explain, forming a diverse set of instruments to demonstrate and apply them.	As for the sort that occurs from a fall or a blow or the like, the Ancients indulged in lengthy dissertations thereon, giving many kinds of treatment, the greater part of which is of no use. But I have abbreviated from it, making a little which will serve in place of their much, consisting in my clarification and exposition of the sense. I have also depicted the instrument differently from their account and their explanation.	0.7335285
Only kyphosis in the back can be treated with the method I will describe.	The only curvature that can be treated is that of the dorsal spine exclusively, by the means I now describe.	0.75422955
The patient should lie face down on a level place near a wall, with a soft pad underneath to avoid chest injury.	The patient should be stretched prone upon a level bench near a wall, and a soft palliasse should be spread under him so that his chest may not be hurt.	0.8656505
A straight post should be placed upright in the ground at the head of the patient’s place, and another at the feet.	Then put a straight spar, set in a hole in the ground at the end of the bench where his head is, and another spar where his feet are at the other end of the bench.	0.65313363
One assistant holds the post at the head, without fixing it in a hole, and another holds the one at the feet similarly.	Let an assistant hold this spar, which is not to be firmly fixed in the hole, while another assistant holds the other in the same way.	0.7445323
Then wrap a strong band around the patient’s head and under the armpits; extend it to the post at the head and tie it there; similarly, tie another band around the hips and thighs, and secure it to the post at the feet.	Then wind round the patient's chest and beneath his axillae a soft strong wrapper, and stretch one end of the wrapper to the spar at his head, and tie it to it. Then bind other wrappers: over his hips, his knees, and by both tendons of Achilles; then bring the wrappers together and tie them to the other spar at his feet.	0.8476656
Each assistant then tightens the bands towards the posts; the posts and bands remain in place, not firmly fixed as described.	Then each assistant extends the spar with the tie towards himself; the two spars will not shift from their places in which they are planted, but, as we have said, they are not to be fixed.	0.69029236
The doctor then presses the vertebra with his palms firmly until it returns, or places a board over it and applies pressure with his feet until it returns.	Meanwhile the doctor is to press hard with both his palms upon the spine until it goes back; or he may place a board upon it and apply pressure to the board with his feet until it goes back.	0.89065945
If it does not return this way, use a board about three cubits wide or long, and make a hole in the wall near the patient where the end of the board fits. Then place half of the board over the vertebra, and the doctor applies pressure with his feet on the other end, tightening it until the vertebra returns to its place.	But if it does not go back under this treatment then let a board be taken, about three cubits long, and let a place be hollowed out in the wall, which, as we said, should be near the patient, into which you put the end of the board; then place the mid-point of the board upon the hump, and he—the doctor—should place both his feet on the other end and strongly thrust upon the spine until it is forced back into position.	0.8559495
If preferred, use a turning device operated by hand; place two posts, each a cubit long, in the ground near the patient's head and another two at the feet, with a space of one palm's width between each; make holes in each post for a rotating rod, firmly fixed in the ground.	If you wish you may operate by means of a winch turned by hand; thus: you fix in the ground at the head of the patient, at one end of the bench, two wooden spars each one cubit long; and the same at the lower end, at his feet; there should be the distance of a span between the spars (of each pair).	0.8358243
Insert a round rod for the rotating device through the holes in the two posts.	Then you introduce a round piece of wood, the shaft on which the rope is wound, into the two openings of the two wooden spars.	0.5780628
At the end of the rod, there is a hole to fit a handle one palm long for turning; the other two posts have similar holes.	At one end of each shaft is a hole into which is firmly fixed a piece of wood a span long by which it is wound. Likewise with the other two spars.	0.71757144
Tighten the bands from the patient's chest into the holes near the head, and the bands from the thighs into the turning device near the feet.	Then bind the wrapper that you have bound round his chest to the shaft at the patient's head, and those bound round his legs to the shaft at his feet.	0.7552258
Each assistant turns the device by hand while the doctor adjusts the vertebra as described.	Then have an assistant standing at each shaft to turn with his hand the handle by which the shaft is revolved, while the doctor straightens out the curvature in the way we have described.	0.70439994
Once the vertebra is returned and the position corrected, apply a drying poultice with egg white, then wool; place over the poultice a splint from a board three fingers wide or so, long enough to cover the kyphosis area, and over the healthy part of the spine.	After the spine has been restored and the place has been straightened it will be necessary for you to apply an absorbent plaster with egg-white, then packing, then over the plaster apply a flat splint about three fingers wide and long enough to cover the site of the curvature and several sound vertebrae on either side.	0.77608836
Bandage it as described, and let the patient use light nourishment until healed.	Then let it be bandaged as is needful and let the patient follow a mild diet until he is cured.	0.7798536
If any prominence remains at the end of healing, administer softening medicines and use the board treatment for a long time as recommended; sometimes a lead sheet is applied.	If after he is healed there still remains some prominence at the site, it will be necessary to employ remedies to relax and soften the parts, together with the use for a long time of the flat splint we described; in this case a leaden plate may be employed.	0.7364996
Sometimes a prominence appears behind the spinal vertebrae, mistaken for dislocation; this bone prominence should not be treated with this method, as it can quickly lead to death.	Sometimes there occurs a prominence at the end of the dorsal vertebrae, from which one may form the opinion that there is a dislocation, whereas it will be a superfluous bone that has become prominent; do not interfere with it by this treatment, for death may result.	0.7957885
Chapter .31.	CHAPTER THIRTY-ONE.	0.57490647
On the treatment of a dislocated hip.	On the treatment of a dislocated hip.	1.0
You should know that the hip joint and the muscle joint only suffer dislocation, and they are not affected in the same way as other joints with slight displacement and concavity.	You should know that a complete dislocation alone is sustained by the hip and shoulder joints; they do not sustain the lesser displacements, with concavity, as do the other joints.	0.84986097
The hip joint can be dislocated in four ways: inward, outward, forward, or backward.	Now the hip joint is dislocated in four directions, interior, exterior, posterior, and anterior.	0.822057
It is mostly dislocated inward, and rarely forward or backward.	Most commonly it is dislocated interiorly; and rarely is it dislocated anteriorly or posteriorly.	0.90800506
The sign of inward dislocation is when you compare the patient's healthy leg with the affected one, it appears longer and the knee is more prominent than the healthy one, and the patient cannot bend their foot towards the groin, which is swollen due to a severe abscess because the femoral head has moved there.	The indication of an internal dislocation is that when you compare the patient's sound leg with the injured leg it will be longer and the knee will be prominent as compared with that of the sound leg; nor will it be possible for the patient to flex the foot back on the groin; and there will be an obvious swelling near the groin because the head of the femur has moved there.	0.8822194
The sign of outward dislocation is that the symptoms are opposite to those of inward dislocation.	The sign of the occurrence of an external dislocation: the symptoms will be the exact contrary to these.	0.7448719
The sign of forward dislocation is that the leg extends normally but cannot be bent without pain in the knee; if forced to walk, the patient cannot move forward, their urine is retained, the groin is swollen, and they walk on their heel.	The sign of an anterior dislocation is that the patient can stretch his leg out fully but cannot flex it without feeling pain in the knee; and if he tries to walk he will be unable to walk forward; and he has retention of the urine and his groin swells, and in walking he hobbles upon his heel.	0.8829738
The sign of backward dislocation is that the knee cannot be extended or bent forward towards the groin, the affected leg is shorter than the other, the groin is softened, and the femoral head is at that location.	The sign of a posterior dislocation is that he cannot extend the knee, nor can he flex it before flexing the hip; also the leg will be shorter than the other, the groin will be relaxed, and the head of the femur will be evident at the lumbar region.	0.8573437
But the reduction of these types of dislocations depends on whether the dislocation is old and longstanding; if it has become chronic, the reduction and retention of it in its place is not effective, so it should not be attempted.	As to the reduction of the various forms of this dislocation, you must examine the case and if it be an old dislocation which the patient has suffered from for a long time and the reduction of which has not been contrived and which remains as it was, there is no treatment for it at all, nor should any be attempted.	0.6622326
But if the dislocation is recent and is one of the four types, then promptly return the joint by extending it inward and outward, moving it right and left, as it quickly returns to its place and no further treatment is needed.	But in that case whose dislocation is recent, whichever of the four kinds of dislocation it be, hasten to rotate the joint and extend it internally and externally and move it to the right and the left; for often it will return and no further treatment will be needed.	0.89510727
But if it does not return in this way, prepare a strong assistant to extend the patient's leg from below, either with their hands or with a band tied above the knee; another assistant extends the patient's arm so that their hands are under the armpits; then tighten a strong band around the thigh and have another assistant hold the end of the band.	But if it does not go back thus, you must have ready a sturdy and powerful assistant to extend the leg from below, either with both his hands or with a wrapper bound upon the leg above the knee; while another assistant pulls from above by putting his hands under the patient's axillae; then you should bind a soft wrapper upon the root of the thigh, with a third assistant to hold the end of the bandage.	0.92598677
Extend the leg either inward towards the groin or backward towards the back.	Then extension should be made either anteriorly from the direction of the groin to the direction of the clavicle, or posteriorly toward the dorsal spine.	0.6528061
Extend all parts at once until the patient is lifted off the ground and remains suspended.	Let them all make their extension simultaneously so the patient is lifted up bodily and remains suspended.	0.7722825
This type of extension is common to all four types of dislocations.	This kind of extension is common to all four kinds of dislocation.	0.99451226
If the dislocation returns as we have described, it will be good; otherwise, specific treatments will be necessary for each type.	If the dislocation goes back by the way we have said, good. Otherwise, each kind must have the special treatment I shall describe.	0.860904
In the specific reduction for inward dislocation, the patient should lie on their healthy side; place the band around the thigh at the spot between the femoral head and the area below the groin; extend the band from the groin to the highest part of the shoulder.	When it is an internal dislocation then the special reduction is for the patient to lie upon his sound side; then apply a wrapper to the root of the hip in the space between the head of the femur and the part below the groin; then carry the bandage upward from the groin toward the upper part of the body, in the direction of the clavicle.	0.84719086
Then, a strong assistant takes hold of the patient's arms, supports the upper part of the affected thigh, and extends it outward with strong traction, causing it to return to its place.	Then another powerful and sturdy assistant is to take hold of his arms while the thick part of the afflicted thigh is clasped and strongly extended outward; then it will return to its place.	0.80424273
This type of treatment is easier and more effective for reducing this kind of dislocation than the other types.	This kind of treatment is easier than the others for the reduction of this limb.	0.82313585
But if you are uncertain and do not follow this method completely, tie the patient's feet together with a strong, light band around both heels and knees.	But if you find it refractory and it does not answer to this method of treatment, then the patient's two feet will have to be bound together with a strong soft bandage round his two ankles and his two knees.	0.79289585
Each leg should be tied four fingers apart, with the affected leg extended two fingers more than the other.	The distance from each to the next should be four fingers, and the injured leg should be stretched two fingers beyond the other.	0.8750304
Then suspend the patient by the head of the post in the house; the distance from the ground should be two cubits.	Then the patient is to reach upward and grasp any beam that may be in the house; he should be about two cubits from the floor.	0.7171761
Instruct a strong young man to reduce the femoral head, and have another young man suspended with the patient, pushing with force so that the joint quickly returns to its place.	Then tell a powerful servant to clasp the head of the hip and another servant to hang from the patient; and the other servant, the one who is clasping the hip, should thrust powerfully; then the hip will speedily go back.	0.65913165
In the specific reduction for outward dislocation, the patient should lie on a cushion as previously described for the yellow disease; tightly wrap the band around the affected leg and chest.	The special method of reduction in the case of an external dislocation: it will be necessary for the patient to be lying on a bench after the manner described for the one with a curvature of the spine; but wrappers are to be tied only on the injured leg and the chest.	0.73431003
Place two posts, one at the patient's feet and the other at the head; then place posts in the middle of the cushion wrapped with damp cloths to prevent the patient from being harmed by the post between their thighs, ensuring that the extension is not pulled downward.	Then the two spars are to be set in position, one at his feet and another at his head; and have an additional spar firmly fixed in the middle of the bench and wrapped in soft cloth so as not to injure the patient; this spar is to be between his thighs so that he will not be dragged down during extension.	0.88813806
Each assistant extends their part, and the physician guides the reduction with their hand according to the art.	Then each assistant is to pull in his own direction while the doctor sets the hip with his hands.	0.6638602
For forward dislocation, the leg should be gently extended in the same way on a cushion; the physician places the palm of their right hand on the affected groin, compressing it with the other hand, and with this compression, extends it downward towards the knee.	When it is an anterior dislocation, extension will have to be applied forcefully to the patient's leg, on the bench, exactly as described; the doctor should place the palm of his right hand upon the injured groin and then apply pressure with the other hand, directing the pressure so as to make extension downward toward the knee.	0.87188077
For backward dislocation, the patient should not be extended downward but lifted from the ground; they should be placed on a hard surface, as described for outward dislocation, lying on their face with the bands extended as previously mentioned.	If it is a posterior dislocation the patient must not be raised above the ground and extended downward; rather must he be placed upon something hard, in the manner that we prescribed for an external displacement of the hip: he is to lie prone on the bench with the bands tied as we said before.	0.8516704
Apply compression with a board over the area where the joint protrudes.	It will also be necessary to apply pressure with the board to the site to which the joint has been displaced.	0.69936967
When the reduction is properly done — the sign that it is successful is that both legs can be extended equally and the patient can flex and extend the affected leg without pain, indicating the joint has returned to its place — then adjust both thighs, apply a poultice and bandage tightly to keep the hip stable, and let the patient rest for three to four days.	When the proper reduction of the joint is completed—the signs of reduction will be plain to you; namely, that you extend both the patient's legs, and when you see that both legs are of equal length and the patient can draw up and stretch out the leg without difficulty, then you may know that the limb has gone back as it should—then bring both thighs together, apply the plaster and bind with a sash so that the hip does not move in any direction; and the patient is to keep perfectly quiet for three or four days.	0.8724858
Afterwards, remove the bandage and poultice, and compare one leg with the other.	Then loosen the bandage and the plaster, and compare the leg with the other.	0.90086156
If the legs appear equal and stable, the dislocation is fixed, and the patient can be allowed to walk.	If you see that they are both the same size you may know that the dislocation is cured and you can allow the patient to walk freely.	0.70153606
If there is any sign of softness, reapply the poultice and bandage it tightly as before, and leave it for three days.	But if you see any slackening then repeat: replaster and rebandage as you did at first, and leave for another three days. Then unfasten.	0.6825545
Afterwards, remove it and allow the patient to walk gradually over a few days until they are fully strengthened.	Then unfasten. He should be cautious about walking on it for some days, until it is thoroughly strong, God willing.	0.6301183

On the treatment of a dislocated knee.	On dislocation of the knee.	0.7519522
The knee is dislocated in three ways: outward, inward, and downward but mostly backward; it is not dislocated forward.	The knee is dislocated in three ways; it is dislocated interiorly and exteriorly and inferiorly, that is, posteriorly. It is never dislocated anteriorly.	0.890702
The sign of dislocation is when you ask the patient to bend their leg at the knee; then you will know that the knee is dislocated.	The sign of dislocation is to bid the patient flex his leg on his thigh, and if it does not reach the thigh you may know the knee is dislocated.	0.83427167
The method to restore any type of knee dislocation is to have the patient sit straight, extending their leg if they can; place your knees against their thigh, and put their foot between your feet; then place your palms on their knee, holding it firmly with your fingers, while another assistant extends their foot until the knee returns to its place.	The way of setting all the types of dislocation is to make the patient sit down with both legs extended, if he can, with an assistant sitting behind him to hold him by the middle and incline him slightly backward. Then do you yourself sit on his thighs with your back to his front, and put his leg between yours; then the palms of your hands should be applied to his knee, and join them together by twining the fingers; then with the palms put strong pressure on both sides of his knee while another assistant extends his foot until the knee goes back to its place.	0.8773129
The sign of successful reduction is that the leg can be easily bent without pain.	The sign of its return is that the leg can be flexed back easily and without hindrance upon the thigh.	0.7609849
Then apply a poultice and bandage the leg to the thigh, and wrap them together with a bandage for three to four days, and then unwrap them.	Then apply a plaster and flex the leg on to the thigh and bandage them together for three or four days; then loosen them.	0.93637705
The patient should not walk for a few days until they are healed and strengthened.	He should do little walking for some days until it gains strength.	0.65545404
But if you cannot reduce the dislocation, then perform strong extension with the same bandages used in the hip treatment described earlier.	But if you cannot effect reduction by this method, apply powerful extension by bandages as we have described above for the treatment of the hip, until it goes back.	0.7987898
Chapter 33.	CHAPTER THIRTY-THREE.	0.6304041
On the treatment of a dislocated heel.	On the treatment of dislocation of the ankle.	0.9093659
The heel is sometimes displaced by a slight movement, and sometimes it is completely dislocated, either inward or outward.	The ankle is sometimes slightly displaced, sometimes fully dislocated, the dislocation being either internal or external.	0.9065919
The sign of dislocation is that you will see the heel swollen towards the direction it is dislocated.	The sign of its dislocation is that you will see the ankle swollen, and projecting on the side to which it is dislocated.	0.82223296
The treatment for a slight displacement is a gentle reduction, extending it easily with the hands until it returns.	As to the treatment of its displacement, the reduction of it is easy: if it is gently extended with the hands and straightened, it will go back.	0.6816441
For a complete dislocation, have the patient sit straight, with a strong assistant supporting their back from the middle.	As to treatment when it is dislocated completely, you should make the patient sit upright with a strong and sturdy assistant holding him about the middle from behind.	0.80511683
Hold the upper part of the foot with your right hand and the lower part near the ankle with your left hand.	Then hold the dorsum of the foot with your right hand, and with the left grasp the foot from below about the heel.	0.8020353
Pull the foot towards you with your right hand, then with your left hand twice, and then extend it with the left; push the sole of the foot with your right hand towards the leg without effort.	Then draw the foot toward you with your right hand, then with the left, twice. Then extend it with the left hand and thrust the metatarsus with the right hand without violence toward the leg.	0.8767817
Do this twice as we have described.	Do this as we have described, twice.	0.9661766
Then push the sole of the foot towards the leg a third time, focusing on the ankle.	Then thrust the metatarsus toward the leg a third time while exerting traction at the heel.	0.79673135
If the foot returns to its place once or twice in this manner and appears aligned, it is good; if not, repeat the procedure until it does.	If it goes back in one or two attempts thus, and you see the foot is straightened, well and good. If not, repeat the operation and it will go back.	0.8157401
But if you are unable to reduce the dislocation as described, lay the patient on their back on the ground, secure a block firmly to the ground, and place it between their thighs, wrapped with cloth to avoid injury.	If you find it impossible to reduce it by what we have said, make the patient lie on his back on the ground and firmly fix in the ground between his thighs a stake wrapped in material so as not to hurt him.	0.8051701
Then one assistant holds the thighs, and another extends the foot with their hands or with a band tied around the ankle; each assistant pulls in opposite directions, while the block between the thighs holds the body steady to prevent it from being pulled down during the extension.	Then an assistant should grasp his thigh and another assistant should extend the foot, either manually or with a cord tied round the narrow part of it; the assistants should pull one against another, with the stake upright between the patient's thighs holding him so that his body will not be dragged down with the extension.	0.86316925
The physician aligns the dislocation with their hands, while another assistant holds the healthy thigh downward, allowing the dislocation to return easily.	Then the doctor should straighten out the dislocation with both hands, while another assistant holds down the sound leg; then the dislocation will speedily go back.	0.7912067
Once the dislocation is reduced and confirmed, apply a poultice and bandage it tightly, binding the foot to the leg.	Then when the dislocation is reduced and the soundness of the reduction is manifested to you, apply a plaster and packing, bandage firmly and bind the foot downwards.	0.7823087
Take care to avoid compressing the nerves behind the heel too forcefully to prevent damage.	You will have to be careful of the tendon above the ankle at the back, not to bandage tightly over it so as to injure it.	0.7400511
Leave it for two or three days; if the bandage loosens, tighten it.	Then leave him for two or three days; and if the binding works loose, tighten it up.	0.90137494
Remove the bandage on the third or fourth day, and prohibit walking for 40 days. But if walking is necessary before this time, there is no guarantee that the dislocation will not recur and worsen, preventing proper healing.	Then on the third or fourth day loosen it, but the patient is to abstain from walking for forty days, for if he tries to walk before this lapse of time you cannot be sure that the dislocation will not collapse and corruption set in and thereafter be incurable.	0.82559586
If an abscess occurs, treat it as previously described in another place with appropriate care and embrocation until it subsides.	If an abscess occur you must allay it by the application of such dressings and embrocations as we have already described more than once, until it is gone.	0.70722485

On the treatment of dislocated toes.	On the treatment of dislocation of the toes.	0.9349297
A dislocated toe should be gently realigned without much effort; this is usually easy to do.	Any that are dislocated must be straightened by means of gentle extension, without violence; that is not hard but positively easy.	0.67536926
But if the dislocation is in some of the joints of the foot, have the patient sit with their foot on an even surface or table, as if they were standing.	If the dislocation be in one of the joints of the dorsum of the foot, the patient must set his foot on level ground or upon a board, standing as though walking.	0.8126882
Then stand and place your foot over the dislocated joints, pressing down firmly until they return to place, ensuring they are aligned and no swelling appears.	Then you must stand and put your foot on what protrudes of those joints, and put strong pressure upon it with your foot until it goes back and you see that it is evened out and there is no prominence at the place.	0.8236293
Then place a board under the sole of the foot to support it completely, securing it with a tight and firm bandage for three days; then remove the bandage and have the patient rest without walking for many days until it is stable and the reduction is confirmed.	Then put under the sole of his foot a flat splint with two heads to take the whole foot, and bind it on with a tight and secure bandage for three days; then loosen it; but keep him from walking for a good many days until it binds and you are sure it will not revert, God willing.	0.8445761

On types of dislocation that occur with a wound or fracture or both together.	On the kinds of dislocation that accompany a wound or a fracture or both.	0.9300394
When any of these conditions occur, and you attempt to treat and restore it, often death ensues.	When anything of this kind happens and you attempt treatment and restoration, death is a frequent sequel.	0.8436748
Therefore, only a skilled, experienced, merciful, and cautious practitioner, not rash or presumptuous, should attempt the treatment. Initially, use medicines that only alleviate painful abscesses and leave the patient to divine judgment, unless you have hope of recovery and alleviation of the disease, with some sign of hope. Then try to reduce the dislocation immediately at the onset, before a painful abscess develops.	Therefore such treatment should be undertaken only by a person that is skilled in the art, has long experience, is dexterous, sympathetic, cautious, and not reckless or over-bold. To begin with he should apply only remedies for the allaying of abscesses and then leave the patient to Divine providence, unless, of course, the injury is light enough to give some hope of his escaping death; in which case you should set out to reduce it at once before an abscess arise.	0.83271646
If the limb returns to place as desired, administer treatment to alleviate the abscess and heal the wound with appropriate drying ointments.	If the part goes back as you wish, employ the treatment for allaying abscesses and dress the wound with suitable desiccant ointments.	0.8586658
If the dislocation is accompanied by a fracture with separated bone fragments, stabilize them and proceed as described earlier for such conditions.	If it be a dislocation with a fracture and there occur splintered fragments in the bone, try to remove them, following therein the instructions relating to the simple diseases we have mentioned before in their place.	0.70942664
Protect and avoid exposure to hazards as much as possible, as advised earlier; this is better for you before your Creator, more lasting for your glory, and healthier for your body in the long run. Thus concludes the words of Albucasim perfectly, for which God be praised. Amen.	Use your utmost diligence; keep clear of entering upon a course with a dangerous outcome, as I have enjoined on you before. For this will best ensure the continuance of your prestige and safeguard your good name, God willing.	0.6347151
