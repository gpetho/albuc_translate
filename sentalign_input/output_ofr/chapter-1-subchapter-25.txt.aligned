On the dislocation of the shoulder	On cauterization of the axilla.	0.52044123
When the head of the shoulder is dislocated due to moisture, and it is reset but cannot stay in place, repeatedly dislocating with slight movement as we have experienced, then you must first reset the dislocation. After, the patient should be laid on their back and on their side; then lift the core which is within the armpit with the fingers of your left hand; and if the joint is dislocated inwards, heat the cautery which has two prongs of which here is the form:	When the head of the humerus is dislocated on account of the synovial fluid or when it does not remain in the correct position after the dislocation has been set, so that this becomes a regular occurrenceâ€”it is set and then dislocates with the least movement, as we have ourselves seen; you must first set the luxation, then make the patient lie down on his back or on his sound side; then with the fingers of the left hand lift up the skin of the axilla if the joint has dislocated downwards. Then heat a cautery provided with two spits in this manner.	0.84578156
and cauterize the core until it pierces through to the rib, and the mark of the cautery would resemble four cauteries; and therefore, cauterize with the cautery which has three prongs, whereby the marks of cauterization are six cauteries; and the prongs are the thickness of a tent and this is the form of the cautery which has three prongs:	Then with that burn through the fold of skin till you have perforated to the other side, getting four cauterizations. The cautery may be of three prongs and then the form of the cauterization will be six burns. The prongs should be of the fineness of a probe. This is the figure of the cautery with three prongs.	0.77724826
And sometimes another prong is added to this, whereby there are eight cauteries.	Sometimes there is added yet one more so there will be eight burns.	0.76046133
Then apply crushed leeks with salt onto the cautery; then let the patient rest, and the limb should not be moved for a long time until it is well strengthened.	Put on the burns leeks well pounded with salt; then keep the patient absolutely quiet so as not to move the joint for a time till it gains strength.	0.8912732
And if it is dislocated upwards, which happens rarely, then apply cautery on the thick part of the collarbone, with many cauterizations by pricking.	If the dislocation has gone upwards, which very rarely happens, then cauterize him above the shoulder with one good claviform cautery or with multiple punctured cauterizations.	0.72947687
For the joint is closed, and the moisture is removed and the patient is healed.	Thus the joint will gain strength and the humidity will disappear and the patient will be cured.	0.7286101
