of the chilblains that come on the feet
Very often it happens that on the outside of the feet a malady arises which is called "corn" according to our understanding, and it is a large, misshapen thing that injures the foot.
And the cauterization of this malady is done in two ways.
That is to say, cautery by fire, and cautery by hot water.
Fire cautery is done by heating a cautery iron like a vaulting rib, and it should be made of good iron of a size that it can enclose the corn on all sides, and that it has thin edges; then place it hot upon the corn, and turn your hand all around the corn until it reaches the bottom of the corn; and leave it thus for three days until it begins to discharge pus; then make a poultice of wild mallows ground with salt, and leave the poultice on all night, and the corn will fall off and be uprooted.
Then treat the area with an ointment that generates flesh until it is healed.
And if they are turned outwards on the body, and often this happens on the hands and feet, then you must apply cautery with hot water; and it is done in this way: take a tube of copper or iron, or a vaulting rib, and place it over the corn and the wart, that is to say, verrucous warts; and place the tube over it so that it surrounds it completely, then put in a little hot water, and hold your hand firmly, and press your hand while turning so that the edge of the tube reaches the root of the corn, and the hot water can find a deep path to the root; and let the patient endure the burning of the hot water for an hour; then leave it like that, and it will uproot itself completely with all its roots. 
Do this one after the other, until you have extracted all those that are on the body, then treat them with ointments that generate flesh.
