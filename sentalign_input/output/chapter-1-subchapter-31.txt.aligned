On the cauterization of dropsy.	On the cauterization of dropsy.	1.0
Cauterization is not normally used for dropsy except in specific cases.	The cautery is particularly effective in ascites.	0.51431656
When treating dropsy using the methods described previously, if your treatment does not work, then you should cauterize with four cauterizations around the navel, one on the stomach, one on the liver, one on the spleen, two between the vertebrae of the back, one on the right side of the chest, and one more on the stomach. The depth of the cauterization should be close to the thickness of the tendon.	When you have, without effect, treated a dropsical person with the various measures mentioned in the section on diseases, you should sear with four cauterizations around the umbilicus, and one over the stomach, another over the liver, and another over the spleen, and two behind his back between the vertebrae, one at the level of the breast and one at the level of the stomach; and let the burn be almost skin-deep.	0.778023
Then leave the cauterized area open so that it discharges pus for a long time.	Then keep the burn open so that it suppurates for a long while.	0.7774004
Do not stop the patient's treatment after cauterization until it is clear that the two intended purposes are achieved, which will hasten their recovery.	Do not let the patient, after cauterization, be without the necessary treatment, so that you combine both methods for him, and a cure will speedily come to him.	0.7001612
The shape of the cautery used for the abdomen should be like a nail, as previously described, and the one used for the back should be like an olive, as described before.	The cautery with which his belly is cauterized should be claviform like the figure previously given; while the one with which his back is cauterized should be olivary.	0.7901124
