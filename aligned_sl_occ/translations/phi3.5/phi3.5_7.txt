Oh children, you have completed this book of medicine just before my time in science ends here (referring to the author's period of expertise), and through its contents—its discussions, statements, and declarations—I see that you appreciate this work deeply which is part of surgical practice.
When the operation is subdued in our region and at all times privately, while I am observing it closely through my eyes, not removing anything from Antiques except for some small descriptions found therein; these things change what they are now into errors and superstitions that were closed within them long ago.
Here comes the first sentence to translate: And I have seen that you understand this tractate'dict in its second manner of exposure and explanation, as well as for the application of cautery tools and other instruments used in the work at hand, which is necessary for preparation.
May be the reason why no one dares to abandon our craftsmthy art in this time, as medicine is long and requires constant practice in anatomical science—which Gualia knew well regarding how patients' limbs function (movement and shape of those parts), their joints and ligaments, bones and muscles; plus the names of these structures along with their respective functions.
Through the water of Hippocrates that we call by name is sufficient for small tasks and primarily in the workings of the body as a whole.
May we already have told you about that in the entrance of this text; who do not know what we have told them regarding anatomy, will fall into error and serve deadly purposes if they have seen even some aspects of these things, as formed within this science and taken from its knowledge and experiments.
Here comes the first source sentence to translate: "Quar yeu vi un metge folh e enperit aver incidit un apostema escrophilos en le colh de una femna, e incidic alcunas arterias del colh per que fluic gran sanc entro que la femna cazec morta entre las mas de lu.
Here comes another doctor who prescribes that the patient should drink a stone from a pot of wine which had been processed in his/her state; this stone was large and came to him/her (and fell into their body), leading to the death of that home on the third day.
And when you call for it (to remove), and because of the greatness of the stone and due to its position in the bladder, come undernethy that they will die therein.
And another doctor takes the pay from our lord of this land for surgery, and brings in an iron bar that was broken inside his thigh; they fixate the fracture on the patient's body without letting air into it, using strong pillows and bedsides.
Return the lame according to your wishes, and fix the splint securely overnight or as commanded so that the knee will enter into decay; this is when the thigh goes through the portal of rupture, arriving at destruction.
And you have called upon him/her (patient), and used the ligature to untie or loosen it; thus achieving relief from their pains.
Even if decay has been confirmed in the body part, it cannot be restrained and will continue to spread within until it reaches the cavity where humors circulate poorly (the malady).
And here comes another doctor who pierces an abscess and it becomes inflamed within days; during this time the cunning of him grows towards his lordship.
The cause is that the head cautery is for humors melancholical, and not because it will come to him in total, but rather from the member which he was held captive by them.
And for that reason, boys, it is necessary for you to devise the operation in two ways: one related to health and another where there is danger involved in major decisions.
Here comes the first source sentence to translate:
Thus take up your weapons for solicitation and protection from God, and the sickness for healing and strengthening.

The division of the second partition. The second chapter on incision and puncture, and of fistulae, and ulcers, and extraction of herbs and similars for those things, all is ordered according to the forms of these instruments.
The third pillar of restoration and displacement, as well as care for twists and disguises to these; the head ordered within our bodies' weight, and forms of instruments arranged by him/them.
When you open up where that lancet was used and about the body'dictions (possibly referring to cavities or spaces within), it is forbidden to use a lancet therein.
Thus it is said that the discourse of cautery and its non-existence is long and intricate, requiring subtlety in knowledge; they often disagree among themselves greatly, which suffices for me to learn a small part of their discussions, lest I fall behind.
And so it is said that the cautery comforts all of the body universally, except for two complexes, which are parts of his matter.
In the complexity of the dry tail and matter; those who use cautery are beneficial to that area, while others oppose it as not suitable for illness characterized by both quality and dryness—since nature is likewise a combination of these qualities, making damping and healing this moisture essential.
Here comes the first source sentence to translate:
Through that speech of his, I have already experienced some waters come up for me.
Even if there is no need to bleed out the one who has already been probed and exercised in the place of cauterization for today' extraneous activities, understanding their complex composition as humans and how diseases are arranged within them, along with causes of these ailments and timing of those occurrences.
May also in other complications, it's not out of fear but mostly due to damp and cold humors, which is why doctors are agreed upon these matters, without neglecting the use of caution when treating them here.
And as for the wise ones who know of healing through focus and its benevolence towards us, they apply their care to medicine by means of combustion (burning), whereby the focal point is simple; it reaches only the part that has been cauterized and does not affect the other parts but may cause a minor harm.
May the medicine' extrude to that in his limbs which has lain unattended for too long, and may it cause difficult recovery and prompt return of health.
May the focus, due to its elevation and beneficial substance, does not cause excess but rather provides cure; and for this reason we are granted an excuse from lengthy discourse because during our pause here I will secretly attempt at your navel (belly button), a procedure which demonstrates through dialogue the removal of diseases. If it were otherwise that my free time is not available, rest assured, as what happens in this discussion proves philosophical and enlightening for your mind-stones (thoughts).
And learned physicians know that it is most suitable and beneficial for the patient to undergo punctures and breaks at the beginning of primary care.
E you say that cautery is convenient at all times, in such a way that the harm from accidents submerges into the water where the cautery has been drawn back to, and mainly if it' extricates or fistulas necessary for them – these things do not suffer tardiness because of fear of malice; this greater damage entering is more than minor injury over time.
So do not touch your feet or knees, men and women alike; for they all consider the common folk and ignorant physicians as estimating only those who suffer from this ailment treated by cautery, so that it is impossible to completely remove such consequences at once, and delays occur.

The form of this cauterization is as follows: firstly command the malady to be expelled through medicinal lavage for three or four nights, according to how much exertion it requires and the patient'thy age and custom.

The translation of this medieval medical treatise line by line into English would be as follows:
Capital Second.
Of the pointed cautery of the head/capillary (in this
When in the entire body there is chronic and long-lasting pain located mainly within the spleen (which remains prolonged), doctors use knives and lancets, cupping glasses, lancing instruments for draining abscesses or fluid collections, cauterizing tools with their own healing capabilities; most of these are not effective if they have already been used on that particular cause. Additionally, consider the possibility that the spleen itself has a strong constitution in its nature (meaning it is very resilient); therein lies no merit for heavy or harmful intervention—rather, apply another cauterizing tool to this minor issue now. Return the brandished upon your head that is being burned, with caution inside while the navel has been divided. Cut the rib and expose its bone as much as we have measured out before (and previously cauterized it at this place), which is where air was drawn upon by a ventouse—this location. And raise your hand with such force that you do not discover the bones; for when the humors attack strongly they cause great pain different from pains caused by other caustics on the head.
Here they apply this cautery to its place, wherein if the cautery there is for these corns on the head and back, which are treated with subtle cauteries that belong to that very spot of treatment in the head; thus it constitutes their method.
Capital pain or discomfort (The original Latin term "cap

When the headache is severe or if there's pain within the skull cavity itself (The original medieval text discusses different types of medical interventions for ailments involving brain pressure). Either cauterization with medicine acutely combustible, immediate in nature, or by means of iron tools are employed; this treatment is performed through two methods: using heated medicinal substances that can ignite rapidly (the medieval approach to treating conditions like severe headaches involves applying heat for therapeutic purposes), and with the use of metallic instruments designed specifically as cautery implements.
Maycuttia (or medicine) uses the burning of charcoal for relief and you take hold of that instrument to pull out both ends of the patient'thy limbs from them respectively. Return (or return) the location of pain to where there is a sharp lance within that place hidden by bone, inside which it occurs.
Here comes the first source sentence to translate:
Return that which is inside you with care; for it heals within itself when treated properly.
If you come, apply some of the poultices that you have written about in the section on burn treatments.
May the caustic action be with iron as follows in this manner:
And when it is called for a tightening with the forceps of steel (for which they have no name in our language), whereby their head takes on the shape and size similar to that of a rose, smallness being observed at its place upon them:
Return your hand over the location of pain, and hold it—so that the iron needle does not harden (which has just been heated), gradually rotate the small needle by speed.
If the quantity of blood that has flowed through the bowel is as much as it suits for its capacity and your hand ensures that the artery does not become overwhfalved (overfilled), thus preventing bleeding, which represents a discharge or flux of bile.
Return the wound to water infused with salt and place it there for three days, then rest the dressing on the border, and take care that inside is healed properly.
If you go ahead, perform cauterization on the part of the scalpel according to the previous cautions, and pay attention not to make an incision into this circulating vessel directly without due preparation/considerations.

When you treat an emigrant (likely referring to a migratory condition, possibly related to travel or shifting locations), remember what has been said about the healing process before and consider it for each division of diseases mentioned; if not proficient in this curative approach, then when there is still pain from that which was first cauterized with medicine (or a pointed instrument) as per its line where intense suffering remains within your patient's body—therefore pinpointing the source or location of such enduring torment; and restrain your hand for some time while you press it upon this exact spot, using intermittent pressure points on which an iron tool has been applied.
However, it is necessary for you to guard against the continuation of the mandible'zyme (possibly referring to bruxism or teeth grinding), which should be held due to chewing and prevent jaw locking as well as nerve involvement that may lead to spasms.
If it is about the custody and caution of blood flow from the artery that expels, there'se in this patient fear, mainly towards whom knows not what he does or doesn't study; thus perform the operation on him carefully.

If you feel from this illness that the current treatment is not sufficient and if your headache worsens in the place where we have previously noted it (assuming "cap ayssi" refers to a specific area on or near the head), then cauterize there with our method, as discussed earlier. Take care of the patient while they are healing.
If you go there, administer the same caustic we have mentioned in the chapter of heat treatment with a cauterizing agent used for two coats, and this will be even better healing.

And when it is necessary for the treatment of joint pain, particularly in the fingers ("aurellas"), then use caustic substances as directed by medical profession
When in the finger there is pain due to cold and it's caused by irritating factors or other treatments as I have mentioned earlier (division), this treatment does not alleviate the suffering; hereby we use caustic measures, which are represented by a lancet for puncture. This represents the method described:
Return the points with fire (or cautery), and carry it throughout the entire body'selly or within any of its parts where pain occurs. Carry using a rotating instrument, similar to turning over an axle wheel, as appropriate when there is discomfort in one part or another. Long enough you must hold the cautery of the red-hot iron, barely as large as your hand that seeks to enter this place.
If all points made with hot needles throughout the body are applied and carefully monitored for which areas have healed, so that those places can be rejuvenated further if necessary.

Of the turtle which is healed and of such caustication not are they but spices that come through veins (or "flow through blood vessels"), as we have stated in the divisions of diseases. Here, it seems to suggest a medieval understanding where certain herbs or medicinal substances would enter the body's circulatory system—through what could be metaphorically termed 'veins'—and these were then used for their therapeut
Avoid the caustication of this herb which comes through dryness or by causing a spasm in nerves (likely referring to methods that avoid using heat, potentially irritating fluids like vinegar-based concoctions). The medieval approach suggests they were aware
When you heal that herb of the turtle with juniper and cauterization without causing discomfort to your treatment, be mindful that when causticating this ulcer at three points: use a gold spit for lance (gold being highly valued), apply small touches using holy temple water ritually prepared, and the tongue is needed with two kissing lips. This line suggests an old medical practice where specific materials like precious metals were used in treatment preparations—possibly as part of cauterization or other healing rites involving spiritual significance given to items such as a "holy temple water." Here, it indicates the use of gold for its perceived purity and efficacy alongside more common objects associated with religious practices.
Pause the caustication for opposing parts of the diseased area; herein lies relief not in what you have applied but where health is apparent (indicating that sometimes stopping treatment can be more beneficial than continuing). This implies an understanding from medieval times when doctors might halt certain interventions if they believed it would lead to better healing, recognizing a balance
The method of cauterization is to apply the lancet at the tip of the thumb on the top of the head, and in the temple where it's twice as long as the length of your finger, keep your hand inside until enough has been burnt off for treatment.
This is how the cautery works, and it belongs to the specialty of those who perform its use nowadays. Even if that one is slightly lax in their movements, and there is an excess of unnecessary flesh on them, do so delicately.
Return care to where it is needed currently as that which enters for healing purposes proceeds inside.
The provided text seems like an early modern interpretation of medical practices using archaic
Based on your phrase "Cauterizacio di antica apoplessi," it appears that you are referring to the ancient practice of

And if for these healing arts you possess knowledge; otherwise, make three cauterizations in the lower portion of your head where two parts meet (the upper and skull portions), with tools belonging to that very area: This passage is providing specific instructions on how to perform an alternative treatment using caustics. It mentions performing a procedure—likely for treating abscesses or other purulent conditions in the scalp, by making small burns ('cauterizations') at particular locations within this body region where there's likely significant pus presence: The text emphasizes precision and targeting specific areas rich with 'pus,' which might indicate an attempt to cleanse these regions effectively And there is space between each of these cautions, and proper care should be given for the fluid that comes from it.
If you increase the size of the patient' extrusion and take out it from its place in heat (implying applying localized treatment), then use a heated lancet at that spot; if there is greater expansion, cauterize over both toes.

This sentence reflects a medieval medical perspective where bodily illnesses were thought to be caused by an excess of certain substances (humors) and treated with various concoctions aimed at restoring balance, in this case referring potentially to the use of specific therapies when humoral imbalance is severe or patients develop intoler
Translation: And if it is an infant who does not suffer from the medicines, administer mustard and ointments to cleanse them daily through application by hand movements for a long time until they are healed properly with foods (as part of their diet). Here medieval doctors suggest gentle methods like applying heat in form of hot applications or poultices on an infant who might be sensitive, advocating rest and good nutrition as means to facilitate recovery. This highlights the tailored approach taken for different age groups within historical medical practice where infants required special
Translation: Then trim the hump of phlegm and apply a heated lancet at the head where there was earlier an application; another lancing on their backhead, applying burns over every crown for that which has been previously causticized. This passage illustrates how medieval treatments involved targeted cauterizations to remove or neutralize phlegm from specific body regions following certain prior procedures as part of a larger treatment plan centered around humoral theory and manual interventions by practitioners with lancets (sharp instruments). It reflects the hands-on, localized approach that was common in historical medical practice. The reference to 'phlegm' aligns If the humors are strong and enduring, then it is necessary to apply those cauterizations that I have described, which will cause a paralysis and softening of the body over the vertebrae of the back and the lumbar region.
And if it is necessary for a second olive-like pointed instrument (cauter), as previously mentioned by doctors, then so shall be used accordingly in treatment.
And if the humors are still present (in case of residual or lingering symptoms), then pause and use a subtle form of cautery as per this methodology.

This translation interprets "Capitol .xv." as referring to an instruction in medieval medical practice regarding the use of cauterizing agents for treating eyelids affected by conditions that cause them to become soft, likely due to excess moisture or illness at the time (as was common understanding).

The provided medieval medical text appears as follows when translated line by line into English:
When the ears are treated with pinches on their paws, and they hold tightly (with their hands), it can be interpreted as an old method of treatment where gentle pressure or manipulation was applied to alleviate symptoms—possibly headaches in this context due to misalignment being addressed through physical means.
When the ears' (of an animal) hairs become part of their digits and they hold tightly, two kinds of cupping are considered next: one where you perform or apply medicine burn therapy; herein lies a possible method from medieval times to address pain through such techniques. The term "cautery" refers historically to various forms of healing that involved burning substances—often herbs impregnated with oils—to relieve symptoms, and the practice was thought effective in drawing out harmful humors or excess bodily fluids believed responsible for illness
If you perform cupping focusing on the patient's back, commanding humid to enter through their paws simultaneously with those from which they breat extricate themselves; and if your finger is used for denial, then bind tightly (with a bandage) around the ears so that it does not crawl within while its hairs have been born. This passage suggests an approach in traditional medicine where cupping was utilized to create suction on various body parts with specific intention: potentially inducing humidity or fluids for therapeutic effects, as well as restraining the ears' growth (possibly referring metaphorically to controlling symptoms). The use of a bandage implies additional measures taken to keep external elements from interacting negatively with treatment areas.

When you treat a fistula with the fluid we have discussed in the divisions of diseases and do not apply your treatment, then as per this method: command the humors to stop rising at the head within the body'dictum (the patient), ensuring that no excess or agitation remains above their head by holding one minister between the temples.
Return your hand pressure in an oil or woolen pad on his body.
Return the cautery of which this is the form:
Which has been secured like a cane or sickle blade at the location where the cautery is applied, from one limb to which the pain occurs.
If you go in, it will penetrate into the other extremity. If you wish it to come out as an attempt.
May it be better for that person's recovery in this work of mercy.
When an abscess has burst (opened), and cleansing material is taken out of it from undernethy or chest, where their hands are placed by them. If there is none (ubert), then work that area and extract the poultice from it.
Return the flame of the lit instrument to you and hold it over your hand that holds the cautery for bleeding out blood from the nose's partition, so that neither your nor the patient is anxious or disturbed; at the same time keep the cauteries on the nostril wound area in order not to corrupt what has been healed.
So if the caustic has entered into the mouth, be; and otherwise, repeat the caustic once or twice a week as necessary according to practice; leave it there for three days, then pause over that spot at the border of the bone until such time is when said substance becomes dry-out.
If they have passed seven days and are not healed yet, then take a potent quick-acting medicine within which the bone will become evident and be cleaned according to your judgment in its capital (the head).
Here comes the first source sentence to translate: And another method of applying a cautery for an abscess that is initially performed at the site of the abscess and forms this delicate crevice within which its form lies; herein, we use our hand as good containment so it does not let out pus from there. We place stoppers above where the fluid comes up in a book or water vessel: Here, lead pellets are used to plug that location of the abscess and heal by an extraordinary cure.
If the fistula is healed by the water we have from cautery and treatment, then it is; but if not, administer distress relief through your nose and reduce the fistula in its nostril location as soon as possible.

Constantly rubbing cracks appear in the lips, mainly on children'thy lips are subjected to constant friction and this may cause discomfort or pain; doctors observe such conditions often occurring among young patients due to their habit of licking or chewing on these areas.
So when you care for those cracks in the water we have mentioned earlier and do not properly complete your treatment with this type of small caustic instrument as described here, fire (or heat) will be applied.

From the act of cauterizing an ulcer within the mouth, which aligns with medieval medical practices for treating such conditions as documented herein:
When in the presence of the uvula or tongue and palate, which are apoplectic (seizing) with an abscess that is both old and inflamed, causing a fistulous ulceration for curing without further examination; apply as much cautery to this extent required by what has been revealed of the lesion's condition within it. Place your heated instrument into its depth whereby (the iron tool) may penetrate and reach its base, doing so enough only once or twice; then inside keep a vigilant watch until recovery is achieved—as advised in our treatise on cauterization methods for ensuring proper healing.
So if the illness is removed and health restored, be content; but if not, it's necessary to discover where the disease has remained and hold the damaged bone accordingly when it comes into its head (or peak of symptoms).

When the veins are softened by moisture and the teeth become rough, cures for these will be provided by medicine without conferring anything to you; thus pause at the top of the belly in the throat (presumably a reference point), place your heated instruments where they can fit into that form which is about to come forth. This way, as long as you keep pressure on the tip and insert those hot tools within this space containing the swollen gland, heat from the flame will help bring warmth down to the root of the affected tooth, aiding in healing.

When toothache is due to inflammation or a worm infestation, and the medical treatment does not provide comfort, then there are two types of caustic treatments used: lancets (like those made from cow horn) for puncturing sores, or cauterizing tools like surgical hooks.
Cauterize is where you grasp the edge of cowhide and bell metal here in the forge, apply a clamp over the extremity of the torch being lit, secure that same edge with glue or resin so it adheres to the painful tooth inside which has already been ignited.
When applying heat therapy is necessary for some days until the spirit of the focus reaches the head'dict, where thoughts occur and decisions are made.
If you wish, immerse wool or cloth in the space below it and place that above the sore tooth, whereby the heated iron reaches the cavity of the affected tooth' extrication.
Indeed the cauterization near the heart must be attended to when there is an eruption or iron wound, and it'dict that in the chest where such growths occur, their heat should not reach the mouth of the malady.
Return the cautery to its form, and place it on your teeth for the purpose that the cautery becomes reddened; make some adjustments if the pain returns in either day or another day.
When that instrument causes the malady'sup to shift its mouth and hand for an hour, and then seals it shut with pressure - this is how the use of the instrument proceeds.
When you have extracted what is possible by your hand, then apply heat with that which (or whatever) you are able to use as a caustic agent.
This is how the catheter is formed:

If thereafter digestion is required, continue till you reach the core of that ulceration.

Cauterization of the chest illness and coughing: Here, a medical procedure involving burning is referred to as treatment for respiratory issues or persistent coughing—
When a cough and chest illness are caused by humidity that infiltrates the body, without fever or swelling (indicating an ancient form of malady), then two lancets would be applied over the collarbone at pressure points; another lancing on where the breasts meet above each nipple. The lancing is done according to their specific shapes:
If you wish, your cautery will be the kind of points that are called upon for joint pain in arthritis (the point used to alleviate such pains). The form of this comes before the puncturing technique for arthritic pain relief.

When addressing abdominal wounds in medieval medical practice: When these internal pains are caused by moisture that weakens the body's humors and affect digestive retention within both stomach and intestines, it is through medication applied to hand treatments that such ailments can be cured without exacerbating them. Moreover, when these internal pains manifest due to disturbances of humor exposure from wounds themselves—whether large or small on the abdominal wall's delicate structures (pertaining perhaps more generally), in areas including but not limited to stomach sutures and circles for tightness relief as well as four localized cauterizations along these lines, using either a sharp instrument with precision—or two such interventions upon the upper abdomen above ribs; or three at large.
If you observe the excessive humidities exhaled by the patient and their malady accepts them, then cauterize that over the chestnut area and on the swellings (buboes), firmly adjusting those cauters on the stomach and above the genitals; this is curative care for vitality without error.

Two cuts below the navel using two implements will also be made as part of this curative process:

When joint pain is caused by cold humors that infiltrate each part of the body, and pain occurs in the feet, it is customarily called gout by doctors.
And when treated gout of cause frigor is not aggravated by the touch and care for it, then apply dressings with caution.
When you are cauterizing that which is expelled in the excretion pathway of the joint between the foot and thigh, with various types of caustic instruments at hand.
This is where the olive-shaped instrument referred to herein lies:
If it is necessary for points to be made on the sole of the foot, then use pointed cautery accordingly. If pain spreads into the groin or other joints, and its movement becomes erratic, then apply a caustic at that particular joint with three to four of this same treatment from all over the body using these caustics for healing.
If there are lancets needed for these lancing instruments, then you should lance that which is necessary and do not press your hand too much on the lancing device beforehand; just send out the instrument of the penis alone.
If pain enters into both shoulders (the chest and the back), then apply the same treatment we have described in this chapter.
If the pain is only in the feet and it's called soreness (suagra), then a pinch will be made along the course of the flames that circulate therein; piercing those two lines.
If there are remaining pains in the knees and over each joint' extrinsic point of connection (suggesting pain focus), then insert points along these connections on every bone and between fingers/toes, which holds their hands firmly.
If joint or muscle pain comes up during the days with cold in their chest and limbs, then doctors will perform caustic treatments on all parts of the patient'thy aid.
And if there is not proper drainage of the swolthy and its reception to medicine, even with good management by this instrument it may be cleansed; for God helps those who help themselves.

And if there is an obstruction in the opening, then use an arsenic tube and insert its extremity into the ulcer'dictum of the aorta; close it with clay mixed with oil softened by fire so that only the tip of the catheter remains outside. And withhold urine when it is strong and heavy flowing, which we have counted together.
If there is no surgical intervention in this condition, take heated air or cold apparatus where the instruments are pressed tightly together and pause at the end of their reach; then cover that extent carefully folded over it patiently.

May pain originate from the extraction of worms in the artery, when you heal that which we have mentioned before regarding division and flow within fluid passages; moreover, ensure not to hinder your care with exposure to sunlight while observing the vein.
Therefore if there is any cause of worms present here, extract that with gentle gestures or subtle touches; but if no such cause exists, take a quick-drying catheter inserted upstream and downstream from which this treatment takes form. And insert the subtlety into the artery according to the quantity that suffering can cause the humors; and draw out those substances with force from there, so as long as all parasites are expelled through their excretions.

If you wish, take the feather and wrap it gently around the patient's limb distally, placing oil or honey in the cavity of the chest, or any extract from these medicines via a syringe – which is in your hand –; apply the feather at the site below (the bottom part), compressing with your palm so that the applied substance comes out into the space within the thorax where it can be sensed by the fayte.
When it is found that something has been encapsulated in the artery and has already caused small cuts at its focus, here we go (the text continues with further medical advice).

If in the limb where it is located there are sharp and blunt parts, and its socket (the hip joint) has two rounded areas to prevent harming the head of the bone.
And if the swelling is due to flesh that has sprung out in her thigh or leg, then cut it off gently and strike hard within until all the flesh is removed.
If the stone is lodged in the portal of the artery, then insert it gently under the subtle dragon and heat that spot until warmth pervades; place it back into the flesh of the artery.
So if the patient' extruded pain is caused by water that weakens his abdomen due to external grievances, this pressure will be alleviated; and ensure it does not harm the nerves of the armlet (bracelet).

Translation: When in the eyes of humans, natural hairs are adjusted quickly and become ancient ways that make us feel illnesses accompanied by persistent tearing and palpable eye moisture—cures for this cause can only be reached through four methods as stated herein: or with a lancet; according to what is said in the section on acute treatment instruments (the capital 'C' suggests it may relate specifically to an instructional part of a larger text); by extracting them internally, using knowledge and sutures; or via catheters if required.
And so you should pause the head of the malady in its thigh; with your left hand's finger on their cheek (or face), if converted/transformed it is—and then use a needle there where they placed parting down, and insert the needle under that which corresponds to hair — at this place where no fur grows. Pull back the thread of the needle up towards above skin level by means of cheek (or face), changing its direction toward below skin surface; convert it into a line/ray there.
Return the eye part (palpebra) where hairs and tear duct stones are inserted within the major lacrimal inside; then remove them outwards with forceps from undernethy padded palpebral lid, place fingers over the eyelid to prevent further attempts of insertion.

Even when pressure is applied on the hips, it's a good operation and not out of fear.
And another symptom in the face is that there are eye lashes like hair appearing on the eyelid with three curls arranged and gathered according to this manner.

The procedure for this operation involves taking a lancet that has two sharp ends and keeping one of these in contact with the flesh while you puncture it; then drawing blood from inside the left tear gland into the right tear gland until the needle reaches both extremities (ends) of the body. This detailed line suggests an ancient medical technique for treating conditions related to blockages or disruforts in eye secretions, possibly referring to drainage procedures involving a lacrimal sac and associated ductal structures within the eyelid region ("carn"). The process likely aimed at clearing any impaction (blockade) that could lead to tear overflow issues. However, it should be noted this description is quite archaic in terminology; modern medical practices for such conditions involve

When in the nose diverse kinds of meats are born that have no cause for being assembled into scorpions or polyps, and this illness is called 'Polyp,' as it resembles those pins depicted." This translation maintains the essence conveyed by the original medieval text. It describes a situation where various types of meat (or substances) are found inexplicably within the nose—a location not typically associated with such materials according to medical knowledge at that time. The 'scorpions' and 'polyps,' likely metaphorical or symbolic references, suggest foreign bodies causing disease when they should be absent ('quan en le nas so nascudas carns'). These findings are From it there comes blackened meat, and from that some is dark brown or reddish-brown in hue." Here the text describes a discolored form of matter (possibly foreign particles mistaken for food) within one'se', suggesting an abnormal condition possibly associated with nasal blockages. The mentioning of different colors indicates varying stages
Therefore in these there is neither fraudulent nor cancerous matter; cover with your hand and place it over the area, drawing breath (inhaling) into them through their nostrthyrs [nostrils], while pinching upward on those parts." The instruction appears to be for a medical procedure where one covers affected areas gently—possibly indicating palpation or suction techniques aimed at clearing the nasal cavity. It instructs drawing breath into what could possibly refer as nostril passages, with an action implying pressure (pinching) being applied simultaneously to aid in this process of purification from foreign matter within one'se'. This medieval text provides a vivid account of how individuals might Extract that from the divided parts, and insert what you have understood of those spines so thin within which you know all flesh is retained; if any reason for excision exists in them due to whatever cause it may be possible (and this refers back), then extract there with one of the subtle instruments available herein.

If that flesh returns, you shall inspect it immediately and cauterize it; the wound will not recur again with those treatments.
Capitol .xxix.
From reason of teeth is iron used.
When sharp instruments are applied to the surface of the teeth in parts and at the foramen, cutting slices, some bleeding is red or citrine (yellow) blood flowing through that which enters into decay within the gums; these cuts/bleeds are called teeth.
So that you make the thighs apart and pause at the top of your head as for its base, grind teeth in those places where sharp objects or causes resemble sand within them, caused by blackness and citrinitas (yellow bile), among others made manifest.

The form of the forceps and tongs are those by which the tooth is numb at the edge both above and below its cutting surface, from short manipulation with hand or fingers as well as large movements. Here it means that when using tools like forceps (tongs) for dental work on a patient'thy mouth, they help in keeping teeth unnumbed during operations by carefully controlling their movement—whether through small motions within the confines of the tooth structure or larger maneuvers outside this area.
When they are bending with heavy movements as before and these joints are not doubled but shortened outside their natural length.

It seems that the sentence you've given, "Capitol .xxxi.," is an excerpt from a medieval medical treatise and appears to be incomplete or taken out of context in English translation request. However, I can provide a possible interpretation based on typical
When extracting a tooth that has become fractured or broken down ("la qual es trinquat roman alcuna causa"), one must pause over the area where the infection is located (perhaps at its border) for either one day or two until healing occurs; and apply pain relief ointments, such as liniments containing substances from which teeth are composed ('extramitatz'), to a bird's beak-like tool called 'ciconia,' analogous to forceps.
The tools used for this procedure are like scalpels or knives.
If you do not obey my treatment with these forceps or tweezers, then bend over the chest and remove all the flesh, inserting the tool I am holding in it (the shape of which is like this):
E for a small appendage is not enough and it should not be broken off.

May it happen that the jawbone or other bones in the mouth break, and if so, a weight is placed on it where appropriate using tools such as forceps with which we have been dealing during tooth extraction; this helps in treatment.
And whether it is small at first, and gradually becomes larger until its place in the mouth where bones grow, then do not allow escape or flight inside so that all of the patient's bones will occupy their respective places; restore this location with appropriate medicine for him/her.

When teeth are prominent in their natural shape and mostly when they appear on women's breasts or revered places; therefore consider that this tooth is not of its own kind nor can there be extraction by water, which suggests a dental issue possibly involving wisdom teeth (third molars) commonly affecting females. You must note: if the tooth isn’t related directly with another such as an impacted third molar, then you should carefully inspect that object from which this form is taken; and it resembles pork flesh, made of steel cutting tools finer than Indian razor blades sharp enough for dissection.
And your intellect is where you insert that into the mouth for several days to relieve the hardness of the teeth, and not elsewhere in other parts of the body.
If there is an outward expansion of blood (edema), then apply the same Indian steel from which this instrument is made to that area.

Gold does not deteriorate over time; it retains its luster forever, hence your dental restoration should ideally consist of materials like pure or high-quality gold to ensure durability and resistance against decay which these precious metals offer due to their enduring properties unlike silver that loses brightness.
Should the metal be subtle and refined according to how much can enter between your teeth; shape it so that you hold the filament in one hand over healthy adjacent teeth, or even on molars if necessary (if there are two), expanding its form within doubled gaps. This suggests a meticulous approach whereby dental materials like gold must be fashioned with precision tailored to each unique situation—adjustable and carefully placed between existing intact healthy adjacent teeth, or in cases of wider spaces created by severe decay ("maugudas"), even using multiple pieces if needed. The goal is for the filament (metal) to reach across into a remaining sound portion on another half's dentition—indicating an era when restorative techniques required significant craftsmне, attention and understanding of both material properties and oral mechanics from ancient practitioners aiming at long-lasting repairs in the face of decay.

(Please note that this translation is made to the best ability considering medieval medical terminology's similarity across your mentioned languages; however, without more specific text or context it may not be entirely accurate.)
Regularly attached to the joint of the foot or a thorn, among other causes. (Again, this translation is an attempt given limited context; precise medieval terminology would be required for full accuracy.)
Therefore when you draw out the water that is obviously attached here above where it can be seen upon which your tongue rests as an implement in daylight time to make clear whether there’s fluid within, thus indicating its presence inside the joint (this translation makes a best effort with assumptions of medieval medical practice and language usage; direct quotes should ideally come from actual transcript for accurate interpretation).
And if the fluid is not apparent and it remains hidden in the joint, when you vomit up food that has fermented within your stomach; or regurgitate bile from a liver stone (or dried pea) or an intestine worm—these are all reasons why such fluids may have accumulated internally and entered into this condition. If, on the other hand, you find that with forceful action in vomiting out what is present here, those same stones come up; similarly as when a stone from your bile ducts or gallblad0der comes to light during an episode of jaundice—these actions together effectively dislodge such obstructions and remove them. (This translation incorporates medieval medical understanding into English while remaining faithful where possible, but the specific language used may be unique to the original source.) May take a catgut and tie it firmly around the leg, or may use an aspirin pill dissolved in water to apply externally on and remove; or takes a pork rind and applies both internally and externally for relief.
Might it be due to these causes that we speak of, and at this time uses an iron tool as described herein thusly:
Even if a large mass is present and its location within the cavity you insert it into to ease the patient' extraterrestrial condition (presumed pain or discomfort in this context).
Here comes the first sentence for translation: When the patient' extricates his head upwards and ensures that you do not touch their neck or backbone as they come towards him/her, which is what the doctor has arranged for them to hold on.
Even though the humour (referring to bodily fluids) that enters has entered his body due to its knowledge of the location and cause related therapy, pull out your tool as prepared within this appropriate quantity when needed.
Given that this medieval text combines elements from different languages such as Latin,
From the extraction of gout associated with the gallblad0r (Note: The term "sangcu" seems to be a misspelling or misinterpretation, possibly intended
When bloodsucking is treated with the medicine as stated in this section of medical care and does not require discomfort, consider that it occurs within the gallbladder of bile (Note: The term "golayro" refers to a bladder or sac associated with bodily fluids), place your tongue over what you have previously recommended for use as an instrument.
So if you find a swelling or slight movement undernethy therein, extract it carefully and gently with small motions.
If it is not possible to extract from there, then take a concave cannula and insert that into the hollow of the gallbladthy, placing a heated iron pin within the concavity of the cannula; allow such amount (so long as the gallstone has died and remains in place) until it is removed for all the day's water.
Here comes the first source sentence to translate:
If it is not a fever that we have treated with water or arsenicum through the instrument used in steam suction, then heat and arsenic are applied to the throat using this same tool.

La frase traducida al inglés puede interpretarse como: "In the speech, where are they gathered in fragments and sections?" La respuesta a esta pregunta depende del contexto específico del discurso que se está mencion
La frase traducida al inglés puede ser interpretada como: "The fragments are special signs, of various kinds that recall them here in this text." Esta oración parece sugerir que dentro del texto se encuentran diversas señales o fragmentos especiales (apostemas) que llevan recuerdos de algo anterior. Sin embargo, sin más context
La frase traducida al inglés puede ser interpretada como: "Therefore they are various in their piercing and section, of which one is itself an apopema (fragment), and for this reason we extract from them moisture." Aquí la oración parece discutir fragmentos o señales de distinto tipo que pueden tener una forma punzante y dividida. El término 'apopema' se refiere a un segmento o porción, posiblemente metafóricamente en este contexto para indicar pequeños
La frase traducida al inglés puede ser interpretada como: "The second aspect is relating them to the locations in which they occur, wherein an incident apopema (fragment) within the head differs from that of a fragment found at the joint; and also those present on tender flesh differ as well. Each one of these fragments operates like playthings." Aquí la oración parece describir cómo ciertos fragmentos, o 'apostemas', tienen relación con diferentes partes del cuerpo y actúan de manera distinta según su ubicación—como un juguete en el cráneo (cabeza), una característica diferente a los encontrados cerca de las articulaciones (articulaciones) e incluso aquellos presentes
When there may be some of which worms that are not pierced but have reached the stage of illness in those areas complementary to them.
So other appendices that are dislocated when crossed and not mature according to their complement, they resemble those attached at joints; when an appendix is in a position adjacent to a joint, its existence within the body cavity extends as long as it stays there due to bodily fluids circulating through this space—damaging ligaments or nerves of that joint. If intervention occurs too late and reaches only the matured form lodged at the main organ (presumably referring to a protruding appendix), then penetration will not occur until unprocessed food particles reach it, causing elongation into the intestinal partitions of the abdomen; resulting in an abscess or inflammation that cannot be healed. May you know the time of the puncture for the abscess, and so it is when it ripens.
Be aware that it matures when the pain yields and fever subsides, and you decrease grief and heartbeat, strengthening the head of atrophy, along with other symptoms.
When you know that a draining needle has entered the place where pus and drainage from treatment of inflammation come out,
Perforation is performed through the length of the flesh or body part, if pins are inserted into parts of the upper or lower limbs and in joints where tendons, ligaments, bursae; and later on all troublesome locations where reflection occurs, use according to that particular part.
When the abscess is in the muscle tissue, then we must insert a catheter into it until its digestion has been confirmed twice over; but if you puncture that area now, it will extend both the thigh and knee joints of the patient, making their lips hardened and deepening within.
May one make an incision according to the direction of the flesh or bone if it is necessary, following what that part needs.
When administering a small puncture, and in the case of large or broad piercings according to the variety of the sizes of the instruments used.
Here comes the first source sentence to translate:
From those who are seated and have three angles; among them is one that resembles the form of a miter (a tool used for cutting or fitting stones), similar to the joints of an angle grinder.
When they enter in those places where a circular and crescent-shaped incision is applied, it seems like them to us.
May that person who cannot bear with surface appendices (likely referring to external parasites or warts), be pierced just enough so shall it not penetrate further than the surface alone.
And when the abscess is large and has gathered pus, do not attempt to extract all of it at once; remove some from that place today, restore tomorrow what was removed today, take out a larger portion tomorrow, continue taking them out according to degree until you have completely drained (treated) through which hole.
Mostly if the malady is caused by excessive melancholy or old age pressure on healthy people'se lungs and thus forces them to exit their body; when they come out as sickness, then you operate upon them.
Guard your actions with great caution and ensure that when you perform this puncture for these implants, cleanse to avoid infections; consider whether the fluid from the implant is scarce or flat, then administer what he/she would prescribe traditionally (or modern); if however, the implant is large and there are fractures within your incision site, stop cutting at any point where we meet.
If in the apoplectic (stroke) there is detachment of a part of the spine or it has been concave within its circuit, then you should bind that piece with fine cloth or wire gauze as soon as you have transported pans or razors, which increases moisture; and tighten this firmly into place during the third day, following which process will treat the fluid accumulation coming from bandages while it is healing.
If you experience bleeding during your operation, then administer cold water and apply pressure on the areas where blood flows with a cloth that is used for bandaging; pause there to control the flow of blood.
May the flow of blood persist if you maintain your regimen and care, as recommended in these pages of our book and division.
If it is winter time and the location of ulceration is where nerves are compressed, then cover them with flour and oil using caution, placing these over the locations.
If it is summer and the locations are carnivorous, then when you pause pulpils at the beginning in water and oil (and also vinegar or wine), do so as we have mentioned before, allowing all that enters into him to come out until a healthy day arrives. In this way, when an abscess appears and is cleaned away with what has been introduced for treatment during his illness up to the point of healing, it should be done according to our discussion here today.
Here comes the first sentence to translate: And so it is that knowledge of universal remedy care is necessary, perhaps according to the way I have already distinguished each type of ailment for individual treatment herein discussed.
Capitol .xliv (The translation of "Capitol" is
When arthropod parasites enter the chest, where they attach themselves to the throat area:
In the neck where their head is fixed with pins and spices hold these linings that are attached to them; they cause movement in those things of theirs.
From them come drops, and from those that contain moisture like lemon. From those where contain moisture like the palms and their assemblies (referring to joint areas); and from those that are stone-like hardness:
In all of them, and in their removal there is no fear, as long as you perform the operation without contrary actions from surgical tools.
Here comes the first source sentence to translate: And as for those operations on them that require tools of which you have appropriated (i.e., selected or prepared), approach with caution while ensuring they contain what is needed within.
If that which counts for moisture, you divide it into each segment according to its length on the surface following this manner:
Here begins the section where .B. enters and ends with .G., so when moisture is expelled, scrape away that layer which contains that moisture, without leaving any cause of it behind; if there are reasons for this excess humidity present, they return after being addressed.
Here comes the first source sentence to translate:

If there is a ganglion consisting of fatty tissue, then proceed in this manner as follows: I have a segment shaped like an arc (or likened to the shape of a crescent), and I cut between its lips at both ends, extracting my intention from that which contains it.
If your cautery causes contrary effects, then you must tell me immediately what the first remedy is.

Pause in those parts that were put down, to prevent the disease' extrication from reaching the lower parts of their bodies.
Return there that which is necessary for healing in order of recovery (or treatment). In English translation line by line, this can be rendered as follows: "Restore and apply what you need here to aid the process
It appears like a reference code or an entry number which could refer to something specific in its
From the section of scrophulous ones that have been absorbed into the colon (translated line by line: "Reference this part dealing with skrofuls, which are
Consistently, these stones make their way into the colon and intestines as well as in other parts of the body (translation: "Continuously, these stones travel to the colon and intestines along with others reaching various regions within the body"). This text appears from a medieval medical treatise discussing how certain types of kidney or bladder stones can migrate throughout different areas inside the human anatomy. The mention suggests that not only do they affect urinary tracts
These are those that settle in the colon and these stones from them which have been produced (or generated), each takes its own covering; they dwell within their respective nodes of the abdomen, as if nestled inside us like a remedy we take internally with our pills. Herein medieval practitioners seem to acknowledge that kidney or bladder stones can cause blockages forming in various body regions (translation: "These are those found within the colon and these formed from them; each encapsulates its own covering—they reside at their respective abdominal nodes, as if lodged internally like medicine we swallow with our pills"). This text refers to stones or calculi forming in different parts of
And the substances of these skrofuls are stones—some solid like those that have not been treated for removal; some contain moisture and thus differ in form; among them, there exist harmful ones which treatment cannot remove (translation: "The composition or constituents herein consist primarily of stone-like structures. Some present as hard deposits resistant to natural expulsion methods used by the body such as urination—these are not easily eliminated through medical intervention"). The statement reflects an understanding among medieval practitioners that different types of kidney stones have various properties and
So in that position for the treatment you have chosen, where the color of what is manifest (blood) corresponds to the color of the navel and is yellow throughout without being attached to any nerves, veins, or arteries, nor prolapsing as one would expect; herein lies your choice. Thus, inscribe that superficial part above/below where you enter into the line (of treatment), mark it completely with ink from this point downwards through all parts of the body—this is what must be done carefully like how we have described earlier among our fingers and toes: remove small fragments if necessary.
It may be necessary that it is not inserted into a vein or nerve.
Here comes the first source sentence to translate: If the stone does not move within your hand, or if it disturbs the humors (body fluids), and there is no need for you to insert anything further; but if you do inadvertently cut into a vein or artery during your operation, then pause on the scabulated glass or other powders that flow from sanctioned herbs, apply them immediately outside where rest can restore humoral balance of inflammation and soothe the stone until it is ready to be purged. When the sanction has detached.
Thus return within your operation while it is completed.
And investigate thoroughly if there is any cause of the smaller skin diseases herein mentioned; inspect those and purify them accordingly.
If it is in the state of severe scrofulosis and not inserted that scrofulus into its cavity, then do so accordingly. Before anything else happens that may harm his faithful double and cause him internal damage, take note of what enters inside it.
When you fill in cotton wool that which you have already immersed in Egyptian oil, and take care of it thereafter.
If you decide on this entire abscess, then make sure that when you adjust the lips of flesh and bone just enough is placed without any excess waste.
If you find that there has been an excessive opening due to the greatness of the swelling (scrofulus), understand its cause and address it accordingly; apply a stitch as directed.
Here comes the first source sentence to translate: "And that which contains moisture within it pierces this here and withdraws its puncture at your maturation spot, as we have said.
Return treatment with wax and ointments to these places, so that the decay caused by moisture can be stopped from further damage of the body'supremely difficult task due to multiple languages being involved in this medieval medical treatise: Italian ("quel"), Spanish or Catalan (potentially "quals" indicating a group), French ("les quais") and Latin influences. Here, however is my best effort at translating each line Return when the soil (or body in this context) is being cleansed and now you care for that wax applied inside where it can heal. Here, "la plagua" likely refers to waste or dirt within a medical sense; hence translating 'plaga' as impurity rather than literal ground. The phrase suggests an action of applying medicine (wax) into the body during cleans
The text appears fragmented and without clear context, but it seems to refer numerically to
This line is in Italian with a touch of historical medical terminology: "Of the section (or part) where there are goiter developments." Here, 'pilhot' likely refers to
This line seems fragmented and uses archaic or regional language that combines Italian with potentially older forms of expression: "Dissect this section (or part) here in our area, none among us have experienced such an illness." The term 'diyssero' can be translated as a verb meaning to dissect or analyze; it is used metap0.x
This statement in Italian refers back to the previous discussion: "And this is the writing about those (the illness)." Here, 'esse' means
This line is in Italian and discusses the health condition: "May some men have neglected it (the illness), which if not avoided, can lead to improper healing of all veins and arteries here." The phrase 'hauntz esquinencia' points towards a lack or negligence by individuals ('mens') in taking care of their health issue. Here the condition is potentially serious enough that it may affect overall circulatory system, as indicated by reference to "veines" (veins) and possibly arteries ("majors del malaute"). The context
In those who have had cautery or forceps inserted in the mouth or with two bronze hooks (or forceps), when the disease is not present at the navel, urgently seek to remove the detachment caused by sharpness that occurs there due to cold humors.
So when we intend to draw out the fluid (ascites), trace three or four small circles within each circle of ascitic fluid, as much in between two circles by quantity so that the collected part is in a liposoluteous state and not cartilage; this place where fatty tissue resides excludes both flesh and sinews from being drawn out.
If the doctor is afraid, then extend one end of the gout-needle for only an inch (on purpose), and open the needle's hollow part to prevent bleeding from that cause coming out within it at any time thereafter.
Here comes the first source sentence to translate: E apporta insito il cipla secondo che abbiamse raccomandato; ed è significativo sulla sezione della canaletta dove si trova il flegma che proviene da là e per la ascesi del viscero.
Lay aside for some time.
So when the hour arrives in which I pierce the tongue, add lemon balm from the beast'sup chin and place that alone on the cartilage.
Return medicines that cause flesh within it to decrease (or alleviate).
Here comes the first source sentence to translate: And as for Albucasis' advice on what we have recommended, it is simply that arteries which were previously prolapsed in varicose veins of the thighs now enter into death (the term 'mort' here implies a severe condition), and their entrapment has occurred within this place, so they can breatpective through some respiration therein.
Through this commandment the freed one within is consumed by the wickedness of the illness for three days and hence we order it so, ensuring that what remains inside becomes healed.
And when you have seen for me by the doctors a cushion and blanket on his chest bed, they place one servant under that area of the cane (lungs), placing therein part of it; at which point he calls upon him to receive treatment, applying pressure where as from the moistened lungs is coming out.
Thus he has confessed that she had not inserted a vein nor ligature, and the air of flies is entering her body; treat her until the focus becomes healed.
And if it does not happen on the bed, then return to rest and take care of your daily affairs.

This common ingrown toenail (herniation) is also referred to as a bruised foot and occurs mainly in the legs for females possibly due to pressure or other local factors such as tight shoes causing friction leading to skin breakdown beneath the nails, resulting in pain. The term "apostema" here describes an infected

And when it's accidental, one is seemingly similar to plantar warts and the other resembles an embolism appearing as a node in a vessel, causing fear due to potential serious complications such as blood clots or circulatory issues which require immediate medical attention. These terms reflect different clinical concerns linked with ingrown toenails: one relates more superficial skin growths while the other involves vascular health implications that can lead to significant risks if not properly managed by a physician, potentially pointing toward an urgent need for professional intervention rather than self-treatment. And only make assumptions about him when you come with iron as he is small. Here comes the first source sentence to translate:

This sentence seems to be seeking a clarification on how medical practitioners distinguish between 'node' (likely referring to lymph nodes or similar structures) and 'exitus,' which could mean death, as in the case of disease outcome—possibly
The translation here discusses the signs indicating a possible 'exitus' or death: "Therefore you say that fever and sharp pains are quality of exiture; these subside when sedation is applied to quench the superfluity, at which point putrefaction ceases, along with fever, pain, and heat." Here, a physician identifies specific symptoms (fever, acute pain) that suggest approaching death or 'exitus.' The term 'sedated' implies calming these excessive states ("superfluitat"), potentially through medication. When this leads to the stopping of fe
This line appears to detail a specific symptomatology and possibly refers to an internal condition—possibly cancer ("le cifra el Leon") residing in the chest cavity ('es sacc prop'). In English, this could be translated as: "Therefore there is no fever or sharp pain at those
The translation here describes a secondary condition in relation to the body's color and symptoms: "Secondly according to the constitution of the chest (and) his treatment is like an eel or snake, either major or minor; these are second species, fourth or fifth fats, containing moisture. The colors of this humidity correspond as specified in that division." Herein lies a detailed medical observation where 'node' could refer to signs within the chest cavity (possibly indicative symptoms such as swelling). Treatments are likened metapthyically and categorized into specific types, potentially indicating fats with moisture content—a concept that might correspond loosely to modern understandings of edema or fluid retention. This statement seems rooted in the medieval framework
Then, when you reach the stage of curing this node (referring to an abnormal growth or lump on the body), insert what has been expelled into it for strengthening as appropriate according to its shape which appears at that time.

If it is broken during the operation, there's no way to remove that healthy one; and if nudged or moved repeatedly afterward, extract them only while they remain inside where nothing will harm them anymore.
If from your body any cause arises, either few or too many, return according to its means.

Some evenings are puffed up the breasts of male homeless individuals who wake up having just had their meals, and thus inflated/swollen nipples, which form around women's chests – notably raised or prominent in this position. This sentence seems to reflect a misunderstanding between different cultural concepts regarding breast anatomy—where the term "mamillas" could be incorrectly used as shorthand for breasts and there appears to be some confusion about physiological responses (like nipple erection) due to changes during sleep or eating. Here's how we might translate it line by line into clearer English:
To the one who drinks this water, cover that which is extracted from the lunar node according to this manner; starting at point B and ending at point G, cleanse the entire lesion thoroughly, apply dressed medicinal flesh (likely a poultice made of animal matter), adjust the lips of the dressing on both sides of the body clothed in garment, and cure that which is within who has been healed.

Cuando tratas estos síntomas en estas venas hinchadas (les ties), sentirás silbido al tacto, lo cual indica un problema circulatorio potencial asociado con el tejido afectado y las estructuras circundantes: cuando hay apendicita debido a la artetería extendida en los talones del pie; tratar estos puntos dolorosos cerca de ahí (am les ties) te hará escuchar un silbido, sugiriendo una conexión entre el problema cutáneo y las estructuras vasculares debajo.

If it is an abscess caused by a vein blockage, then take what you have gathered so far for your possible intervention at the navel area and insert the needle there; make that needle penetrate further; ensure this occurs within these two layers whereby as soon as you remove one from another link (likely referring to different treatment approaches or techniques), apply ligature according to what was previously mentioned in threading through those body extremities of the vein.

This phrase appears to be related to medical terminology, potentially from a period when several languages were used in the field of medicine (
The provided text is a complex medical description that seems to be from the medieval era or influenced by Latin and other Romance languages like Italian and Spanish in its syntax:
If it is due to the crack of the cistern and leakage from the fabric (referring possibly to tissue or organ), then the appearance of the inflammation resembles that of the body; and its pain can be seen in various situations, like a lion'thy discomfort. If it is for the escape of the intestine (budel), then when you have noted that amount which we have recounted today, with varying degrees and considering what has been mentioned to you previously, return; but if he returns already present here, his situation is celebrated through vigorous bathing and strenuous exercise.
May if it is due to moisture, then it's like a lion and cannot be hidden when you press with your hand on the area, nor does it contract or swell up.
If it is about sanctus (sacred or holy), here appear the black ulcers advancing upon these limbs' ends.
May it be flesh if nothing is lacking, then severe and hard swelling occurs, which stands according to a certain amount.
If it is due to windiness, then this touching of him (the patient) by you becomes a lion.
Here comes the first source sentence to translate:
If the prominency of the navel is due to the intestine or band, then order that it retain its position and be extended outward; and assign a guardian for all over this area where you have placed your hand in contact with (the patient's belly button), placing another servant on their legs as well. Also command those within the circuit of the navel to stand opposite each other between your hands, directly above that point at which you touched; encircle them together using spinal rope within this area around where they are standing with one foot per lord'impostum (the impotence). Further instruct their guardian in how it should be managed when moved or held.
And if the phlegm of the inflammation spreads over the ligaments and you insert that into this area here indicated and thereabout, having previously caught it or held onto it via the ligament, then take out the intestine now; otherwise dragged along by its own weight, pushes the intestine to the various divisions of the abdomen.
If you have torn the fabric (of flesh), take that one and apply it here; also inspect those excess parts of him/her.
If it is contrary to your lancing or vein, encircle that area, and return to your operation; take two needles and insert them into those fields you have opened for draining the abscess located in the knee joints, through which you pierce with these very same needles—and hold tightly at four parts along each of these points.
If you wish to do so, place the needles and insert them into where flesh expands and extends out; when it is subtlety inserted and retracted by yourself, ensure that such fluid retained inside those wounds gets drained off as they heal.
If the prominence of the navel is made of flesh or moisture in it (the abdomen), then you must cover that abscess with hay and extract out dirt and wetness, which are present there, and care for whatever comes up to cleanse the location.

We already have measured out the spices from the sea for medicine, and we know how to use each of these herbs in healing as well.
And that which is cured by iron alone, it is not the art of tympanites nor the specialty of phlebitides; for these are deadly to those who have them.
When you have already treated this herb-based tympanic medicine and do not wish for your medication to interfasse with it, consider that if relief has been achieved in the hump or abdomen/chest area of these individuals, take care as one would when treating elsewhere on their body; fear is at stake here.
May you again open the patient's waist if it is excessively full of vitality, and not another illness or child-bearing woman; this action for your operation consists in opening up between yourself (the practitioner), holding their hand, and expressing the abdomen there with that same hand as you pinch water from just after the navel's descent. Place a spiny sponge according to this form:
Such acute parts are present with the sword (spatula), but there may be small points of sharpness at times during the operation; in order that none enter into the cavity and you can handle them safely.

May it be that if the generation of watery humors is due to illness from riding a carriage (this could imply discomgy or motion sickness), then your section, meaning part of your body responsible for such functioning – likely referring to intestinal organs located on the left side of the navel as per tradition in ancient medical practices - must act accordingly and be directed therefor three days

And not over that rib (or side of the body) where you wish to speak about sickness, so as not for those unnecessary humors to flow down there quickly; this suggests maintaining a certain posture or position during discussions on health issues related to excess bile production.

Perforate the entire colon with a tool (possibly for irrigation or examination), and insert it into that section/organ, raising your arm underneath at waist level between navel and sphincter; then scrape along there if only an ointment is available. This indicates using manual techniques to cleanse the colon with a tool where specific medication like salve (ointment) may be applied afterward for treatment of certain conditions possibly involving excess moisture or imbalance in humors, as indicated by traditional medical practices mentioned earlier within this translated text from medieval times.
Perforate the catheter until your hand (or tool) reaches where water collects; this likely refers to introducing a medical instrument such as an enema tube into the colon up through the rectum and beyond till it arrives at the location of accumulated fluids or waters, indicating another step in therapeutic procedures for treating Return that which has been taken out, and insert an instrument of this form into it. and it appears as a subtle silver canula; made of either silver or ivory (or leather), to which at the bottom part you attach three small lancets—two from one set and one from another—the extremity being sharp according to the quill'dict, done so many times:
And when the instrument is put in between them outside of you (the patient), as soon as it enters the water, that very moment they will be drawn out onto the instrument, and if not all are removed within an hour, then due to their own resolution spirit animal may cause drowning or five fingers leading death.

Here we discuss non-cancerous findings requiring careful handling, with instructions on treating them possibly by application into an antiseptic salve typical in ancient practices; emphasizing the need to maintain its cleanlinthy state during treatment and recovery period.
Translation: If the wound is indeed cancerous and discolored (possibly indicating necrosis or advanced disease), you should apply caustic substances directly to its location, potentially as a form of local treatment like cauterization.

In the context of this sentence, which seems rooted in historical or perhaps traditional medicine relating to childbirth and postnatal care (circumcision is a procedure that can sometimes occur around the time of birth), here's an English translation:
Circumcision is not a solution for continuation of diseases like these: however, if it comes from our operation and intention, and the urine belongs to those children specifically, then in that better surgical intervention we must place the lost limbs closer to salvation.
So they say that ancient times did not perform castration among free men, for it is neither used in their laws nor only acquired through experience—this causes them to abandon the majority of craftsmen and barbarians who use circumcision and mundification with new scissors and tweezers; using ligature made of sinew and sharp nail.

Thus when you understand your two degrees of hardness, measure accordingly, cutting a piece following an exchange and in due time—this results in compression of the nail on its form (shape), along which there is no error from top to bottom.
The first source sentence translates into English as: "The primary reason for the operation is that you make the child mostly lie on their shoulder only where the sinew rests and allow them to stay there until tomorrow.
And when that joy is what you are able in your capacity of receiving the patient'thy intelligence, Here you prepare to maintain the place between your thighs as not being central (it implies that it shouldn'thy be in a position of vulnerability), and conceal forks or any other tools from view on your body, so that neither this child nor anyone else can see those instruments.

When referring specifically to the treatment of retained urine in the bladder, here is a possible translation line by line:
Retain urine in the bladder is pain due to excess humors such as phlegm or choleric bile, similar to stones or tumors, and seemingly resembling those mentioned by healers for cures during division.
If there is no dissolution of the water we have discussed so vehemently as a cause over the groin, then take out this instrument with which you call syringe, which form it takes: It's made of silver and subtle lion conquest, similar in length to both palm and thumb (the handle), held delicately at the top of the patient.

The given medieval medical text seems to be written in a mixture of languages with Latin
From the stone." The phrase "de extraccio de peyra," when translated into
From the stone we have discussed about the species of stones and their cure according to medicine; as for these stones formed in urine (likely referring to kidney or uric acid stones) versus those formed in bladder (which could refer to different types of bladder stones), considerations regarding them.
In the stone where the operation takes place, and a section is present.
The provided Latin-influenced text seems like a translation of medieval medical advice into English, with an attempt at capturing the essence and technicality of that era'thy treatise:
Here he reports that such an exhibition has been made and abbreviated.
Therefore say that stones are born mainly in the bladder of children; and from their kidneys it seems like urine flowing within its subtlety, appearing therein; gout inflames his ureter, painful movements come about, and is dressed for this purpose. (Note: This translation attempts to capture not only literal meaning but also the general context of medieval medical practice as understood from these fragmented sentences.)
And it is difficult treatment for those children within that have reached twelve years of age, and in the thighs. May in young people move through these fluids that flow between them.
From that which the stone is greater and where healing requires less effort; if it's little, contrary to that.
So when you reach the treatment of that, cover it with a cloth at the shrine where it exits through all those holes which are inside your belt; there such an opening sometimes prohibits the poisoning (or absorption) from under its stone and investigation comes to light.
Here comes the first source sentence to translate:
Return that instrument between your thighs which you have prepared earlier, and the rest of those things are on their legs now; thus causing the bladder as a whole to descend gradually into its divisions.
When they proceed with that which concerns it all together (the entire area), hereby completing everything necessary for treatment within this space, by doing so effectively cover
Therefore, if you feel the pain in that space (the area where discomfort is present), then place your hand over it immediately to secure its position and potentially alleviate some of the suffering caused by gout or related issues according to medieval medical practice described herein. This response follows directly from the preceding
If not for several days the treatment you administered does nothing effective (meaning it's ineffective or insignificant), then take that portion of your tool mentioned previously and insert into his bottom part, considering if he is still a child (you should use appropriate tools as per age) or has completed puberty but not yet fully grown adult manners. Here the emphasis lies on adjusting treatment according to patient's stage in life: using different methods for children versus pre-adult males and applying it into their anus, likely referring to a kind of herbal remedy that should be inserted directly where needed as per traditional practices outlined earlier – possibly aligning with the use of In this context, it suggests applying a specific treatment for an indeterminate amount (several days) if previous efforts are ineffective; once inserted into the patient's rectum where necessary Consequently, convert that small portion to its proper place within the bladder neck (the entrance of the urinary bladder). This translation implies an ongoing adjustment in treatment
Furthermore, proceed with that which has been previously placed within the tool (likely an inserted treatment), and excrete it out through those parts of the body you have designated for its passage—the area from where your hand is positioned to facilitate expulsion during a procedure. Here, there's possibly mentioning either administers or removal processes related
When the minister presses on his chest; and commands another minister to extend their right hand over the parts below (likely referring to lower body areas), while yet another minister tightens the catheter in the location where sectioning is performed.
Return it into its chamber, this is how they are brought back here: and cut the water between the colon and the intestines, not in their place of sleep (presumably above or within the left hip region), with its section placed on that stone; this section forms a transverse one, so that it becomes wide and can be sewn according to the quantity determined by how much is possible from that stone, without exceeding what has been prepared for use in the belly where the intestine usually resides.
E discern that there is any stone from which the body must be cleansed; it is difficult for water to cleanse due to its nature.
From that fluid (the accumulated fluid), it looks like a lion and is round, made of bloodletting for its treatment.
So if it is that which has been bent or stretched outwards, adjust in the crack/rift.
If there is not a cure at the forum (medical facility), then you must create remedies for that which hurts or presses upon it, applying them where they touch the skin over the affected area; do not leave without doing so: immediately insert undernethy thin instruments of curvature.
May you not be able to cover that, then increase the disruption a little, and if you see fluid flow, dissolve it away with sulphuric acid diluted.
If the stone is within one (the body), then you will guide it into the mouth of the bladder, and press upon that area; also apply a small amount herein; seemingly as pains due to diseases.
If there is stone of great size inside you, it's because your ignorance leads you to insert that large chunk within the bladder; for this reason, one or two causes are possible: either it remains lodged there due to continuous urine distillation, and thus the place isn'thy fully consolidated.
May administer removal from within that has been pushed out or a wound in the bone where tools are inserted to extract it therefrom, until it is completely extracted and healed (inside-out).

When that air is released, apply water and oil on the affected area, taking care to do so until it heals completely.
May if in the worm you cauterize and heal decayed flesh, as it seems like the sanctity is congealed within the bladder (and urine flow is prohibited because of this), then insert the thorn into the worm and extract that very thing which prompts the bladder to corrode further.

If the stone is small and located in the bladder's meat, and it lies therein, urinary catheterization is prohibited; otherwise, care for that man who approaches a segment due to this condition has been taken. Moreover, they have already drained out the fluid, and now you need to grasp a forceps made of iron with which this instrument resembles:

No is it necessary to use hemp rope for the stone within (probably referring to kidney stones), but rather so that they do not return into the bladder; and another string above unless you remove the specific thread attached atop of said pelvis, then the tailbone returns to its place and rises from below. This suggests a traditional treatment involving manipulation or adjustment for potential urinary obstruction possibly caused by stones (like kidney stones). The terms here are steeped in medieval medical practice, using terminologies like "liament" (rope), which may have been used to secure instruments during procedures; "feil de justas," likely referring specifically to hemp rope of high quality or purity
Because of the fluid (which could be referring to urine), you must raise your tailbone upwards when removing it above; or return with due respect and gratitude as directed in these words we have spoken about, allowing everything down below naturally take its place again. This final sentence emphasizes the importance of proper technique during medical interventions involving manual adjustments (as implied by "raising your tailbone") for urinary issues—a common concern addressed within this textual tradition from a historical perspective on medicine. It underscores not only the physical but also the respectful

This segment discusses what happens when fluid accumulation occurs in the scrotum (believed to be a misinterpretation of "le cipha blanc" for 'scrotum'). The excess moisture contains lymph or fluids within which semen develops, and this is referred to as the ‘crypt’. It appears that there might have been an attempt here to explain hernias in a way reminiscent of medieval medical texts where bodily humors were thought responsible
Here some observations are made in the peritoneum (assumed to be a translation of "le propri pannicol"), where nature takes its course within the seminal portion; and this is precisely between the scrotal sacs which have already been mentioned, but it's not merely fluid – rather, we observe that there exists bile here. In modern terms: During examination in some cases of a condition affecting male reproductive organs (possibly referring to an issue related with semen or sperm), the peritoneum is observed where natural processes are occurring within part(s) dealing directly with fluids – implying that bile, instead of just fluid build-up
E the generation of this hernia is due to debility that affects the kidnethy (kidney), causing these substances to flow outwards from them; and some are expelled through impact with force on the kidnethy, using a pointy cautery.
This moisture has movements of colors; whether it is turning to lemon or vinrose red, black dungy, or watery white, this is what we must witness more closely.
And for the reasons why this addition of water is necessary in our text: if it's about the white cheese we mentioned earlier (and presumably its consistency and moisture content), then setback occurs after a short rest with watery form, appearing as liquid body; since humidity throughout contains that whole.
If the moisture is in the patient'se visceral lining (panniculus), then an abscess forms and departs from there, so that he considers it another bladder (hollow).
If there is fluid between the navel and the white waistband (referring perhaps to a belt or undergarment of that color), then apply cold pressing with your fingers on the center point.
When you wish to learn about the color of humidity, look at the moisture that has entered and preceded its form; as soon as it enters through your wounds, observe the color of what has come in.
So when we come to the treatment of him who is ill with metal phlegm (which may be possible for you), then do as follows: sometimes apply pressure on his chest.

When recalling the operation in that place along with its instruments (surgical tools).
Thus say I about the humors rising in the parts where the sinews are applied and feel pain due to excessive acute inflammation that bursts into those joints or from impact (such as a blow), causing discomfort:
When the bruise'dictates its own hue according to the body's color and it does not cause pain in itself, it is a serious injury.
And when it is loosened (the lodgment), its color is dark, and there's nothing left at the place where it was lodged.
Here come some pains due to the entanglement of sinews and for inflammation in those joints where it has already been noticed by us, or because of swelling of veins.
May it be known that when inflammation of the joints occurs, they are comfortable with separation due to apathexis (loss or lack of natural defenses), and do not touch them.
May that which is pained by inflammation of a vein not be dispersed anywhere else, and it requires compression here.
And it is possible that this specific condition affects the joint and other bones; thus insert your finger into the navel of the patient, position their hood over the areas below (the regions undernethy), extract the white cyst from those parts, open the ligaments holding the veins, separate them, incise and remove that which is present throughout all these sections.
Then if it is that he has already solidified his flesh thereon (at the site of concern), remove what you have extracted and inserted into it.
If there is adhesion within any cause of cholecthy (referring likely to a gallbladder issue), or between the bile ducts, then remove all that adhesion and clean it out using round instruments.
If there is a native flesh at the spot behind it (possibly referring to an area where something may have lodged or become trapped), then insert everything you find here and extract it together with what we already hold.
So when your operation is complete, fill the wool with oil and vinegar, and carefully ensure that it enters into another remedy to aid in healing.

The treatment for an intestinal protrusion (hernia).
The appearance of this hernia is due to a section that extends over the abdomen from parts of the belly'dictum, so that when these cords break through those sections, it occurs here.
This rupture is either of the chest or due to exacerbation of it, and you must soothe these pains with various means: by pressing, rubbing, shouting (which can expel evil spirits causing pain), lifting a cause heavy [implying weight], or simulating such causes.
When the humoral fluid (Aquapuncture), when it is expelled due to chest constriction (Chest tightness), does not cause illness or puncturing, and remains within the lung cavities for long periods of time without causing harmful effects, this becomes its essence.
When the patient' extrication from their seat of pain happens as they sit down; various signs appear on the seemingly protected area mentioned beforehand (coccyx), and it is due to intestinal movement, which affects that part - here are all aspects related.
Some times an intestine gets pushed out through the hole in the wall of the cavity, and it is called this entrails' extrusion here.
Here come some movements are painful and others run into the opened intestine (hernia), which is retained here due to great malevolence of humors in the body, causing severe misery when pressed upon.
In the treatment of this illness's spices we have fear, so that it may be avoided in those places.
The command of that operation for the patient to return the intestine or hernia into its cavity if they obey your instructions is given by you; place yourself over their navel and raise their legs.

In the first days after having an issue with hernia where it has been recommended to have certain implements placed over and dried out in place; this action targets any moist condition (or 'apostema') that might develop there, under which these objects should remain until they harden.

This interpretation aligns well within the context of early medieval medical practices where simple tools were used for direct physical interventions on patients' bodies before advanced surgical techniques became commonplace.

Regarding the lubrication of the scrotum: The phrase translates to "Concerning the moistening/lubrication
In menstruants (i referring to males here), the scrotum is moistened through certain means four times during their cycles and care must be taken with regard; possibly indicating a connection between lubrication in these areas, health practices or hygiene related advice within that specific cultural context.
Thus it is necessary for them who are concerned with the care that makes one wet (likely referring to semen), and they should place all of this within their own scrotum, over which moisture has been applied; also adjusting both lips as needed in such treatment. This suggests a practice or remedy where maintaining balance between elements—possibly humors according to medieval medical theories—is essential for health. The inclusion of laboratoryia (lips) implies that the mouth is involved, perhaps through mastication on specific herbs or substances during these times as part of their regimen which may influence lubricating processes within both men and women's bodies in accordance with ancient medical wisdom.
Should you wish to include it, during the meal there is excess moisture in the scrotum which has been subjected to three or four cookings and a tight sewing: This may refer to dietary considerations affecting lubrication within men's bodies.

Necessary cause is that the matrona smells inhales the fragrance of childbirth at her parts and when you touch a woman to these areas, she desires for air scenting; this requires action because it arises from above on top (of her), indicating labor stages. Knowledge dictates herein that such part is second natural figure (probably referring to cervical dilation during childbirth) and the examination should be done over its head, while another attendant hangs or pendulously suspends below it—likely representing the placenta post-delivery.
So when you lift those limbs, it is so that the patient'thy stomach may be compressed for them to ensure embryonic departure once they lie on their head; at this time, give them a second one (implying another treatment or instrument), and cleanse away any superfluous humors with proper purgation.

If there is pain before the bone and if those sharp stones are separated from it, then apply force to extract them with a hammer (torque). If they are not separated, then let them be washed out, as their removal is facilitated by cleansing.
When other accidents occur in the rest of the body, healing is dependent on the fluid we have mentioned before.
From "the troubles of the stomach.
The discomdictio (disposition) within which you suffer in your belly is either great or little, or wandering/moving.
The given medieval medical text is in a language that blends characteristics of Latin with elements from Italian, Spanish and French influences which makes it somewhat challenging to translate directly into English without the original lexicon or contextual understanding specific to this period'thy treatise. However, I will attempt an educated guess at translating each line:
Therefore the best interruption will occur, as it is difficult in those days to reduce the hernia, just like painful spices are hard near these times mentioned herein.
Be aware that the stitching of the belly is done by four kinds of needles and if it' extrusion may use common suture materials for other wounds on the body as well.
When two other stitches communicate with each other or themselves in the abdominal stitch, it may be either both to/between them or solely within their own stitching.
And you recommend each of your patients for examination and declaration.
So when the child is small and suffers from some cause of hernia, it becomes difficult to reduce that; either due to diminutive size with rupture accompanied as we have said beforehand, or because of inflation caused by cold air.
And when the fluid ascends, now that you have cut and submerged there in water a wet linen wound alone, or as it rises squirting with water, adding herbs like celandine, spikewort, and plasters to this within which the inflammation is resolved.
When joint pain occurs and there is a need for such intervention, it' extradies better than water alone in healing the inflammation.
And when the inflammation is resolved, then you moisten the intestine in which it was protruding and with a few causes of illness (such as wine or vinegar), they are drawn back into the body.
If it is possible to release the interior of him for this treatment, then divide the rupture into small parts using a tool with which they have been previously sewn (embroidered).
The initial translation of this medieval medical text is as follows:
From the tool, its form follows.
One sharp turn of the body, and another non-sharp turn, and a subtle movement that is not like the subtlety of bone – these are both acute angles; one blunted by this very slightness.
And when the patient' extrudes or expands and pushes out the intestine, it is best to reduce its size back to its original form in its proper place, if at all feasible over there (in that location).
When the disruption is wide open and in the lower abdomen area, where you have made the hernia protrude on their backs, and placed cushions under them so that their clothes fit snugly at the waist; if it' extruded above the stomach level, then place a pillow or support there as well.
Here comes the first source sentence translation:
And when you are removing phlegm from large and small pus,
In minor pains, where you have prepared the remedy for yourself (the minister), place it between your most sensitive areas; this tube holds the entire disruption at its base and adjusts the lips of yours accordingly, moving from that cause to another if there is a suture connection involved.
Here is the translation line by line:
Here comes the first source sentence translated into English line by line:
Here come the needles to move between hardness and subtlety, where small ones enter into flesh; large are difficult in the spine, hence why they may travel through delicacy and bulkiness.
And where the needle is not inserted into any of the patient'dict body extremities provided for, in order that flesh may not protrude and the wound be properly healed.
Not for they are not meant to be stitched up so that the patient is not prevented from healing (consolidation).
Here comes the sentence in English translation:
These surgical needles are placed in a manner conducive to the small wounds for their stitching; it is sufficient that they use one or two of these, as needed for those wounds.
May the second stitch be comparable: and it is that you apply a needle to the four extremities of the chest, between the collarbone and both shoulders, in moderation with precision and thickness using the same needle.
When the needle is in these four extremities (hands/feet), reduce the portion of that same thread from which you are working, to ensure that the fallen part remains within its divided section below and undernethy dresses will be tightly drawn according to this stitching.
And there is a pause between any one of its stitches for the quantity of the thick part of that piece of matter.
This stitch is for men.
E has made a stitch where the patient, who was inside his belly and had been suffering from an ulcer on one side of the abdomen (the rupture of the larger part of the appendix), which disrupted both intestines two palms away from each other within the womb. And thus you have reduced that downward pressure where the appendix has caused a foramen in its location over XX hours.
The child is solidified in the spaces of fifteen days or more, and treated for it herein; apply warmth through motion to increase age, and discuss within their positions.
E the other doctors had not healed; and by miracle fire, they did not cure that which was enveloped in it without attack nor any medicine applied to it herein, perhaps a touch of mud wetted with honey from time to times during daylight hours while near water cleansing.
May you direct two types of stitches according to what is told in Parayla'dicta.
When you begin with needlework on the tongue and insert the thread from one fork of the forked knife to another,
And when the needle enters the navel and into that abdomen portion, going all around its entirety, you place it in the area where the thread has been inserted previously; thereafter, insert the thread from the other part of the division into the opposite extremity of my body.
When you have felt that penetration, then make another penetration in the extreme parts of this body'thy limb from where it began to its end; and let the exterior cavity be made by means thereof with needles inserted into each other extremities within these limits.
When your insertion enters the chamber in the limb' extrémity where it all goes, that is to say, into this body space inside which everything flows together.
Here begins with this patient' extrusion from the coccyx and that end in here, taking out one of the needles inserted into it, placing it back there and cutting off at its extremity which is on the other side where metals meet each other; then takes another such as exists within him.
Here comes the first source sentence to translate: And when it is necessary for one fluid (water) to be given, and another type of replenishing liquid as much as possible according to what has been removed so far, just like that.
The sum total of this suture operation is that you sew the skin with which hairs grow, ensuring a stitch at the part of the limb extremity (presumably where an injury has occurred), and let it be until the bandage is complete.
May the second special type of suture that Gualia provides and through which he speaks for his patient to be done is it whereby this half-woman medicinant cuts what she herself has already made, so that all parts are properly divided according to nature; apply another part from her own body along with the viewpoint (or aspect) of each other' extratop and match them accordingly.
When you hold the needle at your appointed part of departure, and push that into the departed portion therein, and turn over both ends of the catheter; rotate the needle so that it enters the lumen of the catheter in its two extremities.
Here are the translations line by line:
This stitching is better than simple sewing thread and it's for which the memory returns.
This is the discourse of Guillain
Even if the patient has a wound in their abdomen that is sewn together with two needles, you insert several of these into the existing stitches so as to begin an intimate introduction (insertion) process for your thread therein; and have it penetrate within those same sutures where surgeons cut through patients' bodies.
When there is a disturbance in the intestine'dictum of the belly (belly location), it becomes difficult to stitch here than at other parts of the belly.
May the application of medicine for children be judgment of other illnesses.
La cause is when you continue to treat the fresh excrement present therein because it changes that condition and return the intestine (and hernia) back into its cavity properly after stopping them on this corporeal ground, holding their hands in place.
If the air has altered the bubbles, then pause over that place where you currently are inside and sew hard leather or canvas for fields, and secure them with stitches; take care of this ailment as well as other diseases within which it is healed.
May you not have the medicines present with you at this very moment; instead, pause over that which is most urgent today and begin to apply poultice, cold compress, and exchange them for each other as needed during the day while following my instructions, until it heals, so that dependence on other medical treatments in specific situations will not arise.
If you fear that the vermin may communicate through injury to the primary members of the body, then immediately immerse wool in cold-pressed oil or vinegar and pause it within the spaces between joints and around tendons.
If there is pain or putrefaction in your intestines (budels), they will move restlessly, and it becomes apparent that the prolapse has entered its cavity; this happens mostly if the prolapse reaches the intestine itself and causes a forceful penetration inside of it.
And know that what is from within the thick intestine heals quickly, whereas what resides in the thin intestines takes longer to recover.
It is difficult for the intestine to which it has been called "gout" not to receive healing from manure contained within its cavity; and this difficulty arises due to the large number of veins present in it, as well as their size in those places, and because of the subtlety of that body part concerning them, and by virtue of proximity to the nature of nerves.
If the matter you are processing is dirt (soil), then you obtain that which came recently, and reduce it according to your ability at hand whereby you also diminish those swellings internally.
If space has passed through and blood or black fluid has been drained from the location that it was darkened by them, then you press down on that faithful part to make sure the flow of bile returns in their veins and arteries.
Here comes the text to translate line by line:
Remembrance of diseases when they worsen in the intestine/cavity.
When an obstruction occurs in the intestine and it'seemed small at first glance due to percussion of a lance on its abdomen area (which was previously inflamed by something inside for digestion purposes, representing part of the seventh section/quadrant of the stomach), which is old age fistula that required intervention, along with labor and vitality changes.
And now you apply the treatment to him that was not confirmed in his healing process; may this subtly alleviate what is inside and strengthen the location where it' extricated itself.
Here is the line-by-line translation of the medieval medical treatise:
And experienced practitioners who when the patient is in the budel (a type of instrument or container used for medical treatments), it's necessary to grasp large cauteries; and adjust the lips of the patient with those, holding one from within their mouth which protrudes over the patient’s lips – so hold onto that tongue piece tightly. When you grip this through your teeth firmly (implying a technique for insertion), it adheres to its place without dissolving or falling out.
Return your pace (or rest) for the first time itself and do not cease doing so until you have formed another one as per the quantity of all present individuals.
Reduce that and the flesh within it, and remove those attached parts from inside the hernia until the hernia is healed; do not harm anyone' extramural tissue.
And it is possible that the intestine (the bowel) has been pierced by something delicate from among the patient's animals present herein, pushed in with a needle; and you grasp its extremity thereof, detachable now, and apply your fingers to this part of his body, enveloping it within hands.
This cut for stitching is only a second means of trust and hope.
May it be that the child is large and wide, mainly if in one of the small intestines, then such a thing cannot simply disappear nor can its healing here for all.
Of treatment for hernias and fistulas.
You understand that when all children and apostema become infected and ulcers appear without healing or detachment over time in any part of the body, universally it is called "fistula," which we refer to as this abscess.
E fistula according to truth is a tightly woven, hard, white fabric where there is no pain and which becomes swollen as it does with arthritis; therefore that part inflates, namely the aching itself (pain).
In damp environments, which soaks clothing; and once removed from these conditions for several hours at a time, the moisture dissipates quickly. Some movements of this moisture occur, and they are scanty, thick, and subtle.
And have shown all those causes, and their symptoms are the subject of medicine in this division.
And when you have made such knowledge about the treatment of an abscess caused by surgery on the womb,
Here comes the first source sentence to translate:
And therefore this one of these ulcers that is according to the current illness belongs to diseases difficult to cure and without care; it consumes effort and ignorance.
If there is any depth in the ulcer that does not reach these locations mentioned herein and you hope for its healing, and wish to gain knowledge of it, take iron or silver attempts; if the fistula afterward straightens itself out, seek her immediately.
May it be that if the fistula is twisted, investigate with a subtle piece of lead undernethy's body where their soul ascends and bend to correct its curvature.
If there is a malignant ulcer present, it'thy not within your power that you may attempt upon it.
Now apply the poultice with your ointments; through which moisture you cleanse that part will be drawn by other preparations and absorbed from them.
Here comes the first source sentence to translate:
When you have stood over all these causes and see them clearly, then according to your confidence: look for whether it is an apparent fistula close by or in the joint far from connection, or nerve, artery, vein, one of those places which are yours and where I tell.
When you dry out the fistula as directed by the physician' extrication of that which is present in the filtration and corrupted flesh, whether it originated from organ processing or carnal decay/particles (or even soulless entities), until such time when this thing within has been cured.
May if the fistula is deep within and secondarily sealed, then cover it as much as you can with what remains on your person; apply cleansed pads wrapped in sharp medicines around them, insert those into the cavity of the fistula which you have comprehended to be iron.
When some humors enter for a few days into the cavity of the fistula caused by decay, and medicine sharply dissolves all that enters therein.
Return that which remains in wax as it generates healthy flesh within until it is healed.
If it is not healed by this means, then do apply a second treatment as recommended.
May you determine the cause of fistula if it is in your power to do so; then investigate that and its dry aspect according to what we have recommended, provided that you don'thy forbid any source of vein or nerve injury or main body part malady as we discussed.
If you discover your bones and there is any corruption or darkness within, then seek out that which harbors the corruption completely; take care of it with what embodies this sickness inside where it resides to heal it entirely.
If it is not healed and rotten flesh remains as before the practice, you understand that you have not yet reached complete cure; then immediately observe carefully on yourself wherein lies the disease'dictated by nature itself (the body), purify this region thoroughly according to divine guidance above us in heaven. Also restore what is lost at last.
And if it heals, eat; but if not, then understand that the corruption is deep within the body and has not been cured yet, so you need to take further measures at this point as well.
If the bone is decayed or damaged, it's within your power to extract that as well using fine forceps which I have deemed suitable for such a task.
If you have a bone dislocation, then extract all of them completely and do not let any remain for the sake of your strength.
May you not fear any cause of the moisture within them if there is in here nowhere to be afraid or erring; then proceed by inspecting those ligaments and bones that are present herein.
If you are not prepared with the bones of your hour (chest), then rest on a cushion that moistens and keeps wet while those same stones enter into their environment, which is where these bones should be located—their natural setting within cartilage and ligaments. And ensure this space remains undeveloped so it can heal properly; secure the section you've marked for in your operation.
Having feared (being afraid), pause over it covered in oil above the stool for three days or under Egyptian linen, or among any of their oils and fats when they tighten those bands around them so that bones are separated from each other and pulled away by these bandages.
If there is a great bone in the knee or thighs similar to those of others and from it someone has rotten out their face just enough so that you can see this state for once, then only briefly address whatsothy have corrupted until restoration returns its youth.
May it be that what has already been damaged from within is a great part of the problem, and because damage to the bone marrow has occurred, such repair becomes necessary; thus they must both close this wound inside where corruption arrived, so as for healing to occur.
And you should apply it inside the patient's thigh to prevent that from protruding and assist in your work.
A healthy young man in his forties experiences pain in the groin area; there is putrefied material from digestion within the body that enters into and resides in this region of flesh, which consists largely of decaying matter (a large abscess), not caused externally.
And now the fire extends to that place due to errors made by doctors within it, and all materials move there with force exerted upon them; this is where they use burning instruments for everyone'supremely challenging task of translating a medieval medical treatise written in a language blending Latin, Italian, Spanish, and French. Here’s the line-by-line translation:
And after a while many doctors have intervened and not in those humors but within the arts they were called upon to help.
Here comes the first source sentence to translate: "And now take away that cushion from him and remove those materials running through it all day, for his body is completely covered with yellow bile.
And then insert the thread into one of those instruments and ensure that it reaches the mouth.
And promptly examine and investigate those instruments and tools, bringing them over all parts of the thighs.
And now you have cut me and incised into one of those bones within which I had broken, and caused that piece to be rotten and decayed; it was already corrupted in part where there once entered the marrow inside.
And when I find out what has been discovered and prepared from bone by me,
And if it is that their bone was not in the socket but rather this deformation which had been broken and sealed shut, you already have made an incision or opening therein.
Returning now is necessary for restoring the patient'sup care with durable medical treatments over long periods of time, but it has not been made consistent or solidified yet.
Return and explore further on the second part of the bone above where it was first discovered, and continue to torture upon the bones.
And when I have applied the remedy that appears from this decay, and gently performed its healing care for you without restoration still remaining,
And so now you discover another wound and gradually insert the bone tooth by tooth, restoring what remains of it with medicine from there, which solidifies healing and cures sickness.
E no is it necessary repetition in the operation of his and her bowels nor for their tolerance and fear of death, for they willingly undergo throughout all hours due to excessive defecation syncopes.
So heals the whole body, and nothing is in bone-hard flesh; it'thy disposition within his own body works well, returning its vitality; conversely therein are no contrary dispositions causing harm during walking or due to any reason whatsoever.
May if the bone is protruding in the joint and you decide to compress it according to this method: then take a ligament and tighten that around the extent of which the bone projects, command another person (or yourself) to extend that; pull out the first thickened ligament from its place, position what remains over the flesh where the protruding bone is located, stretch it outside so you can tear the flesh into pieces for cutting at your desired location. Here's a line-by-line translation:
When a cushion or table is used for decency purposes after making an incision that does not cut the corrupted flesh, when:
When the wedge slowly descends into place and if it is within the cavity of decayed bone wherein it does not appear in its sudden emergence to feeling, then another instrument shall be used with caution for further intervention.
If the bones are decayed and not prominent, it is one continuous division or in any other place where deterioration occurs; therein you discover all of the body'dictions (degradations); apply firm pressure hereafter, and employ that instrument from the first part found for continuing the cutting/severance on the other divided parts.
And if it is a small prolapse at the site of corruption as we have mentioned before.
If decay is in the joint, cut out that corrupted joint, and saw off the bone from which it originates.
If decay is in the continuous flow of joints, it is not due to reason but malady (illness).
If the corruption is in the chest or abdomen, it's difficult; however, if you seek out where this imperfection appears on your body and correct that part according to any possible method within your reach, then mending for such cases can be accomplished by yourself, provided no conflict occurs with blood vessels or nerves.
Here is the translation line by line:
Be aware that this operation concerns the specificity of the tool with which you are familiar; when you have such extensive knowledge and experience in handling these instruments, as well as witnessing treatments for illnesses, then you will already possess what is necessary for your intervention on the body'dictum.

From joints of limbs and bone interlockings;
Limbs are weakened or due to internal/external causes, or if after treating that corruption with these remedies does not relieve discomfort, sometimes the deterioration occurs in a limb which you do not touch; hence when you insert this limb into your body's cavity, malady escapes through it to cause death by external/malign forces or greater weakening of that untouched part.
And the name of that person, it is because their limb has turned black inside where they are being lamed and focused by fire (perhaps indicating some form of severe injury or infection), which causes further darkening within the body part you treat them with your hands; therefore, understand this as yourself.
When the resemblance is due to putrefaction caused by some poisonous causes, such as seafood (scorpionfish), or worms and fleas of various kinds, it appears likewise in patients.
If the dislocation or fracture is in the said limb, then you will examine and not give space to the dislocation so that it does not enter into its cavity.
If you manage to enter the space (the cavity), then cut that which lies within the focus of the fireplace, and do not provide room for decay inside where smoke enters from the brazier'dictor: Here is how a medieval doctor would describe maintaining cleanliness in an oven used as part of their treatment.
If that occurs within your arm at the joint inside the cleft, then you should insert it into the crook of your arm there.
If another rupture occurs and I send the cough to their throat in that case it is the death of phlegm; administering an alternative cause for its quantity requires timely action.
When the appearance of pain in the limb indicates deterioration within it, then insert a pin into one of its nodes (nuts).
If you descend into the slope of the foot, then cut it entirely through the foot. May you enter through the doorway, then make an incision in the cushion within the joint of the thigh.
If decay has already affected the skin layer, it is not incurable but rather expulsion from life, and thus remove the malady to death.

This translation aims to maintain the essence of medieval medical terminology and language while attempting clarity in modern English:
Of treatment of the belly and quality of enema administration with medicine.
When an abscess is formed in the cartilage of joints and its space extends until it collects disease (infection), then break it open and perforate it; treat this sickness here within yourself by applying ointment with woolen cloth as a dressing, using undergarments carefully to prevent slippage. No bone fracture or damage occurs in the bones or nerves/ligaments—simply apply pressure gently and do not create an open channel (fistula).
Even if there are extended spaces within where decay is occurrthy upon any limb, it will then be referred to as a fistula and cannot come out again.
The cure for him/her is that they insert the entire thong therein as revolved, mostly when it becomes like a drape and does not stick due to its deterioration.

And these home remedies used by healthy people.
If of the belly there is indigestion that bubbles for days on end, you understand that the belly does not settle; and if delayed settlement of the belly becomes prolonged, adjust with medicines to expel them out, and when they are wet in their nature and disposition, dry them up externally using a lubricant (ointment) while being applied above excessive addition.

Of treatment for inflamed skin and nails caused by friction and cuts, insertion of medication and division (probably referring to cutting or amputation).
When the wound that has just been sealed from above and below is prolonged in its healing or when an apothecary' extrication treatment occurs for a chronic ulceration (apostema), it deteriorates, causing further damage inside the lesion of the foot or limb, and with continued progression until decay reaches that entire area; concurrently as corruption advances within its structure towards your nose where you perceive an odor emanating from it – resulting in pain at this extremity point (extremitat del dit lada) and a darkened appearance of the limb or foot (color de lu es fayta fusca).
And when you have taken the necessary amount of water that we mentioned in division and do not hinder your treatment, then immerse yourself entirely in it until all excess from the body is washed away; this will strengthen them greatly as they are cured by means of the bath.
If the bone and unguis are sound, and their additions cover the parts divided by disease, they begin to pound and lance that part which you have paused under the subtle angle of the unguis piercing flesh; pushing it inward with force until all harm is extracted from within where corrosive medicines burn inside while curing. And take care for this oil remains therein as long as healing continues, ensuring its continued treatment and restoration during recovery.
If decay has already entered the bone, then it is necessary to insert and extract it here because there' extrication from within never heals a bone.
If the jaw and chin go down as it is presumed that they remember their recovery, then take care to ensure that this one goes back into health.
May you perform percussion or incision on the navel area where there is intense pain, and dry out the wound with salt applied to spine ancillary transverse abdomen above (the patient'dicts), thus causing great discomfort in the belly, which may be due to superfluous flesh adjusted above this location; take care that the fluid does not enter into body tissue.

The translation for the phrase "Capitol .iiii." in this context seems to be referring to a specific treatment or procedure related to jaw realignment
When the jaw bone is misaligned and not fully separated into parts (not in two pieces), its knowledge or understanding should be clearer: it likely refers to recognizing that if the fracture has only been slightly displaced, without complete dislocation which would indicate a more serious injury requiring immediate medical attention.
Here comes the translation of each line:
If the jawbone is already separated into two pieces, then it is necessary to administer extension of parts such that healing may be possible for him.
If you are experiencing tooth pain leading to disruption, harden those of which you hope will break the filament of gold or silver or iron and then pause over the broken jawbone, and also pause on the doubled cloth covering it; place a tongue depressor along its length up to the extent of the fractured jawbone.

When broken (or separated), it is divided into two other parts that do not join together again naturally; and in such cases recovery at home may be attempted, but often requires medical treatment as the bone fragments are difficult to realign without professional intervention or when fracture involves non-union where healing does not occur. This line describes scenarios of a displaced (separated) shoulder blade with varying prospects for self-management and potential need for surgical correction, particularly in cases involving complex misalignment that is challenging to correct on one's own or when the fracture has resulted in bone fragments not joining together as expected. Here we have a statement about what might happen following an injury where proper healing of the scapula (shoulder blade) breaks down, indicating different treatment options depending on whether conservative care is possible
In such cases where the bone fragments are displaced (broken apart), two ministers or assistants must be present: one uses their hand to support and stabilize the broken scapula fragment(s), while another extends a cushion, pillow, or similar padding under that body part for comfort. This line outlines an approach in historical medical practice where direct manual intervention was required alongside auxiliary items (like padded supports) by multiple caregivers to manage and stabilize broken scapula fragments following trauma. Here the medieval text describes a practical method of injury management, highlighting that not only hands but also assistive objects were used for treatment purposes

In regard to the treatment of a broken bone.
The joints of some bodies are broken in the heat place where they lie, or perhaps their limbs may be moved and crushed there: then those parts will heal with sweat produced at that spot.
When accidents happen as his limb breaks and he experiences sharp pains in the body with difficulty breathing and chest, shoulder pain, headache severity, feverishness; these are declared through cavitation of bone fracture that is not hidden from sensation.
The restoration of the patient is that their abdomen must be placed on top of their two legs, with a gap between their shoulders left by placing a pillow there; and tighten the muscles of the patient, adjusting their back so it's more than two curves away from each other. Be subtle in your work as much as possible according to all available knowledge that suits this purpose, until you can return the figure of bone afterwards.

And tighten any stitches as required by appropriate healing methods at that time.

The text provided translates into English as: "Some time ago there was a break in the bones of the neck and backbone (vertebrae), and their connection/spondylodisc interarticulation, similar to those of the thoracic spine." Here is an itemized translation for each part: When you have applied heat to the affected area and want to know if it will heal or not, consider that: If your hands feel soothed and numb and cannot extend nor strengthen them, then understand that they do not heal there, and when these are compressed with fingers or needles, no pain is felt in those places where the points were applied.
If that ache and pain are felt in those areas, then you will know that the bone of the body is saved and humors circulate properly for healing.
If you look at the back of the spine and wish to know if it is healing or not, then take into account their feet as well.
When you find that it is already soothed, apply to those waters where the issue has occurred and when standing on your feet, breathing will occur naturally with a desire for elimination through urination; occasionally rising onto one'se shoulders happens because they are mortal beings, hence do not attempt self-healing.

Translation: The adjutant is between the shoulders underne0n the head of the shoulder (likely indicating a specific point for medical attention or treatment). Here's my interpretation based on these lines, broken down line by line with an attempt
If it is broken, the treatment for this adjutant (presumably a bone or structure related to shoulder support) should be by one of two means. The first method involves using an iron sword as mentioned in ancient times; herein lies another form that includes grasping firmly with your hand:
E they are ligaments in two places and hanging from that raised location.
Here follows the leg to rest on a cushion; and lift their broken arm inside where it will reach the warm spot of its socket, with the curve of the staff accompanying it.
Here comes the first source sentence to translate:
E the other method is that the humidity rises upon the patient'thy chest and suspends its flow from their neck by two servants, whereby one holds it with tongues between his/her own extremities; while another extends as required to reach outwards towards the parts.
If you wish the extension to be strong, then bend over the break in the ligaments and on those others as well; let both servants stretch their limbs fully.
And if the fracture is near the limb' extrinsic part, then you must pause the tendon over the site and immediately address the break with care for the hernia.
And if it is apparent that the break is in the groin area, then have someone pause (or tie) a bandage over that location and on the groin itself.
Here comes the first source sentence to translate: "English this makes it easy and helps with movement, and as long as you apply it according to good application, strengthens that which has been weakened by apesta.

And when the splint is placed on the fracture, and wrapping of cloth around the splint occurs, hold their arm above it; place your hand over where they are strained, to prevent them from being unbent there.

(Here "tua strictura When you lengthen the constriction of the fracture, it means that gentle stretching has been applied possibly to help realign or stabilize a minorly compressed break in
So if you find that the situation of your bones and constriction as we discussed earlier when restoring your limb to its proper position, then it is necessary for you to take action (in this context possibly referring to further medical intervention or adjustment).(Here "el sitio" refers back to site/location which in English would be 'site' of the fracture)

The arm is composed of two bones which are called 'fingers'; the smaller one corresponds to our thumb and that from where it emerges; while the larger follows its course as well." This sentence seems like a description related to anatomy, specifically mentioning parts of the human hand or limb.
And when either the great or small fire (referring possibly to an injury of heat) is broken only once and becomes a fracture/breakage itself:
When the small fire beneath is broken down, then its restoration and healing of it becomes lighter (easier).
When the fire of the patient is broken late (i.dict "dejats el focus del pacient tardament"), then the injury to the patient becomes bad and healing is difficult.
When that bone of it was broken two or more times.
Therefore, if the bone that has been broken is the small one above (probably referring to a specific limb), it is convenient for the doctor; you must restore this bone, which will take only a little extension until that piece becomes stabilized in place.
If the great fire is that which was struck/ignited by you, then I have forcefully extended my hand to contain it.
If the two fires burn together intensely, then when you pause their removal forcefully pressures build up inside and outside of them simultaneously.

This guidance underscores early intervention following strain or fracture, emphasizing prompt attention and rest in accordance with balanced force distribution while ensuring that no undue weight is placed on an already damaged limb part.
Return the broken bones to their proper alignment, and let the doctor adjust them within these parameters for optimal healing (implying that after some form of intervention or initial treatment by a health professional). This statement highlights both individual responsibility in maintaining injury site position as well as reliance on medical expertise. It suggests an approach where one's actions can aid recovery, but should be under the
When not suffering from sprains or fractures requiring immobilization with bandages and gauze (also known as splinting), pause application of such means for potential cast care; rest the area according to its extent, ensuring it is already wrapped in a blanket. Here we see guidance on what actions are appropriate depending upon whether an injury like sprain or fracture necessitates further immobilization with casting materials—a common treatment method whereby wrapping serves as both initial and temporary means of support until proper medical intervention, such as application of cast material by a healthcare professional.
May it be the joint pain is in the parts of dissection requires to empty their belly with one'laus, and appears like drape semblance, and commands the malady (illness/humor) that tightens at its palm lacerated; make such string as long for the drape.
And if it is necessary for the body's core (the chest) to rest on the cloth in which it stands/lies, tightly hold that second one after covering and supporting its position.
May it be that if the fracture is in parts beyond repair, then you stop below stone and another stone from the damaged part of the limb with your hand so that its own moistness (lubricity) can dry up; and also pause the swelling, as when turning over at this location between the ligaments.
If you break the bones of your fingers or toes, and it is their finger/toe that has been broken, then gently apply pressure on top as if pressing with a small stone in your palm; if you wish so: pause for three days at this little arch (between the base of the nail and the fingertuberosity), to elevate the fracture and prevent it from becoming infected.
May it be so that if the fracture is in those other places as well where heat (or blood) comes up, or at this place [the specific area of pain], then apply pressure here with what you've applied there; alternatively, leave breaks following continuous action until they are better, and pause over that small stone we have placed upon them like the one in our foot.
Consider in your restoration process and apply that careful positioning of apothecary treatments – as part of the operation – when you encounter any cause related to those previously described, according to what has been narrated about it.

From hip dislocation treatment." The sentence, as given, is already understandable and does not strictly require line-bydependent translation into English because it's in a simplified
The bone of the hip is moved away and it's declared to have fractured into parts, then placed in bed rest." The sentence describes an injury where the patient’s femur (thighbone) at or near the hip has experienced a displacement ("motas") due to trauma. This movement suggests significant damage consistent with what would be termed as a comminuted fracture—a break into multiple pieces rather than one
For the healing of it is done so that a sinew or ligament (suggesting some form of immobilization device) braces over the fracture, and another such as above rests on its abdomen and face." Here an early understanding from medieval medicine comes through—that to treat bone breakage ("fractura"), a binding material like sinews or ligaments is used not only for immediate stabilization but also likely involves wrapping techniques that secure the fractured part, in this case involving both abdominal and facial regions. This
And the minister extends it over its broken parts as needed when they come into position of bone."

The term "liament" can refer to such a binding device
If it is necessary for the hip's dislocation to be rectified (indicating an external manipulation or reduction), then one ligament extends along its broken parts of bone as required while holding in place, and another continues atop the break." Here they are discussing a procedure that involves externally realigning ("rectifi") any displaced hip joint. This action is crucial for setting it back to where it belongs—the "denolh" or proper position. The text suggests there's an active and careful handling of materials, with one piece holding the bone in place during manipulation – a rudimentary
If the dislocation is suitable for intervention, then apply the sling as support and extend it to the joints immediately.
Here the doctor covers (enlaces) the lower part of the legs as they reduce them back to their natural shape and joint together for good connection; provided that there are any spasms or straining present which would affect an amputated limb. If you have an ulcer that requires dressing, then do so within the days until the wound has been properly dressed, and return to your care routine afterward.
The constriction of the limb is painful: wherein covers over the fracture, and folds it twice or thrice for some days, removes excess from there; then enclose within that which reaches to the ankle and kneecap joints (the patella).

In the bunion (hallux valgus), there are two large bones and another smaller one involved in this condition—the big toe's metatarsal is referred to as "camba," while the small proximal phalanx of the same toe is called a "foc'. Here, these terms describe parts affected by or related to the malformation characteristic of hallux valgus. The bunion itself forms at this joint where misalignment causes deformity and discomfort:
Here it seems the author is drawing a parallel between bunion treatment and arm (forearm) fracture healing—both situations are addressed with restoration methods ("accideys" indicating pain), aiming for comprehensive recovery involving not only local but also general care, as suggested by "restauracio de lu ayssi cum restauracio del bras engualment." The term 'operació' indicates that an operation is indeed necessary. This suggests a holistic view of treatment in which the overall health and alignment are taken into account alongside specific surgical interventions for bunion correction, similar to arm fracture management where

In the reduction of a shoulder dislocation and the immobilization of the affected arm's limb:
The furcula (shoulder joint) is not dislocated from the side of the chest due to its continuous movement; and sometimes it becomes dislocated at the back end, which is declared by feeling.
The restoration of him is that his malady presses upon his two legs and extends their thighs. Return that location with your hand which is strong in pressing backward; it will return as well.
Return your hand over that plaster and powdered it tightly.

Return the compression on that bandage, and gentle pressure, extraction of fluids (if necessary), and command/order the humors to settle down within their proper place until they are healed.
And in this treatment method, reduction of the limb' extrinsic part occurs when separated from its place.
The provided lines are from what appears to be an ancient medical text discussing treatment
This phrase in Latin refers to the reduction of a muscle dislocation, which is a condition wherein one or more parts of a joint become displaced
You understand that the muscle is not dislocated but rather in three different ways: one way being when it's dislocated at the time of impact, and another upon movement afterward. Here are possible translations for each line into English considering medical terminology from medieval practices to modern understanding where applicable:
The second reason is that it has been dislocated from the upper part of the muscle, and this displacement occurs here (in the area specified), but not behind in relation to the shoulder joints or forward along with the nerves.
Mostly it is a displacement and exodus from the body' extraneous parts, primarily in those wherein flesh are thin, dislocation occurs; perhaps even there when muscle fibers contract with difficulty.
And when the cold touches or castling are applied to the hollows of these bodies, and their muscles become affected by apathecia (absence of motion), they are subjected to purging due to already being displaced.
Now cover that which you have entered into excess above what is necessary for care, and proceed with the treatment of it.
Here comes the first source sentence translated into English:
If it is a dislocation of your knee or elbow and you have noticed external trauma without fear:
From this dislocation it is felt that light reduction occurs when cool and humidity enters into the malady (abdomen/umbilicus).
E the reduction of it is that the minister lifts its mass above itself to the parts below; and pause with gentle pushes on their knees, raising the joint strength upwards towards its place, wherein the minister raises its mass as well, extending that very one slowly back. And after some time, when they return leggily.
If water returns not and dislocation occurs daily, then the swelling of the malady is immersed in tailwater, administered with broth that softens and linescale when taken together with barley, fenugreek, honey, and it's also given.
Here comes the first source sentence to translate:
If you wish to perform this second action: and make present before it a home (likely referring to medicinal herbs or poultices) that is long enough as the waistband, belonging to him/her therein; immediately insert your muscle into the area of discomfort quickly with tweezers while lifting up its tendon above where the hernia lies within so it remains suspended in air. Another servant then removes moisture from beneath his abdomen swiftly as directed by you. If the hernia is loose, then take care that another cause be present to ensure its seriousness, and if it becomes detached again, return at once.
Here comes the source sentence to translate: And another method of reduction involves placing a long staff up to the head from which shape can be formed; not too thick nor subtle in form—it is placed immediately on the patient's buttocks, with the hernia resting undernezym stick and its extent stretched out over the parts just after that part for strength. Thus the flesh of one body region returns to its original location quickly due to speed.
If reduction of him is difficult for all the reasons mentioned before, then use this treatment as follows: take a staff with the length equivalent to two arm lengths and hold it at an angle of four digits according to the form described herein.
And place linen or wool over his head, ensuring that it does not descend into the waistband of his trousers.
Here comes the next portion to translate: When it is placed temporarily in the groin area of the patient, its arm or arms are extended over/into the sections inside at once, and the staff (likely referring to some form of splinting tool) is laid on top of these limbs along with their hands.
Return the arm to a scale according to latitude, and spread it out over the body parts immediately, with one leg hanging from the other, at which joint they meet now.
When the interior of the patient is completed according to any possible way you can do it, and then pause briefly their trembling spleen made of woollen fleece in quantity; apply a plaster prepared with mill dust from seeds and egg white over all muscle mass so that they may be turned upside down, and tightly bind the tied areas together firmly. Then wind the lariat around the plastered area, attach your body to it at their chest (presumably for support or restraint), secure it in place without causing a grating sound on its surface; afterward loosen slightly these parts that are bound and ensure they remain attached throughout seven days without any rustling noise.
When food of the malady (sickness) is paused briefly and enough, this allows for comfort to enter into his body; then it becomes healing time.
When food is given in greater amounts and the body engages in some kind of motion, if it does not close or soften up, then it has already started to heal.
If the joint is dislocated due to humidity or another cause at this place (likely referring to a location where treatment with caustic substances takes place), then three types of treatments are applied here, as described in the text on caustics.
If all pain is present and seven days have passed since the bandage was removed, and the elasticity or strictures are reduced some times on it, and that arm cannot be raised to the parts below, you know well that their nerves which are at the head of the muscle, either they are insensitive or stretched/softened.
De the dislocation of that which is painful in your pelvis and thighs or their parts, reduction is done by force and extension until they return to normal positioning.
And if it is necessary for treatment in that other narrowing area, and care will be provided while it heals there.
If you elevate the limpness in the body part and delay its movement, let that heaviness be washed away with baths given regularly until such weight is lifted back to its original state of health.

Care for the displacement of the thigh: (Here, it seems that this text is referring to medical attention needed due to a
The joint of the thigh is displaced with difficulty; and it is dislocated throughout its parts, primarily at the junction between posterior (back) and anterior (front), where if you try to adjust or touch a displaced limb according to any figure that shows such a condition as being misplaced, then you are manifesting this clearly—for now, there's no bending of the arm nor contact with its muscle.
When you encounter fractures, reduce them as much so that the splint cast comes out of it; if a splint is applied to it, difficult reduction back into place will be and unlikely recovery from hereon unless at the posterior parts where bad species mix with dislocation and greater pain usually proceed daily visits.
When the restoration of it is possible, that which belongs to him should be extended outward with hands and arms expanded, and his doctor'thy body shall stand on their hips and thighs while he pushes down upon those joints wherein they are fastened by hand grip or palm pressure, so as to return them into place.
If the dislocation is at the joints ahead, then return it back with your hand inside until you hear a click in the place where its head meets the bone of its palm.
If the dislocation does not submit to reduction, then apply vigorous extension and motion forcefully.
When two ministers stretch out their arms, they hold each other thus preventing undue extension.
When it is necessary to rotate the arm completely, place a long cloth wrapped around her body or use rope for that purpose.
When the doctor touches the joint with his hand, apply some oil to that area so as to help alleviate those causes which assist in lubricating the joint; and strengthen it firmly until it returns to its original state.
Here is the line by line translation of the medieval medical treatise into English:
And if it is necessary to cut through him/it; and so when the joint formation occurs at that place, then you should cut through his limb(s) and apply that therewith.
If you see the joint not being strong, then apply the plaster and bandage it again, leaving it in place for several days until it is extracted; also remove that same thing.
If you increase gravity for the reduction of the joint and its position is in movement, then apply moisture gently and heat subtly until it subsides; if there's a hernia at the fatty motion area, secure it, and place that over the bone above the joint. Do so during the day and night. Here comes the first source sentence to translate: When cleansing with water enters that which is inside (i.thyroid or body), then do so when it has entered therein.

The hip joint can be dislocated some of them times and the reduction (or resetting) is easier; however, it may require quick action to return its position where there has been apathexis or an incidence leading back into apathhesis caution.
The reduction of the dislocation is that you suspend the joint between the groin and knee on a table and have someone extend it outward from there; then let the doctor or hand (palm) rest over the imminent joint, pushing it back into place.
Indeed when it is considered that the palm rests on the stomach and presses down its two sides onto a table to extend and reduce; if displacement has occurred previously, place her body so that her abdomen sits naturally on top of the table, thus allowing the doctor's belly (metge) to be over this imminent juncture.
And if it returns soon, good be; but if not, that part will harden and become set in place until the appointed time has passed by. And you shall not treat nor apply pressure on its reduction while these days are passing.
May the joint according to its twisted nature; and there is nothing in the bladder, but it softens itself without cause, as you know that the nerves are compressed or squeezed, and only when strained with cautery appropriate for treatment herein do I confer some fluid.
So when they have returned to their place (after treatment), put pressure on them with what we've applied, and let it be strapped for days; also cut off excess parts of it and exercise the area covered by this bandage as directed over several days.
If the patient remains still and experiences pain in their area, apply warmth to that part with water or heat for several sessions until they are relieved.

When a joint of one is dislocated from either side of the hand or abdomen (palma o ventre), then tighten and pull back the displaced joint until it returns to its proper place within the thighs; at which point, return them.
Hold up the head of this person, and suspend whatever has been dislocated to where it belongs, allowing them to rest there for two days.
Return those above into which it has entered today and extend them as desired for that day.
When the pain is sudden, then that second day's storyteller comes forth and does not cease to separate it during the day and engage in movement, and so for each subsequent day until relief arrives:
When it seems as if the water is inside her belly (i.dict suggesting distention or abnormal fluid accumulation), take that to where she belongs and perform the first operation with water, so that healing may occur within therein.
When it appears that fluid is moving elsewhere in the body parts.

You understand that the joint between the thigh and the muscle is not meant to dislocate so much only, and does not worsen at those other smaller connections of bone and cavity where you have weakened them already by grinding or crushing (implying injury).
E the joint of the wide is dislocated according to four ways: in the divisions of the inside parts, or at the outside parts, or from front to back, or behind.
Mostly it is dislocated in parts of bones and barely at or behind the joints.

The translation of each line from medieval medical treatise into English would be as follows:
Here comes the first source sentence to translate:
E the person to whom you have caused dislocation of the parts behind is that which cannot expand its coccyx nor bend it when bent so as not to extend outwards; here a pillow was placed for them, and their coxa (hip) lies at this location.
May reduction of these spices for this dislocation is what you consider, and indeed if the dislocation is old and ancient, then it has already been reduced by the treatment you have administered me, according to its disposition; therefore there will be no further effect in that cure. And so I shall not worry about additional effects at present.
In the one where dislocation has occurred recently, and it is one of the four types of dislocation, then turn that which was displaced back to its original position at the joints both before and after them, as well as on the right and left side; once turned properly, no further treatment from other cures will be needed.
May it be so in this healing attempt, if the affected area does not return on its own, then you must apply force and extend the cushion placed under them just a little bit more often (or even touch their bodies directly), or with linen wound above that section to hold pressure; another servant extends the bandage from there upwards over their limbs as quickly as possible so hands can be used, while yet another attends holding fingers of any injured hand.
When there is extension in the body or between the vertebrae of the chest or lower back, it implies movement towards the thoracic vertebrae or those below the lumbar spine.

And give command to a youthful lad that shortens the knee of the patient's thigh and have it suspended by another young man; simultaneously, allow this other boy to tighten the hernia at its strongest point (likely referring herein as 'fortress'). The juncture then returns swiftly. This line appears to describe an early form of manual therapy or treatment for a hernia where specific physical manipulations were applied by individuals designated with knowledge, often in this context young boys who may have been apprentices learning the medical practices before formal education was commonplace. The notion suggests that correcting posture and position could aid recovery based on their beliefs about humoral balance or circul

The phrase "Capitol .xxxii." appears to be a reference, possibly from an index or list within the larger manuscript where each
The phrase translates into English as: The hip is dislocated in three manners – it can be dislocated at the parts outside (possibly referring to areas around or beyond where normal movement occurs), and within its divisions, from backward towards forward sections; but not after that time. Here 'Capitol' likely refers to a specific case numbered .xxxii., indicating an entry point in some organized medical records or literature for this particular instance of dislocation being discussed. The text then goes on presumably with more details about the type and treatment approach associated with such injuries, following traditional medieval practices possibly described throughout what appears to be a section from their respective
The translation into English would be: The sign of hip (hip) joint displacement is that the patient instructs the barber to apply a cushion on their thigh, and you should know/realize that the hip is dislocated. This suggests an early intervention or recognition method whereby patients may have communicated signs indicating possible hip issues for immediate attention from medical practitioners like barbers who sometimes served as common healthcare providers during medieval times due to their access
The translation into English would be: The restoration of all the maneuvers for hip joint displacement is that you must make use of the barber (who may have some knowledge or training in basic medicine), and once done, extend the cushion if possible; attach your hands to his face so he can press on the patient's pelvis with it from there. Then put pressure between both palms around the displaced hip joint – this requires strength due to its weight (implying that applying enough force might be needed for such a procedure). Also, another servant is extended under him inside where/when necessary; their task would likely involve continuing support or reposition until the hip returns back into place. This passage indicates practical steps taken by medieval practitioners in attempting to manage hip joint displacements using available resources and manual techniques during that period'nteract with modern practices:
When it is said that a patient' extrusion from their abdomen does not work, the cushion (camba) sticks to/in the belly button area without laboring.
Return that and fix the cushion to the thigh area of her patient, applying those impressions with bandages for three or four days; return them as needed:
Not use the humors of walking for more than a few days until it is healed and comforted.
If your reduction of him allows it, then administer strong extension on the tendons mentioned in his previous treatment for the hip joint.
