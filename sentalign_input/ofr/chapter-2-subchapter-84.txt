of wounds/from wounds
We have already spoken in the division about the treatment of wounds;
now we will tell you the treatments by hand and by medicine, according to completion.
I say that wounds are diverse according to how they are made, and according to the places where the wounds are made, and from what they are made.
The things by which wounds are made are by throwing stones, and cutting with a sword and knife, or with a lance or wood or arrow, or similar things;
or that they are made according to the places of the body, such as a wound that falls on the neck, or on the head, or the chest, or the belly, or the liver, and similar members;
and I will tell you the treatment for each wound, and will begin with the simple wounds of the head, for the complex one will come in its chapter.
I say that when a simple wound occurs on the head, and the bone is not broken, take note if it is from a thrown stone or similar things, and the skin is nevertheless broken and the wound is large, and you suspect the development of a hot abscess:
then immediately have them bleed from the cephalic vein, especially if little blood comes from the wound, and let the bleeding be on the opposite side of the injured part;
and the patient should avoid excess of wine and rich foods.
And if they do not want to be bled, then let their food be light, and let them not drink wine, nor eat meat;
and put on the wound, if a hot abscess develops there, cotton soaked only in rose oil, or in styptic wine;
and if there is no hot abscess, then put on the wound, if it is fresh with all its blood and has not been exposed to the air, a powder, which I will describe a little later;
and if the burn has altered it, then apply some ointments until it is healed.
And if the wound is large, like from a sword cut or similar, and the edges cannot be brought together by tents, then join them by stitching, as I will describe for wounds of the belly, concerning stitching.
If the wound exposes bone and hangs, attached only slightly, cut it off;
then treat the wound with medicine, and restore hard flesh in place of skin, and instruct the patient to eat rich foods, such as head cheese and cooked wheat, also like chicken, and similar things.
And if you find rot in the skin, and it does not reach the bone, cut away all the rot, and throw it away, then treat it;
And if there is an artery or vein in the wound from which blood flows, and it cannot be stopped with medicines, then search for the artery, and if you find it displaced, tie it with a thread;
and if that doesn't work, cauterize it.
And if these wounds are small and simple, the treatment is easy:
and put in this powder which heals before the burn changes it.
And the composition of the powder is:
take one part incense;
two parts dragon's blood;
three parts quicklime, and powder it finely, and fill the wound, and bind it tightly, until it heals well and joins with all its blood;
and then tie it well, and leave it unbound unless it swells;
for the medicine is not removed until it is healed.
And sometimes this is done with lime alone, when one does not have the incense or the dragon's blood, but the burn must not have changed the wound.
And if the burn has changed the wound, especially in summer, then this powder is not applied;
but apply some digestive ointments, or a poultice of barley flour made with water and honey, until it suppurates;
then treat it with other treatments until it is healed.
And if a bone fracture comes with the wound, and it is small, then extract it with fine forceps; 
and I will tell you later about fractures of the head.
of the wound of the neck
If a wound occurs in the neck and it is simple, there is no difference between it and that of the head, but if the nerve of the neck or the artery is cut.
If it is the nerve, there is no other method than to leave it to heal, and not put anything restrictive on it, because it harms the nerves and makes them retract;
and do not put anything cold on the wound, because the substance of the nerves is cold, and their connection is with the brain, which is the highest member;
but the medicine should be soft, such as warm water washed in fresh water, and mixed with rose oil, and cuckoo pint also washed in fresh water, and other mineral stones in this manner, and moist ointments.
And if the wound is large, then sew it and bind it with bandages, then treat it until it is healed.
And if the wounds are deep and it is filled with pus and mud, then pierce it in the lowest place;
And if the artery is cut, and bleeding occurs, then uncover it, and wash it, and cauterize it if necessary;
And if the windpipe of the throat is cut, or the heart, and the tube is preserved, through which the food passes, then sew the heart over the tube of the throat, and do not touch the throat but put it back according to its natural shape;
And then bind it conveniently, and leave it for some days, then treat it with drying ointments until it is healed;
And if the wound has made an impression in the bone, then scrape it;
And if there are pieces of bone, then pull them all out if you can, and those that you cannot get, leave them until the wound festers, and is opened and the passage cleared;
And if the wound is fresh, then sprinkle on the powder that I have mentioned.
And if there is bone in the wound and there is a fistula, then treat it as I have said in its chapter.
of the wound of a lance or knife
If it is a blow from a lance or knife, and the wound is deep, then see if air escapes from the wound when the patient breathes:
know then that the wound is mortal;
and if it is not deep, and it is fresh with all its blood, do not put the powder in it at the first hour, nor bind it because of the blood so that it does not remain deep inside and return to the heart, and kill the patient;
but put on a drawing ointment, and bind it twice a day;
and if you have no ointment, put old cotton in the wound to suck out the moisture, and make the patient sleep on the wound for three days, or four, or more;
thus no spasm will come, nor trembling sickness of the heart, nor shortness of breath;
and when you see good signs, know that the wound is safe.
Then treat it with tents and other treatments until it is healed;
and if it cannot heal, and festers, then know that there is a fistula;
so treat it as one should.
And if the wound is from a sword cut or knife, and it is simple, whether on the chest or the back, treat it as described previously;
if it is large, with sutures;
and if it is small, with powder, and if it is pressed into the bone, and has broken off pieces, then explore the wound, and draw them out if they are detached;
and if they are not detached, let the wound fester, so the extraction will be easier;
and the judgment for other wounds in other limbs is as we have said.
