Chapter seventy-one on the excision of the clitoris and the flesh that grows from women's vulvas
The clitoris may sometimes grow beyond its natural size until it becomes ugly and unpleasant in appearance.
And it may grow large in some women until it spreads like that of men and becomes suitable for intercourse.
Therefore, you should hold the excess of the clitoris with your hand or with a hook and cut it.
And do not cut deeply, especially at the root, lest bleeding occur.
Then treat it with the treatment of wounds until it heals.
As for the excess flesh, it is flesh that grows in the opening of the womb until it fills it.
And it may protrude outward like a tail, and therefore some of the ancients call this disease 'the tail disease'.
Therefore, you should cut it as you cut the clitoris and treat it until it heals.
