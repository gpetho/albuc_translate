of dropsy
We have already mentioned in the division the characteristics of dropsy, and how the collection of water is made, and the signs of each type, and the treatment that is done with medicines, and the one that is treated with iron: it is only eclites; and one should not touch with iron in these two types: namely, tympanites and yposarche, because it is a deadly thing; so when you treat this type of dropsy called "eclites" with medicines, and the treatment does not work, then see if the patient is weak, or if he has another disease besides dropsy, such as cough and looseness of the belly and similar things; then do not touch with iron, because there is doubt; and if you see the patient has strong vitality, and he has no other disease besides dropsy alone, and he is not too young nor too old, then you should proceed as follows:
lift the patient upright in your hands, and the assistant presses the belly pushing the water to the lowest part of the chest, then take the pointed spatula in this form: and it should be sharp on both sides and pointed, but not so penetrating that it can reach the intestines when it is inserted, and cannot injure them;
then see if the dropsy is formed towards the intestines: then you must cut above the belly three fingers width below the navel; and if the dropsy is due to liver disease, then the cut should be on the left side of the belly three fingers; and if it is for the spleen, it should be on the right side, and the patient should not lie on the incision so that the fluids do not flow to that weak place;
then pierce all the skin with the instrument, and push it, and lift your hand with the spatula between the skin and the sac as if peeling to the size of a fingernail or around; then pierce the sac until the spatula reaches the empty space, and that is the place of the water, then pull it out, and insert this instrument in this form: and it looks like a delicate silver tube, and is made of bronze or light brass, and has on the lower part a small hole; and on one side, three holes; and two on the other side, and one on another; and the top is shaped like a pen, and this is the shape of the incision with which the scribes shape the pen:
at the top is the blade, so that when the instrument reaches the water, it descends immediately on the instrument; then empty half or a third of it, because if you empty more than necessary at that time, perhaps the patient will die from the loss of his life force, or he will faint, or he will approach death;
but empty according to the amount of his strength, and according to what the conditions of the patientâ€™s strength signify, and his pulse; then remove the instrument and retain the water, and it is retained now by the skin that stops the hole that is on the sac, which I mentioned, that you pierce in this manner; then reinsert the instrument the next day, if you see the patient tolerating it, and draw out a small amount of water;
do this for a few days, and be careful not to rush so that only a little water remains. And if you have doubts about the patient, and you leave a lot of water in him, then treat him with burial in hot sand, and with a lot of sweating or baths and in the sun, and prevent him from drinking; and treat him with drying medicines until he is healed, and cauterize over the stomach and over the liver and over the spleen after the extraction of the water, as I said before.
