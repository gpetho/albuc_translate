Chapter twenty-nine on cauterizing hemorrhoids.
The ancients mentioned cauterization with birthwort roots for cold quinsy in this manner.
It is that you take from the long dry roots of birthwort a single root, the longest you can find, and it should be as thick as a finger, then dip it in oil and burn it in fire, then cauterize with it once between the junction of the clavicle and the neck.
And two small cauterizations a little below the jugular veins, inclined towards the area under the chin.
And two large cauterizations above the breasts, between the third and fourth ribs.
And two cauterizations also between the fifth and sixth ribs, inclined slightly towards the back.
And another cauterization in the middle of the chest and another above the stomach.
And three cauterizations from behind, one between the shoulders, and two on the sides of the back, lower than the cauterization that is between the two hands.
And it is not appropriate to deepen your hand with the cautery, rather it should be on the surface of the skin, a superficial burning.
And some of the ancients mentioned that some people used an iron cautery, like a probe, and heat it up, and insert it between the ribs until it reaches the tumor itself, and extract the pus as we mentioned in the case of liver tumors.
And in this recklessness with cautery is a great risk: either the patient dies immediately, or a fistula develops in the area that has no cure.
