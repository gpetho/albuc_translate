About hailstone-like formations
Many times things form on the eyelids that resemble hail in their shape and hardness, and because of this, the condition is called "hailstone," and it is an accumulation of thick moisture in the upper and lower eyelid; the procedure is as follows: check if the hailstone moves from one side to another, which is easy to determine; then make a wide incision, then scrape it lightly from each side, then take it with pincers and cut it. If you cannot cut it without piercing the eyelid a little, it does not harm the patient; and if the incision is large, then stitch it, and treat it until it is healed; and if it is small, do not force it, for the ointment will soon restore it and generate flesh.
And if the hailstone descends inside the ear towards the upper part, then turn the eyelid and stretch the hailstone with pincers, and cut and press it from one side to another; and if the eyelid is separated by the incision, it does not harm anything; and when the hailstone is cut, wash the eye with salted water, and treat the area with substances that generate flesh until the patient is healed.
