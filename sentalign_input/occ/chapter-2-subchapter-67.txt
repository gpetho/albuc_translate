Chapter 67.
On the rupture that occurs in the groin.
Sometimes a rupture occurs in the groin as we have said, and the place swells.
And it does not leave any cause from the intestines to the genitals; and if it does, it is little; and it returns at all times.
But if time is prolonged with this, a fissure is formed in the sac in which the intestine descends into the sac; and this happens because of the extension of the sac that is in the groin as we have said, which causes the sac to be stretched, and then it becomes softened and the place is swollen and enlarged.
And the treatment of it is with cautery as previously described.
And sometimes it is treated with iron in this manner: and the patient lies on his back between your hands, then dry the place of the rupture from the swelling with an incision across it according to the width of three fingers.
Then stretch the white sac that is under the covering until it is exposed.
Then take a rod and place it on the swollen area of the sac, and press it to the belly button.
Then sew the two swollen areas over the end of the rod of the sac, and join them with the suture.
Then remove the end of the rod, and do not cut the sac completely, nor extend the testicle, nor any other part as I let you know in the treatment of intestinal hernia.
Then treat it with wound care, and when you cut the threads, clean it and restore the wound until it is healed; because the sac is contracted and the rupture is not swollen.
And cautery is better in this place, because it is closer to health.
