This is an abscess enveloped in a covering resembling a bud, with the softening of the testicles, And the patient moves painfully when he walks;	A varix is a twisted tumour resembling a cluster of grapes, with relaxation of the testicles, which makes movement and exercise and walking difficult for the patient.	0.5602193
And the treatment of this disease is almost as fearful as the one mentioned before,	The treatment of this condition is of uncertain outcome, akin to those conditions just spoken of.	0.5405649
And yet we will tell you the work of it, according to what the ancients did.	Nevertheless we must describe the operation for this condition as it was performed by the Ancients.	0.61182404
You should make the patient sit on a raised seat, then push the suspensory of the testicles down with your fingers, With all the vessels that are near the penis, and the master holds them, and extends them firmly;	So I begin by saying that you must have the patient sitting upon a high seat; then push down the suspensor of the testicles and take hold of the skin of the testicles with your fingers together with the blood-vessels near the penis; then let your assistant take hold instead of you and draw out strongly.	0.8028163
Then cut with the broad sharp spatula across the vessels, until they are uncovered,	Then with a broad sharp scalpel make an oblique incision in the direction of the vessels so that the vessels are laid bare.	0.6976886
And then strip on each side, as we have said in the extraction of the arteries that are in the temples;	Then dissect on all sides in the same way as I told you for extracting the temporal vessels.	0.66434956
Then stick a needle with a double thread, and tie it at the first place where the infection has come, and tie it again at the other end; Then cut them in the middle straightly, according to the length of the body, and draw out the corrupted moisture;	Then run through them a needle doubly threaded and tie at the spot where the varix begins and tie it again where the varix ends, then cut through the varix in the middle with an incision at right angles to the length of the body and draw out the turbid corrupt humidity that has gathered in it.	0.78719896
Then treat the wound as with others where pus forms, so that some vessels fall that nourish one of the testicles;	Then dress the wound with the wound dressings usual where you wish to encourage suppuration, so that the vessels nourishing the one testicle may perish; there is no harm in that.	0.6244805
For from this comes no harm, and if infection comes to all the vessels, it is necessary to extract the testicles with all the vessels; So that the organ does not lose its nourishment due to the cutting of the vessels, and they dry out and cannot be helped.	But if all the vessels are varicose then you will have to remove one testicle with its vessels lest the testicle be deprived of nourishment through cutting into the vessels; for it will wither and be of no use.	0.73611367
