of circumcision
Circumcision is not a separation of continuity like other wounds;
however, when we perform this procedure by choice, specifically on children, it is necessary that we do the best work, and the most conducive to healing.
I say that the ancients did not speak of the circumcision of their children, for it was not practiced in their law, and we have only what we have learned through experience.
For I have seen the majority of masters and healers perform circumcision around the first day, forcefully, and with a razor;
thus the skin fled, for there are two layers, and by chance they would cut the upper one and leave the one below.
Then it was necessary to cut it again, and the pain was doubled, and during the cleansing, which takes place on the eighth day, the tip of the member is not safe;
and during the cleansing of the nail, by chance the iron slips, and they ruin the work, and often they are born such that they do not need cleansing and I have seen it.
Regarding the cleansing which is done forcefully with a linen thread, I have found the experiment to be good, for the threads cut evenly both above and below.
For when you squeeze your hand, you cut evenly in a single instant;
but the thread must be tightly wrapped around the skin;
and the way of the first procedure is that you make the child think, if he understands, that you are only tying the thread around the penis, and then you make him happy in all the ways you can;
then have him stand straight between your hands, and hide the threads between your hands or under your feet so that the child cannot see them, nor any of the instruments;
then put your hand on the penis and blow in the opening, and pull it upwards until the glans of the penis is inside;
then clean it well of the dirt that has accumulated there, then tie the marked place with a double thread, then tie it below, a little further down, with another tie;
and hold it with two fingers by the second tie with the thumb and index finger, and cut between the two ties, then quickly lift the glans and pull the tip of the penis;
then let the blood flow little by little, because that is the best;
and put powder on it and over the powder a cloth soaked in a mixture of cooked egg yolk diluted with rose water, blended with good fresh rose oil, and leave it on until the next day, and treat it with other treatments until it is healed.
The method of strengthening for cleansing is this:
The two edges should be thin and sharp, and the edges should be as wide as the handle equally:
The error of cleansing is when the core inside escapes the incision;
Then you must expand it with your fingernail, before the place forms an abscess;
and cut it evenly, and if you cannot hold it with your fingernail, hold it with forceps, and then cut it.
And if it goes beyond three days, and what is under the penis is swollen, leave it until the hot abscess is subsided, and peel it lightly;
cut it as best you can, and be careful of the part of the penis, it will not harm it at all.
Then treat the area with wound-healing powders, as we have described in the section on powders, and if one cuts from the heart excessively, and it goes above, it will not cause harm;
treat it then, as we have said, until it is healed.
