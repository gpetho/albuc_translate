When the cancer is in its initial stage and you wish to arrest it, burn all round the circumference of the cancer with the circular cautery.	When cancer is beginning, and you want to halt it, then cauterize around it with a circular cautery, following its circumference.	0.8497126
Some doctors have said that it may be cauterized with one extensive cauterization in the middle.	The wise have said that it should be cauterized with a final cautery in the center.	0.54262245
This hardly seems right to me, for I should expect it to ulcerate out; which I have several times seen.	However, this does not seem advisable to me, as I fear it may ulcerate, and I have seen this happen several times.	0.73357224
So it is correct to burn around the circumference with a circular cautery as we have said, or with multiple cauterizations.	It is better to cauterize around it with a circular cautery as we mentioned, or with multiple cauteries.	0.8575859
