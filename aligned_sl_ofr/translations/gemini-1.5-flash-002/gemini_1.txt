O you, very dear sons, I have completed for you this book which is the last of the science of medicine together with its completion, and I have made the end through its explanations and through its declarations. And it came to me in a vision that I should complete it for you with this treatise, which is a part of the work of hands, that is to say, "surgery".
And because the work of hands is weakened in our region and is completely and entirely neglected, the science is lost and fragmented, and nothing remains of it except the small descriptions in the books of the ancients that the hands have changed. And from this has come error and vanity, and intentions are closed and the science is distanced.
Now it seems to me that I wish to revive it together with the ordering of this treatise according to the way of exposition and declaration and abbreviation; and I will add the forms of the cautery irons, and of the other instruments of the work, with the addition of their declaration and preparation, as is necessary.
And for the reason that no good masters of hands are found in our time, the art of medicine is neglected. And it is necessary for him who undertakes it to excel in the science of anatomy, as Galen says, so that he knows the arrangement of the limbs, and their forms and connections and separations, and has knowledge of the bones and nerves and muscles and their number, and the movement and the moving and resting veins, and the place of their origin.
And for this reason Hippocrates says that the name without the deed is much, and with the deed is little; and likewise in the art of the hand.
We tell you in the introduction to this book that whoever is not knowledgeable of the things said before, let him beware that he does not fall into error and that he does not kill men;
as I have seen many times, many of those who meddle in this science and abandon themselves without science and without experience.
For I saw a foolish physician who cut an abscess of scrofula on the neck of a woman, and cut the arteries of the neck; because so much blood came out that the woman fell dead in his hands.
And I saw another physician who extracted a stone from an old man, and the stone was large; so he removed with it a piece of the bladder, and the man died within three days.
And I had already been called to treat him, and I saw the condition of the patient and the size of the stone, and I knew that if he were cut, he would die.
And I saw another physician who took in his care a duke of our land who had a broken leg, and with the fracture there was a wound;
and the physician, full of ignorance, pulled the fracture through the wound at the ankles with strong force, and did not leave any lint on the wound, and left it thus untreated;
and he ordered him not to unbind it;
and it remained so that the leg and foot were completely swollen and came to ruin.
I was called to come to him, and I hastened to come and unbind the leg; and when I had unbound it, it was at peace and felt no pain.
But still the corruption was already established in the limb, and I could not heal it;
and the corruption did not cease to spread through the limb until the limb was completely lost.
And I saw another case where an abscess was opened, and then inflamed by the malice of its lord.
For a canker, when it is pure of melancholic humor, should not be touched with iron unless it is in such a place that one can remove everything that is corrupted.
And therefore, dear son, you need to know that manual operations are divided into two divisions: that is to say, operations where there is danger in several ways;
and I will show in each place in this book where there is fear and danger.
Therefore it is necessary that you guard against it, so that foolish people cannot speak ill of you.
So take up your tools carefully, and undertake your patients lightly and firmly, and use the best method so that, by the grace of God, you come to salvation and are praised;
and leave the frightening diseases to serious physicians;
and remove your tools from that which makes you doubt, and have faith in yourselves so that you may pass from this world to the next in glory.
Galen says in some of his admonitions: Do not undertake a serious illness unless you are called a foolish doctor.
I have composed this treatise according to three chapters.
The first chapter is on fire cauteries and on cauteries of liquid medicine, and the chapter is ordered from the head to the feet;
and of the forms of instruments, and of the cautery irons, and of all that is necessary in the work.
The second chapter is about cutting and piercing, and about cupping and wounds, and about the extraction of arrows, and similar things;
and the chapter is ordered and the forms of the instruments are [described].
The third chapter is on restoring dislocations and sprains, and similar things;
and it is ordered from the head down to the feet, and [describes] the forms of the instruments.
Before we remember the work, it is necessary that I speak of the quality of the help and the harm of each complexion.
I say that the quality of the help and the harm is the longest speech and subtle science and the secrets kept;
and of this many wise men spoke, and agreed on this;
and their words suffice me little, for I fear the length.
I say that cautery helps universally to every complexion where there is matter, except two complexions: that is to say, a hot complexion without matter, and a dry complexion without matter.
In a complexion that is both hot and dry with matter, some differed and said that cautery is a great help; and others said the contrary: that cautery is not good for an illness that comes from heat and dryness. For the nature of fire is hot, and a hot illness should not be treated with heat, nor with dryness;
and he who said the contrary said that cautery greatly helps a hot and dry illness that comes in the bodies of men. For when you compare the body of man and its moisture to the complexion of fire, you find the body cold.
And I agree with this statement. For I have found it sometimes by experiment.
And yet, let none undertake it except he who has proven it, and who knows by long usage the chapter of cauteries, and the diversity of the complexions of men, and the dispositions and causes of their illnesses, and the occurrences and the length of time;
of other complexions we have no fear, especially in cold and moist illnesses. And all the physicians assembled and agreed on the cautery.
And know, son, that cautery with fire is among the secrets of cures, and of greater benefit than cautery with burning medicine.
For fire is simple, and does not go beyond the member which is burned, and harms no other member except very little.
Burning medicines spread from one member to another, and cause illnesses in the member that are difficult to heal; and perhaps kill the patient.
Fire, because of its intensity and the goodness of its substance, does not do this, unless there is excess.
And this I have found through experiment and through the length of service and study that I have devoted to the art, and it was based on the truth of things;
and therefore I excuse myself for the length of the speech, for I do not wish to withhold from you the secret that is contained in fire, and the quality of the work, how it expels the illnesses of the body, as the philosopher says in demonstrating; or receive it in your thoughts.
And know, son, that they agreed on the time when cauterizations should be performed, and chose spring.
And I say that cautery is suitable at all times, because the arising harm is overcome by the help of the cautery; and similarly if the cautery is for necessary, severe, and urgent pains that cannot wait for a time when a greater harm might come to the limb.
And never think, dear son, as foolish physicians do; for a disease that is healed by cautery does not return; and they say so;
and they say so; but it is not as they believe, because cautery is only a medicine that changes the complexion, and dries the humors that are the cause of the pain, and is better than medicine because of the speed of its action, and because of the virtue of its work and its mastery.
And it is possible that the disease sometimes returns according to the patient's complexion and the location of the disease and its virulence;
and superfluities are gathered there by the ingestion of foods and similar things, unless cautery is administered where there is little superfluity and moisture, such as cautery of the teeth for pain, and similar things, and such pain does not return; but this happens rarely.
And many people do not understand why cautery is called the last resort of medicine, and it is true;
but they do not believe that cautery is effective after medicine, but their understanding is false, and cautery is the last resort of medicine because when we administer various treatments for a disease and they are ineffective, then we administer cautery, and it works.
Then it is clear that cautery is the last resort of medicine, not according to the understanding of foolish people.
The ancients said that cautery with a golden instrument is better than with iron, and they did not say this falsely, but because of the quality of gold and the high nature of its substance;
and they said that the cautery site does not become putrid, but this is not true because I have tested it, and I have found that it is true in some men;
and cautery with gold is better than with iron, as they said. And yet when you heat a gold instrument, you do not know when it is hot by the color of the gold, and it cools down immediately;
and if one heats it too much; they do so in the fire; and thus there are enough impediments.
Now I have ordered this chapter from head to foot, so that the way may be easier to find.
This cautery is good for moisture and coldness in the brain, and there are two that are made because of a disease which is called "soda", and because of many humors which descend from the head to the eyes and ears, and because of a multitude of dreams and toothache and sore throat, and especially for all diseases which come from coldness such as paralysis and soda and apoplexy and similar diseases.
The form of this cautery is that the patient should be purged with purgative medicine purifying the head for three or four nights, according to what the strength and age and habit of the patient can tolerate; and then shave the head of the patient.
And then have him sit cross-legged between your hands, and put his hands on his thighs;
afterwards, place the root of your palm on the root of his nose between his two eyes; and let your middle fingers go where it will bleed; then heat the cautery which is called "olive", of which this is the form: And place it on the spot marked with ink, and move it downwards and inwards, little by little, turning your hand; then lift your hand quickly, and observe the place to see if you see the bone slightly; and if you do not see it, repeat the cautery until you see the bone as I have told you;
afterwards take a little salt, and put it in water and soak cotton in it, and place it on the spot, and leave it for three days;
afterwards apply cotton soaked in butter; and leave it on until the burn is healed; afterwards treat the wound with the ointment called "tetrapharmacon", until it is healed.
And the ancients said that the longer the wound remains open, the more it cleanses itself; and therefore it heals better.
And some of them said that one should leave the cautery on so long that part of the bone is burned, and then one removes what is burned from the bone, and it is healed.
And others say that one should leave the cautery on so long, and burn so deeply that one removes from the bone as wide an area as the whorl that women put in their spindles, so that the humors may more easily come out;
and one should leave the wound open for a long time; afterwards one should treat and dress it.
And these two methods of cautery do not seem to me to be good at all, except in certain cases where there is danger;
and it seems to me that I ought to leave it there;
for the head is weakened by continuous natural discharges, as we witness in other limbs;
and similarly when the patient's head is weak by nature, the first type of cautery is safer and gentler for me, and I use that method in such cases for the patient's safety.
When chronic pain comes to the whole head, and lasts a long time, the patient should use herbs and pills that are called "cochie," and head purges, and oils, and plasters; and if cautery is performed as we have described above, and it is ineffective. Take care if the patient's head is of strong nature, and that it is not too cold; then cauterize below that cautery a little as we have said above. Then make a cautery on each temple of the head down to the bone, as we have said before, and make a cautery in the place that is called "vessels"; and this is the place where cupping is performed; and lighten your hand so that you do not go down to the bone: the patient feels much greater pain in this cautery than in others, and I will speak of it elsewhere;
and it is necessary that the cauteries of the temples be more subtle than those with which one cauterizes the middle of the head, and this is the form:
of the cautery of the head When sudden pain comes to a part of the head, and the illness extends to the eye, and the head is cleansed by purifying medicines, and the other treatments that I have mentioned in the division of illnesses have been done, and all this does not help: then make cauteries according to two methods, that is to say, with sharp medicine and with fire.
The cautery of sharp medicine is that you take a slice of garlic, and remove the peel and cut it a little at the two ends, and then slit the temple where the pain is in such a way that you can place the slice of garlic under the skin;
and when it is placed, tie it and bind it well and leave it thus for twelve hours; and then untie it and remove the slice of garlic, and leave the wound thus for two or three days; then apply cotton soaked in butter until the suppuration comes out.
Afterwards, treat it with ointment until it is healed;
and if you wish, do this with some burning medicines that I have written in the twelfth treatise on burning medicines.
The iron cautery is according to this manner. Heat the cautery which has this shape:
And it is called "clos" because the head is made in the shape of a bell, or it has a little curve, and in the middle a small appearance;
and put it on the painful place, and hold your hand and turn the iron a little lightly, until half the thickness of the heart is burned;
and lift your hand so that the artery does not burn, which is outside, and an abundance of blood flows.
Afterwards, put cotton in rose water, and put it on the place for three days; then put cotton soaked in butter, and then treat the place with ointment until it is healed;
and if you wish to cauterize this migraine with the cautery which is called "cultellare", with the whole point, and beware of cutting the artery in this migraine which is not old.
of migraine
When you treat a migraine as we have said before in the divisions of diseases, and it does not improve, and you see that the cauteries previously mentioned of medicine and of iron are not sufficient, then it is necessary that you heat the cautery which is called "cultellare" until it is white;
and bleed thus on the painful place a line half a finger long, and remove your hand once, and ensure that you do not cut the artery and that you do not go down to the bone;
and beware of the mandible which moves when one eats, and the nerve should not be affected so that it moves and that spasm does not come to the patient, and beware of the flow of blood from the artery when it is cut, or cutting causes great fear, and especially to one who does not know it, and who is not a student and experienced; and leave the work half-done;
but I will tell you how to stop blood when the artery is cut, and I will show you the place where it is appropriate in this book.
And if you see that this cautery is not sufficient for the illness, and the patient is suffering, cauterize him in the middle of the head as we have said, and treat the wound until it is healed;
and if you wish, administer the cautery that we have mentioned in the chapter on the extraction of the artery, with the cautery that has two knives; and this cautery is better than that one and more helpful.
of the earache from cold
When pain comes to the ear from cold, and solutions and other treatments that we have mentioned in the division have been tried, and the pain does not cease, then heat this cautery which is called "points", of which this is the form:
Then prick all around the affected ear, or around both if the pain is in both, and withdraw a little above the root of the ear after you have marked the place of the puncture; and let there be ten punctures around each ear;
afterwards treat the place until it is healed.
Of the treatment of the mouth
A mouth ailment that ought to be treated by cautery is only that which comes from phlegm, as we have said in the divisions of illnesses;
and do not perform cautery on similar ailments that come from dryness and spasm of the nerves.
When you treat this type of mouth ailment which comes from phlegm, with bleedings and purgations of the head and gargles, and this is not effective, then you must cauterize the patient with three cauteries: one at the root of the ear, and another a little outside the temple, and the third at the joining of the two lips;
and place the cautery in the part that appears healthy, and make a cautery towards the top of the ear a little below the horn of the head, and another in the temple as long as a thumb; and leave the cautery on until half of the core is burned;
and this is the form of the cautery:
And it is similar to the lancet that we have shown before, but it is a little more subtle and the knife should be a little thicker;
after, treat the place as I have said before, until it is healed.
When apoplexy is old and you treat it as we have said, and it does not help, and the patient does not have a fever, then make four cauteries: two on the two horns of the head, and one in the middle of the head, and one in the place that is called "vessels" as we have said before, and the last cautery on the mouth of the stomach;
and let it be treated as we have said before.
of lethargy
For this illness, it is necessary to give the patient large herbs and pills that cleanse the brain;
after shaving the patient's entire head, and placing on the occiput the mustard plaster which is written about in the treatise on plasters;
and this is the manner of cautery: if one does it as I have said.
If he is healed thus, it is good; and if he is not, make three cauteries in the middle of the head descending to the neck, and let there be a space of one thumb's breadth between each cautery;
and cure it as the others, and if you wish to add more, and the patient is suffering, make one cautery in the middle; and if necessary, two others on the two temples, and cure it until it is healed;
and let the cautery be that which is called "olivare," as I have said before.
It is necessary that the head be cleansed of sores and of that which we have said before;
after shaving the patient's head, then apply a cautery in the middle of the head and on each temple, and one behind and three on the spine of the neck;
and if you need more, and the body is moist and the patient is suffering, and the illness is severe, apply four cauteries on the spine of the back; and leave them until the deepest part of the flesh is burned, and then lift your hand; afterwards treat it until it is healed, and it should be the cautery which is called "olivare" that we have mentioned before.
of epilepsy
Epileptics should not use fire cautery except those who are phlegmatic, and it is necessary first to cleanse the brain of humors and other treatments that we have mentioned in the section when the patient is large and suffering to take medicine.
And if it is a child who cannot tolerate it, give him gargles and mastications that cleanse the brain often with good foods;
after shaving the head in the middle, and there make one cautery as we have said before, and one cautery above the vessel, and on each temple; and if the patient is strong and suffering, make cauteries for him as I have said for one who has paralysis and softening of the body, on the spine of the back and neck, and let the cauteries be olive-shaped according to the manner that I have said.
If the patient is a child, make one subtle cautery for him in this manner:
When, due to melancholy, the superfluities or corrupted humors and thick phlegm are present, then cauterize with such cauteries as we have described for one who has paralysis.
And if, due to melancholy, the superfluities are inclined towards melancholy, and the patient's body is moist, then give him something to drink to cleanse the brain, according to what is stated earlier in the division.
Afterwards, shave the patient's head; afterwards make a well-made linen pad, like a circle, and place it on the head;
and let the patient sit cross-legged, and be well supported on all sides;
then present the liniment, and sheep butter is worth using; and heat it gently over a fire, so that the fingers, if one puts them in, can bear it; then empty the circle inside on the head, and let it cool;
and do this to the patient once each week along with other good treatment, until he is healed.
Or if you wish to cauterize it, make several points across the whole cautery.
This method of cautery moistens the brain equally;
and then apply cotton moistened in butter and chicken fat.
of the water of the eyes When water first comes to the eyes, by the signs that I have mentioned in the division, then begin and give the patient something to cleanse the head, and keep it from all moisture, and make him sweat in the bath many times fasting.
Afterwards, instruct him to raise his head, and apply a cautery in the middle of the head, and apply two cauteries on the two temples if the descent of the water is to both eyes together, or one if the descent is to one;
and with the whole cautery cut all the veins and arteries that are below the heart, and let the cautery be long according to the width of the temple;
and guard against the flow of blood, and if you see too much blood flowing, then staunch it with such power as you have.
And I will teach you in the extraction of arteries and in the incision the precaution how you will staunch it;
and sometimes a cautery is made or applied under the two bones behind.
and one sees that it is from cold phlegmatic superfluities, then make for him the cautery that I have said in the beginning of the descending water to the eyes: one cautery in the middle of the head, and two cauteries on the two temples, and two cauteries on the nape of the neck under the two bones; and if there is more need, then cauterize him wisely above the eyebrow with a small cautery.
When you treat him according to what we have said in the division, and he does not improve, then give the patient to drink three nightshade berries; after shaving the head, and make a cautery in the middle of the olive-shaped cautery; and make two cauteries with the cautery that is called "clavilis" above the two eyebrows, a little below the hair;
and beware of the artery that you do not cut it.
And this is the shape of the cautery that is called "clavilis":
When the eyelid is softened by illness and moisture, then cauterize it with this cautery that is called "olivare". of which this is the shape:
And if you wish, make two cauteries on the two eyebrows as long as the eyebrows are;
and do not leave the hand there except until the third part of the eyelid is burned, according to the manner that I have said.
of the hair that pricks the eye Sometimes it happens that the hairs of the eyes are turned inward, and prick the eye, and then one makes cauteries according to two methods: that is to say, of fire, or of a burning medicine.
For the fire cautery, instruct the patient to let the hairs grow long and even; and if they prick at their base, hold the eyes steady so they do not move until they grow.
When they grow and are even, then the patient puts [them] in your hand; afterwards, draw on the skin with the eyes a figure like the leaf of myrtle, and let the beginning of the sign be near the hairs;
then put cotton soaked in egg white and parsley poultice on the eye, then heat the cautery of which here is the form:
Afterwards cauterize on the figure that you have marked little by little many times, so that the heart is burned in that place;
and the sign of the success of the work is that you see the skin contract, and the hairs raised at the puncture of the eye;
then lift your hand, and leave it so for three days, then put cotton soaked in butter there until the burn is gone; afterwards treat it with ointment until it is healed.
And if afterwards the hairs come, and the skin is softened then recommence the cautery on that same place, as you did before;
and if the hairs are weak, cauterize it until the skin is raised to its natural place, and is even, and the hairs do not prick the eye.
The cautery of burning medicine is that you instruct the patient to let the hairs grow until they are long and even, then make from parchment the shape of a myrtle leaf;
then take of French soap and quicklime, of each one ounce, and grind well together; and do it quickly, so that it does not cool, then spread it on the form that you have made like the myrtle leaf, and place on the skin oils; and if the disease affects only one eye, one should work on one, and if both, likewise; and place under the eye cotton moistened in egg white;
and the patient's head should be on your lap and put your forefinger on the medicine, and press gently and move it every time the patient feels a burning sensation from the medicine, for it burns as if with fire.
When you have done this for a long time, then remove the medicine with your finger. And when the burning sensation has passed, lift the eyelid, and look to see if you see the membrane raised as if it had been raised by the constraint of fire or by incision; and if it is so, it is well.
If not, then apply more medicine to the place where the medicine has not worked, until your work is even, and your eyelids are aligned;
then apply cotton soaked in butter until the burnt area falls off, afterwards treat the place with the ointment which is called "dyafenis" and others, until it is healed.
And if it is necessary that you guard yourself well in your work with great care that none of the medicine falls into the eyes.
And if the skin becomes soft afterwards, and the hairs prick at the eye, then reapply the medicine to that area which has been softened by the skin properly, as you did before; afterwards treat it until it is healed;
and this is the form of the myrtle leaf:
And know that the eyes of men are diverse in size, and according to that should be your constraints;
and the right way should not be revealed to him who is studying this art.
of the treatment of fistula by cautery
When you treat a fistula, as we have said in the divisions of diseases, and your treatments do not help, then you must cauterize it in this manner.
Instruct the patient to put his head in your lap; and let the assistant hold his head between your hands in such a way that he does not move, nor nod his head;
then place moistened cotton in egg white or parsley juice on the eye;
then heat the cautery, which is as follows:
and is shaped at the head like a vulture's feather, along which the cautery should be;
if you wish, let it be pointed from one end to the other, and if you wish, let it be like a tent;
however, this one which is shaped is better for your work.
Then press the fistula if it is open, and remove the pus, and dry it; and if it is closed, then open it, and remove the core;
then apply the hot cautery strongly, and hold your hand to the cautery at the part of the nose above the eye, so that your hand does not fail; and place the cautery in the fatty tissue of the eye, and corrupt it.
If you reach the bone with the cautery at the beginning, it would be good. If not, repeat the cautery again, and again if you need to, and leave it for three days;
afterwards apply cotton soaked in butter, and treat it with drying ointment until it is healed, and if forty days pass and it is not healed, apply a corrosive watery medicine until the bone is uncovered; and treat it according to what would come in its chapter.
And there is a method of cauterizing a fistula that some of the ancients described. Attend to the fistula, and incise the area; afterwards put into the incision a thin cauterizing iron of which this is the shape: and it is made to the quantity of a 3 of lead; and hold your hand with the cauterizing iron firmly, and let the patient not move at all, lest the molten lead run into his eye;
and it is necessary that one put on the patient's eye cotton moistened in egg white or in water:
the lead thus burns the place of the fistula, and heals it by marvelous health.
And if the fistula is healed by the cautery that we have described, that is good. If not, it is necessary to administer a perforation to the nose, and to bring the fistula back to the body of the nose according to what is necessary in its proper place.
of the cracks in the lips Very often cracks occur in the lips which are called "chapped lips," and similarly in the lips of children.
When you treat these cracks with what we have said in the divisions, and the treatment is not effective, then heat a small knife cautery according to this form:
And apply it quickly to those cracks until it reaches the bottom;
afterwards treat the area with cerate until it is healed.
When an abscess appears in the root of the throat or in the uvula, or on the palate, or at the roots of the teeth, after it forms pus and breaks and ages and becomes a fistula; and you treat it as we have said in the sections, and it does not improve: then you must apply a cautery according to the size of the fistula; after the opening or hole of the fistula, and hold your hand until the hot iron reaches the bottom of it, and the furthest point;
and do so once or twice, after treating it as we have said in treatments, until it is healed;
and if it is healed thus, it is good; and if not, it is necessary to uncover the place and remove the corrupted bone, according to what you will find in its chapter.
When the gums are softened by moisture and the teeth move, and you treat it with medicines and it is of no use, then place the patient's head in your lap; then heat the cautery whose form will come later in such a way that you place a chain on the tooth;
and put the hot cautery inside quickly, and hold your hand until the patient feels the heat reaching the root of the tooth;
afterwards lift your hand and reapply the cautery according to your wish;
afterwards let the patient fill his mouth with salt water, and hold it for an hour and then spit it out.
And in this way the tooth which was loose is fixed, and the softened gum is strengthened, and the corrupted moisture is dried.
Of the toothache
When toothache comes from coldness, or there is coldness or pain, and the medical cures are not effective, then cautery is needed in two ways: and cautery with butter and cautery with fire.
Cautery with butter is such that you take butter of a cow, and put the end in an iron or bronze spoon; then take cotton and wrap it around the tip of a tent, and moisten it in boiling butter, and apply it to the aching tooth quickly and hold it until it is cooled;
and thus do often until its virtue reaches the root of the tooth, and if you wish, then moisten wool and cotton in cold butter, and put it on the aching tooth, and put a hot iron on it until the fire reaches the end of the tooth.
The cautery with fire is such that you take an iron or bronze cane, and it should be thick so that the fire does not reach the mouth of the patient;
then heat the cautery, whose form will come later, and put it on the tooth and hold your hand until the cautery is cooled;
do this often, for the pain will be removed that same day or the next.
And it is necessary that the patient fill his mouth with good butter at the time of this cautery, and then rinse it strongly;
and this is the form of the cautery:
And make a cautery of whatever head you wish, and according to what you have power;
and this is the form of the cautery:
of the scrophula When the scrophula are of phlegm and cold moisture, and are not obedient to digestion by medicines, then heat the cautery head of which the form follows, and it shall have two openings for the fumes to escape from the cautery on the other side;
and place the hot cautery on the abscess once, or twice if necessary, until it reaches the bottom of the abscess;
and if the abscess is small, apply the cautery according to the size of the abscess, and leave it thus for three days; and apply cotton soaked in butter until the burn is healed;
afterwards treat the area with ointments and tents until it is healed.
When humors overcome the channels of the lung, and especially when this comes from a cold complexion, then the patient must first be purged with laxative medicines;
afterwards apply a cautery to the root of the throat, and be careful not to go down to the throat, and not to burn near the heart but only a little.
Afterwards apply another cautery to the joint of the neck at the top of the spine, and let the cautery be that which is called "clavicle," of which we have the form above;
and treat the place as we have said before until it is healed.
When all the illnesses of the lung are from cold moisture, and the patient has neither fever nor dryness, and the illness is chronic, apply two cauteries on the collarbone in empty places; and one other cautery in the middle of the breast between the two nipples;
and let the cautery which is called "clavile" be according to the form which is described above.
And if you wish, make a cautery by pricking with the whole cautery which is called "points," the form of which is described above in the illness of the ears;
and let the pricks be up to thirty, or thereabouts.
After, treat the place according to what is said before, and let the cautery be in three rows according to this form:
And for this reason the cauteries are lighter, because you make three at a time.
of the dislocation of the shoulder
When the head of the shoulder is dislocated due to moisture, and it is reset but cannot stay in place, repeatedly dislocating with slight movement as we have experienced, then you must first reset the dislocation. Afterwards, let the patient be supported on his back and on his side; then lift the heart which is inside the pericardium with the fingers of your left hand;
and if the joint is dislocated internally, heat the cautery which has two nerves of which this is the form:
and cauterize the heart until it pierces to the side, and the figure of the cautery would come together with four cauteries;
and for this reason a cautery is made with the cautery which has three nerves, because of which the figures of cauterization are six cauteries;
and the nerves are according to the thinness of a tent peg and this is the form of the cautery which has three nerves:
And sometimes one nerve is added to this, because of which there are eight cauteries.
Afterwards, apply to the cautery crushed parsley with salt; afterwards, let the patient rest, and let the limb not be moved for a long time until it is well strengthened.
And if it is dislocated above, which happens rarely, then make a cautery on the thickness of the clavicle cautery, or many cauteries by pricking.
For the joint is closed, and the moisture is removed, and the patient is healed.
When in the stomach come colds and much moisture, to the extent that it changes its complexion, and catarrhs are multiplied in him, and in the accustomed methods of treatment and he does not benefit, then it is necessary that the patient be laid on his back, and extend his legs and arms. After this, make three cauteries, one under the hollow of the breast the size of a finger, with the whole clavicle cautery, and two cauteries outside the two sides so that the shape of the cauteries is in three angles, and has such space between one and the other that they are not joined together when they discharge pus;
and let the cauteries be so deep that they reach the two parts of the heart, and let the shape of the cauteries be according to this form without addition:
And if you wish to cauterize with a large cautery in the middle of the stomach according to this form;
and he who is afraid of this cautery, cauterize by pricking and bleeding on the stomach at one point according to the quantity that you wish to draw out; then cauterize with the whole cautery which is called "points".
After the treatment of the cure that we have had before, until it is healed.
When pain in the liver comes from cold and moisture and great flatulence, so that it is removed from its natural complexion by superfluities; and the patient is treated with what we have said in divisions, and it does not benefit him, then it is necessary that the patient be treated on his bed; and mark three cauteries according to this form and this figure and this quantity on the liver, outside the hypochondria, where the ribs of a man come;
and let there be a space between each cautery the thickness of a finger; and let the cauteries be lengthwise along the body, and do not press your hand too much on the whole cautery;
and let only half of the heart be burned, and let the patient be upright on his feet;
and if he cannot, let him be lying down, and extend his legs, and raise his arms;
And if it is your wish, cauterize these cauteries with the curette, if you are skillful and wise in the art, and beware that you do not burn the whole heart, for you would dry up the whole body; and that it does not reach boiling, for the heart is very delicate in that place, and know that for certain.
When there is an abscess in the liver, and you want to know if it is in the flesh of the liver or in the membrane: if it is in the flesh, the patient does not feel very strong pain;
and if it is in the membrane, he feels excruciating pain.
And then when this treatment weakens the eyes, it is necessary that the patient be supported on his head;
and then bleed the area where the abscess is, and then heat the cautery which is similar to a ray, of which here is the form: And cauterize with the cautery until the core is burned, and it reaches suppuration, until the burn is completely inflamed;
after the treatment according to the treatment of burns until it is healed;
and it is not necessary that anyone use this cautery except those who have studied for a long time in the art of medicine, and through whose hands these diseases have sometimes passed.
Then he can work boldly, and yet it seems to me that it is better to leave it.
Of the cautery of pleurisy.
The ancients said that for pleurisy one should make cauteries of aristolochia roots, and in this manner: Take a long aristolochia root, the largest you can find, and let it be dry, and let it be as thick and as long as your fingers; and moisten it in oil, and hold it in the fire, and cauterize with the cautery between the clavicle and the neck, and two small cauteries a little lower down in the part which is below the beard;
and two cauteries between the fifth and sixth ribs, sloping slightly backward; and one cautery in the middle of the breast, and another on the stomach, and one between the two shoulders, and two on the two sides of the breast, outside the cautery which is between the two shoulders;
and do not press your hand, but act openly as if you were smelling.
And some ancients said that some men use a fire cautery resembling a razor, and they heat it and place it between the ribs, until it reaches that abscess; and the pain leaps out, as we have said in the case of the liver abscess.
But in this operation there is fear that the patient dies immediately, or a fistula results which cannot be healed.
of the mice
When you treat the disease of the mice according to what we have said in the divisions of treatments, and it does not help, then there are three kinds of cautery which are all good.
Of which one method is that you make three cauteries, or four, in a line along the length of the mice, according to the figure of the liver cautery that we have mentioned before;
and do not press your hand on the whole cautery, and let the patient often lie on his back;
and another method of cautery is that you heat the cautery which has two points, as we have shown in the dislocation of the shoulder;
and lift the heart which is located near the mice, or where the patient's side is towards the left, and let the elevations with which you lift the heart be along the heart, along the length of the body, and the cauteries be along the width of the body.
Afterwards, put the two burning points in until the heart is pierced on the other side, and then draw out the cautery, and thus there will be four.
And if you wish, cauterize with the whole cautery with three points.
After the cure, when it has expelled pus for a long time, and this is better than the other cures mentioned above.
Cautery is of no use for a dropsical patient, except in the manner which is called "asclytes".
When you treat it according to the methods we have described in the divisions, and your treatment does not help, then you must make four cauteries around the belly, and one on the stomach, and one on the liver, and one on the spleen, and two on the back along the spine, and one near the breast; and let the cautery be very close to the thickness of the heart.
Afterwards, leave the cautery open to discharge pus for a long time, and do not neglect the treatment of the patient after the cautery; and healing will be hastened, and the two intentions will be combined with God's help.
The shape of the cautery for the belly should be the small peg that we have shown before; and that for the back should be olive-shaped, according to what is shown above.
When the feet are swollen in a dropsical patient, and are full of citrine water, you must cauterize on the back of the foot between the little toe and the ring finger; and lift your hand with the cautery without turning it.
And do not enter too deeply, lest the citrine water be consumed by fire, and let the cautery be according to this form:
Afterwards, make on both legs two cauteries on each leg at the tip of the little toe; and let the cauteries be long, one below the knee in front and the other behind, in the middle of the leg;
and leave the cauteries open for a long time without tending them, so that the water may come out;
after the treatment of the other treatments that we have mentioned.
When looseness of the bowels comes from cold and moisture, so that the retentive and digestive powers which are in the stomach and in the intestine are weakened, and cannot be cured by means of treatments; and you see the patient is well-bearing and of strong virtue, then make a large cautery on the stomach according to what has been spoken of before concerning the cautery of the stomach, the circular cautery; and four subtle cauteries around the buttocks with one subtle clavile cautery, and two cauteries on the hips.
And if you see abundant moisture and the patient suffering, then make a cautery on the wrist, and one cautery on each side, and two small cauteries on the stomach near the large one, for the cure is beneficial when there is good assistance.
Of the cure of hemorrhoids
When the hemorrhoids are in the fundament, one or more, and are old and are of large, cold, and moist corrupted humors, and are cured as we have said in divisions, and it does not help, then make cauteries: Three on the spine of the back, those which are entirely outside below the armpit little by little in a triangle, and one cautery below the buttock two fingers [width];
And if you think that his stomach is chilled, and the food does not digest, and one sees the face swell, then make one large cautery on the stomach, as it is said before, and another on the liver, and another on the spleen with the whole clavicular cautery; and leave the cautery open a long time. After, cure the place until it is healed.
When you cut the thelul, heat the cautery which resembles a razor, and then place it, all burning, on that cut thelul; and leave your hand there until the cautery reaches the origin of the vein, from which the blood flows;
do this once or twice, and if there is much thelul, cauterize each one as we have said; afterwards cure it with beneficial ointments until it is healed;
and if you cauterize with a large cautery on alchatim, it will have greater benefit.
When the patient cannot tolerate incision or opening, which we will describe in its place, such an illness occurs that it cannot be healed except by cautery.
When a fistula develops in someone, and it is old and discharges pus and corrupt moisture, you should probe it entirely with a thin tent, and make sure you know entirely how deep the tent goes.
Afterwards, heat the cautery which resembles a razor, and insert it into the fistula according to how far the tent went in, and repeat the cautery until the rotten and corrupt flesh is burned, once, or twice, or three times, according to the amount needed;
and beware of burning the nerves which are nearby, and the large veins.
If the fistula goes to the body of the bladder and the intestine, beware of those places, and do not apply the fire except to fleshy areas, and know that it is not penetrating;
afterwards, treat the area until it is healed, and if the area is sealed, and the matter has been removed for a long time, then know that the area is completely healed;
and if the matter is not removed, know that the area is infected, and the bone at the bottom is corrupt; and thus like one of those that we shall describe in its place.
When cold pain comes to the kidneys, and great flatulence, and he does not desire a woman, then you must cauterize him over the kidneys on one side and the other with the cautery iron that we have described before;
and if we cauterize in the middle, there will be three cauteries in a line, and they will provide greater help.
Of the bladder When the bladder is soft and weak from cold and moisture, so that the patient retains urine, then make a cautery on the outer part above the bladder, where the hairs of the pubis begin, one on the right and one on the left, and let each cautery be as long as the width of a thumb;
and make one cautery on the back, or two if you need them;
and let the cautery be peg-shaped according to the form previously described.
When the womb is cold and moist, and does not allow conception for this reason, and the flowers (menstrual blood) are corrupted and their time is delayed; and when they come, she feels great pain: then it is necessary that three cauteries be made around the buttocks, as we have said in the cautery of the bladder, and two cauteries on the outside of the back;
and let the cauteries be of the appropriate size, as we have said.
When viscous humors descend to the hip joint, and because of this it moves from its place, and the sign is that the thigh is longer than the other when measured together;
and the place of the separation is found empty, then you must cauterize the patient over the hip joint with one cautery resembling a circle, and bleed in front of the place around the joint as it turns, so that the joint is inside the circle;
and let the cautery be like that with which one cauterizes the stomach.
And if this cautery is not present, make three cauteries of the size of an olive, and let the cauteries be as deep as all the fingers;
and cure it until it is healed.
of the hip pain When pain comes in the hip joint, and it is from cold and moisture, and the patient is treated with what we have said in the division and the treatment is not effective, and the illness is old: then you must purge the patient of the gross humors with fetid pills, or other similar good pills. Afterwards, apply a cautery;
and the manner of the cautery is according to two methods: that is to say, with burning medicines, and fire cautery.
Fire cautery is done in many ways, of which one is this:
that you cauterize on the hip bone three triangular cauteries according to this form, and make them deep and large, and have between each cautery the space of the width of a finger, and let the cauteries be olive-shaped;
Sometimes a cautery is made in the middle on the head of the hip, so that there are four according to this form:
And if you wish, cauterize it with the circular cautery that we have described before in the dislocation of the hip;
but do it in such a way that the circle contains the whole hip, and all the surrounding bone is burned.
And this is the method used in sciatica, when the pain is in the hip and does not reach the thigh or leg.
And if it extends to the thigh and leg, make two cauteries where the patient says the pain is, and one cautery above the ankle four fingers, a little to the left side;
and let the cautery be knife-shaped, and let the thickness of the bone be burned;
and if the patient feels that the pain extends to the toes or nearly so, cauterize where he feels the pain, three or four points with the cautery which is called "points". And if necessary, make more.
And if the pain is below the knee towards the thigh, make a knife-shaped or circular cautery, and take great care in all your cauteries that you do not leave the cautery on so long that you burn the nerves and large arteries, and that you do not cause the patient greater harm and contraction.
And I myself have seen many who have made cautery on the ankle of the foot, and left it on so long that the leg was completely swollen, and the foot as well, and the whole foot was pierced and corrupted. After a bowel movement, from which he died.
And if the pain is in two places together, make a cautery in one and in the other, in this manner.
And the wise men said, for the cautery of the hip, of which this is the manner, make one such iron and let its head be as thick as a date pit, or a little less, and let it be grooved, and let the space between the grooves be the quantity of a thumb's knuckle;
and let the grooves be open on two sides, and let them be also like knots, and let there be a well-made iron handle;
and this is the form:
And let it be heated until it is all red and throws off sparks, and then put it on the hip joint of the diseased side, and let it be turned towards the healthy side;
and cauterize it once, around the cautery, and leave it for three days; and then make a plaster of butter, and leave the wound open for a long time; after the treatment with ointment until it is healed.
Albucasis says that we use little of this cautery because of the fear of its effect, and we see few who use it;
and yet it is one of the good cauteries, for those who can endure it, and where it is appropriate.
The cautery of burning medicine is that you make an instrument with interlocks in which the edge of the door descends, and it should be of bronze or iron with a long side, and in height it should have two knobs, and between each the quantity of the thickness of a finger; and they are open outside and above, and join together according to this form:
Then place the box on the hip of the patient lying on his healthy side, and press your hand very much on the box of the hip; afterwards pour between the two circles of hot water which has been heated over the fire a little, and leave it for an hour, and let the patient suffer the heat and burning from it.
For it finds a burning there as from fire;
and when the burning is past, lift your hand with the instrument and lift the hip from the warm water, and leave it so for three days, and apply butter until that which is black from the scald is removed; and leave it three days so that the corruption comes out;
and that would be the last aid after the cure of ointments until he is healed.
And if the pain has extended to the thigh or to the leg, make for him an instrument that holds water according to what you have done to the hip equally;
and this is the manner of warm water, and I have written it in the treatise on the rectification of medicine. Take alkali and quicklime, as much of one as of the other, and grind them together, and put them in a new pot. where there is a small hole outside so that the point of a razor can enter it;
where there is a small hole outside so that the point of a razor can enter it; and place on that pot another pot well sealed, and put on top alkali and lime and sweet water, until there is a finger's breadth above the powders when you have well pressed it with your hand;
and leave it thus until water descends and drips into the sealed pot, then take all that water, and pour it over the lime and alkali as before.
And then it will be very strong water and is administered in many medical operations and in cauteries of other members.
For it performs the same work as fire, and there are other medicines with which one cauterizes the hip well, such as tesisie and honey and anacardi and lime with soap, all these things mixed together.
And Galen tells us of a cure by which a man was cured of the hip pain and sciatic vein, and praises it highly, and says that no other cure was performed, and that he was healed at once when this cure was performed, and he bathed himself as he teaches below.
And he says in this manner that you take fresh and dry green litharge, and grind it very finely with one ounce of fat, and put it on the hip and thigh and leg where the pain is, and bind it;
and leave it for three hours, and according to the amount that the patient no longer feels the burning.
And then make him enter the bath until his body is slightly warmed, and make him enter the bed, and the pain will all go away and he will be healed.
And know that no one should use cautery with such medicines, unless it is after the evacuation of the body.
And Dioscorides says that when the sciatic vein is cauterized with goat dung, it helps greatly;
and the cautery should be done in this manner. Take wool and soak it in old oil, and place it on the hollow that is between the thumb of the foot and the other which is called foscile.
Then take dried goat dung, and burn it until it is charcoal, and put it on the wool, and leave it until it is extinguished;
and do it again in this way, and do not cease doing so until you think by feeling that it reaches down to the hip, and that the pain is ceased;
and this type of cautery is called "goat cautery".
of the pain of the back
When pain comes to the back, whether from a fall or from percussion or from too great evacuation, or from similar spread cold matter, in none of these cases is cautery useful, except for that which comes from the infusion of cold matter.
It is necessary that after the patient is purged of fetid pills or other similar things, that three lines are made on his back, where the pain is located, signed with ink, and in each line V cauteries or more, according to the virtue and quantity that the patient can endure;
and let the cautery be made according to the cautery which is called "points";
and if you wish, make III cauteries or IIII with the middle nail cautery according to this form:
Many times this illness comes to small children, and the sign of the beginning is that they have shortness of breath when they rise, and fear; and you find in the last spine of the back and in us the appearance which comes upon the other spines.
When you see this and you wish to cure it, cauterize it with the circular cautery according to this form. So that the cautery equally affects each part of the spine.
And if you wish, cauterize around the spine with the pointed cautery two or three lines, and let the points be close to one another.
After, cure the place until it is healed according to what we have said, and beware that you do not administer cautery in a gibbosity which is in a spasm of the nerve.
Of the pain of the joints.
When joint pain is from moistures that are spread to each limb of the body, and when pain comes in the feet, which the physicians properly call "podagra," and when it is from a cold cause and cures by medicines cannot cure it, then it is cured by cautery in this manner:
Make many cauteries around the joint of the foot, and let the cautery be olive-shaped according to this form:
And if it is necessary that you cauterize on the surface of the foot, make a cautery for the whole cautery that is called "point". And if the pains reach the knees and other joints, and this happens many times, make three or four cauteries on each knee, on each side, with the whole olive-shaped cautery;
and if you need more, then make more, but do not hold your hand there longer than until the thickness of the skin is burned.
And if the pains descend to the knee and the back, administer the cautery that we have described in its chapter.
And if the pains are in the hands, make points around the wrist two lines;
and if any pain remains in the fingers, make points on each joint and on the back of the hand;
and if the pains come down to the elbows or to the shoulders, cauterize each part, and give good care to the patient and take medicines.
For if you give him good care and purge phlegm, he will be healed with God's help.
When a rupture occurs in the groin, and the bowels descend into the scrotum, and it is recent, it is necessary that when you wish to cure it, he should not eat that day; and that he use things that loosen the belly, so that the feces descend from his belly;
then make him sit on his back between your hands, and instruct him to hold his breath until the bowels are replaced, and bring them back with your fingers, and make an incision below the rupture on the pubic bone, and make a mark that resembles half a circle above the body;
then heat the cautery of which this is the form:
until it is white and gives off sparks. Then replace the bowels in their place; and the assistant hold his hand above so that they do not return;
and spread the patient's thighs well, and place a cushion underneath him and a servant on his thighs, and another on his chest to hold his hands;
then place the cautery on the mark with your whole hand, and hold it steady and hold it until you reach the bone, and if you do not reach it the first time, repeat it again until you reach the bone; and carefully watch that the bowel does not protrude when you apply the cautery; lest you burn it; and that the patient does not die because of this, or suffer other harm.
And know that if you do not reach the bone with the cautery, your work is worthless.
And the cautery for children should be small according to their size, and for adults large according to their size;
after three days, treat the cauterized area with butter until the burn is gone;
afterwards treat it with other ointments until it is healed, and let the patient lie on his back for forty days until the wound is well closed;
and his diet should be light for a long time, so that his bowels do not move when he wants to go to the privy.
And after forty days, when he wants to get up, provide him with a well-made bandage, and keep it on for another forty days;
and let him have good rest, that he works little and guards himself against too great repletion of drink and food, and too loud laughter;
and when he follows this instruction he is completely healed.
And I will describe the treatment of cutting in its chapter.
When ruptures occur in other bellies and are known, and you see that they are not growing, make a cautery of the round cautery according to its size, and let one-third of the heart be burned; after the treatment according to what we have said;
and some of the ancients have said that one should cauterize it with a three-angled cautery according to this form:
but first mark the place of the incision and make a line across the width above the rupture, and another outside, and hold your hand in the middle with the whole cautery firmly.
But the first cautery is lighter and gentler.
of old pain in some limb When pain comes in a limb, either from a fall or a blow, and that pain lasts a long time, and the cure of medicine is of no use, then it must be cauterized with the cautery which is called "points," and let the cautery be according to the length of the limb and its smallness and its weakness and its strength and its location of twists and its pain.
If he is healed by the first cautery, it is good;
if not, begin another cautery on that one, for such is the custom that it must move to the limb that is near it, wherefore it is necessary that you make cauteries until the patient is healed.
Lepers are sometimes helped by cautery with great benefit, and likewise the illness that comes from the putrefaction of phlegm and melancholy.
When you see it cauterized, take care if the illness is at the beginning, and if it is cured according to what we have said in the division, and does not descend or remain, and you doubt that the corruption may seize the whole patient, then make five cauteries on the head: one in the middle of the head at the nape, and another towards the forehead at the hairline; and two on the two temples, and one behind on the nape of the neck;
and leave your hand there until the cautery reaches the bone, and until the scabs come out so that the vapors of the gross humors can escape;
and cauterize on the chin according to what is before.
And if the leprosy is scattered everywhere; and it appears manifestly, then you must cauterize it with the cauteries that we have mentioned on the head, and one cautery in the middle of the nose, and two cauteries on the spine of the neck, and six cauteries on the spine of the back, and one large one on the rump and one other beside it, and two on the two shoulders; and two on the elbows, and two on the breasts, and one on each joint of the hands and feet, and on the hollows of the hands;
and beware of the nerves that are on the heel, that you do not burn them;
and sometimes one makes a cautery on the bone of the wrist, and another on the bone of the stomach, and another on the liver.
And know that the more cauteries you make, the more help you give, and the more it benefits him;
and know that the sick person does not feel any pain from the cautery as the healthy feel, because the body is already all corrupted.
And it is necessary that the cauteries be large and small according to the limbs and joints, according to what you will find in the types of irons.
After, cure the place with vetch flour with honey and other cures until it is healed.
When swelling comes in a limb and is treated with medicines and oils and plasters, and it is not healed, then make cauteries on the limb according to the size of the limb;
and let the cautery be a little penetrating into the thickness of the flesh; then cure it with ointments until it is healed.
And sometimes a cautery is made on the hand and on the foot and on the back, at the exit of the nerve that moves the limb, and thus the swelling is removed;
and yet no one should interfere unless he is knowledgeable of the limbs and the exits of the nerves moving the body.
When the illness that is called "albaras" is old, and the tools of medicine are of no use, then cauterize it with a cautery a little deeply, according to the thickness of the heart, until the whiteness is removed, and its color is changed;
then treat it with flour of vetches and lentils with rose oil and plantain leaves, and pigeon blood and swallow blood, one part of each; and let it all be mixed together, and bound with a cloth, and let it be aired in place until it is healed.
The treatment of cancer by cautery
When cancer comes at the beginning, and you want to stop it, then cauterize it with a cautery that resembles a circle, all around the edge of the cancer.
And yet the wise men say that one should also cauterize the middle of the cancer;
and yet that does not seem good to me, for I fear that it will be ulcerated and corrupted, and I have already seen that happen sometimes;
and a more straightforward thing is that it be cauterized around, with the cautery that is called "circular," as we have said in many cauteries.
When someone has an illness that is called "adubelati," and it is slow to mature, either because of the superfluity it causes or because of the age of the patient when he is decrepit (that is to say, very old) and he has little blood, or because of the season; and you see it hasten to mature: then cauterize it around with many small, piercing cauteries; afterwards leave it thus. For it will hasten to mature.
And if you see it pierce through the whole cautery, then heat the cautery of which this is the shape:
And place your hand in the middle of that illness which is called "adubelati" until the cautery has pierced the core, and let the cautery be such that the patient feels it outwardly in such a way that the course of the corruption is alleviated.
Afterwards cure it until it is perfectly healed.
There is another kind of illness which is called "corrodens", and it is nothing other than an eating away of a limb, for it eats away the limbs like fire eats dry wood.
If you see this illness in a place that can withstand cautery with fire, then heat the cautery pins, small and large, according to what is needed for the place where the illness is;
after cauterizing on all sides until you eradicate all the corruption, and nothing of it remains, so that all that is corrupt is removed.
And then leave it for three days, and apply to the cauterized places softened bread with oil until the burns from the fire are removed, and all the corruption.
Then treat it with ointments that generate flesh.
And if you see after three days that healthy flesh does not grow, it is good;
and if not, then repeat the cautery on what remains of the corrupted areas.
And this ailment is sometimes cured by a liquid medicine in place of fire cautery;
but nevertheless fire cautery is of greater help, and I have already described the treatment with liquid medicine in the section: take it when you need it.
of the swellings that come to the feet Very often it happens that a disease arises on the feet from the outside which is called "clos" according to our understanding, and it is a large, swollen thing that injures the foot.
And the cautery for this disease is according to two methods. That is to say, cautery by fire, and cautery by hot water.
Cautery by fire is that you heat a cautery iron, just like a goose feather, and it should be made of good iron to the measure that it can encompass the nail on all sides, and that it has fine edges;
afterwards place it, very hot, on the nail, and turn your hand all around the nail until it reaches the bottom of the nail; and leave it like that for three days until it begins to exude pus; then make a poultice of crushed wild mallows with honey, and leave the poultice on all night, and the nail will fall off and be eradicated from its roots.
Then treat the area with flesh-generating ointment until it is healed.
And if they are inverted outwardly from the body, and this often happens in the hands and feet, then you must apply a hot water cautery; and it is in this manner: take a chain of bronze or iron, or a goose feather, and place it on the nail and the wart, that is to say, on warts; and place the chain so that it encircles it entirely, then add a little hot water, and hold your hand firmly, and press your hand turning so that the edge of the chain reaches the root of the nail, and the hot water can find a deep path to the root;
and let the patient suffer the biting of the hot water a little for an hour; then leave it thus, and it will be uprooted entirely with its roots.
Do this one after another, until you have eradicated all those that are on the body, then treat them with ointments that generate flesh.
When someone trembles from coldness of the nerves, or from quartan fever or other, then you must make four cauteries or four on the spine of the back, one cautery between each spine; and one cautery on the feet, and one on the stomach with the olive cautery;
then the trembling will cease, and the health from the cold illness will hasten.
Sometimes there appear on the outside of the body boils, or foul pustules, which come from large corrupted matters.
then it is necessary at first, when they appear, that one make a cautery on each head of the pustule: a subtle cautery of myrtle wood, of which the point is held in the fire, or of the root of long birthwort, or with the lenticular cautery.
And sometimes they are cauterized at the beginning when they appear, in this manner, and they cannot grow from then on, but the superfluities from which they come are broken up, and they are healed;
but it is necessary that this be done after the evacuation of blood.
Often there are great flows of blood from the artery which is cut in the wound that comes from a burn, or in the incision of an abscess, or in the cautery of a limb, and similar things; and it is a very difficult thing to staunch.
And however when this happens to someone, hasten to put your index finger on the wound of the vein, and press it very hard until the blood is calmed beneath your finger, and that no drop comes out anymore;
then put in the fire several small and large olive-shaped cauteries until they are all red;
then take one, either large or small according to the wound and the place where the artery is broken, and put the cautery on that vein where you hold your finger, and hold the cautery there until the blood is stanched.
And if it spurts out when you lift your finger from the vein, and the cautery is extinguished, then quickly take another of the cauteries which are in the fire.
And do not cease doing this one after the other until the blood is stanched;
and be careful that you do not burn the nerve which is nearby, and that no other harm comes to the patient;
and know that when blood flows from the artery, one cannot easily stanch it, especially when the artery is large, unless it is by one of the four ways that we have mentioned: either by cautery, or by extraction when it is not treated, or by tight binding with thread, or by medicines applied which have the power to stanch blood; and it should be bound and compressed tightly.
Whoever attempts stanching by tightly binding with cloths or by applying burning things, or other similar things, will gain little benefit.
And if this happens to someone and he does not have a leech or medicine present, he should put his index finger on the wound of the vein as we have said, and press firmly until it is stanched above the wound and above the vein; and not move the finger, but wet it with cold water often, that it be very cold until the blood is congealed and thickened and stanched;
and then do what he needs to with cautery and medicines.
We have told you in the first chapter all the illnesses in which it is necessary to cauterize with fire, or with burning medicine, and the occasions, and the causes, and the instruments, and the forms of cauteries;
and I have placed that chapter from the head to the feet, and I will go in this chapter by that same way so that one may more easily find what one wishes.
And before I begin this, dear son, it is necessary that you learn that in this chapter there is more peril and fear than in the first of cauteries, and therefore greater caution is necessary.
For in the work of this chapter there often happens evacuation of blood in opening the vein, and in the incision on an abscess, and in the treatment of wounds, and in the extraction of arrows, and in the incision on a stone, and similar things; where there is doubt and fear, and death comes to many.
And I warn you that you do not undertake foolishness. For many kinds of people come for treatment. Thus some come who are so angered with their illness that they die easily because of the rage they feel from their illness, and from the magnitude of its malice; and one must fear these.
And among these there are some who give you their senses, and say: Wait, I am healed"; and the illness is spiteful.
It is not fitting that you consent to those who come to you who have this manner, but put greater trust in your honor than in your greed, and do not work foolishly but wisely on that which you are certain of, and from which you can gain praise and honor;
and use prognosis and indication in the treatment of your patients to which health should be directed;
and this will help you acquire good reputation, and glory, and memory of praise.
Most dear son, may Our Lord give you good understanding and righteousness, and may he inspire you with the holy inspiration of his hand, amen.
Now I have ordered this chapter in sections, according to what is before, or the chapter on cauteries, which I have described from head to foot, so that you may more easily find what you need.
Know that this illness very often comes to children at birth, and when the midwife pulls the child's head too hard;
and sometimes it comes from a hidden cause that is unknown.
And I never saw this illness except in children, and in all those I have seen, death hastened; and therefore it seems to me that it is better for me to leave the work in such treatments.
And I saw a child whose head was full of water, and the head swelled each day until it could not support it;
and the moisture grew so much that he died, and this moisture is gathered under the bone above the dura mater, between the brain and the bone;
and the procedure is such that if the moisture is between the brain and the bone, and the abscess is small, that you make a large incision in the middle of the head;
and let it be as long as two fingers, until the moisture runs out;
and here is the form of the spatula:
If the moisture is more grown, and the abscess is larger, make two incisions in the manner of a cross, according to this form:
And if the moisture is under the bone, and the signs that you see the sutures of the head open on each side, and the water leaps forth when you press it from the inside with your hand, and this is not returned to you: then you must make three incisions in the middle of the head in this manner:
And after the incision, draw out all the moisture. Afterwards, bind the incisions with cloths and powders, and apply wine and oil, and leave it so until the fifth day;
then unbind it, and treat the wound with tents and ointments, and allow the head to drain evenly, and give the patient dry meat with little moisture until the limb is strengthened and healed.
And another method of incision is that you look at the size of the abscess where it is apparent, and the collection of the water;
for sometimes it is in front; sometimes behind; sometimes on the right; and sometimes on the left.
Therefore, cut where the abscess appears, and the collection of water, and open it as much as you can;
and be careful not to cut the artery; and a flow of blood comes, so that the patient dies from the flow of blood and the evacuation of moisture.
When someone has a disease called "catarrh" in the eyes or chest, and the disease is old, and the treatment of medicine does not help, then the last resort is cautery, along with cutting the two arteries.
Therefore, when you want to cut them, the patient should throw back his head; then rub the area with a rough cloth until the arteries appear, then the patient constricts his neck with the cloth; then look where the vein beats, and the locations of both are behind the ears, and they are slightly recessed;
then mark the places with ink, then cut one and the other with a sharp spatula on two sides, until the cut reaches the bone, and this should be across the width of the head.
And if you wish, place the spatula under the artery and cut above it, cutting as if with two fingers across.
And when the vein is cut, the blood spurts upwards continuously.
And if the artery is not felt, you must measure the space of three fingers, then mark with ink and cut down to the bone;
and the amount of blood to be let out is six ounces, and perhaps a little more or less, depending on what the patient can endure, and the fullness of the artery;
then examine the wound: if any point of the dura mater remains on the bone, cut it so that no abscess forms, then bind the wound tightly and treat it with ointment until it is healed.
of migraine When chronic migraine occurs, and acute catarrh, due to the moisture of the tears and the heat in the temples and old, violent headache and similar things, and it is treated with various methods of medicinal cures and none of this helps, then we bleed the arteries of the temples and cauterize them, as we have described.
And the method of extraction is that the patient should raise the hair from his temples, and find the artery that appears in the temple, for it appears clearly by its beating, and is only slightly hidden except in some men who are too cold;
and if it is hidden, the patient should pull his hair back with some cloths, then rub the place with some rough cloth, and bathe the area with warm water until the artery appears clearly; then take the spatula of which this is the form: then lightly scrape the skin until you reach the artery, then pull it upward with the tweezers, and separate it well from the tissues that are beneath it on each side;
and if the artery is small, turn it with the point of the hook, then cut it from that part according to the quantity of two fingers. For if it is not cut, the blood will not flow out entirely.
And draw out six ounces of blood, down to three;
and if the artery is large, you must tie it in two places with a strong double silk thread, so that putrefaction does not occur before the healing of the wound, and excessive bleeding occurs;
then cut the excess which is between the two ligatures at that very moment, and then, if you wish, cauterize it with a knife cautery down to the bone until the edges are cut;
and this is the best method, if the patient does not have a fever and is of a warm complexion. For cautery helps to dry up the humors: therefore it is of greater help for humors.
Where it is necessary for the extraction of arteries that one fill the place with old cotton and put on well-made tents;
and when they are unbound, let it be treated with dry medicines that produce flesh, and with tents, until it is healed;
and if blood flows from the artery as long as you work there, hasten to cauterize it, or fill the place with vitriol and restrain it with your hand so that the blood is stopped; and if you do not have that at hand, put your finger on the place until the blood is congealed, and irrigate the place with cold water until the bleeding stops, and it is extracted as necessary;
And there should be one finger's breadth of thickness between the two knives, and then when you have marked the two places, you place the burning iron there until it reaches the bone, and cut the vein in two places; and they should be separated between the two ends, for it is not completely sealed by this cautery entirely;
and this is the form of the cautery:
and that which is milder and easier in the extraction of the artery is that you cauterize the vein with this sharp cautery on two sides, but the cuts should be thick to retain their heat longer. For when the instrument is too thin, it retains its heat less.
of tears When tears from the eyes are descending from the veins that are on the top of the head from fever, and no medicinal cure helps, and you see the face of the patient redden, and he feels a throbbing in the forehead like trembling; and his eye is swollen and moist so that the hairs of the eyelids have fallen out, and the eyelids are hot and scorched by the burning of the tears, then this treatment is necessary. And the ancients called it "contus cure", and it is that you should shave the hairs that the patient has on the forehead who has this illness, then make three incisions on the forehead equally along the length of the forehead;
And the ancients called it "contus cure", and it is that you should shave the hairs that the patient has on the forehead who has this illness, then make three incisions on the forehead equally along the length of the forehead; and let one of the incisions be like two fingers across the middle of the forehead going down to the nose, and the other two at the two temples above the eyelids, and beware of cutting the arteries that are at the two sides above the eyelids;
and keep your hand away from the continuation of the two jaws, and let each wound be the size of three joined fingers across;
and have ready a piece of sponge and many cloths to wipe the blood, then put the sharp spatula on two parts of which this is the shape:
from the incision that is by the temple to the second incision; and scrape all the skin that is between the two incisions all over the surface that is on the bone, then do likewise from the middle incision to the other second one, and then remove this spatula. then put into the first incision the instrument which is called "cultellary", and it is very sharp on one side, and on the other side it is smooth, not sharp, and this is its shape:
And place the cutting side towards the raw flesh of the skin, and the smooth side towards the bone, and put it in until it reaches the middle incision.
And cut all the vessels that descend from the head to the eyes until the incision is continuous to that which appears of the skin, and then likewise do in the middle incision to the other end;
and then draw out the blood equally, and wipe the place for the blood taken;
then put in each incision a tent of old cotton, and put on cloths moistened in wine and oil and vinegar, and guard against hot abscesses forming there;
and on the third day untie the ligature, and administer a great plenty of warm water there, then treat it with basilicon ointment with rose oil, and other treatments with which wounds are treated, until it is healed.
When someone has an acute catarrh habitually, and you see the eyes swollen and small, and the vision weakened, and the eyelids burned; and the hair falls out, and in the head there is intense pain, and the patient sneezes; then know by these symptoms that those materials and that catarrh do not come forth except from many veins, and the best cure for it is this.
And it is that you instruct the patient to raise his forehead, then make a large incision in the middle of the forehead, and another a little bit wide. And begin from the incision of the left temple to the right temple, and let the incision go to the bone; and keep your hand away from the nerves of the temples that move when eating;
and when the bone is uncovered, wipe away all the blood with a sponge, and then separate between the two lips of the incision and place old cotton and linen tents there; then bind over it cloths moistened in wine and oil, and beware of a hot abscess;
when it is removed, it is necessary that you rub the bone until flesh begins to grow there, then treat it with drying things, which cause flesh to grow.
In this manner: take two parts of wheat flour, and four parts of colophony, and make a plaster; and apply it to these wounds to cause flesh to grow everywhere.
Of the stopping up of the ears
Everything that falls into the ears is one of four things: either grains, or an animal, or a mine stone or something similar like iron; or seed, such as lentils, beans, peas; or a flowing substance such as water and vinegar and similar things.
When a stone or other kind of thing falls into the ear that does not adhere to the ear, nor grow in the ear, put the ear to the sun.
If you see the stone, then instill a little violet oil or oil of sesame, then proceed with extraction; and make him sneeze with hellebore, and plug his nostrils when the sneezing comes, and place pieces of cloth or wool around the ear; and hold the ear upwards.
Often, strength comes from this treatment;
and if strength does not come, then administer extraction with fine forceps, of which this is the form:
If it comes out with the forceps, that is good;
if not, then administer extraction with a fine hook of small curvature;
and if it does not come out by this, then make a chain of bronze and insert the head of the chain into the hole of the ear strongly, and stuff that which is around the chain with soft wax so that the wind cannot enter with the chain; then pull it out strongly, for very often it comes out as we have said;
and if it does not come out in this manner, then take birdlime, and put it on some instrument which is pointed for doing this, and put a bit of cotton around it; then press the birdlime onto the stone or whatever it may be, and pull it out.
And if it does not come out by all these things that we have said, then hasten to cut open the ear before a hot abscess and spasm come;
and the manner of the incision is that you first bleed the patient from the cephalic vein, and draw out blood according to the measure of his strength, then make the patient sit between your hands and turn his ear upwards, and make a small incision at the root of the ear, in the fatty tissue or the dependent part; and let the incision be like a crescent moon, until you reach the stone, then remove it as best you can, and suck it out quickly with your mouth;
and treat it until it is healed.
And if it is a grain that is inside and it swells, administer extraction;
and if it cannot come out, administer a thin spatula according to this form: and administer incision of that grain.
But do not do this when you think the grain is moist because of the moisture of the ear, until you have made many pieces;
then extract it with fine tweezers and a suction device, as we have said, so that the extraction is easy.
Then, for water that falls into the ear, the patient should first use a sneezing powder, and fill the ear with old cotton. And let him lie on that same ear where the water is. If it jumps out because of this, it is good.
If not, take many stones, according to the length of your middle finger, and light, and warm them a little in the fire; and let the patient put one in the opening of his ear, and jump on it with his feet on the other side, and strike with another stone on the stone which is in the ear; and do not cease doing this with stone after stone until all the water comes out, and thus it all jumps out;
and if you wish, take a reed, and put one end in the ear, and take the other end and hold it to the fire until the reed is mostly burned;
then do the same with other reeds until all the water comes out, as we have said with the stone.
In the extraction of the creature, if it is small, like a flea and similar things, cure it as we have said in the division;
but if it is large enough to be felt, then administer extraction with tweezers; and this is the easiest thing to remove that is in the ear.
In the extraction of worms embedded in the ears, when you treat it as we have said in the division and in the treatment of distillations, and the treatment does not help, then you must look at the ear in the sun: if any worms appear, pull them out with fine tweezers, and if they do not appear, take the candle of which this is the form:
And let it be narrow below and wide above. And put the most slender end into the ear according to the amount the patient can tolerate, then suck strongly on the whole candle; do this often until all the worms come out.
And if they do not obey and come out, stuff around the candle with cotton as I have said for the stone;
and if they do not come out as we have said, administer distillations which the ancients have proven in killing worms, and you will find them in the treatise on distillations;
and distill your oils and your medicines into the ear with this instrument, of which here is the form as you see: And let it be of silver or bronze, narrow below with one small hole, and open above for distilling;
and to press the distillation inside, a well-made bronze instrument for this, and if you wish take a razor and wrap cotton neatly around the point; then pour your oil or your juice, and what you wish of your medicines, into the tube, and the tube should be in the ear;
then put the razor inside with the cotton, and press your hand moderately until the oil is distilled or completely in the ear; and the patient should feel it inside, and let the distillation be slightly heated over the fire before it is distilled into the ear; and ensure that it is not too cold, for the medicine would not be as good.
Of the deafness of the ears
Some children are born without any opening in their ears;
and this same thing happens to adults through the blockage of a wound, or of flesh growing inside the ear, and this blockage sometimes occurs deep in the ear, so that one cannot see it;
and sometimes the opening is slightly obstructed, and one can see it well.
That which occurs deep within, so that one cannot see it, is difficult to cure in many cases, and for that which is visible you must put the patient's ear in the sun; and look inside: if you see the obstruction clearly, then work with all this spatula of which here is the form:
And let it be sharp and cutting in front and behind, completely smooth, so that it does not injure the ear;
if the obstruction is of raw flesh or in the body of the ear, then hold it with fine tweezers, and cut it lightly, until that flesh is entirely removed.
And if the obstruction is deep in the ear, then take a thin, light razor and heat it slightly in the fire, then put it into the body of the ear.
If you feel the obstruction from which the patient feels pain in hearing, pierce it lightly, and take care that you do not injure the nerves of the ear;
then put into the ear a tent according to the width of the opening, and moisten it in Egyptian ointment. Do this for a few days until the wound is healed, or take a tent and moisten it in rose water, and sprinkle on powdered vitriol;
And if you see the ear swollen, then you must remove the tent and insert another tent moistened in cerate made from rose oil and wax, until the swelling is gone; then cure it until it is healed.
And if a flow of blood comes, dip a sponge and cloths in cold water, and put it on the ear, and use other cures which stop the flow of blood that are in the treatment of distillations.
These styes that come in the eyelids when they are moist and dry, then you must stretch them with forceps and pincers, and cut them with a spatula from their roots; then put crushed vitriol on the place.
And if blood flows, cauterize it with a fine lenticular cautery, and cauterization after incision is better;
and often they return, when something remains of their roots; and when they are cauterized by fire, those roots are burned and do not return.
of the hail Many times, things appear in the eyelids that resemble hail in form and hardness, and because of this, this disease is called "hail", and is a gathering of thick moisture above and below the eyelid; the procedure is as follows:
the procedure is as follows: observe if the hail moves from one side to the other, and this is easy to know;
then make an incision, then lightly scrape each part, then grasp it with tweezers, and cut it.
if you cannot cut it without piercing the eyelid a little, it does not harm the patient;
and if the wound is large, bring it together with a suture, and treat it until it is healed;
and if it is small, do not use force, for ointments restore it quickly and generate flesh.
And if the hailstone descends into the inside of the ear towards the upper part, invert the eyelid, and extract the hailstone with tweezers, and cut and press on one side and the other;
and if the eyelid is loosened by the incision, it does no harm;
and when the hailstone is cut, bathe the eye with salt water, and treat the place with what generates flesh until the patient is healed.
of the fat of the eyes Exinach is a grease which is generated in the webs of the eyelids, and this happens more to children than to any other people, and it grieves their eyes greatly, and they get cataracts in the mornings, and cannot look at the sunlight because the tears rush to their eyes;
and therefore they lie on their faces constantly, and sleep thus, and their eyelids under their eyebrows are moist,  because the swelling and the appearance are covered by the exinach which appears in the eye. And when you press the place with your fingers and feel the exinach between them.
And the manner of the work is that the patient puts his head in your lap;
and then take a linen cloth, and prepare a tent in the manner of a circle according to the quantity that contains the exinach of each part, then put it on him; and press with your fingers on one side and the other, so that the exinach is gathered in the middle of the circle;
then cut in the middle of the moisture with a sharp spatula a slit of the width, and let it not be larger than the wound that one makes in bleeding a vein;
and cut the skin deeply until you reach the exinach; and in several ways exinach comes from the fissure, according to the form of a piece of white fat.
Extract it then in one piece with a piece of lint between your fingers on the outside, and turn your hand to right and left until it is separated;
and be careful not to insert into the fissure, that you do not come with the whole spatula up to the eye, that you do not injure it.
And if the exinach does not appear at the beginning of the fissure, slightly enlarge the fissure a little until it appears;
then extract it as we have said, then moisten cloths in vinegar and water, and apply to the place, and bind with bandages.
And there are some men who grind celery and apply it to corrupt that moisture which has remained.
Then treat it until it is healed.
And if a hot abscess appears in the place, treat it with soothing plasters until it is healed.
of the hairs of the testicles When hairs grow in the testicles that are in addition to the natural ones, and are overgrown, they harm the eyes and cause various diseases such as habitual tears and softening of the testicles and albuginea, to the point that it causes destruction of the eyes;
and the cure is according to four methods: either by cautery with fire, or by a sharp medicine according to what is said before in the chapter on cautery, and it is done either by incision and suture or by cautery, according to what I will say.
It is necessary that you place the head of the patient in your lap, then turn the testicle towards your left hand;
if it is turned, that is good; if not, then put a needle with thread on it; and let this be near the edge of the testicle where the hairs grow near those hairs, and pull the thread over the whole testicle, and turn it towards the smoother side;
then cut in the part under the testicle, under the joined hairs, with the whole sharp spatula, from the greater lachrymal gland down to the smaller;
then pull out the thread, and place under the testicle a small tent of cotton and cloth, then mark on the testicle a figure of a wedge, like a myrtle leaf, and however it is necessary that the figure be according to the quantity that you wish to elevate the testicle which is divided for all.
And if there is someone who needs a great quantity of the testicle to be cut according to how much the testicle is softened;
then cut with the whole spatula on the two lines that you have marked, and begin from the greater lachrymal gland down to the smaller; and let one of the incisions be near the natural hairs in the thickness of a root, then put the onion in one of the two angles of the heart, then peel it completely;
then join the two lips with a suture of a needle with a very fine woolen thread, and wipe away the blood, and cut off the superfluity of the threads above the two eyebrows with some sticky substance, if you wish to do so;
and if not, then do not worry about it, then leave the suture and the threads for three or four days;
then treat the wound without suture with drying and constricting substances, for the skin shrinks at the closing of the wound and its joining, but the suture is better (as the ancients say), and this is work without fear; and there is another method:
and there is another method: and it is that you cut the skin in a shape like a myrtle leaf, as we have described, in three separate incisions according to the form which is here:
then cut what is above with small, equal forces according to the form which is here:
And if you are not able to hold the forceps, and the thing is not even, then take a needle with one thread, and put it into the shape; and put one other thread near the large tear, and the second thread near the small one, and bring together the threads evenly between your fingers;
then lift your hand evenly, and lift all the skin on which you have cut, as we have described, then bring together the two lips of the wound by suture, and treat it until it is healed;
and if an abscess comes to your incision, then soothe it with cerate and similar soothing ointments;
and sometimes it happens that the hairs of the wound are inverted:
then you must use what we have said about the incision;
but the suture in one and the other is more skillful.
The treatment of cankers is according to this form: and it is that you turn the wound and cut into it according to what I have said, and then make two cankers by art, and two fine threads as long as the wound and as wide as the spatula is; and cut at the two ends of the two parts where you hold the threads;
then join one and the other subtly over what protrudes from the wound of the eye, and tightly pull the two cankers of the two parts; and leave it thus for some days, and the skin which is constricted will die and wither and rot, until it falls off by itself.
If it delays, then cut it with force, then treat it until it is healed;
and when the wound is sealed, and the membrane is raised, and the hairs no longer prick;
and this is the form of the two cankers that you will make according to this figure, and according to this quantity of length and width:
the procedure is such that you take a fine needle, and thread it with a soft and fine silk thread; then join the ends and tie them together subtly, and let the length of the threads be one palm long;
then arrange in the chase another fine silk thread briefly, and tie the ends of the thread;
then let the patient put his head in your lap;
and let it be near the sun so that the work is clear, for it is a subtle and delicate work, then put the needle with the chase into the root of the added hair, and make it pierce the skin quickly until you pull it out above the natural hair;
then pull the hair up to the chase, and put that hair into the chase, if there is one or two or three or more;
then withdraw your hand until the hairs come out with the chase into the skin with the natural hair.
And if the chase is pulled and the hairs do not come out with it, then pull the chase downwards with all the thread that you have ordered there, until the chase comes out of the hole above and you see it with the vision of your eye;
then pull the chase and the thread, and close the eye and leave it closed for two or three days, until the hair heals in its place and the flesh grows over it;
and if the hair is small, accompany it with a long hair from the natural hair, and let it be raised with that one or leave it, until it is lengthened and then remove it.
of the corruption of the eye When this illness which is called "aleacrati" or corruption comes in the eye, there are two kinds:
one natural, and the other unnatural.
And it happens through a sudden wound, or cut, or cautery, and through similar things.
And the manner of working on it is that you split that suture, and separate the lips of it, and put inside linen tents, and bind it until it is healed;
and it is not necessary that you use in its treatment things that dry and constrict. For if you do this, the illness returns worse than the first;
but work with softening things, such as fenugreek; and rose water or mallow and linseed cooked, and diachylon ointment melted in some oil, and wrap a tent, and cure it with this.
And the treasure of your cure is that you take care that it does not heal according to the form it was before;
and these works that we have spoken of are nothing but treatments for this illness, that it may not return according to the form it was before.
This illness which is below, which is truly called "axacrati", and is natural and accidental.
The accident comes from a wound and a fissure and a cautery and similar things;
and the method of working on it is that you take a needle, in which there is a double thread, and pierce it into the flesh, and make it pierce from the left tear duct to the right, so that the threads come out at two ends of the flesh;
then stretch the flesh above with the needle, and cut it to the width of a spatula. And if the shape of the paper returns as it should, it is good;
if not, take a rasp and put it in the fissure, and turn the paper, and make two fissures on the sides inside the paper;
and let the ends of the two fissures be at the two angles of the incision that you have cut, and make an angle so that when they are joined, the shape is like the shape of a letter which is called "I griesche";
then remove that flesh, according to the quantity that its sides are sharp beneath, of that which follows the paper, then join the two separated parts, and sew them with a wool thread;
then cure it with what we have said of mollifying medicines, and of tents, until it is healed.
And if the illness comes from a fissure or suture or cautery, then it is necessary that you make a full fissure under the hairs of the papers, and according to what is above; then separate between the two lips with a tent, as I have said;
then separate between the two lips with a tent, as I have said; and one must do the work according to the form of the illness, for it is very diverse in form, and the wise master prepares a device with all his power how he makes the figure return to its natural form;
and the patient himself, according to what is necessary for work and instruments in several dispositions.
When this adhesion happens to many men in such a way that the papule above is adhered to the white of the eye, and cannot move or perform its natural functions, then you must put the point of a razor under the papule, and lift it up;
and stretch it with pincers, until you cut what is attached with a fine spatula, which is neither too sharp nor too blunt, so that the patient cannot suffer that the too sharp spatula might injure the eye;
and let your incision, with which you remove that adhesion, be light, so that the papule returns to its natural form;
and when that adhesion is healed, they sometimes use salt water in the eye, and then wash it with fresh water, and with milk;
then place between the papule and the eye a linen tent, and place on the eye wool soaked in egg white; and after the third day use milk and soothing things until it is healed.
Know that the nail is according to two manners: it is nervous and similar to hard tissue, and another which is not nervous, but is similar to congealed white moisture, so that when one touches it with iron and thinks to pierce it with pincers, one cannot;
and both forms begin towards the lacrimal gland, and grow little by little until it covers the whole sight and all the light and movement of the eye.
And the manner of the incision is that the patient puts his head in your lap, then opens his eyes; and lift the eyelid with your hand, then grasp the nail with small double-pronged forceps, and extend it upwards; then take a needle, and put on it a horsehair, or cowhair, or oxhair, and a strong thread; and double the point of the needle a little and stick it into the nail, and pierce it with the whole needle, and tie the nail with a thread and extend it upwards, and scrape with the hair the side of the nail that follows the pupil and the silk on the hair to the head, then cut the remainder at the root of the lacrimal gland with the subtle spatula and small forceps, and leave the natural flesh in the lacrimal gland, so that the body of the tears does not come through the incision habitually;
and sometimes the nail is extended only with the hook and the thread, as we have said; then scrape it with a soft spatula of which this is the form:
And take care that the spatula does not touch the fleshy membrane and break it, and that the pupil is not pierced;
and after the incision, put a little crushed onion and a decoction made from litharge into the eye, and leave it until the next day; then treat it with what is necessary until it is healed.
And if the nail is not sinewy, and you cannot insert the needle, and the hooks cannot enter, this type of nail is often cured with medicines;
and grow as I have recounted in the division, and if you see it should be cut, then open the patient's eye, and take a light, slightly sharp spatula according to this shape: And shave the nail very finely, and if you see that it diminishes little by little and the scraping hastens it, then instill into the eye from your mouth a decoction made from litharge and red decoction and crushed onion, and plug the eye until the next day;
If nothing is contrary in the eye, such as a hot abscess, then leave it, and first cure the hot abscess until it is healed, then recommence the work as before, until it is healed.
then recommence the same work according to this same method, until it is completely removed.
And if the appearance of the flesh of the tear duct harms the eye greatly, then lift it with a hook, and cut a part of it and not all, so that the tear duct is not damaged;
then instill into the eye a red decoction which is made from litharge.
In the eyes of some men, sometimes red flesh grows and covers the pupil and encroaches upon the eyelids and turns them outward, and it resembles a pomegranate rose;
and the procedure is that the patient puts his head in your lap, then opens his eyes, and you pull all that flesh with hooks suitable for this, and hold it firmly;
then cut the first flesh, and keep cutting with a razor to the end, and be careful that you do not injure the eye during the procedure;
and let the incision be with the spatula which we have mentioned in the incision of the nail and with the small forceps with which one removes the sebum, as the figure after this chapter demonstrates;
and when the incision is complete and all the flesh removed, apply crushed dog's eye or distil red vitriol and similar corrosive medicines into it, and place cotton over the eye with egg white, so that it is protected from a hot abscess;
and if anything remains, and the hot blood overwhelms you, and you fear a hot abscess, leave the eye and treat the abscess with things that soothe hot abscesses;
then return to your work until it is healed, and do so whenever flesh is added to the eye in this way.
However, you must always ease the treatment of each weak eye by natural means; and by accidental means, with iron instruments;
and do not put your hand to any of these operations until you see that the limb can tolerate that operation.
Styes are red veins that are covered over the eye, and they take away its function and weaken the eye always.
It is necessary then first that you look if the eye, in which the sty is, is strong, and there is no other disease except the sty; then treat it in this manner:
instruct the patient to put his head in your lap, then open those veins with the lancet according to your wisdom, and let the lancets be very sharp according to this form:
And let there be two lancets by degrees in one body according to this form:
then that one treats forcefully those veins subtly, and draws out the blood little by little, until you see remove those veins from the eye;
and be careful that you do not injure the eye with the points of the spatulas, and do this work at midday before the sun, and be very fervent in your work so that you cut only those veins;
and when you have done this, then instill in the eye green and red copperas to corrupt that which remains of the pus.
And if you are not able to collect all the pus at that time, then make a plaster on the eye of things that soothe the pain of the eyes, and leave it for some days until the pain is relieved and the hot abscess is healed, then begin again in this manner which is above until it is healed;
and this is the method of treatment:
The Arabs call a fistula "arissati":
When you treat it with cautery and with burning medicine according to what I have said before, and it is not healed, then it is necessary that you lance the abscess, where it should mature, and draw out all the moisture that is there, until the bone is uncovered.
And when the bone is uncovered, and you see the corruption and the blackness, then scrape it with the instrument of which this is the form;
and it is called "rough head," and it should be made of iron, with one rounded end, and sharpened like a file as it is in the present form:
And place it on the area of the corrupt bone, then turn it between your fingers, and press your hand a little until you know that this corruption is removed;
and do this several times, then restore the area with drying medicines.
If the place is healed, and flesh grows there, and the body of the bone is healed, and remains so for forty days, and it does not renew and is not abscessed, and no bad accident occurs, know that it is healed;
if not, there is no other method than to return the fistula to the opening of the nose according to this form: and that is that you uncover the bone a second time with iron, and with sharp medicines, and when it is uncovered then take a drill according to this form, and let the head of iron be three-angled, and let the shaft be tapered to the head as you see here:
then place it on the bone near the tear duct, and move your hand away from the eye a little, then turn the drill completely until it pierces the bone and the patient feels it because the wind will come out if he holds his hand over his nose;
and then restore the place with dry medicines, as I have taught you, and when the flesh grows and the place hardens, then the matter goes to the nose; it is easier for the patient.
When the eyes are completely open and there is no obstruction or narrowing of the nose, you must bind the patient;
then cleanse it, then apply cupping glasses to the temples without wounding to draw out the humors, then apply to the eye a liniment made of acacia, aloe, incense, and sarcocol, and then bind the eye, and apply the plaster with bandages and cloths;
and the manner of the cloths is that you take sufficiently soft cloths, and fold each one into four, and then place one over the other according to the quantity that the eye needs;
then bind it over with a strong bandage, and repeat the cupping to draw out the humors without wounding;
then remove the cupping glasses and leave the eye bound day and night, and if the liniment softens, you must bind it very tightly;
then remove the liniment after a day and night, and if you see the eye recovering, it is good;
if not; then repeat the plaster and cloths and the binding and the cupping glasses until it is healed.
Of the rupture of a webbed membrane When disruption comes in the webbed membrane, then it opens, and there comes forth from the papules like grains of resin, and it is frightening to see;
then if you see it split, the procedure is such that you insert a needle into the root of the lower part up to the upper part, then insert another needle where there is a double thread from the part of the tear; and make it pierce, and leave the first needle according to the arrangement;
then cut the place of the double thread and tie a part of the membrane around, and pull it well, then remove the needle and place on the eye wool moistened in egg white;
and leave it until the thread falls with the membrane, then treat the eye with comforting things until the wound is healed;
and sometimes the wound is constrained by the membrane on each side by a circle of cloth, until it is healed.
And if the eye gives great appearance, pierce it with a fine spatula that goes to the bottom of the eye, and let the albuminous moisture run and the eye descend, and enter immediately;
then remove it until it is healed.
This illness which is called "alcunnati" is nothing but a swelling that is gathered in the eye, resembling descending water, and it is not water;
and the manner of the operation is that you make the patient sit on a prepared and straight seat, then take the head between your hands on two sides, and move it until you see the swelling come to the top to your eyes; then let it be pierced, and let the light not descend and be obscured, and let the patient see things as he was accustomed;
and if it does not descend below, know that it is water, and if the descent of the swelling is not prepared as we have said.
then make the patient sit between your hands, then take a fine spatula and make an incision on the corneal membrane a little, by the continuation of the conjunctiva with the corneal membrane and the cornea, until the swelling comes out;
and when it is out, then distill into the eye warm water mixed with honey, or water in which fenugreek is boiled and honey, then let it be treated with another treatment until it is healed.
of the waters of the eye We have already described the appearances of the waters in the division, and what is necessary to pierce them; then operate according to the health.
It is necessary that you make the patient sit between your crossed hands, away from the light of the sun, and bind the healthy eye and squeeze it very tightly;
then place the paper of the eye in your left hand if the eye is left, or in your right hand if the eye is right;
then take in your right hand, if the eye is left, the instrument which is called "almagda", or in your left hand, if the eye is right;
then place the point of the instrument next to the cornea by the thickness of a hair in that white of the eye at the part of the smaller tear duct, then push the instrument which is called "almagda" skillfully, and turn your hand until it pierces the white of the eye, and feel that the almagda reaches the empty thing;
and it is necessary that the measure of the almagda pathway be at the depth of the space which is from the pupil to the end of the blackness; and that is the cornea of the eye;
then you will see the bone in that membrane because of the clarity of the corneal tissue, and then put the instrument to the place where the water is, then press it out under one pathway after another.
if the water descends immediately, the patient sees in front of him and the instrument in his eye.
Afterwards, rest a little, and if the water rises the second time, put force with the instrument, and when it is inserted inside and it does not rise, then extract the almagda gently by turning your hand little by little;
and then put back in the water a little rock salt, and lift from there the eye inside. Then place on top of the eye tampons or wool moistened in rose oil and egg white, and bind with the healthy eye.
We, and those who are of our time, put on crushed cumin with egg white.
And if the almagda cannot enter the eye because of its hardness, for there are such men who have very hard eyes, then it is necessary that you take the instrument which is called "alberit", of which here is the form:
And pierce then only the conjunctiva, and do not go too deep, but make a subtle opening, then put in the almagda, as we have said;
and at the completion of the work, prepare for the patient a suitable sleeping place, in which he sleeps on his back in a dark place;
and let him be free from all movement, and let him take light foods, and let him not move his head neither to the right nor to the left, and let him be bandaged according to his condition until the third day;
then unbind him in that same dark room, and test his sight, and make him see some things, and then put the bandage back on until the seventh day;
and it is not necessary that you do this at the time of treatment or immediately after the incision, but it is necessary that you delay this, because the water rises quickly.
if a hot abscess comes, that you unbind the eye before the seventh day, and treat it with that which soothes the abscess;
and when it is calmed, then unbind the sight and put on his face a little cap to cover it for some days, and let him always be in that dark room.
And then let him go out of the house little by little, and return to his affairs;
and know that no disciple should interfere in this case. And one came to us who was from Iraq, who told us that in his country they made almond paste, from which one sucks the water, but still I never saw any in our land, nor did I ever read of it in the books of the ancients; and perhaps it is a new thing.
And these are the likenesses of the forms of almond paste, so that those who do not know them may see them;
and let them be of bronze properly: And let their heads be of this same subtlety, and the last in three sharp angles.
Sometimes various added flesh growths arise on the nose, of which some resemble scorpions with many feet;
and there are some where there is ingrained flesh of a livid color, and there is soft flesh of good color. In that then of these fleshes which is soft, and not ingrained, it is necessary that you cause the patient to sit between your hands against the sun;
In that then of these fleshes which is soft, and not ingrained, it is necessary that you cause the patient to sit between your hands against the sun; and open his nostrils, and throw the hook at those fleshes, and pull them out; then cut what you can hold with a thin, sharp spatula on one side, until you know that that flesh is all removed.
And if anything remains that cannot be cut, open it entirely with subtle instruments lightly, so that nothing remains; and if pus overcomes you, or a hot abscess, dry it as is necessary;
and if it is a malignant abscess, hurry and cauterize it until the blood is stopped and all the flesh is removed, then pour in either vinegar and water or wine. If the nose works, and moisture comes down to the palate, know that he is healed;
and if moisture does not flow as it should, know that there is dead flesh on the bone above, which the instruments cannot reach to cut:
then you must put in a slightly thick linen thread, knotted at both ends, and have between each knot the space of a finger or less; and let the patient put the end of the thread in his nose as much as possible, and pull it gently until it comes through the nose into the mouth;
and many times children do this in schools, and it is an easy thing for one who wants to do it;
then hold the end that comes through the nose in one hand, and the other end that comes through the mouth in the other hand, and pull them slowly, following the knots that are on the thread.
Do this until you see that the knots have corrupted that flesh, then pull out the thread, wipe away the blood, and moisten the thread in Egyptian ointment, and put it back in the nose as before;
do this three days or more, until the ointment corrodes all that remains of the flesh;
and then put a lead cannula in the nose for some days until it is healed, and if it needs drying medicines, then use them;
and this is the form of the instrument for cleansing the head, with which one distills oils and medicines into the nose:
And let it be of silver or bronze, similar to an open lamp, like a cannula, and the conduit as well;
and if you wish, make a closed cannula, and let the instrument be full to cleanse the head;
and it has a handle at the top for holding it when one heats the oil or any liquid.
of the flesh above the nose
Many times a disease called "telul" arises on the top of the nose, and it grows and becomes large constantly, until it is a sight to behold;
and for this reason it is necessary that you cut it at the beginning, and remove it entirely, then put on the place the cautery or burning medicine;
and if one delays cutting it until it is large, then take care if it is hard, of a livid color, and insensitive:
then do not touch it with iron, for it is a cancerous abscess, for when one cuts it sometimes, great harm comes to the patient;
and if the abscess is soft to the touch, not livid in color, and you see that it can be entirely cut, then empty the patient and cut it without fear, and treat the place with drying and astringent things.
Know that when a solution of continuity occurs in one of these cartilaginous works, it benefits little, except in some men.
It is necessary then, when this happens to someone, to see if the wound is fresh with all its blood; and then bring the two lips together in a suture, then treat it until it is healed;
and if the lips are already separated on one side and the other, it is necessary that you scrape all the parts of their heart until they bleed, then bring the two lips together in a suture, and bind it, and sprinkle on it dragon's blood powder, and ground incense; and place over the powders a piece of strong plaster or another soldering plaster, and leave it until it falls off by itself, then treat it with ointment until it is healed.
The manner of the suture is that you bring together the solution: or with needles, as we have said in the suture of the belly; or with thread, as I have shown you.
of abscesses of the lips
In many men there occurs within the lips a hard abscess, similar to vesicles, both smaller and larger;
then you must turn back the lips, and make an incision on each side, and take it with forceps and cut it in each part;
then fill the place after the incision with crushed vitriol, until the blood is stopped;
and then wash it with vinegar, and treat the place with dry things until it is healed.
Often there grows on the gums added flesh, which the ancients call "albulus";
then you must hold it with tongs, and cut it at its root, and let the pus or blood flow;
then put on the place crushed vitriol, or other astringent and desiccative powders;
and if that flesh returns after the incision, and this often happens, then cut it a second time, and cauterize it: it will not return after the cautery;
Sometimes, gathered at the roots of the teeth, inside the mouth between the gums, are ugly and rough growths; and sometimes the teeth are black and yellow and worm-eaten, until the corruption reaches the gums, and the teeth are foul-smelling;
then you must make the patient sit between your hands, and his head should be on your lap, and clean the teeth or growths until nothing remains; and so do with the blackness and greenness, and the yellowness and other stains, until they are cleansed;
and if one removes what is there at the first scraping, it is good; if not, then begin again on the second and third day, until you have cleaned everything;
and know that the teeth require various forms of instruments for cleaning, according to what the work shows, because the scrapers with which one cleans outside the teeth have other forms than those with which one cleans between the teeth; and these and other forms should be prepared and ready with you.
It is necessary when you treat a toothache that you delay extraction as long as you can, for one should not do this; for it is a very serious matter until one has no excuse for extraction.
Then when the patient is compelled to extraction, it is necessary that you are certain of the aching tooth. Many times the pain deceives the patient, and he thinks it is in a healthy tooth, and has the good tooth extracted; and yet the pain does not depart because of that, until the bad one is extracted, for we have already seen this happen to these wise men;
and when you are certain of the aching tooth, you must scrape around the tooth with a very strong spatula to protect the gum on all sides;
then move it with your fingers or with fine forceps little by little, until it is well loosened, then firmly grasp it with the forceps; and let the patient's head be firmly between your knees, and hold it well so that it does not move.
Afterwards, extract the tooth straight without breaking it, and if it does not come out easily, take one of these instruments and insert it inside from each side lightly, and move it as you did before.
And if the tooth is perforated and decayed, you must fill it with lint where the holes are; and extract it carefully with forceps, so that it does not break during extraction;
and it is necessary to work very wisely around the gum to loosen the tooth.
And I warn you well that you do not break it, and that a part remains, and the patient suffers from the malice of the root greater pains than the first.
And beware that you do not do as the ignorant surgeons do, who through their haste and boldness sometimes break the tooth, and do not achieve what we have recounted;
but sometimes cause great illness through the roots that remain, or because of the tooth that they break, as we have often seen;
and when the tooth is extracted, wash the place with wine or vinegar and salt;
and if bleeding occurs, which often happens, apply crushed vitriol to the place;
and if that does not work, cauterize it.
The shapes of the instruments with which one first moves the teeth should have long points and thick handles, so that they do not bend when you extract the tooth;
and these are the shapes: And let them be of thick members so that they do not bend when pulling, and let them be of well-made iron, and let them be toothed to hold the tooth.
of the root of the teeth When the root remains during extraction, it is necessary that you put cotton soaked in butter on the place for one or two days, until the place is softened, then put there the tongs which are called "algefri", of which the head resembles a bird's beak;
and let them be made inside like a file and this is the shape:
And if the roots do not want to come out with all these tongs, it is necessary that you uncover the flesh all around the root, and put there the instrument which is called "althali", that is to say, a lever, of which this is the shape:
And let it be strong and thick so that it does not break, and if the root comes out by this, it is good;
if not, help yourself with all the instruments, of which the shapes come afterwards:
And one helps oneself with this instrument which has two prongs, of which this is the shape: and of other instruments which are in front in the extraction of teeth, and of this instrument which resembles large tongs, of which this is the shape:
And let this instrument be strong so that it cannot break, and know that there are many instruments for teeth; and also other instruments, which are not counted;
and the wise and subtle master finds his own instrument, according to what his work and the illness show him, for there are such illnesses where the ancients did not teach any instrument because of the diversity of cases; and if one breaks a piece of the cart or other bones, or if it rots, then he seeks among the instruments which are necessary, that I have told you about, and helps himself with the gestures, of which this is the shape:
And let them be thick and well-holding to hold the bone, so that it does not escape, but that one can hold and remove it;
and then restore the place with suitable medicines, and if there is rot in the bone, and it is small, then scrape it with this instrument:
When the teeth appear not according to their natural position, and the form is ugly, and especially in virgin women, then you must know if the tooth is behind the tooth, and is not in the right place, and one cannot file or grind it:
then extract it; and if it is loose along with the tooth, then take this instrument of which here is the form, and it is similar to a small beak, and let it be of iron, sharp at the tip:
And cut it little by little in several days because of the hardness of the tooth, and so that you do not move the others, and if it is apparent that one can file it, then file it with such a file as here is the form:
and it is like the file with which needles are made;
and file the tooth little by little in several days lightly, so that it does not move until it falls;
then smooth it at the end with some scraper, and if the tooth is too sharp and it injures the tongue, then it is necessary to file the roughness until it is even, so that it does not injure the tongue nor impair speech.
When the front teeth loosen, either by percussion or by falling, and the patient cannot press on what he eats without their falling out, and you have treated them with astringent medicines, and that is of no use;
then it is necessary to bind them with a gold thread, for silver thread turns green and rots, but gold never changes;
and let the thread be medium, neither too thick nor too thin, according to the amount of space between the teeth;
and if you wish to straighten the teeth, take the thread and put it doubled between two healthy teeth, then place the ends between the loose teeth, if there is one or more, until you skillfully reach a healthy tooth on the other side; then begin the wrapping again to the point where you started, and pull your hand subtly and skillfully, so that it does not move;
and let your binding be at the root of the tooth so that it cannot escape.
Then cut the ends of the thread with pliers, and join them, and put them between the healthy tooth, and place it so that it does not injure the tongue;
and then leave it thus tightened as long as it can remain, and if it loosens, or the thread breaks, tighten it with another thread;
it will remain and serve thus its entire time, and this is the form of the teeth and the figure of the arrangement of the two healthy teeth, and the two moved, as you see:
And when the tooth falls out, one puts it back in its place, again and again, as we have said;
and let no one meddle who is not wise and patient, and sometimes one makes the form of a tooth from ox bone, and one puts it in the place where it is lacking, and one tightens it as we have said, and it remains and serves thus a long time.
Sometimes this ligament comes from under the tongue, or is natural, that one is born thus; or by accident of a healed wound;
and the procedure is such that you open the patient's mouth, and hold his head in your lap, and lift his tongue;
then cut the nervous ligament broadly, so that the tongue is released from its confinement, and if there is hardness or a knot, and this is from a sudden wound, then insert the hook and cut broadly that ligament;
and be careful that the incision is not too deep, because of the artery which is underneath;
and when you have done this, wash the area with rosewater and vinegar, or with cold water, then place a linen tent under the tongue;
and let the patient dress it each night, so that the wound cannot close.
And if excessive bleeding occurs, apply crushed vitriol to the area; and if the bleeding overcomes you, cauterize it with the lentiginous cautery, which is good for this; then treat it with other treatments until it is healed,
and if you see it of a livid color or black or hard, so that the patient does not feel it, do not touch it, for it is cancer;
and if it is inclined to become cancerous, and there is moisture, apply onion juice, and gently scrape it with a fine spatula, and clean it from one side and the other; and if the bleeding overcomes you in your work, apply crushed vitriol until it is stopped, then return to your work until you remove all the pus;
then clean the place with vinegar and salt, and treat it with other treatments until it is healed.
of the abscesses of the throat Sometimes there come in the throat swellings which are called "goitre", and they are properly called the two tonsils, and when you treat them, as we have said in the division, and they are not healed, take heed:
if this abscess is hard, small, and of a dark color, do not touch it with iron.
And if it is red and the root is large, do not touch it with iron, also because of the flow of blood; but leave it until it is ripe, and then you will open it, or it will break by itself;
and if it is of a round white color, and the root is thin, have the instrument ready for cutting, but first see if the hot abscess is settled and calmed.
Then have the patient sit in front of the sun, and his head should be on your lap, and he opens his mouth and the surgeon takes him by the hands, and presses the tongue down with the instrument, of which this is the form;
and let it be of silver or of thin bronze like a knife:
When you press the tongue with this instrument, and you see the abscess, then take the hook and insert it into the tonsil, and pull it upwards as much as you can;
and pull out some of the membranes with it, then cut it with the instrument, of which this is the form, that resembles a pair of shears; and however the blades are curved, and one against the other, and they are very sharp, and it is made of Indian iron or bronze:
And if you do not have this instrument at hand, then cut it with pliers, of which this is the form: And let it be sharp on one side, and blunt on the other;
and when you have cut one of the tonsils, cut the other in the same manner, and after the incision let the patient gargle with warm water, and water and vinegar, and if bleeding occurs, let the patient gargle with water in which pomegranate bark has been boiled, or myrtle leaves, and similar things, until the bleeding is stopped; then treat it until it is healed;
and sometimes other abscesses grow in the throat besides the two tonsils, then cut them in the same way as the two tonsils.
And I treated a woman with an abscess that had grown in her throat, that is to say, a small abscess;
and it had almost completely closed off her throat, so that the woman could not breathe because the passage was blocked, and could neither eat nor drink, and would have died if she had remained so for one or two days.
And the abscess had risen so much that it had forced out two veins through the two nostrils.
I hastened then at once, and inserted a hook into one, then pulled it forcefully, and pulled out a large portion of pus;
then I did likewise in the other nostril, and I opened her mouth and pressed her tongue;
afterwards I inserted the hook into the abscess, and cut a part of it, and only a little blood came out; and thus the passage of the woman's throat was cleared, and she immediately began to drink water and then wine, and I did not cease to cut that abscess for a long time;
and the abscess grew again, and filled the place that I had emptied, until it was very large again;
then I bandaged it and cauterized it inside the throat: thus it remained without growing;
and I departed from those parts, and I do not know what God did with her after me.
of the grape
When catarrh descends to the uvula, and it is swollen and long, it is called "perpendicular";
and if it is thick and round below, it is called "uvula".
When it is treated as we have said in the division, and the treatment does not help, and you see that the heat of the abscess is subsided, and it is thin, then you must cut it;
and that which is round, gathered and not long; and it is bloody or of a dark color or black, then you should avoid cutting it. For there is great peril to the patient.
Therefore, when you see it, according to the manner that I have said, of its whiteness and its length, you should make the patient sit before the sun, and press the tongue with the instrument of which we have made mention before; then insert the hook into the uvula, and draw it downwards, and cut it with one of the two instruments that I have mentioned in the incision of the two almonds.
And you must not cut more than the superfluity which is beyond the natural limit;
for if you cut more, you injure the voice and speech;
and after the incision, use what we have said in the incision of the two almonds, and treat it until it is healed.
And if the patient is afraid of cutting, then you must use a device for cauterization so that he feels no fear.
And the manner of the cautery is sharply sharp. And it is that the patient puts his head in your lap, and then you press his tongue with the instrument that we have mentioned in the chapter on cautery, and cauterize with heated, clear water, so that it is neither too thick nor too thin; and apply the end of this instrument, of which this is the form:
And it has at the head a cavity where one puts the medicine, like the bowl of a spoon, and puts the instrument with all the medicine on the uvula;
and the patient lies on his side, so that the saliva and mucus flow from his mouth away from the medicine, so that it does not descend to the throat and injure it;
then hold your hand with all the medicine and press it on the uvula, the amount of half an hour, until you see it numb and the burning from the medicine is calmed;
and if you wish, take cotton and wrap it around some instrument, and moisten the cotton in the medicine, and put the instrument with all the cotton into the mouth above, until the cotton rests on the uvula;
and do this often, until the cautery is complete, then let it dry, and it falls off after four or five days.
And if you need to restart the cautery with the medicine, then restart it, and after the cautery wipe around the uvula with cotton dipped in butter, and clean what is around the medicine;
and let it be sprinkled with cold water, and be treated with gargles until it is healed.
This treatment is safer than incision, or cautery;
if it is treated by fumigation in this manner, take calamint and hyssop and origanum and rue and chamomile and verbena and similar herbs, and mix all or some of them in a pot, and add vinegar, and bring to a boil;
and the pot should be well sealed with strong clay, and inside the pot there should be a perforated instrument made in this way: And let it be of silver or bronze, and let one of the ends be inserted into the patient's mouth so that the vapor rises to the uvula through the throat, until the uvula is cauterized;
afterwards repeat it often, until the uvula is dry, and take care not to do this at the beginning of the onset of the hot abscess, for several things happen there; and do not do this except at the decline of a hot abscess.
And if this instrument is not present, take a tube and put inside the end an eggshell, so that the patient's mouth does not get too hot; for the eggshell does not allow the vapor to harm the mouth, and this is a good treatment and also healthful.
Often a bone or fish spine, or something else, gets stuck in the throat;
then you must pull out what you can see, and press the tongue with the instrument towards the sun, so that you can see the thing move;
and what you cannot see and is lodged in the throat, you must make the patient vomit before the food is digested in the stomach; by chance the thing will come out backwards through vomiting;
or the patient swallows a piece of sponge, or a piece of navel, or a lettuce root, or a piece of dry bread; and tie a thread to the sponge, and then swallow it; and when it comes to the place, it will stick, and then pull it out strongly;
and if it does not come out by what we have said, take a lead instrument according to this form:
And let the instrument be curved at the head so that it can more easily enter the throat, and have the head raised high; and beware that you do not touch the epiglottis, lest a cough comes to him, nor push the bone inside;
and it is better that the patient puts in the instrument, because he knows better where the thing is stuck; then push it down, or pull it out with the instrument equally, until it is out.
of the leech in the throat
Sometimes the leech is medicated, as I have said in the division, by the cure of medicines; and when that does not help, then look in the patient's throat at the sun, then press his tongue with the instrument that I have told you.
And if you see the leech, pull it out with a small hook, or with fine forceps that are good for this.
And if that does not work, take a horsehair, and put it into the patient's throat, then put a hot iron at the end of the hair, and do this often. And let the patient drink water every day.
Then take a full glass of cold water, and open the mouth, and pour it in without swallowing, and move it with your hand often; and as soon as the leech feels the water, it falls off.
And if it does not fall off as we have said, fumigate the patient with asafoetida, with the instrument that I mentioned in the fumigation of the uvula;
do this many times, for it will fall off without delay.
And the manner of fumigation is that you take a pot in which there are live coals, and let the pot be covered with a lid pierced in the middle, and in that hole let the head of the instrument be;
then throw in your fumigation, and the patient puts the head of the tube in his mouth, and closes his mouth, so that the smoke does not escape, but comes down to the leech;
and the leech will fall off immediately, and if it does not fall off, repeat the fumigation many times;
and let the patient suffer thirst, and eat salty and sharp things, and drink no water;
and then it will be necessary for it to come out strongly through this method.
And the form of the instrument with which one draws out the leech is, when one can see it, similar to curved tongs to better enter the throat; and it has a resemblance to the beak of a bird, and has a roughness like a file, so that what it grasps, it cannot let go;
Many kinds of abscesses there are, according to what is remembered hereinafter of one and another in this book, and they differ in perforation and in size;
and this is in two ways, of which one is in its very appearance, and of what it contains of moisture.
And the second manner is because of the places where they are in the body.
For abscesses of the head are different from those of the fundament, and abscesses of fleshy places are different from those which come in joints, and each has its own judgment in the treatment.
And there are abscesses which one should not pierce, until the swelling is ripe according to its completion;
and there are some which it is necessary to pierce when they are raw, and do not ripen according to their completion, such as abscesses which are near joints.
For when an abscess comes near the joints, and it is left until it is rotten around, perhaps the ligaments and nerves of the joint are corrupted, which is the cause of contraction in that limb.
Or if the abscess is near a principal member, and you delay perforation until it is ripe, it will harm the principal member;
or if it is near the fundament, one pierces it before it is ripe;
and it is not fitting that you pierce a raw abscess without completed digestion, except that which is near the fundament, lest it rot deeply, and become elongated within, and a fistula develop there; and cannot heal in a long time.
And it is necessary that you know the time of the perforation of the abscess which is ripe according to its completion, and that is when the pain is lessened, and the departure of the fever, and the lessening of the pain and redness, and of the throbbing and sharpening of the head of the abscess, and the other signs;
and it is necessary that you make the perforation in the most dependent part of the abscess, and where it appears softened;
and let the perforation be along the length of the body, and if the abscess is in the hands or feet, or in joints and near nerves and arteries, and in all similar places where there is no swelling. In those that swell, along that limb.
And when the abscess is in a fleshy place, it is better that you leave the perforation until it is confirmed in completed digestion, as we have said.
For if you pierce it before that, the body of the venom will be spread from it, and it is full of much filth; and perhaps the lips and depths of it will harden.
And if there is any abscess that is pierced along the width of the body, according to what the limb needs.
And it is necessary that you make small holes in small abscesses; and in large abscesses, large holes, and many slits according to the likeness of the size of the abscess;
and there are such abscesses where it is necessary to reach the core, and cut; when it has become like a rag, and is mortified, it is necessary to do as is done with buboes:
and there are some that are split into three angles, and there are some that are cut like a myrtle leaf, like abscesses of the armpits;
and there are some where one makes a round cut, and other cuts and similar incisions.
Those which have no head, like a soft superficial abscess, it is necessary that you pierce it completely;
and when the abscess is large, and it has collected much pus, and you pierce it, do not draw out all the pus at that time, but draw out a part; then plug the abscess until the next day, then draw out something again; do this many times gradually, until all the pus comes out;
especially if the patient is of weak constitution, or a pregnant woman, or small child, or an old decrepit man. For the spirit sometimes leaps with the exit of the pus, so that by chance the patient dies, and you are not to blame.
Therefore approach this chapter with great caution, and when you have pierced your abscess, cleanse the wound, and see if the wound of the abscess is small; and if it is a full incision, apply linen or old cotton tents; and if it is a large abscess, and there are many openings, you must put a tent in each so that they meet one another;
and if you have cut a part of the skin in the abscess, and you have shaved it around, you must fill it with old cotton or linen cloth shavings without moisture, and bind it until the third day;
then remove it, and treat it with ointment until it is healed.
And if bleeding occurs in your work, apply cold water and vinegar, and wet a cloth, and apply it to the bleeding area many times.
And if the bleeding persists, apply treatment and remedies, and the powders that I have mentioned in other places in this book, and if it is winter, and the place where the abscess is is very sensitive, you must apply tents and cloths moistened in hot wine and oil;
and if it is summer, and the place is fleshy, you must apply cloths moistened in water and oil, or in cold wine and oil, until the third day, as we have said;
and then open the abscess and clean it and treat it, as is necessary, until it is healed.
And this must be known universally in the treatment of abscesses:
I have told you how one should proceed with the treatment of abscesses, and here is the chapter.
In the head come small abscesses, and there are kinds that are in clusters, like the yolk of a hen's egg, and there are many similar ones.
There are fatty ones and those in which there is moisture, like pus;
and there are some that are hard and stony to the touch, and there is no doubt if the artery does not act against it.
And the method of incision is that you probe with the instrument called an "introducer", of which the form comes later, what thing it contains.
For if it contains moisture, then you lance it lengthwise from above.
And when the moisture is emptied, scrape it without leaving anything of the skin that contains that moisture, because it returns again when one leaves anything there;
then dip cotton in Egyptian ointment, if it is present; if not, in water and salt, and apply it to the wound, and leave it until the next day; and this will remove what remains from the night.
And then renew the cotton, as before, the second day, and the third, until you know well that nothing remains from the night;
then treat the wound with suitable ointment, until it is healed.
And if the abscess contains thick matter, cut it lengthwise according to this form; and put in your ointments, and scrape it on all sides, and apply all your treatment to draw out the matter where it lies;
and if the artery opposes you, then do what I have told you afterwards.
And do the same with an abscess if it is stony, and of the cutting and cleaning as I have told you.
And the incision on a stony and moist abscess is easier, for they contain little blood. And if there are some of these abscesses on the head where there is no moisture, and of these were the abscesses that I cut on the head of an old woman;
and I found the abscess like a hard, rough, and white stone, and could not break it; and if one had struck it, one would have made a wound as much as from a stone.
In other abscesses appearing on the head, except those that come at the heads of children and at the roots of the ears, the opening should always be at the lowest point, so that the pus may escape;
and treat them as is necessary.
Often these abscesses occur in the neck, and under the armpits, and in the groin, and sometimes they appear elsewhere on the body, and are many, and are intertwined with one another.
And each scrofula is properly within its own sheath, like the nut and the abscess of the head, as we have said; and the appearances of these scrofulas are many.
and the appearances of these scrofulas are many. There are some that contain moisture, and there are malignant ones that do not wish to obey health.
In that one then which you see of good disposition to the touch, and is similar in color to the body, and moves on every side and is not close to the nerves of the neck or to the artery or to the vein, and is not deep;
then you must cut it open from above, and scrape it from each part, and extend the two lips of the wound with hooks, if you need to, as we have said in abscesses of the head;
and remove it little by little, and be sure that you do not cut the nerve or the vein, and let the spatula not be sharp or cutting, lest the hand slip, and do not go too far forward, lest you cut what you should not.
And if you cut the vein or the artery, and this does not allow you to work, then put in the wound powdered vitriol, or some powders that staunch blood, and bind the wound; and leave it until the abscess is subsided, and the wound is softened, and begins to fester.
And when the blood is stanched, then return to your work, until you have completed it;
then seek with your index finger if there remain any small scrophulae, then cut and cleanse them.
And if there is a large vein at the root of the scrophula, it is not necessary that you cut that scrophula at its root, but tie it with a strong double thread, and let it fall off by itself, without harm;
then fill the wound with old cotton dipped in Egyptian ointment, then dress it.
And if you cut the whole scrophula, it is necessary that you bring together the two lips of the wound, and sew them immediately, since there is no superfluity remaining because of the size of the scrophula. then it is necessary that you attend to cutting its root, and pulling it out, and sew it as we have said.
then it is necessary that you attend to cutting its root, and pulling it out, and sew it as we have said. Those scrofulas which contain superfluity, pierce them where they appear ripe;
and pierce it like the one previously mentioned, downwards, then apply tents with ointment and similar things, so that it consumes what remains of the corruption; and when the wound is well cleansed, then treat it with flesh-generating ointment, until it is healed.
The ancients said and spoke of the incision of the throat; but I never saw anyone in our land who did it, and this is a written account of their words.
For those who have quinsy, it is necessary that the fissure of the throat which is called "epiglottis" be avoided; and that no help be given by this, because all the veins and the lung of the patient are near to those who have a hot abscess in the mouth, or in the throat, or in the two tonsils.
When the illness is in the channel of the lung, it is necessary to cut the epiglottis to avoid the death that comes from strangulation.
Therefore, when we want to cut the epiglottis, we should cut it below three or four circles a small slit across, between the two circles or by the amount of the slit of the syfac, not in the cartilage;
and that place is suitable for the section of the epiglottis because there is no flesh there, and the vessels are far from there.
And if the master is fearful, it is necessary that he stretch the skin of the throat with the whole finger, then cut the skin until he reaches the channel; and avoid the blood vessels, if you see anything, and then cut the syfac, as we have said;
and it is demonstrated by the section of the phlegm of the channel which leaps forth through the place which is broken, and by the defect of the voice;
and leave the wound open a while.
And when the hour has passed of which one doubts the strangulation, bring together the two lips of the wound of the throat, and sew it all alone without the cartilage;
then administer medicines which cause flesh to grow, until it is healed.
Albucasis says that one should not do this until the throat is completely swollen, and the patient is judged to be dying, and the breath fails him. Then one cuts the epiglottis because the patient cannot breathe, and he breathes through the wound, and thus is saved from death;
and for this reason the ancients ordered to leave the wound open until the malignancy of the disease has passed, and it passes in three or four days. And then they ordered to sew up the wound and treat it, until it was healed;
and I will tell you what I saw. I saw that a young woman took a knife and stuck it in her throat, and cut part of the channels of the lung;
and I was called to treat her, and found her as good as dead.
I uncovered the wound, and found the blood that had flowed from it, and I knew well that she had not cut a vein or duct other than the throat, and the wind came out through the wound.
I hastened, and sewed up the wound, and treated it until it was healed;
and nothing happened to the young woman except that she was hoarse, and later returned to her normal state;
therefore I say that in the cutting of the epiglottis there is no need for fear.
This abscess is called a "hernia of the throat," and is a large abscess the color of a yellow-greenish bruise, and is very common in women;
and is of two kinds: natural, and accidental;
or natural has no remedy.
And the accidental is of two kinds, of which one resembles a lipoma, and the other kind resembles an abscess which comes from an artery; and if there is fear, and it is not necessary to operate with hot irons except in that which is small, and prove and search with the whole probe: if you find it like a nut of fat, and it is not attached to any vein, cut it, as one cuts nuts, and pull it out with its covering, if there is any; and search well everywhere, and treat it as is necessary, until it is perfectly healed.
There are many kinds of lipomas, of which I will describe all the similarities;
And now it is necessary that I explain all the differences between a lipoma and a boil.
I say that a boil is accompanied by heat and fever, until the boiling is over, and the suppuration is complete; then the fever and heat subside.
With a lipoma there is neither heat, nor fever, nor pain, and it contains a cyst, which is its own sac and is the same color as the body, and begins like a small swelling, and becomes large;
and they are of two appearances, either greasy, or moist, and many are in color as I have said in the division.
It is necessary, when you come to the treatment of a lipoma, that you first examine and explore it with the instrument called an "introducer," according to what its form will show in the chapter that follows.
And the manner of the examination of abscesses is that you take the most moist place that you find in the abscess, and turn your fingers little by little, until you know that the instrument has pierced the core, then let it be according to the size of the abscess;
then withdraw the introducer, and observe what comes out.
If running moisture escapes, note its color, and treat it as I have said of other abscesses;
and if after the introducer no moisture comes, know that it is fatty, then incise it in a cross, and take it with forceps, and lightly scrape it on each side and guard the tunic in which it lies so that you extract it whole with the lipoma;
and if you cannot extract it whole, then extract it in pieces so that nothing remains.
For if anything remains, the lipoma will return many times;
and if a little remains, and the blood bothers you, fill the wound with some sharp corrosive powders, and cleanse the wound, and apply soothing things to a hot abscess, and treat it with other treatments until it is healed;
and if the lipoma is large, sew the two lips of the wound, and treat it with that which engenders flesh.
and if the throbbing vein is bothersome or otherwise bothers you and hurry and fill the place with powdered vitriol, and leave it there two or three days, until the wound festers, and the boiling of the blood subsides; then return to cut away what remains of the lipoma.
Here are the forms of the instruments used, and they are of three kinds: large, medium, and small;
and there are three square ones which are called "albaret", and one which is called "breb", and there are three kinds of them: large, medium, and small, for encircling the abscesses of fistulas;
and they are like the needles with which one sews sores, and are of yellow brass, or of iron, or of silver, and those which are yellow are worth more, and are more proven with black lead for encircling the curves of fistulas;
and there are three kinds: large, medium, and small, according to the size of the width of the openings.
The shapes of the hooks are very similar, as you see here:
and there are hooks which have two curves of three kinds also;
and there are hooks which have three curves, and are also of three kinds;
and there are hooks which have two curves, and hooks of only one curve, and are of three kinds;
and all these are necessary in their place.
The heads of those with which one cuts are sharp, and there are some which do not cut except on one side, with which one scrapes the skin, so that one does not cut the vein or the nerve;
and of these introducers, the blades are enclosed in handles, so that the patient does not feel them at the opening of the abscesses;
and they are of three kinds: large, small, and medium, as you see;
and one uses them only in fleshy places, such as legs, and arms, and breasts, and in the groins, and in similar places;
and sometimes one makes another small instrument, similar to a fig-pecker, according to this form, with which one stanches blood: and it is sometimes placed in the place which is healthy to cut veins, and arteries, and sometimes round according to this large form:
Sometimes the breasts of some men swell when they begin to be corrupted, until they resemble women's breasts;
and they remain ugly and swollen, and whoever wants to cure them, must lance them according to this form from this line b. down to g.: then remove the fat, and fill the wound with flesh-generating medicine, then join the two lips of the wound with sutures, and treat it until it is healed;
and if the breast hangs down, and is softened by its size as happens to women, then split it in two pieces above, through two similar incisions; so that one is held to the other at the end of each, so that the larger line contains the smaller according to this form, from this line b. to line g.; then remove the skin which is between the two lips, and remove the fat, and apply there what we have said of sutures and powders, and what is necessary in the treatment, until it is healed;
and if it is not healed, or the incision is not completely made, because the patient does not want to rest, or because of the flow of blood, then you must fill the wound with cotton soaked in corrosive ointment; and leave it until it consumes the remainder and the fat, then treat it until it is healed.
These abscesses that come under the armpits are kinds of hard scrofula where there are ribs, and some contain moisture.
Those then which contain moisture must be cut according to this form, from line b to line g: And when all the matter that is in the abscess is emptied, fill the wound with old cotton, and leave it until the next day, then remove all the cotton, and treat with an ointment suitable for this until it is healed.
And if the abscess is similar to scrofula, incise it as we have said in the incisions of scrofula, and if the wound produces matter, apply cautery as we have said before.
When the artery is broken, and the skin above is sewn, an abscess often forms, and the same happens with an inflamed vein and abscess;
and one recognizes it as being due to the artery if the abscess is long and deep; and when you feel it with your fingers, you feel a throbbing;
and when it is due to the vein, it is round and apparent on the outside;
and it is foolish to cut this abscess, especially when it is under the armpits and in the groin and neck and in many other places, and is very large. Therefore, one must avoid the treatment with iron, and the one that is on the head must also be avoided, and in the one that is swollen from an artery, one incises above the skin lengthwise;
then make an incision with the incisions, and nicely separate the artery from the tissues, until it is uncovered;
then place a needle underneath, and make it pierce to the other side, and draw the artery out with a double thread in two places, according to what I have taught you in the extraction of the two arteries that are in the temples;
then puncture the area between the two threads with a lancet until the blood that is there comes out, and the abscess is emptied;
then administer the treatment that engenders pus, until the threads rot; then treat that with a suitable ointment, until it is healed;
and if the abscess is because of the incision of the vein, then you must hold in your hand what you can of the abscess along with the skin, then place the needle under the area that you hold in your hand, and make it pierce, and there should be a double thread, so that you pull it out on the other side; then tie the abscess, as I have told you, with the thread on one of the two sides to the two ends of the thread;
and if you doubt that the threads will come out, then insert another needle with a thread under the whole abscess at the incision of the first needle, and pull the threads in four places;
then cut the abscess so that the excess comes out, then cut the excess from the heart and leave that which is tied;
then put on a cloth moistened in wine and oil, then administer treatments of tents and ointments until it is healed.
Just as abscesses come in the artery and in the vein, abscesses come to the nerves when they are injured, or by too much work, and similar things.
And this happens more often in the shoulders and fingers and in all places where there are joints, and it is a serious abscess, and its color resembles the color of the body, and is in many ways without pain;
and when one presses it hard, the patient feels pain, and it is not deep in the body, but under the skin;
and moves well in all directions, and does not go forward or backward, or down or up, and that which is in the joints should not be cut with iron: by chance, a contraction would result; and that which is on the head or forehead, cut the skin with a spatula.
and that which is on the head or forehead, cut the skin with a spatula. If the abscess is small, hold it with tongs, and cut it at its root;
and if it is large, suspend it with a hook, and scrape it, then remove it and close the wound with sutures, and treat it until it is healed.
Sometimes it happens in the belly and nowhere else, and it is a disease which is called "fungus" because of its resemblance to them, and the root is subtle, and the head large;
and there are small ones and very large ones;
and I saw a man who had two in his belly which were more similar to fungi than anything else, and there was no difference, and they were white, and had a thin root, and were split open, and moisture constantly flowed from them.
I cut them and found one weighing eighteen ounces, and the other six and a half, and the procedure in the incision is that you observe whether the patient is moist, and the color of the little member is white and moist and of subtle root; if you cut it with a wide spatula, and have the fire cautery at hand.
if you cut it with a wide spatula, and have the fire cautery at hand. For in cutting, there often comes too great a flow of blood, and if the blood overcomes you, then hasten to cauterize;
and if you see the patient frightened and fearful of the incision of the iron, take a well-made lead thread, and tie the little member with it as we have said, and leave it for two days;
and then restrain it, and do not cease to tighten the lead thread until it cuts the little member, and it falls off by itself without effort;
and if the roots are large, there is fear in cutting, especially for the belly, but you can well cut half, then cauterize it so that it does not return;
then cure the wound, and be careful not to cut the small growth which is of a pale color, poor sensation, and milky appearance.
For this is an infected abscess, and I will come to the treatment of cancer afterwards.
when the swelling comes forth If the appearance of the swelling comes from cauterization of a wound or fissure of a fistula, and is on the belly and some of the swellings come out, as happens in other ruptures, or of blood flowing from veins or arteries according to what is before, or from flatulence;
and if it is by the rupture of the fistula and by the exit of the bowel, then the color of the abscess is similar to the color of the body, and it is a light thing without pain, and shows diverse discharge. And if it is because of the exit of the intestine, then it is more diverse, and when one presses it with his fingers it retracts, and then returns, and perhaps it is scarred, and increases greatly at the entrance of the bath and by hard work.
And if it is due to moisture, it is a light thing, and it appears well when you press it with your hand, and it does not constrain.
And if it is due to blood, then the abscess appears large and hard by these signs, and is fixed according to a quantity; and if it is due to flatulence, it is soft to the touch, and the procedure is that you look whether the appearance is due to blood from the artery, or from the vein, or flatulence.
and if it is due to flatulence, it is soft to the touch, and the procedure is that you look whether the appearance is due to blood from the artery, or from the vein, or flatulence. Then you must leave the cure. For there is doubt and fear, as I told you in the chapter on abscesses, concerning the artery and the vein.
And if the appearance is due to the intestine or bowel, then you must instruct the patient to hold his breath, and lie completely straight, then bleed from the anus all around the buttocks; then instruct him to lie often between your hands, then go around the area you have marked with the spatula, then extend half of the abscess upwards with the large hook; then tie it around with a strong thread, or a cord of strong silk firmly, and let the knot of the ligature be secure;
then open the half of the abscess extended above the ligature, and put your index finger there, and search for the intestine; if you find it caught by the ligature, then untie it, and put the intestine outside the belly;
and if you find the bowel, then take it with the hook, and cut off the excess;
and if the artery or vein opposes you, then go gently around, then return to your work and take two needles, and put two strong threads on them, and put the two needles around what you have done in a cross that you made pierced;
then bind the abscess in four places over the needles, and if you wish, remove the needles, and leave the place until it festers, and the dead flesh falls away by itself; or you cut it when it is thin and rotten, then treat it as is necessary, and heal the abscess as we have said;
or you cut it when it is thin and rotten, then treat it as is necessary, and heal the abscess as we have said; and extract the blood or moisture that you find, then treat the place as is necessary, and sew up the place.
Of the canker We have described in the division the types of canker, and how one should work on it with medicines, and how one should avoid iron treatment;
and we say that canker grows in the marrow, and there is great caution in its treatment, and the ancients said that when a canker is in a place where it can be excised, such as a canker that is in the breasts, and in the thigh, and in similar places, one should completely remove it when it is at the beginning;
nor did anyone ever heal one before me.
And the procedure, when it is in a place where it can be removed, as we have said, is that you purge the patient of black bile some times;
then make him bleed if he has manifest repletion, then prepare the patient in a good place to perform the procedure;
then spread your ointments on the ulcer, and the hair from all sides, and the bone from all sides without leaving anything;
and let the blood flow completely, and wipe the area well with your hand or something else, and if the flow of blood hinders you from incising the artery or vein, cauterize it until the blood is stopped; then treat it with other treatment until it is healed.
Of dropsy We have, I said in the division, the appearances of dropsy, and in what manner the gathering of water is made, and the signs of each appearance, and the cure which is made by medicines, and that which is cured by iron:
and one should not touch with iron in these two appearances: that is to say, tympanites and anasarca, for it is a mortal thing;
then when you treat this appearance of dropsy which is called "eclites" with medicines, and the cure does not benefit, then see if the patient is weak, or if he has another illness than dropsy, such as fever and looseness of the bowels and similar things; then do not touch it with iron, for there is doubt;
and if you see the patient of strong virtue, and he has no other illness than dropsy alone, and he is neither too young nor too old, then you should work thus: lift the patient straight up on your hands, and administer pressure to the belly, pushing the water to the lowest part of the chest, then take the spatumile espinous according to this form: And let it be sharp on two sides. pointed, and yet not so penetrating that it can reach the intestine when inserted, and cannot injure it;
then look if the dropsy is swollen towards the intestines: if so, you must make an incision above the groin, three fingers directly below the groin; and if the dropsy is due to liver disease, let your incision be to the left of the groin, three fingers;
and if it is due to the spleen, let it be on the right, and it is not necessary that the patient lie on the incision lest the superfluities run to that weak place;
then pierce all the skin with the instrument, and push it in, and lift your hand with the whole spatula between the skin and the peritoneum, as in flaying, to the size of a fingernail or thereabouts;
then pierce the peritoneum until the spatula reaches the empty space, and that is the location of the water, then draw it out, and insert this instrument of which here is the form: And it is similar to a thin silver tube, and is made of bronze or light brass, and has at the lower part one small hole; and on one side, three holes; and two on the other side, and one on the other;
and the head is shaped like a pen, and this is the form of the incision with which the scribes cut the pen:
at the top is the handle, so that when the instrument comes to the water, it immediately descends on the instrument;
empty then half or a third part, for if you empty more than is necessary at that time, perhaps the patient will die from the dissolution of his vital spirit, or he will fall into a faint, or he will approach death;
but empty according to the quantity of his strength, and according to what the dispositions of the patient's strength signify, and his pulse;
then draw out the instrument and retain the water, and it is retained immediately by the heart which stops the opening which is on the surface, of which I have spoken, that you pierce in this manner;
then resume the instrument the next day, if you see the patient enduring it, and draw out a small quantity of water;
do this for a few days, and be careful not to continue until there remains only a little water.
And if you doubt about the patient, and you leave too much water, then treat him with a hot poultice or warm sand, and by sweating a lot or bathing and in the sun, and let him abstain from drinking; and treat him with drying medicines until he is healed, and cauterize on the stomach and on the liver and on the spleen after the extraction of the water, as I have said before.
Sometimes children are born who have no opening in the penis, or the opening is small, or it is not in its proper place.
Then it is necessary that it be pierced immediately with a very fine spatula according to this form:
then place in the opening a small lead tube, and tie it and keep it thus for three or four days; and when he wants to urinate, let the tube be removed, and let him urinate, and then replace it;
and perhaps it is not necessary, for the urine that comes forth does not leave it closed.
For those whose opening is small, it is treated with the lead tube, as we have said, so it will widen.
Those who do not have the opening in its proper place are injured, for some are born who have the opening at the head of the penis, wherefore they cannot urinate forward unless they raise their penis upwards; and cannot reproduce because the matter cannot reach the sea, and this is a serious illness.
And the manner of the work is that the patient lies often on his back, then they straighten the head of the penis and cut it like the shaft of a feather, so that the opening falls in the middle, as it should;
and beware of the flow of blood which often comes there, and if it happens, staunch it with that which staunchs blood, and treat the wound until it is healed.
of the pustules of the penis Often these whitlows come on the penis, and it is an appearance of ugly flesh;
and there are malignant and non-malignant ones;
it is necessary that you take them with a thin needle, and cut and clean them all, then put on moistened cotton with Egyptian ointment; then treat it with diafinicon ointment until it is healed.
And if the whitlow is malignant, of a foul color and festering, it is necessary that you apply a cautery.
When you have cut it, and if the whitlow is on the penis, and part is inside the skin and part outside, it is necessary that you remove the whitlow which is inside first; and when it is healed, then treat the outside.
For when you treat it together, the penis is not assured that it will not be pierced, and blackness and corruption come to the penis and the testicle;
it is necessary to remove all that is black and corrupt, then apply a plaster of honey and flour made from the bark of pomegranates and vetches, then treat it with other treatments until it is healed.
And if bleeding occurs, apply the lunar cautery according to this method:
The cautery helps in two ways at once: that is to say, to the flow of blood, and to the corruption;
and if the head of the penis is corrupt and retracted, it is necessary that you insert into the urethra a lead tube, and the patient urinates through it;
and when the skin is tight around the head of the penis, which happens to those who have not been circumcised, or which happens due to a wound or abscess, then it is necessary that you scrape it with a sharp instrument, until the bonds are loosened, and the head of the penis is freed on all sides;
and if it is a serious matter to remove this, it is necessary that you scrape it with a spatula, a little from the head of the penis and the skin;
then carefully separate the two, and place a thin linen cloth moistened in cold water between them, so that it does not constrict again.
Circumcision is not a loosening of continuity like other wounds; however, when we perform this operation of our own will, and properly on children, it is necessary that we perform the best work, and the easiest for healing.
I say that the ancients did not speak of the circumcision of their children, for they do not use it in their law, and we have nothing but what we have acquired through experience.
For I have seen the greater part of the masters and surgeons who performed circumcision around I dal, and forcefully, and with a whole scalpel;
the heart fled because there are two membranes, and perhaps one cuts the upper one and the lower one remains. Now it must be cut, and the pain is doubled, and the cleaning which is of the I dal is not assured at the tip of the member;
and in the cleaning of the nail perhaps the iron slips, and the work is ruined, and many times they are born thus that they have no need of cleaning and I have seen it.
Of the cleaning which is done forcefully with the whole linen thread I have found the goodness of the experiment, for the forces cut just as well above as below.
For when you press your hand, you cut equally in one single time; but that the thread be well tight around the skin;
and the manner of the first operation is that you make the child believe, if he understands, that you are only tying the thread around the penis, and then you make him rejoice in every way that you can;
then make him stand straight between your hands, and hold the threads between your hands or under your feet so that the child does not see them, nor any of the instruments;
then put your hand to the penis and blow on the heart, and pull it upwards until the head of the penis is inside; then cleanse it well of the filth that has gathered there, then mark the place with a double thread, then tie it below, one little knot to another knot;
then cleanse it well of the filth that has gathered there, then mark the place with a double thread, then tie it below, one little knot to another knot; and hold it with two fingers for the second hour at the little finger and the index finger, and cut between the two knots, then quickly remove the heart and pull the head of the penis; then let the blood flow little by little, for that is the best; and put powder on, and on the powder a cloth glued with a cooked egg white thinned with rose water, cooked with good fresh rose oil, and leave it on until the next day, and cure it with other cures until it is healed.
The form of the forces for purification is this:
the two ends should be sharp and cutting, and the ends should be as large as the handle, equally:
The error of purification is when the heart within flees at the incision;
then you must stretch it with your fingernail, before the place forms an abscess;
and cut it evenly, and if you cannot hold it with your fingernail, then hold it with tongs, and then cut it.
And if three days pass, and what is under the penis is swollen, leave it until the swelling of the abscess is subsided, and then lightly scrape it;
cut it as much as you can move, and guard the part of the penis, it will not harm it at all.
Then cure the place of such a wound with powder, which we have described in the treatise on powders, and if one cuts too deeply, and it goes to the top, it will not harm;
then cure it, as we have said, until it is healed.
Of the retention of urine
The retention of urine is from the obstruction of a stone, or of congealed blood, or of bowel, or of dead flesh, or of similar things, which we have mentioned in the division;
and if the urine is not released, and you see that the retention is due to a stone which is in or near the neck of the bladder, then the patient must be bent over his knees; and his feet should be placed on his back, and he should extend his belly from the upper part of the back, and the patient should restrain his breath as much as he can; and then the neck of the bladder is constrained to express the stone upwards, because of which the urine is released;
and if it does not come, as we have said, and the patient feels great pain, then you must administer extraction with the instrument called a "syringe," of which this is the form:
and let it be of fine silver, light and hollow, like a bird's feather; and let the tube be a palm and a half long, and let it be slender at the end.
And the manner of the expulsion of urine is that you take a double thread, and tie to the end a bit of wool or cotton, and put the end of the thread inside the syringe;
and cut off the excess wool and put it up to the end of the syringe, then grease the syringe with oil or butter and egg white, and have the patient sit on a seat, and moisten the bladder and penis with warm oil and olive oil and warm water;
then gently insert the syringe into the penis, until it reaches the root of the penis, then bend the penis upwards towards the belly;
then push the syringe forward to the bladder, and the patient will feel it come to the empty space, and this is not done according to this order except because the passage where it goes is twisted;
then pull the thread with the wool little by little, and the urine follows the wool, then pull it out forcefully, and let the urine flow;
and repeat with the syringe until the bladder is emptied, and the patient is relieved.
When sores or blood appear in the bladder, or corruption gathers there, and you wish to instill waters and medicines, do so with the instrument called a "clepsydra," and this is its form:
It is closed, and has three openings: two on one side, and one on the other, as you see;
and the head through which the medicine passes should be such that it fits well in the penis without addition, so that one may draw out the moisture, and introduce it when necessary;
and when you wish to pour your medicines into the bladder, place the head of the instrument in the moisture, and draw on the tube which is inside;
you will draw the moisture into the instrument, and then forcefully push the tube back inside; then the moisture will enter, and will reach the bladder immediately, so that the patient will feel it;
and this is the form of the subtle clyster with which one clysterizes the bladder:
And it is of silver or tin, and the head is higher;
and below there is a receptacle where the liquid falls;
then take a sheep's bladder and put in it the liquid with which you wish to clysterize the bladder, then tie it firmly between the two receptacles with a good double thread, and slightly heat that liquid over the fire;
then put the head of the clyster into the penis, then press your hand on the bladder with all the liquid gently, until the patient feels that the liquid has reached the bladder;
and if you do not have a bladder, take a piece of parchment, and make a circle from it, and pierce it roundly all around; then put a strong thread into these holes, then assemble the circle as one assembles a bowl, and put inside what you wish of oil and liquid and water, and tie it to the instrument;
and do as you did with the bladder, pressing with your hand until the liquid reaches the bladder.
of the stone
We have already spoken in the division of the types of stones, and their extraction along with medicines;
and I have described the difference between the stone generated in the kidneys, and all the signs, and in which stone one should operate by cutting; and in the bladder, and in the penis;
and I will tell you clearly and briefly.
I say that the stone which is generated in the bladder happens more often to children, and it is a sign that the urine leaps from the bladder similar to water in its subtlety;
and sand appears, and the patient scratches his penis, and it swells many times, and then becomes stiff; and in many of these, the rectum leaks;
and the healing of children is easy until they are four years old, and it is very difficult in the elderly, and it is moderate in young adults, in those who are between youth and old age;
and the cure is easier for those who have a large stone than for those who have a small one.
And when we come to the treatment, it is first necessary to cleanse the patient with a clyster, to remove all the feces that are in the intestines. For it sometimes hinders the healing of the stone.
Then take the patient by the feet, and lift and move him around, so that the stone descends to the bottom of the bladder, and sometimes comes out of its high place;
then make him sit between your prepared hands, and his hands should be under his thighs, so that the bladder is completely inclined downwards;
then I search for and touch it inside;
If you feel the stone in the space, then hasten now to cut above the stone.
And if it does not fall entirely to the touch, moisten your index finger with oil from your left hand, if the patient is a child, or your middle finger, if the patient is a fully grown young man; and put it in his rectum, and search for the stone, and when you feel it with your finger, then guide it to the neck of the bladder;
then press down on your finger, and push it outside where you wish to cut.
And instruct the assistant to press the bladder with his hand, and instruct him to lift the testicles upwards with his right hand, and with his left hand remove the skin which is beneath the testicles in the area where the incision is made;
then insert the cutting spatula, of which this is the shape: And cut between that which is between the testicles and the rectum, not in the middle but to the left side of the scrotum;
and it should be directly on the stone, and your fingers should always be at the rectum, and let the incision be across so that it is wide on the outside, and narrow inside, according to the size of the stone, not too large;
by chance press with the finger which is at the rectum, so that it comes out without effort;
and know that there are stones with angles and edges: then it is difficult to remove;
and there are some which are smooth, similar to an acorn, and round, whose removal is easy.
For that one then which has angles and edges, make the incision larger;
and if it does not come out, then you must pull on it with forceps which are like a file at the head, to move the stone so that it does not escape; or you place underneath it a thin instrument curved at the head;
and if you cannot extract it thus, then widen the hole a little, and if the blood flows, then staunch it with vitriol;
and if there is more than one stone, then place the largest first at the neck of the bladder, then cut above, then pull it out, and the smaller ones afterwards if there are several.
And if it is very large, then it must be sawn, and a larger incision made. For two things happen to the patient: either he dies, or the urine constantly leaks because the place cannot heal;
but nevertheless strive to pull it out, or break it with tongs, until you pull it out in pieces;
and when you have completed your work, fill the wound with incense and aloes and dragon's blood, and bind it, and place on top a cloth moistened in oil and wine, or in oil and rose water and cold water, to soothe the hot abscess; then raise the patient up by his neck, and do not untie the bandage until the third day.
And when you untie it, irrigate the area very well with oil and water, then treat it with diafinicon ointment and basilicon ointment, until it is healed.
And if hot abscesses and corrosions appear in the wound, and blood clots in the bladder, and the urine is retained because of this, which is known in this way that it comes out with the urine: then put your finger in the wound, and extract that blood, for if it remains there, it will run to the bladder, and rot it;
then clean the wound with water, vinegar, and salt, and help it in every way that you know, until it is healed;
and it is necessary that every time you treat it, you bind the two thighs together, and apply the medicines to the area.
And if the stone is small, and it is in the urethra, and lodged inside, and the urine cannot come out; then treat it as I said before, that you cut it many times, and one is excused from the incision by this treatment. I have already proven this so.
Take an iron drill according to this shape and let it be with three angles fixed in a firebrand:
then take a thread and tie it around the penis below the stone, so that it cannot return to the bladder;
then insert the drill into the penis lightly, until it reaches the stone; and turn the drill with your hand in the stone little by little, until you can pierce the stone on the other side;
then the urine will come immediately, then press your hand on what remains of the stone that is inside the penis. Then it is immediately broken, and jumps out with the urine, and the patient is healed;
and if you cannot do this because of something that prevents it, then tie a thread under the stone and another above, then cut the penis towards the stone between the two threads, then pull it out, and untie the thread, and clean the congealed blood that is in the wound; and treat it until it is healed.
of the stone of women
It happens that a stone is generated in women, and if it happens sometimes, the cure is difficult, and is forbidden for three things:
one is that perhaps the woman is a virgin;
and the second is that one cannot find a well-knowing woman who reveals herself to the physicians, especially when she is chaste.
And the third reason is that perhaps one cannot find a woman well-skilled in this art nearby;
and the fourth reason is that the stone of the woman is deeper than the stone of the man, wherefore a deeper incision is necessary, and there is great fear. And if necessity demands it, then you must take a well-knowing midwife, and it is difficult to find one, and if you do not find one, seek at least a clever, chaste physician;
and present to her a wise woman skilled in the lives of women, or a woman who knows a part of the art, and instruct her to do what you instruct her concerning the examination of the stone; and look very carefully if the woman is a virgin:
and look very carefully if the woman is a virgin: then she must insert her finger into the rectum and search for the stone;
and if she finds it, she should press it down with her finger, and instruct her to put her finger into the vagina of the patient, and press her left hand firmly on the bladder.
If she finds it, she must move it gradually from the entrance of the bladder downwards, until it reaches the root of the thigh;
then cut above the stone at the root of the thigh towards the middle of the vagina, where it is usually situated, and feel for the stone in that area; and do not move her finger above or below the stone, and let the first incision be small;
and do not move her finger above or below the stone, and let the first incision be small; then insert the probe into the incision; if you feel the stone, enlarge the wound until the stone can come out, and know that there are many kinds of stones:
that is to say, small and large, rough and smooth, long and round, and which have roots.
so know the similarities to know the outcome.
And if the blood overcomes you, put crushed vitriol on the spot, and hold it for an hour until the bleeding stops;
then return to your work, until the stone is out, and have the instruments that I told you about in the extraction of stones from men to help you in your work;
and if the blood overcomes you, and it is from the artery that is cut, put the powder on the spot and bind it tightly with tents and bandages, and do not restart this, and leave the stone and do not remove it, lest by chance the patient die; then treat the wound.
And when the heat of the blood is subsided, and the place is dried, then return to your work, until the stone is removed.
Watery hernia is nothing else than a collection of moisture or white humors, which is below the covering of the testicles, that contains the egg;
and it is called "syfac," and sometimes it is properly in the membrane of the egg, so that one thinks that it is another egg; and that is the skin of the testicle between the white humor that we have mentioned;
and this happens rarely. And the generation of this hernia is from weakness that comes to the testicles, and this matter is spread.
And sometimes it comes from a blow to the testicles, and this moisture has many colors: or it is a color tending towards jaundice, or it is without redness, or black, or watery white, and this happens more;
and these are the signs to know this gathering, for if it is in the white sheath that we have mentioned, the abscess is round, a little long like the shape of an egg, and the testicle does not appear, because there is moisture all around.
And if there is moisture in the proper sheath, the abscess is round with a part of the testicle, and therefore it is thought that it is another egg;
and if the moisture is between the skin of the testicles and the white sheath, one feels it well;
then when you wish to know the color of the moisture, test it with the square probe, whose form is described above. According to what comes after the probe, then judge what is inside.
And when we treat it with iron, it is necessary that the patient be bled according to his ability and the repletion of his body;
then lay him on his back, on something a little high, and place many cloths under him;
then sit on his left, and instruct the assistant to sit on the right, and extend the rod to one of the two ribs of the heart of the testicles;
then take the lancet, and cut the skin of the testicles lengthwise to near the handle, and let your incision be straight, dividing the skin of the testicles to the white fascia, and flay it subtly according to your ability;
then pierce the fascia full of water with one wide hole, and draw out all the water, and then apply your ointments, and stretch the fascia upwards;
and do not touch the heart of the testicles, but only the fascia; cut all or the parts of it subtly in the same way, for if you do not cut it wisely, the water will return;
and if the testicle jumps out during your work, put it back in place when you have completed the work on the fascia;
then join the two lips of the heart of the testicles with a suture, then treat it like other wounds, until it is healed.
And if you find the testicle corrupted by another illness, then you must tie the vessels that are suspensory, to prevent the flow of blood;
then cut the testicle with all the suspensory ligament, and remove the testicle, and treat it as we have said.
And if pus is gathered in two parts together, know that these are two branches; then cut the other part as you did the first equally, then wipe the blood, and put in the wound wool soaked in rose oil;
then cut the other part as you did the first equally, then wipe the blood, and put in the wound wool soaked in rose oil; and put on top other wool soaked in wine and oil, and put over the two testicles, and put over it doubled cloths, and bind it all with a bandage which is according to this form:
Then take two cloths, and fill them with carded wool according to this likeness and let them be joined by sewing at the opening of the breeches, and one of the ends reach from the bottom to the back, and the other to the groin;
and the other two ends over the two groins, and let all the binding be gathered in the loop of the breeches;
and sometimes this remedy is medicated with cautery instead of an iron incision, and it is that you take a thin, knife-like cautery, and cut the skin of the testicles, and let it be heated as we have said, so that the white layer that contains the water is uncovered;
then take the cautery according to this form, and pierce that layer with the awl, and scrape it with this hot, thin cautery:
And cut it in every way that you can, until you have scraped it all away;
and be careful that the fire does not touch the testicle;
and know that this operation is safer; and more careful to prevent the flow of blood, and gentler than cutting operations;
and if anything goes wrong, whether abscess, bleeding, or something else, treat what is wrong, according to what has been said before.
And if the patient is fearful and unwilling to undergo this procedure because of its horror, then administer perforation, as I tell you, and it is that when you are certain by the signs we have described that watery humor is present, then have the patient sit on a raised seat; then pierce the abscess in the lower part with a spatula as wide as possible, and make the perforation along the length of the body;
and let the opening be wide, so that all the water may flow out freely;
then put cotton on the place, and bind it, and let the remaining water drain, then treat it until the wound is healed;
And if the white cloth does not allow the water to escape from the mouth of the wound, then you must insert a feather or the instrument with which one draws water from dropsical patients, the form of which is described above;
and slightly enlarge the wound, and know that the water returns and collects after six months or thereabouts, and when it is collected as before, and thus the patient will spend his days.
Know that in the incision of this branch there is fear in many situations, wherefore it seems to me that it is better to leave it;
and I will tell you the procedure and the characteristics of the abscess.
I say then that many abscesses come on the body, and especially to the testicles; and that is in many cases.
That is to say, by an excess of sharp and acrid humor, which is spread to the testicles, or from a blow;
and the color of the abscess is according to the color of the body; and it finds no pain, and is a serious abscess;
and perhaps it is a serious, dangerous, and purulent abscess, and of a livid color, and sometimes comes from an artery, or from a vein swelling.
When it is from an artery, it is known by the disposition of the abscess being hot when you press it with your fingers; and it is not necessary that you touch it.
That which is made from a vein swelling is known by its disposition to expression from the touch of the fingers, and one can well make an incision on this and on the other sores; and it is that you cut the heart of the testicles, then extend the testicle upwards, and draw the thread from the tunica albuginea, and free the suspensory ligament from all parts of the testicle.
If the testicle is already adhered to the surrounding flesh, then it is necessary that you draw the testicle and cut it;
and if it is attached to the tunica albuginea, or to that which is within the vessels, then it is necessary that you free all that membrane, and cut it roundly.
And if the origin of the flesh is in the posterior location, then it is necessary that you cut it all, and extract the testicle, as we have said.
And when your work is completed, fill the wound with wool moistened in rose oil and wine, then treat it with other treatments until it is healed.
This is an abscess enveloped in a covering similar to a bud, with softening of the testicles, and the patient moves with difficulty when he walks;
and the treatment of this illness is almost as frightening as the one before, and yet we will tell you how to treat it, according to what the ancients did.
It is necessary that you make the patient sit on a raised seat, then put the suspensory of the testicles down to your fingers, with all the vessels that are close to the penis, and let the master hold them, and stretch them greatly;
then cut with a sharp, wide spatula across the vessels, until they are uncovered, and then scrape on each side, as we have said in the extraction of the arteries that are in the temples;
then insert a needle with a double thread, and tie it at the first place where the pus has come, and tie it again at the other end; then cut them in the middle straight, according to the length of the body, and draw out the corrupted humors;
then treat the wound like the others where a bowel is injured, so that no vessel is cut that nourishes one of the testicles;
for by this no harm comes, and if pus comes to all the vessels, it is necessary to draw out the testicles with all the vessels; so that the testicle does not lose its nourishment because of the incision of the vessels, and dries up and cannot be helped.
The occurrence of this hernia is by the section that occurs in the syfac (synovial membrane), or the stretching on the abdomen in the groin area, wherefore the intestines descend from that rupture to one of the testicles;
and this rupture is either of the syfac (synovial membrane), or of the stretching of it, and these two manners come from many causes:
either from percussion, or from jumping, or from shouting, or from lifting a heavy weight, and by similar things;
and the signs when it is from the stretching of the syfac (synovial membrane), is that it happens little by little, over a long time, and does not come suddenly; and the abscesses are even to the depths, because the syfac (synovial membrane) presses on the intestines.
And the sign is that when it is from the section of the syfac (synovial membrane), it causes sudden pain at the beginning, and the abscesses appear diverse, under the skin near, and this is because of the intestine and the body outside the syfac (synovial membrane).
And sometimes the intestines descend with the intestine, and are retained within, and cause the patient to suffer great pain, especially when pressed.
And in these iron treatments there is fear, wherefore it is necessary to avoid them.
And the manner of the work is that you instruct the patient to push the intestine back into place with his hand into the wound, if he can return it; then let it be supported at its neck. between your hands, and raise the thighs;
then extend the scrotum upward, and cut all the skin of the testicles lengthwise; then insert into the edges of the wound hooks according to what you need to open the wound, and let them be such that the egg can come out;
then peel the fascia which is beneath the skin of the testicles, until the hard white fascia is uncovered on all sides;
then put your index finger into that which surrounds the testicle, into that which is between the white fascia which is beneath the skin of the egg, and between the second fascia, and separate that which is behind the egg, and between the second fascia;
and then move with the right hand inside the scrotum, and extend the white fascia upward with your left hand, and lift the egg with all the fascia toward the groin; and instruct the assistant to extend the egg upwards, and untie that which is behind the ligature;
and search with your fingers if there is any intestine wrapped in the hard white fascia, and if you find anything, put it back into the belly below;
then take a needle with a thick thread made of ten threads, and insert it into the back part of the fascia, which is behind the skin of the scrotum; after the waist, then cut the ends of the threads, until there are four threads; then assemble them one on top of the other in the manner of a cross, and tie the fascia, which we have said is below the skin of the scrotum, with a strong ligature in two parts; then wrap the ends of the threads, and tie them firmly on two sides, so that none of the vessels that nourish them can enter in, lest an abscess form there; and place the ligature again according to the first ligature along two fingers of that, and after these two ligatures leave of the fascia which is below the skin of the scrotum the width of a finger; and afterwards all the rest according to the roundness that the testicle has;
then cut in the part which is below the skin of the scrotum, until the blood flows and the bowel appears, as we have said before;
then apply wool moistened in oil, and place it on the wound, and apply the ligature that we have described. And sometimes the white fascia that we have mentioned is cauterized, after the incision, for fear of bleeding. For this happens many times, and leave the ligature until it falls off by itself;
and if it is slow to fall off, let it be sprinkled with warm water, and apply what we have said, until it falls off;
then treat the wound with another treatment, until it is perfectly healed.
of fleshy hernia
In this branch I never saw anyone who dared to perform the treatment with iron.
And the ancients said that it is done like the branch which is together with the vein, in such a manner that you tie the vessels, after the incision above or slightly below;
then cut in half, and treat the abscess with that which works, until the vessels dry up;
and treat it as we have said, until it is healed.
Sometimes a rupture occurs in the angles, as we have said, and the place opens;
and none of the intestines descend to the testicles, and if some descend, it is little, and returns every hour;
and yet if it remains too long at this point, the wound or hernia grows, until the intestine descends;
and this happens because of the extension of the sac which is in the angles, as we have said, for it is extended, then the place is softened and swollen and opens;
and the cure is by cautery, as we have said before;
and sometimes it is cured by iron in this manner: and that is that the patient lies often on his back between your hands, then cut the swollen place of the rupture lengthwise according to the quantity of three fingers;
and then extract the sac which is under the skin that follows it, then take the root and put it on the apparent place of the sac;
and press it to the bottom of the belly, then sew the two apparent places of the sac over the head of the root, and sew one and the other;
then draw out the head of the root, and do not cut the sac or extend the egg or anything else, just as I have made known to you in the treatment of the rupture of the intestines; then cure it by the treatment of wounds.
then cure it by the treatment of wounds. And when you cut the threads, then cleanse and treat the wound until it is healed.
The sac is constricted, and there is no appearance of it in the rupture, and the cautery is milder in this place, and closer to healing.
of the softening of the skin of the testicles
Many times the skin of the testicles is softened in some men, because the flesh within is softened, and it is ugly to see;
and it is necessary, when one wishes to cure it, that one makes the patient lie on his back, and cuts the softened skin above the natural skin;
then bring the two edges together with a suture, and if you wish, first cut away the excess of the softened skin with three or four sutures firmly;
then cut between the sutures, and treat it like other wounds, until it is healed, and the thread comes out.
Of castration
Know that castration is forbidden in our law, and therefore I would prefer not to speak of it in this book;
and it is only necessary for two reasons:
one is that the surgeon knows how to answer when asked, and knows the treatment;
and the other, because we often need to castrate some animals to help us, such as goats and sheep and cats and other animals.
I say then that castration is done in two ways: either by pulling, or by cutting.
In that which we do by pulling, we make the animal sit in warm water, until the testicles are softened and hanging; then take them in your hand, until they are retracted and you no longer feel them.
Of castration by cutting: you must hold the animal, and press the skin of the testicles with your left hand, then tie the suspensory, and cut above each testicle with one cut, when you have properly skinned them;
and leave some of the tunica vaginalis and the thin membrane which is over the vessels;
and this method of castration is better than that which is done by traction, because in traction, by chance, some part of the testicles remains, which causes the animal to desire lust;
then treat the wound until it is healed.
Of hermaphrodites
Hermaphroditism is according to two ways in men: one is that between the two testicles appears something like the figure of a woman's nature, where there is hair, and sometimes the urine flows there.
And the other way is in women, and she has above the vulva something like a penis and two testicles.
And the cure for the man and the woman is that you cut away all the added flesh, and cure them like other wounds;
in the second manner, of men whose urine escapes through the skin of the testicles, there is no cure.
Tenesmus is a growth added to the natural part, so that it is too ugly to see; and some women have it as large as a hand, and this is the cure.
It is necessary that you hold the superfluity of the tenesmus in your hand or with tongs, and cut it lightly;
and do not go too deep, lest a flow of blood come from it, then cure it with another cure until it is healed;
and to another growth that arises at the mouth of the womb, and fills it, and perhaps bursts forth, and is like the resemblance of a cow, and therefore the ancients called it "cow disease". Then you must cut it, as we have said of the tenesmus, and cure it until it is healed.
Erratic is when the woman's nature is not pierced, or the opening is small; and is natural by birth, or accidental by a disease that has come upon it;
and is natural by birth, or accidental by a disease that has come upon it; or it is by added flesh, or by subtle or thick syphus, and is made deeply in the womb, or on the sides, or underneath, or wherever it may be;
and prevents conception, and childbirth, and by chance, the having of flowers (menstruation);
and the knowledge of this is by the examination of the womb.
If the swelling is nearby and apparent, then seek it with your fingers or a probe.
If it is of subtle syphus, and it is near the two lips, then hasten, and break it thus:
put your two index fingers together, and the woman should be on her back, her legs spread;
then stretch the two lips widely, until the subtle syphus is broken, and the swelling is opened;
then take wool, and moisten it in oil, and put it on the place, and let the woman lie with a man each day, so that it cannot heal.
And if the syphus is hard and thick, then you must cut it with a spatula similar to a myrtle leaf.
If the swelling is of raw flesh, then lift it with a hook and cut it;
and have styptic medicines, such as acacia, dragon's blood, incense, together with egg white;
then apply a wide lead plate, so that the wound cannot heal;
and so it should be for a long time, and apply a tent of dry linen;
then it should be treated with other treatments until it is healed.
And when in the wound comes new flesh, then it must be cut according to this method, unless it is festering abscesses. For a festering abscess which is in the wound, one should not touch with iron.
of the hemorrhoids Hemorrhoids are openings of veins from which blood usually flows, and when the hemorrhoids are old they become swollen;
and we have already spoken in the division of the similarities of these, and the signs, and I will say here those which receive cure.
I say that hemorrhoids and swellings, when they are deep in the wound and do not appear to the touch, are not cured by iron.
Those which are at the opening of the wound, which one can feel, are those which one can cure.
It is necessary then that you place the woman in a cold house, then grasp the swelling with tongs, and cut it at its roots, then sprinkle on medicines that restrain blood, such as acacia and dragon's blood and incense, and similar things;
then place her feet against the wall for an hour, then put her in cold water;
and if bleeding occurs, make her sit in a decoction of sumac and pomegranate bark and galls and similar things, and then take barley flour, and mix it with honey and vinegar, and make a plaster on her back from it.
And if it stops, it is good. If not, apply cupping glasses to the back and breasts without cutting;
then take wool, and moisten it in plantain juice or agrimony juice with old wine, and apply it to the place.
And when the abscess subsides, treat the place with ointment until it is healed;
and that which is called "albathir" is red, and resembles a rough head, so it must be cut as I have said of the thelul; and then treat it until it is healed.
Many kinds of abscesses occur in the sea, such as cancer and stony abscesses and herpes and esthiomenes and fistulas and hemorrhoids and hot abscesses, and many other diseases that I have mentioned in the division.
It is necessary then that I discuss in this treatise the hot abscess which comes in the sea, which is not of the abscesses which collect pus;
And if you wish to know the work of iron, see if the abscess is sharp at the beginning of its appearance, and full of heat and fever, and if it becomes red if you can see it. Then do not hasten to pierce, but let it mature until the pain is calmed;
and then have the patient sit on a seat, and have two small seats where he leans, and rests on his back and brings his feet together at the parts of the outside of the leg;
and let his thighs be spread, and put his arms under his knees, and bind them well with a good bandage;
then give him a drink towards the right side, and administer the instrument with which one opens the mouth of the abscess, of which the form comes next;
and it is necessary that when you see this instrument administered, that you first insert the rod to know the depth of the abscess, so that what enters the instrument does not go deeper than it should, and that it does not injure the patient; and if the instrument is larger, it is necessary to cover the depth of the abscess with cloths, so that the instrument does not harm it;
and it is necessary that he put the cone of the instrument on top, and that he hold the instrument.
And when the abscess opens, and one opens it with a soft hand, then it is necessary to cut it at the head, with a spatula;
and when the abscess is emptied, it is necessary that you place in the wound tents moistened in rose oil, or in dried green oil;
and place the tent deep in the wound to the bottom of the abscess, and place on the outside of the abscess and on the wound clean wool moistened in water in which mallows have been boiled;
then cure it after two days with an ointment suitable for this, until it is healed;
and sometimes one cleans the abscess and the wound with a clyster of water and honey, and then with water in which lily roots and birthwort have been boiled; then return to the ointment.
And if the wound is deep in the abscess, you must avoid cautery with iron, but treat it as we have said in the division.
of childbirth It is first necessary for the midwife to know the form of natural childbirth, and the signs are when you see the woman pressing downwards, and desiring to urinate:
then the child hastens to come out; then know that that childbirth is according to the natural form, and the exit is head first, and the afterbirth with it;
and when you see these signs, it is necessary to press lightly on her belly, so that the child comes out quickly;
for when it descends head first, the afterbirth comes out with it, and the womb is cleansed of its superfluities by good cleansing;
and that which comes otherwise does not come naturally.
For sometimes it comes feet first, and the body or the head and hands come out, or it comes on its belly, or sideways, and is perhaps turned on its neck, and in other bad positions;
so it is necessary for the midwife that she be wise and subtle in these things, and beware of error and deception, and I will show you all the positions how one should help her.
If the child comes head first by natural delivery, and the woman labors grievously, and her strength is weak, then have her sit on a stool, where the women hold her;
and raise its nature with oil or fenugreek that has been cooked, and then let the midwife put between her fingers the small spatula of which this is the shape: and split the secundine, and cut with her fingernail until the moisture that is inside runs out;
and take hold of the woman's belly until the child descends, and if it does not descend, then it is necessary to give the woman a clyster of fenugreek mucilage with linseed oil;
then make her sneeze with sneezing powders, and hold her mouth and nose for an hour: then the child will come out immediately.
And if the two hands come out, then you must gently reset them little by little; and if they cannot be put back in, then put the woman on a seat, and raise her feet up; then lower the seat to the ground, and hold the woman so that she does not fall when it is lowered;
and if the hands cannot be put back in, and the child dies, then cut the hands with the knife that is mentioned above, and extract the child, and reset it equally.
of the delivery of the child on its feet When the child comes on its feet, then it is necessary to push it upwards; and then turn it little by little, until it is even;
then take one of the feet and extend it little by little.
When it jumps up to the thighs, then instruct to grasp it, and make it sneeze with a potion; if it jumps further, if God wills.
And if it does not go further as we have said, then turn it little by little, until it is according to the natural form. For then it comes out easily.
And if it does not come out as we have said, then take a mucilage of mallow, and oil of linseed, and melted gum, and grind everything in a mortar; and put it on the nature of the woman inside and outside with this ointment, then make her sit in warm water up to the ribs;
and when she is softened underneath, make her a pessary of myrrh, and put it underneath, and leave it for an hour; then make her sit on a seat, then make her sneeze and clear her mouth and nose, and gently press her belly, for the child will jump out immediately.
of the child's exit onto her knees When the child comes in this way, let the midwife put her hands on it little by little; then let it be supported at its neck, and its feet hanging down, and let it be lying on a bed; and fold its hands little by little, and then take its hands over its belly, and remove the cushions from under it, until it is properly positioned below; and if the child does not come out, take its feet and move them strongly, then move its belly upwards, then put your hands there; and draw the child out little by little; and instruct the woman to strain until the child comes out.
of the delivery of the child which comes from the womb, one hand hanging down It is necessary to devise a way to bring back the hand: if one cannot bring it back, then make the woman stand, and walk;
if she cannot walk, then make her lie on the bed, and spread her legs widely;
then administer the mucilage that I have described;
and if she does not give birth, then make her sit on a seat, then work to bring back the hand; and draw the child according to the natural position, and make her sneeze, and instruct her to strain until the child comes out.
of the child's exit over its neck, and has its arms spread out, and its face turned towards its mother's back it is necessary that the midwife hold its hand, then turn it little by little, and draw it gently;
and when it is even, then apply to the wound a poultice of mallow and oil, as we have said, then instruct her to move little by little;
and when you have done this, then make her sit on a seat, and instruct her to strain; and make her sneeze. in this same manner with all the afterbirth
in this same manner with all the afterbirth When it comes forth in this manner with all the afterbirth, cut the afterbirth with your nail, until the moisture is emptied;
and if the child hangs by its face and neck, cut it from the navel, so that it may not be retained, and the child die;
then put the child inside, until you have placed it as it should be, and instruct the woman to hold herself sometimes:
Of the delivery of twins Know that twins are often born, and sometimes three or four are born; and that is not a strange thing, and it happens little. Two are a strange thing, and they do not live, except a few.
Two are a strange thing, and they do not live, except a few. I know that, if they are multiplied, and are separated by the syfac which divides them, which is attached to the navel;
and sometimes they come out as naturally as a single one, as we have said.
And if they come out badly, treat them as we have said, and let the bandage be fine, and do quickly and lightly what it does; and do so as it is worth moving to salvation. of several children
Sometimes they are formed in the womb, one or two or three or four or five or six or seven, or more up to fifteen, and are all formed in the shape of a child by the measurement of the wise glorious one, and the bandage must know all this, for by chance a similar thing happens; so do according to what is necessary.
of the dead child
When you treat a woman with a dead child in her womb, as I have said in the division, and it does not come out, and you are constrained to work with your hands; it is necessary that you know if the woman is of sound virtue, and has no accident or fear of death;
it is necessary that the woman be placed on her back, and her head inclined downward, and her legs raised;
and the attendant hold her there, where she is bound to the bed so that she is not pulled during the descent of the child;
then rub the mouth of the womb with moist oils with mallow and fenugreek mucilage and linseed, then let the operator oil his hands with these oils and mucilages;
then insert them into the womb lightly, then find a place where she inserts the fingers that are suitable for this, and take care if the child is positioned to descend head first;
then insert the fingers into its eyes or its neck or its mouth or its palate or under the chin or in the clavicle or near the ribs, and if the descent is feet first, insert them into the groin and the middle ribs;
and it is necessary that he hold the finger with his right hand, and put the curvature between the fingers of his left hand, and insert it with his whole hand lightly, and insert the finger into one of these places that we have mentioned, until it reaches the empty thing;
then insert another finger opposite, or a third if you need it, so that the traction is even;
and then extend it evenly by moving from one side to the other, so that the fetus comes out, and let the fingers be toothed to hold the fetus, as is the form here:
And if a part remains, let him rub some of his fingers with oil, and insert them into that part, and pull out the other part;
and if any point remains, then place this finger or more in the higher place, and do this until it all comes out.
And if one hand comes before the other, and he cannot retrieve it because of the tightness, then you must wrap it in a cloth, until it all comes out; then cut it at the joint of the sole or at the heel, and thus you must do in the other hand, and in the two feet.
And if the head of the child is large and it is narrow at the exit, or if it has collected sharp water on the head, then you must put the spatumile espinous between your fingers, and split the head and extract the water; or you round it with the instrument which is called "almidach", of which the shape comes with the instruments in the chapter which is after this one;
and do the same if the child has a naturally large head;
and then pull out the bones with tongs, and if the head jumps out and is pulled with the forceps, let it be split, until the moisture which is in the worst place issues forth;
and if it cannot come out, then cut it into pieces as best you can;
and if it is swollen in the belly or under the ribs, then you must pierce it until the moisture runs out.
And if the child is on its feet, the extraction is easy, and the straightening at the mouth of the womb is easy.
And if it is narrow in the belly or chest, then you must extract it with a cloth wrapped around your hand; and cut the belly or chest until the moisture that is there runs out;
and if the other limbs are removed, and the head remains, then the midwife puts her hand into the depth of the womb, and draws it down to the mouth of the womb; then she puts in one or two fingers, and pulls it forcefully;
and if the mouth of the womb is constricted by a hot abscess that has formed there, then you must not work there, but you must administer moist and greasy things; and administer plasters, and sit in softening and moistening water.
And if the child is on its side, and you can put it straight, then administer what we have said for a living child;
and if one does not have the power, then pull it out forcefully piece by piece, and leave nothing of the afterbirth.
And when you have done this, then administer what we have said for hot abscesses that occur in the womb;
and if a flow of blood comes, then it should be placed in astringent water, and administer other treatments.
And I saw a woman in whose womb a child had been dead, then another was conceived upon that one, and the other was also dead. After a long time, an abscess came to her in the groin, and it swelled until it opened, and began to greatly fester.
I was called to the treatment, and I thought about it for a long time, and I could not heal the wound.
I applied a plaster of strong attraction, and a bone came out of it, and after some days another. I was very surprised, because the belly has no bones.
So I thought that it was the bones of a dead child.
I searched the wound, and I extracted more bones, until the woman was in better condition; and the woman lived a long time like that, and a little pus always came out of the place;
and I have only recalled this chapter because, when the master finds a strange thing, that he may know how to give aid.
After this comes the form of the pressor, with which one uses the books;
and with two turnings at the two heads of the two ligaments. However, the horns should be more subtle than the restrictor, and should be made of ebony or boxwood;
and the mouth of the shaft should be one finger wide, and the edge of the horns one finger, and one and a half palms long; and between the two ligaments should be two attachments of this same shaft, which are fastened in one and the other, half a palm long or a little more;
and these two attachments are inserted into the mouth of the trepan to open when one turns the two horns.
Another form, similar in appearance but more subtle and lighter, should be made of ebony or boxwood, similar to tongs; and it should have at the two ends two attachments, as you see, one palm long and two fingers wide;
and when you want to open the trepan with the whole instrument, make the woman sit on a bed, her feet hanging down and her legs open, then put the two joined attachments into the trepan, and hold the head of the instrument underneath between her thighs; then work your hand with the whole instrument, as you did with the tongs equally, according to the amount you want to open the mouth of the trepan, until the opening does what it should.
These instruments are all surpassed, and their types are multiplied; and when the surgeons have prepared them, the work is so much faster, and higher for men because of their quantity.
Do not despise the instrument that you have not prepared, for their necessity is not excusable.
When the afterbirth is retained after childbirth, you must instruct the patient to hold her breath, and then make her sneeze with a potion, and squeeze her hands on her mouth and nose; and if she expels it thus, it is well.
If not, take a pot, and make a hole in the lid, and put in herbs that can open the mouth of the womb, such as calamint, rue, anise, chamomile, cassia lignea, and centaury; all these herbs, or some of them, should be boiled in water in the pot over the fire;
then place one end of a tube in the hole of the pot, and the other end in the mouth of the womb, and hold it there until the vapors enter the womb;
then make her sneeze, as we have said. If the afterbirth comes out quickly.
And if it remains after this treatment, and does not come out, instruct the midwife to wet her left hand in sesame oil or mallow mush, and then insert it into the birth canal, and search for the afterbirth; and when she has found it, let her take it and gently and gradually pull it straight, so that the womb does not fall during the extraction;
but it must be moved slightly to the right and to the left, and then pulled; then it will come and separate itself.
And if the mouth of the womb is too narrow, we have described the treatment of sneezing and herbal fumigation;
and if it does not come out from all that we have said, be careful not to be reckless in pulling;
but it is necessary that what is at the mouth of the womb, you tie it to the thigh of the woman, then clysterize with tetrafarmacon ointment; then it will rot and soften, and come out.
But nevertheless, when it rots, a bad odor comes to the stomach and head, and harms the patient. Then suitable fumigations are necessary for this:
Some of the ancients have tested fumigation of cress and dried figs.
The form of the instrument with which one fumigates the woman for the retention of the flowers and the afterbirth is this:
And it is of glass similar to a cane, and one puts the thin end into the vagina, and the wide end over the fire;
and let the fumigation be over the coals, and burn it until it is consumed, and begin again with another.
Many children are born who do not have the fundament pierced, but it is stopped up by a thin membrane: therefore it is necessary for the midwife that she pierce that membrane with her finger, and not pierce it with a sharp instrument, and guard against the wound that she not touch it;
then put on wool moistened in wine and oil, then treat it with ointment until it is healed.
And if you doubt that it will close up again, put a lead tube in the opening, and leave it there for several days, and it should be removed when the child wants to go to the toilet.
And sometimes this obstruction comes from a sudden wound or abscess; then it is necessary to cut that obstruction. then it should be treated, as we have said of the lead tube.
Fistulas which come from under the fundament are knots and swellings which come near the fundament without, or in the space of the two parts, so there is one fistula or several;
and when that knot is old, it works, and then moist white or subtle pus oozes, and sometimes these fistulas are perforated;
and are known by the fact that there comes out with the excretion or flatulence when the patient excretes, and sometimes a worm jumps out.
And there are fistulas that pierce as far as the bladder, and as far as the middle of the penis; and reach to the joint of the thigh, and even to the buttocks.
And thus one recognizes the fistula that pierces to the fundament, and that which does not pierce: and it is that you put your index finger in the fundament, and insert a thin needle of bronze or iron into the fistula when there is no tortuosity.
And if there is tortuosity, then insert a thin lead tent, or a horsehair, until you feel the tent or the hair with your finger;
and if you do not feel it, and there comes from the opening no discharge, nor flatulence, nor worm, as we have said: know that it does not pierce; then hasten to the cure.
And when the fistula penetrates to the bladder or to the urinary duct, then the urine leaks out, and cannot be healed by medicines.
If it is pierced as far as the hip joint, then the tent is inserted as far as the place; if there is no tortuosity and the location of the pain is around, it is that pus always flows out, and neither medicine nor healing by ointment is of use;
and in these penetrating fistulas there is no cure except labor, and the vanity of foolish physicians who meddle with them.
In that which is not penetrating and is not old, there is hope of healing by iron, as I have experienced, and it is that the patient lies on his back in your hands;
and he raises his legs up to his thighs, and has his thighs bent towards his belly; then place a tent of bronze, or of lead if there is tortuosity, until you know where the tent goes.
If the patient feels it around the fundament, then you must put your index finger there, if you then feel that the tent has pierced it;
and it is uncovered where you feel between your finger the lining or the flesh, then know that it is penetrating; then do not labor with it if it cannot be healed.
However, it is said that some can be healed well, but this happens rarely;
and the help that is done there is that one heats the subtle cautery according to the width of the fistula, as it is said before; and puts it, all hot, into the fistula, until it reaches near the bottom; and do this two or three times, until you know that the decayed flesh is burned, which is similar to a bird's feather;
and then treat it with tents moistened in butter, until that flesh comes out, then treat it with an ointment that generates flesh and heals.
If it is thus healed, it is good.
If this, it cannot be healed otherwise;
and if the tent enters, and does not pierce to the finger which is in the bottom, and there is between your finger and the tent a thick covering of flesh or of syfac, and you see the fistula at that which follows the covering of the heart; then cut it from the beginning of the fistula, and push the tent forward constantly, and then cauterize afterwards, until it reaches the head of the tent; and the tent will be freed, and will fall;
then cleanse those rotten fleshes which resemble a bird's feather, and let nothing remain.
And if the blood overcomes you, and runs between you and the work, cauterize it with fire or with a sharp medicine.
For fire cautery combines two good things: that is to say, the burning of these added fleshes, and the staunching of blood and the drying of moisture;
then treat it with tents moistened in butter or in crushed herbs, until the place throws off pus, and the burned flesh separates in the pus;
then treat the wound with ointments that are drying and engendering hard flesh, and the medicines are dry.
For when it is restored, it is healed and does not return.
And if a fistula extends to the bottom of the fundament, and is distant from the body, insert your finger into the fundament, and explore it.
If you feel the tent, and between the two is the membrane or the fascia or flesh, or it is about to pierce, there is no other recourse but faith and hope, through the use of one of the three methods:
either you cauterize it as we have said, or you cut it to the bottom, or if you can, you put tents there and treat it as before;
and do not go too deep, lest you cut the ligament that holds the fundament, and there is an evacuation against the will; then treat it, as we have said;
then treat it, as we have said; by chance it will be healed, or you remove that covering and clean it after it is cut near the fundament, either with a tent or with another pointed instrument; then cleanse that rotten flesh which is in the wound, as much as you can; then strive to restore the wound, and to leave the fistula in the part outside the fundament:
then strive to restore the wound, and to leave the fistula in the part outside the fundament: this will be an easier thing for the patient.
And sometimes fistulas are like this: and it is when you put the tent into the fistula, and it is at the side of the fundament near the skin above, then take a tent pierced at the end according to this form: And put a twisted thread in it, and put the tent with the thread into the fistula until it is at the end.
If it is penetrating into the edge of the fundament within, then pull the thread through that hole, so that you put your finger into the fundament;
and pull the end of the thread, and bring the two ends together, and pull one against the other, and leave it one or two days;
and tighten it sometimes, until the thread cuts the flesh that is between them, and they join;
then treat the wound until it is healed and sound.
If the fistula does not pierce, then make it pierce in every way that you can, if it is not too deep. For it is not necessary to cut too deeply for the laceration, and then treat it, as we have said, until it is healed.
The shape of the spatumile (spatula) used to cut the fistula is very sharp on one side and cutting; and on the other side not, so that one does not cut what one should not cut, as you see here:
Hemorrhoids are according to two manners: or they are inside the rectum, like grains of resin, and there are small and large ones, and they constantly bleed, and there is one or more, and they are outside the rectum and at the end of the rectum;
but those which are outside have little moisture, and constantly or a little citrine water or a little blood, and have the color of the body;
and the cure of those who have them inside the rectum, is that you instruct the patient to strain to go to the chamber, until the rectum comes out, and the threads appear; then hurry, and grasp it with tongs, or hold it with your nail, then cut it at its roots;
and if the hooks cannot hold them because of their moisture, then grasp them with a rag, or with cotton, or a piece of chamois; and pull them out with your fingers, then cut them, and sprinkle on top some hot powders which are in place of a cautery; or you cauterize them as it is said in the chapter on cautery, then cure them with other cures until they are healed;
and if the matter cannot come out, then clysterize the patient with a biting and harsh clyster to wash out what is in the fundament, so that it may clearly come out; when the patient is seized, and if the threads are strong from the fundament, then the cure is easy;
when the patient is seized, and if the threads are strong from the fundament, then the cure is easy; and it is that you take them with your nail or with forceps, and cut them, then cure them as we have said, until it is healed, and it avoids incision with iron. Then you must administer the suture according to this manner:
Then you must administer the suture according to this manner: take a twisted thread, and put it in a needle, and then draw the thread above and make the needle pierce on the other side, and turn the two ends of the thread under the needle, and let it be wide;
and pull the thread tightly, then knot the thread, and remove the needle, and do so for all the others, and leave one to restrain the excess of blood;
then put on the wound a cloth moistened in rose oil or in cerate, and put it on the wound, and instruct the patient to rest;
and then leave it until they fall off, and when they have fallen off, treat them with ointment and other treatment, until they are healed.
of the drying of the wound or the bottom (wound) Often there is drying of the wound in the intestine, and by constriction of nature, and when the disease is old and medicine is of no use. Then you must scrape with the point of a spatula or with your nail the scab on top, which do not let it moisten; then treat it until it is healed as it should be;
and if it cannot heal, then begin scraping more strongly than before, until it heals very much, and is scraped; then treat it until it is healed.
of trembling Formication is a small, creeping sensation around the body, and goes very deep;
and sometimes it finds the cold, and it is felt as if dead from trembling, and comes over the whole body, and more in the hands than elsewhere.
And the cure is that you take a quill from a goose feather, or a strong vulture feather, and place that quill on the trembling, until the circle encompasses the trembling completely; then turn your hand with the quill until you cut all around the trembling, and put it deep, and eradicate the trembling from its roots.
And if you wish, do this with a quill of bronze or iron in this manner, and let it be sharp below and blunt above: not pierced, to be held easily with the fingers, and easily pressed.
And if you wish, cauterize the trembling, as is described in the chapter on cautery.
Sometimes a clyster is made of silver, or of tin, or of molten or hammered bronze;
and sometimes these instruments are made small and large, according to those to whom they are administered. Those therefore which are administered in the treatment of children and who are weak and painful, are small.
Those therefore which are administered in the treatment of children and who are weak and painful, are small. The form of the small and large clyster is wider above, where the belly is tied in this manner:
and there is a release where the belly is tied, as you see, and the end is pierced inside;
and has on one side two holes, and on the other one;
and let the belly, where one puts the medicines, be of an animal bladder or parchment, and let it be pierced all around with small holes, and let there be one finger's breadth between each hole, then put into these holes a strong thread of raw thread twisted in an X or however around, and gather the belly like a goat's bladder; and when the medicine is inside, tie it to the instrument in front with a strong thread, then clysterize;
and this is the form of the circle:
And let the medicine be neither too hot nor too cold, and anoint the head of the clyster with oil or egg white, or something similar, then insert it gently; then the administrator squeezes it with both hands together, until it is completely empty, then withdraw the clyster, and let the patient raise his legs against the wall, and if the medicine wants to come out, let him hold it as long as he can; and if he sleeps a whole night, it is greater help.
And if you clysterize him for a disease of bowel looseness, and the medicine hastens to come out, repeat it until he is healed.
And if the hemorrhoids are in the fundament, or an abscess, let the clyster be as fine as for a child;
and this is the form of the fine clyster on which the leather is stretched:
We have, I said in the division, the treatment of wounds;
or we will tell the treatments by hand and by medicine, according to the completion.
I say that wounds are diverse according to how they are made, and according to the places where the wounds are made, and what they are made with.
The things by which wounds are made are by the throwing of a stone, and the blow of a sword and of a knife, or of a lance or of a club or of an arrow, or of similar things;
or that are made according to the places of the body, such as a wound that falls on the neck, or on the head, or the foot, or the belly, or the liver, and similar members;
and I will tell you the treatment of each wound, and will begin with the simple wounds of the head, for the others will come in their chapter.
I say that when a simple wound comes to the head, and the bone is not broken, then take care if it is from the throwing of a stone or similar things, and the skin is nevertheless broken and the wound is large, and you fear the rising of a hot abscess: then make it bleed immediately from the cephalic vein itself if little blood comes from the wound, and let the bleeding be on the opposite side from the injured part;
and let the patient avoid fullness of wine and heavy foods.
And if he does not want to bleed, let his food be lessened, and let him not drink wine, nor eat meat;
and put on the wound, if hot abscesses come there, cotton soaked in rose oil only, or in styptic wine;
and if there is no hot abscess, put on the wound, if it is fresh with all its blood, and it is not exposed to the air, the powder, which I will describe shortly;
and if the burning has exposed it, put on some ointments, until it is healed.
And if the wound is large, like from a sword cut and similar, and the lips cannot be joined by tents, join them by suture, as I will describe for wounds of the belly, of the suture.
If the wound exposes the bone, and hangs, and only holds by a little, cut it; then treat the wound with medicine, and restore hard flesh in place of skin, and instruct the patient to eat strong foods, such as heads and cooked wheat, also like poultry, and similar things.
And if you find rottenness in the skin, and it does not reach the bone, cut away all the rottenness, and throw it away, then treat it;
and if there is an artery or vein in the wound, from which blood flows, and it cannot be stopped by medicines, seek the artery, and if you find it loose, tie it with a thread; and if that does not help, cauterize it.
And if these wounds are small and simple, the treatment is easy: and that you put in this powder which heals before the fire has moved it.
And the manner of the powder is: take incense, one part; dragon's blood, two parts; quicklime, three parts, and powder it finely, and apply to the wound, and bind it tightly, until it heals well and joins with all its blood;
and then bind it well, and leave it untied, if it does not swell; for one does not remove the medicine until it is healed.
And sometimes it is done with lime alone, when one does not have incense or dragon's blood, but so that the burning does not move the wound.
And if the burning has moved the wound, especially in summer, then one does not put this powder there;
but put on some digestive ointments, or poultices of barley flour made with water and honey, until it throws out pus; then cure it with other cures until it is healed.
And if a fracture of the bone occurs with the wound, and it is small, then extract it with fine pincers;
and I will tell you afterwards about head fractures.
of the wound of the neck
If a wound occurs in the neck and it is simple, there is no difference between it and that of the head, but if the nerves of the neck or the artery is cut.
If it is the nerve, there is no other remedy than to leave it to heal, and not to apply anything constricting, for it harms the nerves and causes them to retract; and not to put anything cold on the wound, because the substance of the nerves is cold, and their continuation is with the brain, which is the highest member;
but let the medicine be soft, such as warm washing in fresh water, and mixed with rose oil, and cooked herbs also washed in fresh water, and other minerals in this manner, and moist ointments.
And if the wound is large, sew it and bind it with bandages, then treat it until it is healed.
And if the wounds are deep and it is swollen and full of pus, pierce it at the lowest point;
and if the artery is cut, and a flow of blood comes from it, tie it off, and bind it, and cauterize it if necessary;
and if the spine of the throat is cut, or the heart, and the conduit is guarded, through which the flesh goes, sew the heart to the throat's membrane, and do not touch the throat but reset it according to its natural form; and then bind it carefully, and leave it for some days, then treat it with drying ointments until it is healed;
and if the wound has made an impression on the bone, search for it; and if there are pieces of bone, draw them all out if you can, and those that you cannot remove, leave them until the wound festers, and the outlet is opened and cleaned;
and if the wound is fresh, sprinkle on the powder that I have mentioned. And if there is bone in the wound and there is a fistula, treat it as I have said in its chapter.
If it is a wound from a lance or a knife, and the wound is deep, observe if air escapes from the wound when the patient breathes: know then that the wound is mortal;
and if it is not deep, and it is fresh with all its blood, do not put powder on it at the first hour, nor bind it up, lest the blood be retained within, and return to the heart, and kill the patient; but apply an attractive ointment, and dress it twice a day;
and if you do not have ointment, put old cotton in the wound to soak up the moisture, and make the patient sleep on the wound for three days, or four, or more; thus there will come no spasm, nor tremor, nor ill heart, nor shortness of breath; and when you see good signs, know that the wound is healed. Then treat it with tents and other treatments, until it is healed;
and if it cannot heal, and festers, know that there is a fistula;
then treat it as one should. And if the wound is from a sword or knife incision, and it is simple, whether on the breast or back, treat it as one would treat a wound on the front; if it is large, by suture;
and if it is small, with powder, and if it has reached the bone, and cut pieces of it, cleanse the wound, and pull out the splinters if they are loose; and if they are not loose, let the wound fester, this will facilitate extraction;
and for other wounds on other limbs, the judgment is as we have said.
of the rupture of the belly
The ruptures of the belly are large, medium, and small;
from the large wound sometimes the intestines, or the nerves of the intestines, protrude, causing their intromission;
and the suture is more difficult, and sometimes the small wound is worse than the large one, because the intestines are more difficult to put back in, unless they are put back in immediately;
because the intestines swell as soon as they feel the cold, they are more difficult to replace, and therefore the medium wound is better, because one more easily returns the intestine to its place than the others.
And know that the rupture of the belly is according to four manners:
the two common sutures occur in the suture of the belly, and the suture of other wounds of the body and two other proper sutures are common to other wounds;
and yet they are more proper with the suture of the belly, and I will say each one and explain.
I say that when the wound is small, and something of the intestine comes out, and it is difficult to replace it, this is by one of the two manners: either because of the smallness of the wound, as we have said, or because the intestine is swollen from the cold.
And when it is cold, warm it in this manner: moisten a sponge or a soft cloth in lukewarm water only, or you boil in water squinant and cyprus and spike, and bathe the intestine until the swelling is removed;
and sometimes astringent wine does this, and is better than water alone for reducing swelling.
And when you see the swelling depart, then moisten the intestine with water in which althea and mallows have been boiled, for by this the entry is easily closed.
and if it cannot enter, then slightly open the wound with the instrument with which one cuts hemorrhoids;
and the first treatment is better than cutting, for no one should cut without great necessity;
and these are the instruments for opening it:
cut inwards in the curve and not outwards, and here is the form: And when the wound is enlarged, and the intestine protrudes, replace it according to its natural form in its proper place, if you are able, for this is better.
When the wound is large, and it is in the lower part of the belly, you must have the patient lie on his back, and place his legs higher than his head; and if it is in the lower part of the belly, place the head and chest higher than the lower parts, and likewise if the rupture of the belly is in one of the two parts, apply yourself to ensuring that the injured part is higher than the other;
and thus you must administer what I say in large and medium wounds.
In small wounds, place what you have prepared, then have between your hands a pitiful minister who holds the entire rupture in his hand, and brings the edges together;
and this is the common manner of sutures, and it is that you take one needle or several, according to the quantity of the width of the wound, then leave from the head of the wound one finger's breadth of space, and there insert a needle where there is a good strong thread; and pierce the two edges of the skin with the two edges of the siphac, which is under the skin inside, until you make it pierce that part, and bring together the two edges of the siphac, the four together;
then tie a double thread around the needle on two sides, then bring together the two edges of the wound properly, and then leave one finger's breadth of space, and there insert another needle;
then tie the thread as you did the first needle, and do not cease doing this according to the need for needles, until the entire wound is closed;
and let the needles be medium-sized, between fine and thick, for the fine needles cut all the flesh, and the too-thick ones cannot enter well: therefore it is necessary that they be medium-sized;
and it is not necessary to insert the needles too far from the flesh and skin, lest they cut and open the wound before the closure;
and then cut the ends of the needles, so that they do not injure the patient while sleeping, and put tents or cloths at the ends of the needles to hold them, and leave them until the wound is healed;
and this method of suturing with needles is more suitable for small wounds, because one or two needles suffice.
The second suture is common, and is that you bring together the two edges of the skin and the two edges of the muscle with a needle with a single strong medium thread;
and when you have pierced these four edges together, then return the needle to the part where you began, in the manner in which cloths are sewn;
and place between each suture the thickness of a little finger;
This suture is used by men, and I sewed a wound that a man had in his belly, which was wounded by a knife, and the wound was more than a palm wide, and the intestines protruded well two palms wide, and the wound was in the middle of the belly.
I returned the intestine after it had been out for twenty-four hours, and the wound was healed in fifteen days, and I treated it, and it was healed.
And the physicians had judged that he would die, and this was a miracle;
and I did not treat it with ointment, for I was in a place where none could be found, nor any medicines; and I put clean cotton on the wound twice a day, and washed it with honey water until it was healed.
Now I will tell you the two proper methods of suture:
Take the needle, and put it from the outer part to the inner;
when it has pierced straight through, leave the head of the sheath or case where you put the needle, and make it pierce from the other side, from the inner part to the outer;
and the understanding of this suture is that you sew as the furriers sew furs, and that you leave the sheath on one side once, and take it again on the other, until the suture is completely done.
The second method of suture, which Galen properly described, is as some do, who naturally join the two parts together, and apply one end of the sheath to the other end, in this manner:
insert a needle at the head of the nearby suture, and make it pierce only that place, and leave the two ends of the sheath; then turn the needle, and make it pierce from the outer part to the inner, at the two ends of the sheath;
then make it pierce each from the outer part to the inner, at two other places of the suture which are on the other side;
and this is the best and most common method of suture.
Galen says this, and some testify to it, that one should sew the belly with two needles, with thread in each;
and one should insert one needle from one side, and the other from the other, in the manner of those who sew straps;
and know that when the rupture is in the middle of the belly, the stitching is more difficult than in other places of the belly.
The judgment of the wound is such as the judgment of other wounds:
and it is that when you find the wound fresh with all its blood, before the fire has changed it, then replace the intestine and the seam;
then put on the flesh-generating powder, and if the fire has changed it, then put on any ointment that is present, until the wound heals; and let the threads be sewn, and the surfaces and the viscera be joined; then treat the wound like the others, until it is healed;
and if you do not have medicines, then put on, as soon as it begins to produce pus, old cotton, and change it twice a day until it is healed.
For you do not need other medicine in many cases when the wounds are simple;
and if you fear that the wound will affect the principal members, then you must moisten light wool in oil of moderate warmth, or in rose oil, and place it around the groins and under the armpits;
and if he feels pain or corruption in the bowels, and this often happens, then clysterize them with warm black wine, and especially if the corruption reaches the intestine;
and pierce it inside, and know that when it is the large intestine, it is easier to heal than the small.
The intestine that is called "jejunum" cannot heal when it is injured, and this is because of the abundance of veins that are there, and because of the subtlety of the whole body, and the proximity of its nature to the nerves.
And if the gut protrudes from the wound, replace it as with the intestine, while it is fresh;
and if it is old and has become worm-eaten or black, then you must bind the place that is black, so that a flow of blood does not come there, for there are veins and arteries;
then cut what is between the ligature, and place the two ends hanging down from the part below the wound outside to facilitate extraction when the gut falls, and the wound suppurates.
Of the rupture of the bowel
When the intestine is torn, and the wound is small, it can be restored in some men, because I saw that a man was wounded in the belly with a lance;
and the wound was on the right side of the stomach, and it festered and became a fistula, and the excrement and flatulence came out of it;
I applied treatment according to my ability, and did not cease to refine it until he was healed, and the place closed.
And when I saw it close, I feared that the patient had harm in his belly; and there was no harm there, but he remained in better condition, eating and drinking;
and certain practitioners said that when there is a small wound in the intestine, it should be bound in this manner: Take splinters with large heads, then bring together the lips of the wound, and when the splinter has opened its mouth, place it upon the two lips, so that it draws its mouth shut;
and then cut off its head, and this holds so that it cannot loosen, then place another splinter afterwards in the same manner as before, until the wound is entirely closed; and sew the wound.
These splinters are burned in the intestine, and no harm comes to the patient, and one can bind the intestine with a fine thread which is cut from the intestine of a beast, in this manner:
take the end of this intestinal thread that is very clean, and then tie to the end of this thread a fine twisted linen thread, then put the thread in the needle, and sew the intestine, and bring it back into the rupture;
and this method of stitching with splinters is not certain except according to the way of trust and hope;
and if the wound is large and wide, especially when it is in one of the small intestines, there is no device or remedy, except subtlety.
of a fistula wherever it may be Know that every wound or abscess, when it ages, is universally called a "fistula," and especially when it is haired and suppurates.
And a fistula, in truth, is a hard, white, false knot, where one feels no pain, and it is as hairy as the feather of a bird;
and sometimes it exudes clear pus, and other times thick; sometimes little, and sometimes enough;
and I have spoken of it in the division of wounds, that every wound that is not healed, and there is no flesh, it is only by one of the nine causes: that is to say, by the smallness of the blood or body; or because of its bad quality; or because there is hard flesh within, and on the lips, which does not allow flesh to grow; or there is too much swelling; or the place is rotten, and the matter is of bad quality; or the medicine is not good for the treatment; or because the corruption is a kind of pestilence; or because the property of the region is slow in digestion, and slow in healing, and swollen by nature; or there are veins or bones there;
and I have already shown all these causes, and the signs, and the treatments of medicines in the division.
Now it is necessary that I make you know the treatment of a fistula which is made by the work of hands.
Know that fistula occurs in all the members of the body; for there are fistulas that come to the large veins, and to the arteries, and to the nerves, or to the syfac, or to the intestine, or to the bladder, or to some of the ribs, or to the spine of the back, or to some joint of the hands or feet; and there is such a one that comes to the property of the principal member, and to similar places.
And all the fistulas that are of this manner are of difficult healing, and there is nothing but labor, and ignorance;
and if there is any fistula that does not reach the place that I have said, and you have confidence in the cure, and you wish to know it, then take a tent of bronze or iron, if the fistula is straight, then seek it;
and if the fistula is crooked, then search it with a subtle tent of lead, for the lead bends easily around the tortuosity;
and if the fistula has many openings and you cannot search it well with tents, then clysterize it through one of the openings, for the moisture runs from one opening to another, and cleanses it;
then search it wisely to your ability, that you may know if there is bone or nerve, and it is deeply rooted, and ask the patient well about the pain that he feels at the pressing of your hand, and the place where he feels it;
and when you truly know the place where it is, and if it is far from a joint, or nerve, or artery or vein, or in any of the places that I have told you, then cut it according to what I have told you, and remove completely the excess and the corrupted flesh that are within;
and then treat it until it is healed, and if the fistula is very deep in a straight place, then it is necessary that you cut deeply, as much as you can, then put in moistened tents in medicated water, and push them to the bottom of the fistula, until the medicine corrodes the excess that has remained at the bottom;
and then apply ointments that generate healthy flesh, until it is healed;
and if it is not healed by this, then cauterize it as we have said, and if the bone is corrupted by the fistula, then cut it.
If a vein or nerve does not impede you in the principal limbs, as we have said;
and if the bone is exposed, and there is corruption and blackness, then clean it until all the corruption is removed, then treat it with things that generate flesh until it is healed;
and if it is not healed, and returns as before, know that you have not gone to the bottom:
then uncover and search until you reach the bottom, and remove all the corruption, then restore the place;
and if it is thus healed, it is well. If not, know that the corruption is too deep, that you cannot reach it; then there is no other recourse but to leave it to nature;
and if there is a small corrupted bone, and you can pull it out with tongs, then extract it with a suitable instrument for this, and if there are many bones, then extract them all, and do not leave even one;
and if the moisture hinders you, and there is no risk or fear, then cut the moisture and flesh, and free the bones.
And if you cannot remove them at once, then apply something to the wound that promotes putrefaction, and leave it until the area is rotten around the bones, and then the bones will come out more easily;
and if it is a large bone, such as from the leg or thigh, then only remove the corruption until all the blackness is gone, then restore the wound;
and if a large part of it is corrupted, and it reaches the marrow of the bone; then it is necessary to saw and cut it all the way to the corruption, and then treat it until it is healed;
and I will tell you of a fistula that happened to a man in his leg, so that you may take it as an example and help in your work.
He was a young man of about thirty years, who had pain in his leg from a cause that came from within the body, so that the matter came to the leg, and it was swollen with a large abscess, and there was no external cause to open it;
but the doctors, through their folly, worked on it so much that the abscess opened, and much matter flowed out, and it became a fistula, and many holes appeared which all discharged pus and moisture from the body;
and many doctors treated it for about two years, and there was no wise man in the art of surgery, until I was called there, and I saw his leg and the medicines with which he was treated, and that which flowed through the holes in great quantity; and the young man's flesh became red, and had a yellowish color.
I inserted a tent into one of these holes, and then I searched all the holes, and found that one led to another from all parts of the leg.
I hastened then, and cut into one of the holes until I uncovered a part of the bone, and found it corrupt and perforated, and the corruption reached to the bone within;
I removed what appeared to me of the corrupt bone, and thought that there was no other corruption, except that which I removed;
and I began to treat the wound with cauterizing medicines for a long time, and it could not heal;
and then I began again, and uncovered the bone as before, and found the corruption continued in the bone, and I probed it, and then removed it, and I strived to heal the place; but I could not until I cut around a palm's breadth of the bone, and removed it entirely with its marrow, then I treated it with medicines; and it was healed and mended quickly, and it was not necessary to begin the work again except for the weakness of the patient, who could not endure, and for the fear of death that I had for him. For because of the evacuation, he bled often, but he was healed completely, and in place of the bone grew hard flesh, and it was of good disposition and had no harm or contrary at all, neither in walking nor in coming.
And if the bone is broken in any part of the body, it must be treated in this manner: take a linen cloth, and bind it to the end of the bone which is visible, and instruct someone to pull it upwards; and put another woolen bandage thicker than the first linen cloth, and bind it over the flesh which is above the bone, and stretch the head, so that you pull the corrupted flesh downwards, and uncover the flesh above the place where you wish to treat, so that the treatment does not injure the flesh;
and place a hot iron or a heated blade under the bone to cut away the corrupted flesh;
and it is necessary to treat as much as one can see and feel the corruption, and to treat again another time.
And if the bone is corrupted, and is not visible, and the corruption is in the middle or in one part, then uncover all the flesh;
then place a hot iron underneath, and then treat from one part to the other the corruption, and let the treatment be a little longer than the corruption, as we have said;
and if the corruption is in the joint, then cut the corrupted joint, and treat the bone where it is contained on the other side;
and if the corruption is in the continuation of the two joints, then there is no other remedy than to cut;
and if the corruption is in the wrist of the hand, or in the ankle of the foot, this is a very serious matter, but nevertheless you must examine this corrosion, how it appears to you; and cleanse it in every way that you can, but so that the vein or the nerve do not hinder you;
and know that the incisors and the saws for cutting these bones are many, according to the position of the bones and their appearance, and their thickness and thinness, and their size and smallness, and their hardness; and therefore it is necessary to prepare for each type of work its instrument;
and know that the work will show you the instrument you will need, according to the knowledge of this art, and the testimony of the types of illnesses; so consider the instrument you need according to what is required.
The head rots either from an internal cause, or from an external cause;
and when you have treated that corrosion with the cure of medicines, and they do not help, then it is necessary to cut off that member up to the place where the corrosion comes, so that the patient escapes death by this, or the greater harm, from the loss of the member;
and the sign is that the member becomes black, so that it seems to be burned by fire, and rots after the blackness, then that corrosion goes from member to member, and takes over the whole body;
hasten yourself to cut, and if it is from the bite of some venomous beast, such as a sea scorpion and viper and the like, if the corrosion is at the tip of the finger, cut it off, and do not give it space to come down to the hand.
And if it comes to the hand, cut it at the joint, so that the corrosion does not reach the arm;
and if it comes to the arm, cut it at the elbow;
and if it passes the elbow, it is death, and no remedies are of use except the quantity of its virtue;
and do likewise when the corrosion comes to the foot: if it comes to the first joint, cut it after the other joint;
and if it comes to the foot, cut off the whole foot; and if it ascends in the leg, cut at the knee joint;
and if it comes above the knee, there is no other remedy than to leave the patient to die;
and the manner of cutting or sawing the member is that you bind it above and below, and one assistant stretches one of the ligatures downwards, and another assistant the other ligature upwards, and you separate the flesh which is between the two ligatures to a width of one span, until the bone is uncovered;
then cut or saw it, and place a linen cloth on each side, so that the saw does not touch the healthy area, and cause the patient further injury and another abscess.
And if profuse bleeding occurs while you are operating, cauterize the area immediately, or apply some styptic powders;
then return to your treatment until it is complete, then bind the injured member with a suitable ligature, and treat it until it is healed;
and I will tell you what happened to a man in his foot:
a blackness befell him which resembled a burn from fire, and this corrosion first appeared in his toe, until it affected the whole foot;
and when the man saw the corrosion, he hastened to cut off his foot, and was healed;
and a long time afterwards the corrosion returned in a finger of his hand, and he came to me, and I applied repercussive things after the cleansing of the body, and the corrosion could not cease;
and he wanted me to cut off his hand, and I did not want to, because I had hope of repelling the matter; and I also feared that if I cut off his hand, that he might die, because the man's strength was weak;
and he despaired completely, and returned to his land, and hastened to cut off his hand, and was healed;
and I have recounted this only so that one might do likewise, if one has need.
Sometimes an abscess appears in fleshy tissue, and remains so long that it forms a large collection of pus; and then breaks and bursts, and the pus escapes, and the place remains empty, like a vessel; and the skin that is above is as thin as a fine linen cloth, and does not reach down to the bone, nor to the nerve, and such an illness is called "Sain," and is not called "fistula";
but if it is so deep that it reaches the bone, then it is called a "fistula";
and the skin is such that you cut that skin all around, and especially when it is thin, like a linen cloth; and it will not heal because of its corruption.
And if you are confident that the skin will heal, and the corruption is not deep, and the skin is thick with flesh, then treat it with a clyster thus:
see if the pus is abundant, and the matter that issues from it has a foul odor, then clysterize it with Egyptian medicine which is made thus: take vinegar, and oil, and litharge, equally, and put to cook in a vessel over the fire, until the medicine is red, and becomes as thick as honey;
and then take of this according to your need, and mix it in water and honey, and clysterize the abscess, and extract the matter; and leave the medicine inside for two hours, then extract it by pressing;
do this many times, until the pus is purged, and the stench is removed;
and sometimes it is clysterized with lye, when this medicine is not present, and it is that you take ashes of vine wood, and pour water over it, then filter it, and clysterize with it, until you know that the abscess is well cleansed;
and if the patient cannot tolerate it, neither the Egyptian medicine nor the lye, then clysterize with water and honey in which there is a little crushed litharge; or you clysterize with honey and spiced wine, because honey has the property of cleansing and washing, and the wine helps to dry the pus;
and when you have done this, and you are confident that the abscess is well cleansed, then clysterize with that which causes flesh to grow in it, and it is that you take diaphinite plaster, and make it with rose oil and wine;
or you clysterize with certain medicines and ointments, of which I have described the properties in the treatise on ointments;
and if the opening of the abscess is small, and the nozzle of the clyster cannot enter, then widen it slightly with an iron, and insert a tent of Egyptian ointment, or basilicon ointment, until it is widened;
and if the wound is too large, then sew it and leave only a place where the clyster can enter, and if the opening that discharges pus is above, then cut it at the lowermost point that it is.
and if you cannot cut the abscess below as you wish, then prepare it in such a way that the pus flows to the lowest point that it is, for when the pus is deep, it does not allow flesh to grow there, and if you cannot cut the abscess below as you wish, then prepare it in this manner: that the pus flows easily downwards, and leave nothing of the pus;
that the pus flows easily downwards, and leave nothing of the pus; and take consolidating medicines to put on the abscess, and spread them on a linen cloth that covers the whole abscess; then cut forcefully at the opening of the abscess a little wider than before, then spread a smooth ointment on another cloth according to the size of the opening, and put it on the opening of the abscess to drain the pus, and do not remove the large outer cloth except once after many days;
and the one that is over the opening of the abscess, remove often to remove the pus, and know what flows from the pus, whether it is venom or little or much, or digested, or undigested;
and take care if the patient feels pain or not, and if there is an abscess or not, and when your medicine has been spread in this way and you see the nature that rises above the opening of the abscess, know that the abscess will heal, and health approaches;
and then unbind it in the morning, or on the third day, and when you unbind the wound, change to another cloth, and renew the ointment.
And if subtle venom flows after a long time, do not despair of health, for health approaches.
For there are men whose flesh regenerates slowly in their wounds, and others who do the opposite;
and if undigested pus escapes from the abscess after many days, know that the abscess will not heal;
and if the abscess is slow to heal, and is neglected, add drying medicines, moist in substance and dry in effect, such as diaphinite ointment, for it contains a large portion of vitriol, and it is the last medicine;
take diaphinite ointment, and it is made with rose oil, and rose water of old wine equal in substance;
then mix it and use it;
and this same is better cooked and thickened, when diaphinite ointment is not present, or you take myrrh and aloes and incense, and grind it, and powder it over the honey while it is over the fire;
and then glue a cloth to it, and spread it over the abscess, and sometimes one administers aristolochia longa, and roots of lily of the valley, which is like bean flour and centaury; and use it of simples or of compounds: grind them, and make a powder, and put it on the honey that I have mentioned, and use it;
and if the cure is prolonged, and is not cured by this cure, then know that the corruption is deep, and makes an impression on the bone, or on the hard parts, or on the ligaments; if the cure of the fistula is as we have said before.
A whitlow is an abscess that arises under the nail of the little finger of the hand, or of the foot, or perhaps arises in other fingers;
and when it is neglected, and no care is taken, then there comes a hot abscess, and it runs and throws out matter until it reaches the root of the nail, and perhaps it corrupts the whole nail;
and the corrosion reaches the bone, until there is foul pain, and the head of the finger is swollen, and its color is livid.
When you treat it as we have said in the division, and the treatment does not help, then you must cut away with iron all the superfluous matter that remains of the nail, then cauterize the wound afterwards. Cauterization is a great help if the bone is healthy, and the nail is healthy;
and if the nail presses on the flesh, and begins to prick and injure it, then you must put a thin instrument under the nail that pricks the flesh, and lift it, and cut that flesh subtly and lightly, and put on the remaining flesh burning and corrosive medicines to remove everything; then treat it with ointments until it is healed.
And if the corruption is in the bone, cut it and draw it out, for as long as the corrupted bone is there, it cannot heal;
and if you see the finger corrupt, cut it in an I shape as said before, then treat it until it is healed;
and if it is wounded and swollen, and it causes great pain, then you must heal it first;
then cut the nail of the big toe obliquely from above, and take care that the cut does not reach the flesh beneath the nail, for the patient would feel too much pain;
and if it happens, put something on it that soothes.
The extra fingers which grow on the hands of some men by chance are all fleshy, and by chance there are some where there are bones, and sometimes there is a nail, and some of them grow at the root of the joint, or their growth is in some of the joints of the fingers.
That which grows in any joint of the finger does not move, and that which grows at the joint of the finger, by chance moves;
The removal of that which is fleshy is easy, in this manner: Cut it at its root with a broad spatula.
That which grows at the root of the joint is difficult to cure: then refrain from cutting.
For that which grows on the finger at the last joint, it is necessary that you first cut the flesh around to the bone, then cut the bone with a saw suitable for this, then cure it until it is healed.
The joining together that occurs between the fingers comes from birth, or from the joining of a wound, or from a burn by fire, or from similar things.
It is necessary that you cut that joining, so that the fingers return to their natural forms; then place between them tents or cloths moistened in rose oil, that they not join together; or you place between them thin pieces of lead, until the place is healed, as is necessary.
If a joining occurs to any of the fingers with the palm, cut that joining as is necessary.
Varicose veins are large swollen veins full of melancholic superfluities, which appear in many limbs of the body;
and it happens more in the legs of those who walk and work and carry, than in others.
Therefore, you must sometimes administer a purging of bile, and then bleed from the basilica vein.
The treatment with iron is according to two methods: one is that they are cut, and the black blood is drawn out; and the other method is that you open the vein, and draw it all out.
The incision is according to this method: first bathe the leg in very hot water, until the thick blood is thinned, then bind the patient's leg from above the thigh down to the part below the knee;
then cut the vein in one, two, or three places, with a wide cut, then raise and draw out the black blood with your hand, from one end to the other, until as much blood comes out as the patient's strength can bear;
and then bind it, and instruct him to abstain from foods that produce black bile;
and repeat the evacuation and bleeding when the veins are full, and it harms the patient.
The raising of him is according to this manner: raise the patient's leg, if there is much hair, then put it in the bath, and pour hot water over the leg until it becomes red, and the veins swell;
and if you do not have a bath, then heat it by the fire, and then cut it along the vein from the knee to the ankle;
then open the skin with an instrument, and scrape the vein on each side, until it appears when one feels it;
and it is seen red and black, and when it enters the skin it seems like a white cord;
then push a tool underneath, until it is raised from the skin, and then lift it slightly with the instrument, then cut it in another place above three fingers;
then scrape the skin over the vein until it appears, then lift it with the tool, as you have done, and lift it with another instrument, as you did before;
then cut another incision, or several if you need to, then lift it, and cut it at the toe, then pull and lift it to the second incision;
then pull it from incision to incision, until it is all out, then cut it;
and if you cannot pull and lift it, then put a needle with a strong double thread in it, and tie it and pull it, and put a tool underneath, and turn your hand from one side to the other, until it comes out; and be careful that it does not break, for if it breaks, then one cannot pull or lift it, and it causes harm to the patient;
and when you have pulled it all out, then put on the wound wool soaked in wine and rose oil; and treat it until it is healed.
And if the face is contracted and twisted and wrapped together, and it is not straight, as we have said, then you must forcefully split it, but not cut it; and pull it out as we have said before.
The shape of the iron with which one cuts the face is curved, and does not cut, lest it cut the vein;
and is of a large curve, for if it were thin, it would cut the vein, but let it be thick as we have said, and here is the form:
This vein is generated in legs, in hot places where no herbs or trees grow, and in earth where there is no moisture;
and perhaps it arises elsewhere than in the legs, and this happens from the corruption that comes from under the skin, just as serpents and worms are generated between skin and flesh.
And if the sign of the beginning of this vein is that a very great inflammation comes in the leg, then the place changes, and the vein begins to emerge, like the root of a plant.
When the head appears, you must wrap around it a piece of lead of one and a half to two fingers breadth, and tie it, and leave the lead hanging from the leg, and every time that something comes out, wrap it around the lead and tie it;
and if it is too long, cut off a part, and wrap the remainder, and do not cut it at its root, until it is completely emerged; for if you cut it, it returns to the flesh, and causes abscess and corruption in the place, and a serious illness;
because of which it is necessary that it be treated little by little to the end, and that nothing remains in the body;
and sometimes this vein, when it is treated, is five palms long, or ten, and a man once came to me, from whom it protruded ten palms long, and when you cut it, put a probe into the hole, and pierce it to the bottom, so that everything comes out;
and let the matter that is inside be emptied, and apply to the place medicines preventing corruption for a few days, then cure it like abscesses.
And sometimes this vein has many roots, and especially when it appears in the joint of the foot, or in the foot, and many holes come from it, and from which pus escapes;
cure it then as we have said before.
of the worms which are born between skin and flesh This illness is called in our land "ox disease", because it often happens to oxen, and it is a small worm which is born between skin and flesh, and goes throughout the body rising and falling, and one feels it well going from limb to limb, until it breaks the skin where it goes, and pus escapes;
and is engendered by the putrefaction of certain humors, just as worms and serpents and lumbríci and ascariḍes come in the belly;
and one doubts its malice, for when it goes through the body, and it rises to the head, and it comes to the eye, by chance it enters, and destroys the eye; and this happens many times.
When you see it to cure and draw, then one cannot know except when it moves:
then it is necessary that you bind the place above and below with a strong ligature very tightly, then cut above and draw it forth, and if the worm is deep in the flesh, and you do not find it, then cauterize it with fire above, until it dies;
and the greatest harm that it does is that it runs to the eye, as we have said;
and if you see it coming in the head near the eye, then press down firmly on the eyebrow below it, then cut above, and draw it forth;
and it is necessary to treat the patient with body cleansing using purgative medicines for the putrid humors, and to warn him against foods engendering putrefaction.
Of the pain that comes from flatulence This illness is called "vakirir" in our land, and is a pain that comes in some limbs, and then moves from limb to limb;
and I saw what I tell you. I was called to a sick woman, and she uncovered her arm, and I saw a small swelling in the vein of the arm;
and shortly afterwards, I saw it climb like a worm to the shoulder, faster than anything, like quicksilver when it runs from place to place;
the pain departed from that place, and settled in the shoulder, and then a little later ran through the whole body, until it came to the other arm;
then she told me that it constantly turned around her body, as I saw it.
I greatly marvelled how it moved thus from limb to limb, for I had never seen this illness in this manner. Nevertheless, I had seen many who had felt pain move from place to place, but I had not seen it as I saw it in the woman;
and I thought that it was because the woman had a dry body, and the veins uncovered, and because of this that constrained windiness appeared;
and it does not appear for the same reason in those who are plump, and who have moist bodies and covered veins.
And when you wish to cure this illness, and the patient feels this pain, if it appears as we have said, then bind it above and below hastily, and then cut above until that constrained windiness escapes from the place. and cauterize the place;
and if you do not see it with your eyes, then cure it with that which expels windiness, such as fetid pills, and pills of serapinum, and similar others.
Arrows are diverse, according to their appearances and according to the places of the body where they lodge.
The diversity of them is that there are some which have large points, and small ones, and barbed ones, and smooth ones; and of those which have two angles, and of those which have tongues, and of those where there are pieces;
and that which lodges in a limb lodges in two ways: or in a principal member, such as brain, heart, liver, lung, kidneys, intestines, bladder, and similar members. When it then lodges in any of these members, and the signs of death, which I will tell you afterwards, appear: then you must beware of extracting this arrow, for death follows in many ways; and when these bad signs do not appear, and the arrow is not deeply embedded, then I draw it, and treat the wound.
And the signs of the brain when the arrow falls there and pierces the bone, and the pia mater which is on the brain is injured, are: scotoma and thirst and dizziness and redness in the eyes, and inflammation and redness of the tongue, and spasms and confusion of understanding, and vomiting of bile; and perhaps blood issues from the nostrils, or the ears; and perhaps he loses speech and voice; and there issues from the wound a white moisture resembling pus, and also something like shredded flesh;
and if these signs appear, abstain from treatment, and remove the arrow if it is not inside.
The signs that the arrow has reached the heart are that it is near the left breast, and it feels as if it were stuck in something hard, not empty; and perhaps the arrow moves like pus, and dark blood flows, and there is coldness and cold sweat, and syncope: know then without doubt that death approaches.
And the signs that the arrow has injured the lung are that frothy blood comes from the wound, and the throat swells, and the patient changes color, and sighs deeply and seeks cold air.
And if the arrow strikes the covering of the chest, it is near the lower ribs; and he breathes heavily and is in great pain and sighs; and all the muscles of his shoulders move.
And if the arrow strikes the stomach, perhaps something of the undigested food comes from the wound.
And if the arrow strikes the belly, and some dung comes out through the intestines, there is no hope of cure, nor of extracting the arrow.
And if the arrow strikes the bladder, and urine comes out mixed with pus, and the patient feels great pain: know that the wound is mortal.
The other members, such as the face and the neck and the throat and the shoulder and the arm and the spine of the back and the ribs and the thighs and the legs, and similar members, are safe according to various dispositions. When the arrow is in the nerve or the artery, and it is not venomous, as I will tell you happened to me, so that you may do likewise.
It happened to a man that an arrow struck him in the tear duct at the root of the nose: I probed it, and drew it out from the other side under the fat of the ear, and he was healed without harm.
And I drew out from a young man an arrow which struck him in the fatty tissue of the eye beneath the eyelid; and the arrow was lodged, and I could only reach the point towards the shaft, and the arrow was as large as one from a Turkish bow, with a light iron head without barbs;
the young man was healed, and no ill effects came to him.
And I drew an arrow from the throat of a Christian, and the arrow was an Arabic one with barbs:
I sawed off the barbs, and worked so delicately that I drew it out, and the Christian was healed.
And I drew an arrow from a man, which had fallen into his belly, and I thought that he would die;
and then when he had passed thirty days, his condition did not change; I cut the arrow, and grasped it, and pulled it out forcefully, and there was no bad accident.
And I saw a man to whom an arrow fell in the back, and the wound was closed over;
and the arrow remained inside him, and he did not change his natural disposition, nor did he find harm in any of his natural functions.
And I saw another man, to whom an arrow fell in his face, and the wound was closed; and it remained so without suffering great pain;
and many other similar cases.
And I extracted an arrow from a man of the king's princes, which had fallen into his nose, and was slightly leaning to the right side; and the arrow was completely embedded.
I was called to treat it after it had fallen three days. I found the wound very narrow.
I searched it with a very thin probe, and did not feel it; and he felt a prick and pain below his right ear.
I thought that it was from the point of the arrow. I put on the spot a digestive and attractive plaster, so that the place would not swell; and the location of the arrow appeared to me.
and the location of the arrow appeared to me. I put the plaster there many days, and the wound healed again, and the patient remained thus a long time, until he felt the arrowhead one day inside his nose;
and he told me so. I put a corrosive, sharp medicine on the wound for many days, until it was open, and I probed it, and felt the head of the arrow which was sticking in the place;
then I added to the opening of the wound with that sharp medicine, until the head of the arrow appeared to me visibly;
and the time passed well for about four months, and then I widened the wound so that I put in the forceps, and moved them from one side to the other, and it could not come out;
then I did not cease to refine and devise various instruments, until I grasped it one day with well-made forceps, according to what its form will show at the end of this chapter, until I pulled it out, and healed the wound.
And the physicians judge that the cartilage of the nose cannot be restored: I restored it then, and the wound was healed, and the patient was completely cured.
Now I have told you the quality of the extraction of certain arrows, so that you apply your care to that which I do not mention, for the book cannot encompass everything;
but the wise master considers even a small thing, and from what is present and lacking, finds new work, and a new instrument, for the treatment of strange things that happen in this art.
I say that arrows do not exit the limbs into which they are fixed except according to two methods: either through the place where they entered, or through another place;
and that which leaps out through the place where it entered, that is an arrow entering fleshy places, and sometimes leaping out immediately.
And if it does not leap out immediately, leave it until the flesh is rotten around it, and the exit is easier;
and also if it is fixed in the bone, and it cannot come out, leave it thus for some days, and move it each day;
and then it will leap out, and if it does not leap out, pierce around it with a thin drill, until the place around it is widened, and then pull it out.
And if the arrow is hidden in the body so that one cannot see it, then search for it with a tent. and if you feel it, then pull it out with a suitable instrument;
and if you cannot [do so] because of the narrowness of the wound, and because of the depth of the arrow, and there is no bone, nerve, or vein, then widen the wound so that it is large;
and pull out the arrow if you can, and if the arrow has barbs by which it holds, then remove the flesh which is attached on two sides as much as you can, and then break or bend the barbs of the arrow, until you can pull it out;
and be careful that you do not break the arrow, for you would pull it out more painfully.
And if you cannot [pull it out] at once, then leave it until the surrounding area is rotten, then pull it out, for the extraction will be easier. And if the flow of blood hinders you, then administer what we have said of the treatment in its chapter;
and beware of cutting the nerve and the vein, and devise how you can pull out the arrow without danger, whether quickly or slowly, or firmly or gently;
and place the patient in the position he was in when the arrow entered him, for that is the greatest help there is, and if you cannot, then place him according to what the signs show you.
The arrow that comes from another direction, where something of it appears, or the skin is swollen where it is clearly seen or felt:
then cut above, until the forceps can grip it, and then pull it out: if it jumps out immediately.
And if it is lodged in the bone, turn your hand round and round until it enters the bone, and widen the bone, then pull it out.
And if it cannot come out, leave it for a while, and then resume the extraction until it comes out;
and if the shaft of the arrow is there, pull it out with the shaft;
and if the shaft breaks, and you wish to administer pulling, then use a suitable instrument, so that the point of the arrow enters the head of the instrument;
and then pull it out, and if the arrow is broken, use an instrument with a point entering inside, to facilitate the extraction.
And if the arrow is poisoned, you must cut all the flesh around where the venom is, if you can, then treat the wound as is necessary.
And if the arrow lodges in the foot or in the belly or in the bladder or in the side, and it is close, and you can cut above it, cut there;
and beware of cutting the vein and the nerve, and then extract it, and then sew the wound, if necessary; and treat it until it is healed.
The shape of the forceps with which arrows are pulled is similar to a bird's beak, and here is the shape:
And there are many kinds: large, medium, and small, according to the size of the arrow.
The shape of the pushing head is like the feather of a bird, to push at the point of the arrow, as the shape is here:
There are thirty-one veins from which one is bled, of which there are sixteen in the head, namely: Two temples which are behind the ears, which are called the two "herbech"; and the two arteries which are apparent in the two temples; and two veins which are in the two tear ducts of the two eyes, which are called "aspires"; and the vein which is in the middle of the forehead; and the vein which is at the top of the nose; and the two jugular veins which are in the neck; and the two veins which are in the upper lip of the mouth, and these are the veins which are called "augeherich"; and two veins which are under the tongue.
The veins from which one commonly bleeds are five in each arm:
one is the cephalic, and is on the left side, and the lay people call it "vein of the head"; and the middle one is called "median", and is composed of the cephalic and the basilic, and the lay people call it "vein of the heart"; and the basilic is on the right side, and the lay people call it "vein of the belly", and it is on the forearm, and it is the one from which one bleeds, which appears manifestly on the wrist.
And the salvatella is the vein which is between the little finger and the ring finger, and it has two branches;
and in the leg and in the foot are three veins: one is below the bend of the wrist on the left side, and the second saphenous which is at the ankle on the right side; and the vein which is called "nessa", which is in the ankle of the other side;
and in the other leg are three veins below those.
Bleeding from the veins that are behind the ears helps with old catarrhs, and with migraine;
and the quality of the bleeding, as I tell you, is that you raise the head of the patient, and rub the place where the veins are with a rough cloth; then the patient constricts his neck with a bandage, until the two veins appear behind the ears in two places hanging down from the head: then prick them with your finger, and where you feel the pulse under your finger, bleed from there;
then take the lancet, and put it under the vein down to the bone, then lift your hand with the vein upwards, and cut both the skin and the vein well two fingers across, and let out blood as much as you wish;
then constrain and bind it, until it is healed;
and I have already discussed incision and cautery in the first book.
Bleeding from the two arteries that are in the two temples, is good for chronic migraine, and a stiff neck, and habitual ophthalmia, and a running of the eyes;
and the qualities of the bloodletting are as I said: and it is that the patient constricts his neck, until the two veins appear clearly; and feels the pulse under your finger, and then bleeds from there;
then raise the skin above the vein upwards with your index finger, and place the lancet underneath, and raise the vein upwards, and cut it, as you have done in the other two veins, and let the blood flow according to your needs;
then untie the patient, and place your finger on the vein for an hour, then apply cotton; and then bind it tightly, and leave it until it is healed;
and we have already spoken of their cutting and extraction, at the beginning of the book.
Bleeding from the vein of the forehead is as effective as bleeding from the cephalic vein for old facial diseases, and for migraine, and for redness;
and the quality is that the patient strains his neck by twisting, until the vein appears; then take the instrument which is called "fossor", of which here is the form:
And place the point on the vein, and press down with your hand, or something else, and let the blood flow out according to the quantity you desire; then untie the patient's neck, and bind the vein until it is healed, and sometimes the work is done with a wide blade.
However, it is not necessary that the blade be too sharp; and cut across, for the bone is near, and perhaps the blade breaks when it is thin.
Bleeding from the two veins that are in the two temples helps the eyes, and ringworm, and redness, and hordeolum in the eye, and diseases of the face;
and the quality of their bloodletting is that the patient strains his neck by twisting with some linen, as before;
then bleed him, and let the bleeding be across, a little bit of the length of the blade a little wide, for there is no flesh there. And if the blade is thin, perhaps it will break;
then make the blood flow, as much as you need, and then bind on cotton, and bind it well.
Bleeding from the vein of the nose is good for fever, and for madness, and for facial diseases, such as migraine and redness that comes in the face, especially when it is old;
and the quality of the bleeding is that the patient constricts his neck, then holds his nose with his left hand, and takes a long, thin blade, and inserts it into the lip in the space that is between the two nostrils, for the vein does not appear well there, and the blood will immediately begin to flow;
and do not go too deep, and make the blood flow according to your need, then bind it for one night, for it is very quickly restored;
Bleeding from the two temples helps with the constriction of the throat, and at the beginning of leprosy, and with many illnesses, and with impetigo, and with canker sores, and with herpes, and with fistulas;
and the quality of the bleeding is that the patient constricts his neck on one side and the other, as we have said;
and let the master stand over the patient's head, and the patient sit on a seat, then open the vein lengthwise a little widely, then draw blood moderately, or as much as is necessary;
then do the same in the other vein, then untie the ligature, and bind both veins moderately, so that the patient does not strangle; and leave it until morning, so that the wound is healed.
Of the bleeding of the lips Bleeding from the veins of the upper lips helps with a boil in the mouth, and with corruption of the gums, and fissures of the lips, and of the nose and around.
And the quality of the bleeding is to make the patient sit before you, and constrict his neck as I have said; then turn the lip, and look at the two veins, of which one is on the right lip and the other on the left, and they are known because they are black, and because around them are small black veins:
cut then one and the other, and if you do not know them, and you are in doubt, then cut the largest on each side, and do the same with the two veins that are above and below, for it is the same method.
Of the bleeding under the tongue Bleeding from the veins that are under the tongue helps after bleeding from the cephalic vein, and it is for the constriction of the throat, and for diseases of the uvula, and for diseases of the mouth;
and the quality of the bleeding is that the patient sits between your hands before the sun, and lifts his tongue, and you look underneath on each side for a black vein:
bleed then one and the other, and do not go too deep, for underneath are the arteries.
The veins of the throat from which one commonly bleeds are bled according to two methods:
either by pricking with a flat, myrtle-wood lancet, or an olive-shaped, slender one, like a cutting knife, and it is called "anesil"; and they are wide and slender according to the width and narrowness of the veins. The shape of the myrtle-wood lancet is very renowned, and is wide as you see:
And it is needed to open hairy veins full of thick, apparent blood, and which contain thick and turbid blood; and this is the shape of the olive-shaped lancet:
and it is more slenderly pointed, and is for bleeding the slender veins, where there is thin, citrine blood.
Bloodletting from the basilica vein, which is one of these veins, helps with illnesses that are below the throat, and in the neck, and in the chest, and in the belly;
and it is necessary for the bleeder that he bleeds wisely, and that he guards against the artery which is underneath. And if he cuts the artery, and a flow of blood comes, then it is necessary to staunch it, as I have said; and the lancet should not be pointed, but cutting like a chisel.
And if the basilica vein does not appear clearly, then it is necessary that you search for it, and choose another; or you seek some branch of it, or you bleed in its place the vein in the middle of the arm: it appears clearly; and cut with the lancet-chisel, as we have said.
And if you wish to know the place of the bleeding, it is necessary thus that you extend the arm, that you touch the place until you feel the pulse; then mark the place with ink, and then bind the arm, and cut the vein with the lancet-chisel; and beware that you do not strike the artery when you see the place swollen, for it is the artery: wipe it then.
And if you see it spurt upwards like the urine of a child, and the blood is red and thin, know that it is arterial blood: hurry then, and put your finger on it for a long time, then remove your finger if the blood stops, which often happens; if it is the arm, bind it up, and leave it so, and the patient should not move it;
and let it be on account of fear, and do not move it until it is healed.
And if the blood is not stopped, and it overcomes you, and medicine is not at hand, then cut the artery if it is visible, for its end retracts; and stop the blood.
And take a piece of the bark of a fig tree, and split it, and take one of the halves and bind it on well until the next day;
if the blood stops, it is well; if not, then treat it, as we have said, with powders that stop blood;
and the stopping is not difficult in many situations because of the small size of the wound, and the strength of the ligament of the arm.
The bloodletting of the vein in the middle helps because it draws blood from the head above and from the body below, because it is composed of the basilic and cephalic veins, as we have said;
and it is necessary for the bleeder that he be careful of the nerve which is below, and if he punctures too deeply, and he finds the nerve, and it swells and the bleeding is difficult, and perhaps cannot heal;
and this nerve appears many times, and if it does not appear in some men because of its subtlety, then it is necessary that you bleed it with a blunt instrument; and avoid the nerve to your ability.
And if there is a vein between the two nerves, then cut it lengthwise.
Bleeding from the cephalic vein helps, as it draws blood from the head, and helps the eyes;
and it is necessary to bleed by pricking the olive-colored vein or the myrtle-colored vein, for it is the safest of all veins, for it has neither nerve nor artery beneath it. However, one must seek the lightest place, and it matters not if one misses the first time, and one tries again; and perhaps the place swells in some men, when one misses the first time, but it matters not.
The quality of the bloodletting is according to your judgment.
The first thing you must know about bloodletting is that bloodletting is administered only to maintain health, and to avoid future illnesses;
and let the bloodletting be done in one of the three veins that are in the arm: that is to say, cephalic, median, and basilic; and one should bleed at the beginning of spring on an empty stomach, and in autumn and winter after eating, when the signs of repletion appear;
and one should bleed on the first day or the third, after two or three hours of the day.
The bloodletting that is administered for illnesses has no determined hour, but when there is need, by day or by night, at all hours and at all times;
and one should not bleed children until fourteen years, nor a woman carrying a child except from the fourth month until the seventh. Nor should the elderly who have passed sixty years be bled.
And when someone wants to be bled, in whatever manner it may be, it is necessary that he cleanse the intestines with a light clyster, if he has much retained feces, so that the veins do not draw from the intestines the putrid superfluities harmful to the principal members;
nor should one bleed him who is too full of food, nor who is drunk, until he is sober, nor dropsied;
and one should beware of bleeding after colic, vomiting, and diarrhea, and excessive intercourse for women, and labor, wakefulness and fasting, and anything that diminishes strength, either of mind or body;
then thin the humors, if the blood is thick, by foods and drinks and medicines, if you have the power to do so;
then enter the bath, if nothing prevents it, to thin the blood, and bleed from the vein of the arm around the third hour, as we have said;
and on that day guard yourself from work and exertion and lust and similar things;
and be calm and cheerful, and let the bleeder be higher than the one being bled, and let him rub the arm two or three times, then tie the bandage moderately above, for when it is too tight or too loose, the blood cannot flow;
and then rub the place with your hands until the veins swell and are felt;
then the bleeder moistens the lancet with a little old oil, then places the finger of his left hand on that vein below the place a little where he wants to bleed, so that the vein does not flee and fail when struck.
For there are veins that flee like strings when bled, and there are some that are full of wind, so that when one puts the lancet to them, they retract from the lancet and the vein cannot be opened, and so it is with those; and if he opens the vein, the wound is too narrow, therefore the bleeder must be skilled in these things.
And if the vein opens the first time, it is good; if not, then begin again a little below that place or above hastily, if the place is not swollen.
And if the place is swollen, and the patient is frightened, leave it a day or two, and do not bind the arm: by chance an abscess will come there;
nor enter the bath, then begin the bleeding again if it pleases him;
and if the opening is small, or the blood flows subtly and you doubt that there will not come out as much blood as you wish, then thrust into that same opening with the whole blade straight;
and work a little quickly, before the place is swollen; for this happens many times, when the wound is small.
If you see the place swollen, do not begin bleeding again, and put on a little oil of lead, for it lightens the body of the blood, and lead is milder in this place than oil;
and thus administer the oil of lead in each bleeding that you bleed the veins, to staunch the flow of blood;
and the same does theriac and ox-dung, when one puts it on the place; so it thins the blood and disperses it when it is too thick.
And if a large abscess forms there, which happens many times, especially when it is not bled sufficiently except at that time when the opening of the vein is small, hasten, and apply to the place a sponge soaked in water and a little warm salt, and hold it for an hour;
and you must do this after the issue of blood from the vein, and if there remains in the place after some days some blackness or greenness, it does not harm; and if you wish, put on something of aloes or myrrh mixed in juice of calamint, mint, or the like.
And many times an abscess and appearance occur at the bleeding of the basilica vein:
then put your hand on it, and if you find the place soft to the compression of the hand, then that appearance is bad. Avoid therefore that you put on anything of what we have said, for perhaps it cuts off the artery;
but make him a dry plaster to harden the place, then treat it with another treatment, until it is healed.
And draw from each one blood according to the quantity of his strength, and the color of the blood.
For if the blood is black, let it issue until it is red; and if you see it thick, let it flow until it is thinned; and if it is too hot, let it cool.
And it is necessary for one who is full and strong, and needs bloodletting, that a larger wound be made for him, and the lancet be wide;
and for one who is weak, do the opposite, and he should bleed little and often, and one should bleed him by cutting across, not by pricking;
and this manner of bloodletting is safe from the flowing of blood and the cutting of nerves, and is better than bleeding lengthwise or across.
And to one whose body fails during bloodletting, one should give bread soaked in pomegranate juice; if he is heated, draw blood three or four times. And if he is of a cold complexion, let him eat before bloodletting bread soaked in spiced syrup, or in aromatic honey syrup with spices, such as pepper, cinnamon, ginger, and chickpeas, and a well-scented syrup.
And if he faints during bloodletting, after the issue of much blood, then he should drink broth of meat, and subtle scented syrup, and use the other things that we have said in the division or chapter on syncope, for the evacuation of a vein.
And if he wishes to bleed his arm, and bleed another time, it is necessary, when he is weakened by great bloodletting, that he bleed little by little, according to the quantity of his strength continuously.
And whoever wishes to bleed his arm after the first bloodletting, and has a strong body, let him bleed seven hours after the first bloodletting, or after the ninth hour.
And whoever wishes to bleed from another place, should bleed on the second or third day.
For there is much blood within the body which is already heated, and causes fever; so it is necessary to draw a great quantity, and widen the opening until it falls into a faint; then when you consider all the conditions of bloodletting, and place your hand on his pulse while he is bleeding, that death does not come instead of fainting, and this happens many times, when the phlebotomist is negligent;
and it is not necessary when you wish to untie the arm, and make blood flow a second time, and the opening is closed, that you press strongly on it; nor if it is crooked, that he extend the arm hastily, for that would be bad;
but let him be until he bleeds a second time; or you prick it with the point of the lancet, until the blood which is congealed in the opening of the vein comes out strongly, and put on it a little salt dissolved in water, and press on it lightly.
And if the vein is swollen, leave it and do not bind it, until the abscess is calmed.
And if there is need to draw blood a second time, bleed him in the same place, or in another vein, or in the other arm.
The vein in the middle of the arm is bled in place of the vein of the head because it is composed [in the same way].
And the manner of bleeding is that the patient puts his hand in warm water, until the vein is red;
then it should be bound moderately, so that the vein appears well, then bleed it immediately across, not across the width nor the length;
and let the opening be wide, and bleed very near the joint of the hand, and if blood cannot come out, put the hand back in warm water, and let the blood run into the water, until you have enough;
and if it is summer, do not put the hand back in warm water, for it is put in more in winter than in summer;
and bleeding from this vein is safer than all other veins, because there is neither artery nor nerve there.
Bleeding from the salvatiella of the right hand is good for all liver diseases, and this is the manner:
constrict the hand, and put it in warm water until the vein is swollen, so that one can see it; and if it bleeds across, and if you cut it completely through, it does no harm;
and do not go too deep, for the nerves are underneath, completely bare of flesh, and then put the hand back in warm water, if the blood is congealed in the wound, and cannot come out.
And when you have drawn as much blood as is necessary, put oil and salt on the vein to quickly close it, and thus do for each vein.
Bleeding from the left hand is good for the illness of the spleen, and do just as I have told you for the right.
Bleeding from the saphena vein is good for all the illnesses that are below the body, such as illnesses of the womb, and retention of menstrual flow, and illness of the kidneys, and of the old thighs and legs, and similar illnesses.
And the quality of this bleeding is that the patient puts his foot in warm water, and rubs the vein until it swells, and ties above the joint of the foot; and the vein is at the ankle, and above the foot many veins go;
bleed then from the largest vein, or at the ankle, which is more effective.
And if you bleed it above the foot, beware of the nerves that are below, and bleed across as if cutting;
and let the blade be oiled.
And if the blood cannot flow out, put the foot in water, and let the vein empty well.
And if the bleeding fails the first time, begin again the second time a little higher up, for the place is salty;
do not fear the nerve, as we have said, and do the same for the saphenous vein of the other foot equally.
The location of the sciatic vein is at the heel, and bleeding it helps with hip pain when it is due to hot blood.
And the quality of its bleeding is such that the patient enters the bath, and squeezes above the heel with four fingers twisting, because otherwise the vein does not appear;
and if it appears, bleed it in every way that you can, and across; and it is better that you cut it, for the location is safe, and it is very well-known to many men.
and it is better that you cut it, for the location is safe, and it is very well-known to many men. And if you do not find it, bleed any vein that appears on the back of the foot, and towards the little toe, and beware of the nerves;
and make as much blood flow as you wish, and then untie the ligature, and apply cotton and bind it; it is now healed.
Cupping glasses are made of horn, or of brass, or of glass;
and cupping is done in two ways: either by cutting and drawing blood, or without cutting.
And this cupping which is without cutting is done in two ways: either it is with fire, or without fire;
and cupping which is done by cutting and by extraction of blood is done in fourteen places of the body, of which one is right on top of the head; and the other is in the middle of the neck; and two others on the two sides of the neck; and the cupping below the chin; and the cupping of the two shoulders; and the cupping above the buttocks; and the cupping between the two arms; and the cupping of the two legs; and the cupping of the two ankles;
and cupping does not draw blood except from the small veins that are scattered in the flesh, and therefore it does not weaken one, as bloodletting from a vein does; and it is not necessary that it be administered, either with fire or without fire, in any illness that comes from repletion, until the whole body is emptied.
And if by necessity of illness it is necessary to cup, or by custom, then we administer it every hour at the beginning of the month, or at the end, and in the middle and at every time;
for there are some who, when they need cupping, have a heavy head;
and there are some who find repletion and redness in their face, and in their head, and in the neck, and darkness in their eyes;
and some who find a drop of blood in their mouth, and have a swollen tongue, and spit blood; and there are some who dream, and see at night blood and wounds and dead people and similar things.
And when we see these signs, and especially when it is mid-month, we order them to be cupped after three hours of the day.
Bleeding from the nose helps the headache… that comes to the eyes, and it is not necessary that this be after the evacuation of the whole body;
and this cupping is in place of bleeding from the cephalic vein, and it is not fitting that one who is of cold complexion use it, or who has a fever, for it does them much harm;
and therefore it is not fitting that the elderly use it, nor those who have cold illnesses in the head.
And he who bleeds often from this, becomes forgetful, and therefore it is necessary to place the cupping a little lower because of the fear of forgetfulness.
Cupping in the neck is in place of bleeding from the head and the basilic vein, and therefore it is good for tightness of the chest, and for the splitting of the lung passage, and for coughing, and for repletion;
and it should be applied lightly, for if it holds too firmly, it causes forgetfulness or harm to the stomach and heart.
Cupping at the two ribs of the neck is good for headaches, and ophthalmia and migraine, and for strangulation, and for pain at the roots of the teeth, and is in place of bleeding from the basilic vein;
and you must instruct the bleeder to extend the patient's arm when applying the cups so that he does not cut the artery and cause excessive bleeding.
Cupping under the chin is good for mouth diseases, and for corruption of the gums, and similar diseases that are in the mouth; and is in place of bleeding from the two lips.
Cupping of the shoulders is good for illness that comes from heat and fullness.
Cupping of the sides is as good as the three veins of the arm, for it draws blood from those large veins;
and instruct the bleeder not to go too deep, for the place is bare of flesh, and underneath are nerves and arteries.
The cupping glass that is on the rump is good for hemorrhoids of the fundament, and for illnesses below, and it is necessary that the cupping glass be large, and be of bronze, that it needs to draw well; and perchance, if it were thin, it would break; and it makes large wounds.
Cupping glasses on the legs are manifestly healing, for they draw blood from the whole body, and are good for old pains of the kidneys, and of the womb, and of the bladder, and they restore the menses;
and are applied to the two shinbones, and the two ankles, and yet they weaken the body after long use, and cause fainting in many instances.
The manner of applying the cupping glass is that you first place it empty, and suck moderately, and place it quickly, and move it evenly, and do not cease doing this until you see the place red and swollen, and the redness of the blood appears;
then heat, and reapply the cupping glasses, and take heed of the constitution of the bodies, for there are some who have tender flesh and open pores: then it is necessary to strike only once, and it is necessary to make wide wounds, and somewhat deep; and suck lightly.
And if the blood is thick, it is necessary to strike twice: the first time to refine the path of the thick blood.
And if the blood is very thick, it is necessary to strike a third time;
and when we want to draw blood little by little, one time is sufficient. And if we want a lot of blood, we begin again often;
and if the blood is thick, strike deeply, and the limit is that the heart should be pierced suddenly, and it is necessary for those who have thick and hard skin, and who have narrow pores, that you anoint the places of the cupping glasses with aperitive and dissolving oil: if it is in summer, with violet oil, or almond oil, or pumpkin seed oil;
and if it is in winter, with cress oil, or lily oil, or chamomile oil, or something similar.
And if the superfluity is thick and cold, take marjoram oil, or balsamite oil, or dill oil, and similar ones.
And if the one whom you are treating has tender flesh and large pores, then it is not necessary to put on any oil, but it should be washed after cupping with rose water, or cold water, or deadly nightshade water, or pumpkin water, or porcelain water, or something similar.
And the one who has much moisture, let him rise with vinegar, or myrtle water, and sumac, and similar things.
And those who have thick superfluities rise with old wine, or beet juice, or a decoction of dill or chamomile, or other similar things;
and one should not apply cupping before the bath or in the bath, but after the bath one hour or two;
and do not sleep after cupping, and it is necessary that he be cautious, when he is to be cupped and when he has been cupped.
And beware if the one who is being treated is choleric, and if the blood is too sharp and inflamed; then he should take cold things, such as pomegranates and endives and lettuces with vinegar, and similar things; and eat chickens, and the flesh of a wether, and moist meats.
and eat chickens, and the flesh of a wether, and moist meats. And he who has a cold complexion, should take honey syrup, and moderately fragrant wine, which is between old and new, and eat little, and eat chickens and small birds and pigeons;
and on the day that he is bled, he ought to drink more than eat;
and it is necessary to give some men sometimes theriac or nutmeg before or after bloodletting, to strengthen the principal members; and let the blood be refined, but it is not necessary that those who are hot drink it.
The cupping glasses which are applied without cutting are those which are applied to the liver, and to the spleen, and gout, and to the belly and the groin and the kidneys and the hip, for those members do not tolerate being cut, and it is only done to draw blood from one member to another, just as we apply them to the breasts when the milk is abundant;
to remove the viscosity which is in the member, just as we apply cupping glasses to the belly and to the groin to soften the member;
and removes the pain, when there is obstruction or stone, and removes by its attractive virtue perhaps the obstruction, or dislodges the stone from its place;
and so it does when it is applied to the liver and to the spleen when there is retained flatulence, and these cupping glasses are applied empty only to suck; and sometimes are applied with fire, and sometimes full of warm water, as in diseases of the pleurisy, and in such a manner that one fills the cupping glass with hot water alone, or with water in which suitable herbs have been boiled.
The form of the cupping glass applied with fire is this:
And let it be two fingers wide and half a palm deep, and let it have on the side around the middle a small hole, as if to insert a needle, and let it be of bronze, smooth in front so that it does not injure the patient when placed on the limb;
and let it have in the middle a crossbar of bronze or iron, to place a burning candle in, and let there be large and small ones according to the diseases and the age of those who receive them;
for the cupping glasses of children are different from those of the old, and of the thin from the fat.
And one must thus place this cupping glass on the limb:
take the candle of wax or a liniment, and put it into the cupping glass across the bar which is in the cupping glass, so that the light is at the bottom of the cupping glass so that it does not burn the patient;
and then put it on the limb, and your fingers should be on the hole that we have mentioned, so that when one wishes, the vapor escapes, and one removes the cupping glass;
and one takes the liniment as before, and repeats it often, if you need to.
In the cupping glass then, which is administered in the illness of pleurisy, with boiling water, there is no bar or hole, and it is not administered except when it is full of water, and it is placed on the limb only;
and this is the method:
Leeches are administered only in limbs where cupping glasses cannot be placed because of their small size, such as lips and gums, and similar places; and in places devoid of flesh, such as fingers or nose, and others similar;
and the quality of the leech is that when you find leeches that are in clean fresh water without putrefaction, you take them;
and place them for a night in fresh water, until they are hungry, and have nothing in their bellies; and then let blood be drawn with a vein incision and cupping, then rub the limb until it is red, and apply the leeches;
and when they are full, and fall off, if it is a place where one can apply a cupping glass, apply it, for that is very helpful afterwards.
If not, raise the area with vinegar, and then with water, very well, and then wipe it;
and if the place bleeds too much after the leeches fall off, moisten a linen cloth in cold water, and apply it, until the bleeding is stopped;
and if the bleeding is profuse, apply crushed vitriol, or galls, and similar things, until it is stopped;
or you may put on the area halves of peeled beans, and leave them until they dry on the area, this will stop the bleeding immediately;
and if you need more, take other leeches.
And if the leeches will not attach, rub the area with fresh blood, or prick it with a needle until blood flows, and then apply them, and as soon as they sense the blood, they will attach;
and when you see that they fall off, sprinkle a little aloes and salt, or ashes,  they will fall off immediately.
Here begins the book of fractures. This chapter is often necessary in the art of medicine, and is the restoration of fractures and dislocations.
Know, dear son, that foolish men cast aside this chapter, for they have never seen any of the ancient books, nor read any letters of them;
and for this reason the science is neglected in our land, for I never found any good one;
and I know nothing, except through the science of the ancient books, in which I have studied so much that I have drawn the science from them, and by experiment, and by the custom of my life;
and I have described to you in this chapter that which is contained, and have abbreviated it at the end, and have clearly shown the forms of the instruments that are used, as I have done in these two chapters before.
It is necessary then that we say in the prologue of this book the sums of the speech and the chapters where the wise man puts his understanding, and dwells on the truth, so that those who are experienced may know and learn this noble art, and teach it to others.
I say that when a fracture or dislocation or torsion or bruise comes to anyone, it is necessary that you hasten to bleed the patient on one side and the other, if nothing prevents you, such as weakness of body, or a child, or an old man; or if the time is not very hot, or too cold;
and let him eat cold things, that is to say cold dishes, and the flesh of birds and of kid, and let him not drink wine, nor eat any fatty meats, and let him not fill himself too much with foods that fill the veins with blood, until you have no doubt of a hot abscess, or of the spread of matter to the limb;
then let the patient return to his former regimen that he had used.
And when the broken bones begin to restore, it is necessary that one nourish the patient with foods that give great nourishment, or that have viscosity, such as wheat cooked in water, and rice, and heads, and feet, and cow's paunch, and eggs, and fresh fish, and strong wine, and similar things. For with such nourishment, the broken bone mends and heals more quickly.
And know that the broken bones of old and decrepit people cannot be well mended or healed according to their nature because of the dryness of their limbs, nor those also that are too tender, such as the bones of small children;
but never mind, reset the broken bone with thick bandages which bind and join the limb together, until it is strengthened as it was before; and do not leave it undone, and for that reason it is necessary to nourish it with strong foods, as we have said.
And know that fractures are diverse in many ways.
For a fracture of the head is different from a fracture of the breast, or of the leg, and I will tell you in this chapter all kinds of fractures. For there is a fracture that goes across, and another in sharpening, like the cutting of a quill for writing.
For there is a fracture that goes across, and another in sharpening, like the cutting of a quill for writing. And there is a fracture with a wound, and a fracture with only a small fissure.
And each kind has its own device and its own instrument in restoration, according to that which the memory brings in its place;
and a fracture of the bone is known by this, that the place is twisted, and it appears clearly on the outside, and sounds when pressed by the hand;
and when there is no twisting or sound on touching, and the patient does not feel great pain, there is no fracture;
but there may well be twisting, or a fissure, or a small fracture. Then it is not necessary that you move it by hand, but apply the medicines that come next, and then bind it carefully.
And know that in a fracture that goes across, and the two parts are separated, it is necessary to set them evenly, before abscesses form there;
and if hot abscesses form, leave it for a few days, until the abscesses are calmed;
then set it evenly so that you can easily and wisely, and know that the restoration of this is easier than the restoration of one where there are pieces;
then bind it, as it is necessary hereafter.
And if in the bone there are broken pieces, extend it from two sides, if it is a hand or foot, or with your hand if it is a small member, or with two cords, or with one cord and your hand;
and put the member according to its natural form, so that when the broken parts of the member are separated, restore by all means the additions to their places as much as you can, and take care that by your work no injury or pain comes to the patient;
and join well the two ends of the bones according to the best forms.
And feel it well with your hand if it seems to you that it is not well:
if you straighten it nicely, and do not bind it too much, nor press it as those do who by their work cause a hot abscess and contraction in the member, as we have seen many times.
And when the member is set, instruct the patient well that he not move it, neither awake nor asleep, neither turning nor in any other manner; and ensure well that the member is so secure that it feels no pain. For when it feels any pain, it is not set, and it must be put in such a position that it feels no pain;
and ensure well that the member is so secure that it feels no pain. For when it feels any pain, it is not set, and it must be put in such a position that it feels no pain; and take care that it is set straight, that no crookedness comes when it is restored;
and the condition of the broken member is according to what I tell you.
Know that broken members are diverse in smallness and in size and in form.
For there are small members, such as arms and fingers and similar: then it is necessary to wrap with soft and fine linen cloths; and those that are large, such as thigh and leg:
then it is necessary to wrap with a wide and strong linen, because the wide linen embraces the whole large member, and constricts it equally on all sides, so that there is no lump;
then tie around light tow, three or four turns according to the member, and tighten your hand a little around the linen, then go above the fracture and tighten less, so that the fracture may slightly separate the fracture;
and soften the linen little by little, until you take a large part of the healthy area, then take another linen, and turn around again on the broken area;
then return to the part below the fracture, and tighten moderately, neither too strongly nor too weakly, as we have said in the first chapter above;
then place between the linens linen tow or cloths, until it is all even, then tie all over it a bandage, and then apply your well-made splints, if there is no abscess or swelling.
And if there is swelling or abscess, then apply something that soothes a hot abscess, and which reduces the swelling, and leave it so for a few days;
then tighten your splints, and let them be half of a wisely sawn broad cane, or of wood from which one makes wedges, or of palm branches, and let them be according to this figure:
but it is necessary that the splint that one places on the fracture be a little thicker and wider than the others;
and let it also be as long as is necessary for the limb, small or large; then tighten the splints as you did with the first binding, then bind over it a suitable thread, as in the first binding over the fracture; tighter above, always less;
and it is necessary that the threads be moderate, neither too thick nor too thin, and be of soft linen;
for if the threads are thick, as I have seen in the works of fools who make their bandages of twisted linen cords, and this is a great error, for the bandage cannot be even if it is too thin, and it is not necessary that there be less than the width of a finger between each splint.
And if the patient is injured by the ends of the splints after tightening in healthy places, put under them linen lint or carded wool, so that he is not hurt.
When the wound is with a fracture, and the bone is broken, I will tell the cure later.
And know that it is not necessary to bind all broken limbs with splints on the first day. For when the limb is large, it is not necessary to apply splints until after five days or seven, or more according to your certainty of a hot abscess arising;
And see here the manner of the ancient plasters for restoring fracture, dislocation, and torsion:
and it is that you take the flour that adheres to the walls of the mill, and cook it with plenty of egg, and apply this confection, neither too thin nor too thick, and use it, and this is the common manner of the plaster restoring the fracture in many conditions, and especially for women and small children, for it is neither too hot nor too cold.
Another manner of plaster restoring fracture and dislocation and torsion: Take 3 of bdellium and ladanum and enula and asafoetida and gum arabic and myrrh, of each 10 and 3; myrrh and aloes, of each 5 and 3; elecampane 9 and 3; and make it into powder, and mix it with egg white; If the man's complexion is warm, use this plaster, for it is of good composition, and quickly restores broken bones, and is valuable to many men.
Another kind of plaster that is good for a sprain: take comfrey and mallow, each 10 and 3; myrrh and aloe, each 9 and 3; acacia 6 and 3; Armenian bole 10 and 3, and grind well, and mix with water or egg white, and apply it.
Another type of plaster for joints and bones dislocated from their places, and soothes the resulting pain, and the damage done to the bone, and the fracture: Take new wool, and moisten it in vinegar and boiled oil, and apply it to the place.
This plaster does not restore, but it is good for soothing a hot abscess, and properly removes the pains.
Another type of plaster which restores broken bones: Take dried fig leaves and leaves of henbane, and grind them together, and make a plaster.
Another type of plaster for the restoration of a bone fracture and for diminishing the remainder of an abscess. Take mallow root, chamomile, violet flowers, bean flour, one part of each;
and grind, and mix with wine, and if the limb is inflamed, mix it with moist coriander water, or with water, and apply it.
Another type of plaster stronger than the first, when a hard abscess occurs in the restoration of a limb. Take mallow roots, linseed, balaustines, melilot, and comfrey, and violet and chamomile flowers, of all equally one part; and grind, and mix with salt water, or fresh water, or with wine, according to the heat of the limb, and its condition.
Hippocrates says in his book that one should not put anything on a broken limb for restoration except a cerate made of wax and oil, and nothing else, and says that it should be neither too soft nor too hard.
And Galen seems to think that one should put on a broken limb, for restoration, slightly warm dry things, such as myrrh and aloes and incense and similar things, as we have said.
Another type of plaster that is good for injury and pain: Take mugwort and cut human hair, or bird feathers, and mallow, and mix them equally, and grind them, and make a plaster and bind it on.
And then unbind it a little later, and take care that the patient feels no pain, and that the bone has not moved from its place; if not, unbind it in several days. And if pain or itching comes to the place, or restlessness or swelling, then hurry, and unbind it, and remove the plaster immediately;
and take a light cloth, and a moist sea sponge, and dip it in water, and bathe the place, until the itching ceases, and the pain is soothed; then let the limb rest for an hour, then put on dry wool, moistened in water or rose oil, and bind it on a nut, until you are sure of a hot abscess;
and the inflammation of the limb will subside, and the pain will be removed, then recommence the subtle binding, and a little of the plaster, and do not bind it as tightly as before; and continue until it is healed.
And if you see that the hot abscess, redness, pain, and swelling are completely gone, and you need a plaster and a bandage, then begin again, just as you did before.
And if nothing of what we have said comes to the limb, then do not unbind it before three or four or five or seven days; and sometimes leave it for twenty days, depending on what one sees, until the fracture heals, and the joining of the flesh approaches;
then restrain it more than before, and it will thicken its flesh, as I said before;
and if you see the place drying more than is necessary, know that nourishment cannot come there; then moisten it with lukewarm water, every time you unbind it, and that should be every third day, and soften the bandage a little;
by this work then nourishment comes quickly to the limb, and hastily amends what the foolish healers do, who bind the limb too tightly:
that is bad, and it is a dangerous practice, and I see nothing else than to leave it and to work correctly.
There are many kinds of fractures, and diverse forms, and the causes are varied;
for there are fractures that are made by the blow of a sword, and the neck breaks the whole bone down to the surface which is beneath the bone, just as an axe or a club does; and for this reason this kind of fracture is called "hache-like".
Or the sword cuts the bone from above without piercing, and this kind of fracture is called "absolute";
and the wound of these two fractures is large or small.
And if there is a blunt impact, or a split, or from a blow from a stone, or from falling on a stone, or from other similar things.
And if there is a penetrating fracture, which reaches down to the membrane which is under the bone, or which is on the bone, and this wound is either large or small.
And if there is a wound which is  recessed in the bone as fine as a hair, and the fissure is small, and for that reason this fracture is called "capillary";
and if the wound which is made either by striking with a stone, or by falling, or by a similar thing, and drives the piece of bone inwards, and the place is swollen as the caulkers do when they strike on the cauldrons; if the stone enters inside.
And this happens more to those who have moist bones in the head, like the heads of children;
and it happens in all these types of fracture that small pieces are separated like stars; and I will speak in its place.
And we recognize all kinds of fractures by the pulling on them, and the probing with probes, and by the corrupted flesh which is on top.
Hairline fractures are known by this, that when one has uncovered the bone, and one rubs the finger on it, the black fracture appears.
In the treatment of the fracture, pay attention to the accidents of the patient, and if you see any bad accident, such as vomiting of bile, and loss of consciousness, and stretching, and fainting, and acute fever, and the eyes protruding and reddening, and other similar things in many conditions, then it cannot heal without doubt.
And if you see no frightening accident, and you hope for salvation, then begin the treatment.
And when the wounded person comes to you first, and it is in winter, it is necessary to remove the bone before the fourteenth day, if you can.
And if it is in summer, then hasten to remove the bone before the seventh day, before the flesh under the bone is corrupted, and the accidents that we have mentioned occur.
And if the fracture of the bone reaches the membrane that covers the brain, it is necessary that you split the fractured part thus:
and it is that you take the head of the wounded patient, and uncover the bone in every way that you can, and on the surface of the wound as gently as you can, and if bleeding occurs upon uncovering the bone, or a hot abscess, help him with what is necessary, and it is that you fill the place with cloths soaked in rose oil; and let the wound rest until the hot abscess is calmed, and you are sure of the cessation of bleeding; then begin around the bone to remove it, and this is done according to two methods of working:
one method is that you cut with a narrow incision in front, and this is the form:
And then make another incision larger than the first.
And the second method is that you have a number of different incisions, some narrow and others wide, and they are pointed, and are of tempered iron;
and work lightly, so that you do not injure the head.
And if the bone is strong and hard, then you must pierce it around, before you administer incisions with trephines, not so deeply that they pierce through the skull bone, and it should have a rim or a circle above the point, which prevents the point from passing beyond the bone;
and you must have several, so that each comes in its place on the thickness of the bone, so that you have trephines for the whole head;
and this is the form of the three types of trephines:
The qualities for piercing around the fractured bone are that you place a trephine on the bone, and turn it with your fingers until you know that the bone is pierced;
then place the trephine elsewhere a little afterwards, and do so all around, then cut with the incisors the thickness of the bone which is between the holes, and do this as subtly as you can, and lightly, as we have said, until you remove the bone with your hand, or with some of the instruments that you have such as forceps, pincers;
and be careful not to touch the brain or the dura mater.
And when you have pierced and removed the bone, it is necessary that you smooth the remaining part of the bone with another instrument similar to an incisor, but it must be thinner and more subtle than the other incisors;
and if any small bones or scales remain, remove them lightly with one of the instruments; then treat the wound with tents and ointments as we have said.
And the other method of operation is that which Galen mentions, which is safer; and he praises it highly, and that is his word. First, you must uncover a part of the bone where the fracture appears, so that when you have uncovered that part, you will place under the head of this lenticular incisor, of which this is the form:
And do not cut on one side, and the part is sharpened on two sides, so that the cutting edge is towards the bone;
then strike with a small mallet above, so that you cut the bone lightly all around, and take good care of the membrane that is underneath;
if it is adherent to the bone, remove it lightly, for one can remove it well without harm and without fear.
And if the fracture of the bone does not reach the membrane, and the bone is cut only on top, and there are small pieces, then you must remove that roughness, and remove the splinters with a fine rasp of which you should have various sizes, to apply in each place the most suitable one, according to the work and the shape of the fracture.
Begin first with large rasps, and then with finer ones, and do not cease doing this until it is well.
In each of the other hairline fractures and subtle breaks, you must apply a remedy according to its requirement;
and this is something that is not unknown to one who has applied their study to this art.
And if the dura mater is exposed, you must take a linen cloth, according to the size of the wound, and moisten it in rose oil, and place it on the wound; then take another cloth doubled in two or three, and moisten it in wine and rose oil, and place it on the first cloth; and do this as gently as you can, so that you do not injure the dura mater, then apply another bandage over it, and do not bind it tightly except to the extent that it only holds the wound;
and leave it thus one or two days, until the swelling of the abscess is lessened, then unbind it, and apply medicines such as lily roots, and vetch flour, and incense powder, and birthwort, and similar things;
and of these things make a powder, and put it on the wound, and apply constantly cleansing medicines without biting [i.e., caustic].
and ensure that the wound is always clean, that you do not leave ointment there, nor allow pus to accumulate, for when pus accumulates on the membranes of the brain, it corrodes and rots them, and great harm comes to the patient;
for when one puts something biting on the dura mater, it blackens on top. Take care then, if any bad accident befalls the patient, as we have said, it is undoubtedly doubtful [i.e., dangerous].
And if blackening comes there only because of the medicine that has been put on, that has such a property, then you must take one part honey, and three parts rose oil, and glue one cloth, and put it on the dura mater; then treat it with the appropriate treatments, until it is healed.
Know that sometimes the two parts of the nose are broken above, or one by itself, for they are two bones;
and that below is cartilaginous, and does not break, unless it is bent or twisted, and then heals.
And if one of the two parts is broken, then you must put your little finger into the hole of the nose, and set the fracture inside against your index finger, and with the thumb outside, until the nose returns to its natural shape; and do this gently, and ensure that the patient does not feel pain from your work.
And if the fracture is in the upper part of the nose, and the finger cannot reach the place, then you must set it with the end of a somewhat thick stick.
And if the fracture is in two parts, do likewise, and hasten to restore it on the first day, if you can;
if not, after the seventh or tenth day, when the swelling of the abscess has subsided, then put into the nose tents of linen cloth, if the fracture is in one part.
Or you put one on the other side, if the fracture is there; and let the tents be so large that they fill the openings of the nose.
And some restorers say that one should moisten the tents in butter, and change them each day. It does not seem to me that this is good, but they must be moistened in a mixture of egg white and mill dust; then leave the tent until the bone is strong, and the cartilage hardened.
And sometimes one puts goose feathers in the nose instead of tents, and a soft cloth is wrapped around it, and the fracture is held, and the patient blows through it; or do whatever you wish.
And if hot abscesses come to the nose while you are working there, put cerate or cotton moistened in rose oil, or in a little diachylon.
And if hot abscesses do not come there, apply a plaster externally, of barley flour and incense powder, cooked with egg white, then put light lint on top, and do not bind the nose;
and if the fracture of the nose is small, and it is broken into small pieces, extract them with instruments suitable for this, then sew the fissure, and treat it with things that generate flesh and heal, such as suitable plasters and ointments;
and if there is no wound inside the nose, treat it with tents, and put lead cannulae in it, until it is healed.
When the jaw is broken below, and there is no external wound, and the fracture is only external, and it is not broken in two, except for splinters inside, this is easily recognized.
It is necessary, if the fracture is on the right side, that you put your index finger in the patient's mouth; and if the fracture is in the left jaw, put your index finger of the right hand, and gently put the fracture back in place, and adjust it with the other hand from the outside, and make it even.
And if the jaw fracture is separated in two, it is necessary that you administer extension from two parts, until they are even.
And if there is movement of the teeth, or breakage, bind them with a gold or silver or silk thread, then put cerate on the broken jaw, and put a double cloth over it; and over the cloth a well-made large plaster, or a piece of even leather, long and wide according to the jaw, and bind it on as well as you can, and instruct the patient to rest, and eat light foods.
And if you see that the shape changes, unbind it on the third day, and then readjust what has changed; and put a plaster on, of mill powder with egg white or bean flour, after you have removed the cerate;
and put light wool over the plaster, and if the plaster dries, and the patient's condition does not change, leave it until it is healed; often it is healed in three weeks.
And if hot abscesses come, administer what we have often said.
And if there is a fracture and wound together, see if any piece of the bone is removed; if so, carefully remove it with the instruments suitable for this.
And if the wound is narrow, widen it with a blade according to your need.
And when you have removed all these pieces, and none remain, sew the wound if it is large, and apply suitable plasters to it, to generate flesh, until it is healed.
The clavicle breaks many times in front, towards the shoulder, and the fracture is in three ways:
or it is broken and separated in two, and there are pieces, and it is the easiest to restore;
or there is a fracture with a wound.
And the procedure, when the fracture is without a wound, is that you have two assistants, so that one holds the shoulder that feels the broken clavicle; and the other extends the neck towards the part;
then set the fracture with your fingers, so that the shape is as it should be, and there is neither appearance nor displacement.
And if you need to extend further, place under the patient's shoulder a round bolster of cloth or wool, and let it be thick according to your need; and extend and lift the clavicle, and pull the bolster with your hand, so that you set the fracture as it should be.
And if you cannot pull the head of the clavicle outwards, because it goes in deeply, then the patient must lie often on his back, and place a medium-sized pillow under the shoulder, and the assistant pushes the shoulder down, until the bone of the clavicle is raised.
And then set the fracture with your fingers, and if you find it broken, then you must split it open;
and pull the pieces gently apart, and if the bone cannot join because of some overlapping, then cut it with one of the incisors that you have; but that you place this instrument under the clavicle, to protect the viscera:
and it resembles a spoon, and is not pointed, and should be as wide as is necessary, according to the size of the bone and the power of the work;
and it has two ends, as you see, and one is wide, and the other is narrow, as is the opening of the wound that you have made when you pulled the bones;
and when you are sure of a hot abscess, cut the wound open, and if the opening is small, or you suspect a hot abscess, then fill the wound with pledgets and tents, according to its size.
And if hot abscesses appear, moisten a pledget in rose oil and vinegar and wine, and apply it.
The binding of the bone, when it is without wounds and without cutting, is that you apply to the bone a plaster of mill dust and egg white, and place light tampons on top, and place a splint under the armpit, if you need it; then take a very wide bandage, a palm wide, then place a double pledget on the tampons and the plaster; then take a thin splint three fingers wide and long, and wrap it around that bandage, so that the end of the bandage is hanging; and place the splint on the fracture, and turn the bandage over the neck, and under the healthy armpit, and under the affected armpit; and tighten it on each side, and when you see that the binding holds the fracture properly, and you clearly see that the splint does not move on the broken bone, then examine it each day, and when the binding loosens, then tighten it;
and make the patient lie on his back, and place a small pillow under the armpit while he sleeps, to raise the shoulder; this will lighten the fracture of the collarbone by easing the shoulder, or you bind his arm to his neck, and do not unbind it unless a bad accident occurs, up to twenty days;
then renew the plaster, if you see that it is needed, and tighten it and leave it so, until it is healed;
and it is healed at most in twenty-eight days, and in less time for some men.
Of the fracture of the shoulder
It happens that the shoulder breaks either on the wide side or in the middle, and one does not know it except by touching;
then set it according to the nature of the fracture, and reset it according to its natural form, in every way that you can;
then put on the place mill powder with plenty of egg, and light tampons, and put on a double cloth; then put on a broad and thin splint, a little wider than the shoulder, and if the hair is sticking out in any place under the splint, fill that hair with linen tampons, so that the splint sits evenly;
and then bind it all tightly with a large bandage, so that the splint does not move from its place, and examine the binding each day;
and every time that it loosens, then tighten it, and make the splint even if it is out of place, and let the patient lie on his side;
and the shoulder is restored in twenty or twenty-five days.
And when this number of days is complete, then unbind it, and be sure, for it is not a bone that easily dislocates.
And if a piece of the bone protrudes forward, and points below the heart, then cut it open, and remove it, and do what we have said in the fracture of the clavicle to appease a hot abscess.
of the fracture of the breastbone
The breastbone is sometimes broken in the middle, but this happens rarely; but it often breaks at the end.
And when it is broken in the middle, it inclines downwards, and the patient feels great pain, and shortness of breath, and quickly, and perhaps vomits blood, and the hair appears in the broken bone, and one feels it well.
And the restoration is that the patient lies often on his back, and one places a cushion between his shoulders, then presses the shoulders, and brings together the ribs of the two sides with your hands, and subtly makes it even in every way that you can, until the shape of the bone is as it should be;
then put on plasters and lint over the broken bone with fine salt, or other light wood, and wrap it in a cloth, and tie it over the broken bone, so that it does not move; and turn the bandage round to the back, and tighten it properly, and check every hour the bandage, and if it loosens, then tighten it;
and if it is necessary to untie it, because of corrosion or itching that comes to the place, or pain or abscess, then hasten, and untie it, and remove the plaster, and treat what has come there in the manner of treatment;
then replace the plaster, and tighten it until it is healed.
Of the fracture of the ribs
Know that the fracture of the ribs only happens in the large spaces behind the back, and at the front, and they only bend because they are slippery; and one feels it well on examination with the fingers.
And the restoration is that you set the fracture evenly, as is necessary. And then apply the plaster, and bind it with a bandage, if you need to.
And if the rib fracture is inward-leaning, the patient feels very great pain and pricking, like pleurisy, because the bone pierces the lung; and breathes with difficulty, and quickly vomits a great quantity of blood, and this is a serious condition, and the ancients have applied great skill to it.
And there are some who say that one should administer foods that inflate the belly, in order to push the fracture outward.
We do not do this, lest hot abscesses form there, if they have not already formed. And if they have formed, then treat them.
And some of them say that one places cupping glasses on the area, to strongly draw out, and this seems reasonable; however, there is doubt that the cupping glass might draw superfluities to the area due to the weakness of the constitution.
And some say that one should cover the area with wool soaked in warm oil, and place tents between the ribs to evenly distribute the pressure around, then it should be treated with the treatment for pleurisy, with food and medicine.
And if the patient feels such great pain that he cannot bear it, due to the bone that pierces the lung, and the patient is in doubt, then it is necessary to cut over the area of the broken rib, and it is necessary to place an instrument beneath to guard the pleura;
and then one should cut the bone, and draw it out gently, and then sew the two edges of the wound, if it is large, and treat it with plasters, until it is healed.
And if a hot abscess develops, then apply cloths soaked in rose oil to the area;
and treat the area meanwhile as is necessary for an abscess, and let him lie often on the side where it is, until it is healed.
and also in the spine of the back.
And when this happens to someone, and you want to know if he will be healed or not, then observe if you see his hands softened and swollen and dead, and he cannot move or extend them, and when you prick them with a needle, he does not feel it.
Know that he is mortally wounded in many ways, and if he moves them and feels well when they are pulled and pricked, know that the joint of the bone is safe, and that the patient will be cured, if care is given.
And if a similar thing happens to the spine of the back, and you want to know if he will be healed or not, then observe if the feet are softened, and if the symptoms are there that are in the hands, and on his back there is flatulence and involuntary defecation;
and when he is turned on his stomach, involuntary defecation occurs. And when he is turned on his back and wants to sit up, he cannot. Know that he is mortally wounded: then do not labor in his cure.
And if these symptoms do not occur, the condition is less serious.
And the cure is that you observe if there is a hot abscess, then apply rose oil or egg yolk oil to the spine until it is calmed;
then apply one of the comforting and drying plasters, and bind it with a bandage, and instruct the patient to rest; and do not sleep on that part where he feels the pain, until he is healed.
And if any bone is separated, it is necessary to cut above the heart; and remove the bone, then join the two edges of the wound, if it is large, with a suture, then treat it with an ointment that generates flesh, until it is healed;
and if the head of the bone is broken, which is called the "cow's head", if you put your little finger of your left hand there, and set it even with the other hand as best you can, then apply the plaster and the splint on top, if you need it;
then pull it out, and if there is a separated bone, cut above it and remove it, and treat the wound until it is healed.
Of the fracture of the hip bone
It rarely happens that the hip bone is broken, and if it does happen, it is only a slight reduction at the head; and it splits lengthwise, and inclines inwards, and the patient feels pain in the area, and pricking, and the broken part swells.
And the restoration is that you extend your hand above, until you are over the fracture; and know what the fracture is and its form;
and if the fracture is only at the head, then set the fracture evenly, until it is of its natural form.
And if the fracture is lengthwise, or it inclines inwards, then make the patient lie on his stomach, until the resetting of that fracture is prepared for you. And when you have set it evenly, then apply the plaster, then place a splint of wood or horn, and bind the fracture so that it does not move;
and fill the space under the ribs, until the sides are even. And instruct the patient to sleep on his healthy side, or on his back.
And if hot abscesses appear there, do not touch them until the hot abscesses are subsided, and apply what we have said before; and then return to the reduction, and bind it as is necessary, if there is no bad accident;
Of the fracture of the shoulder
The shoulder joint is that which is between the elbow and the head of the shoulder, and if it is broken, then one must restore it according to one of two methods:
one of which is that you take a straight stick of moderate thickness, according to this form:
And tie two cords to the two ends, and hang them upwards, and let the patient sit on a seat;
then throw his broken arm onto the stick, until it reaches the armpit, and let there be a curve of wood in the middle, then hang some heavy thing or let the attendant stretch it downwards;
then let the physician set the fracture equal with his hands together, until the fracture returns as it should.
And the other method is that one suspends the patient on his bed, and ties his hand to his neck, then commands two attendants that one hold what is above the fracture with his hands, and the other hold below with a cord, and each stretches to his part.
And if you want the traction to be stronger, then pull a cord below the fracture, and above the fracture, and let each of the attendants stretch to his part.
And if the fracture is close to the head of the shoulder, then you must put a cord in the middle under the armpit, and another towards the elbow, below the fracture;
and also if the fracture is towards the elbow, then you must put a cord lightly there, without effort, until the fracture is even above the place, and above the elbow;
then set the fracture evenly, as is necessary, and pull it, if hot abscesses do not form there.
And if hot abscesses form there, then do not pull it until seven days, and apply wool moistened in vinegar and rose oil, until the hot abscesses are calmed;
then pull it, and the manner of pulling it is that you put the plaster on the fracture, then assemble the arm to the shoulder, and put your hand on the shoulder or on the breast;
and put the cloth, and pull on the shoulder and on the arm, so that the arm is in its proper place, if nothing prevents it, or if the bone is not moved.
And if you doubt that the bone might move, then use splints, and put on the fracture one splint wider and stronger than the others, and let there be one finger's breadth of space between each splint, and let each splint be so large that it surpasses the fracture by three finger breadths on each side;
then pull on the splints, as I said at the beginning of the chapter on the fracture, more strongly and less by moving away.
And if you see the placement of the splints, and the binding, as we have said, at the time that you reset the broken limb, and you fear a hot abscess, then leave it to heal until the seventh day, as we have said;
then examine every three days the binding, that itching or swelling does not come there, or that nourishment cannot come to the limb because it is too tight. If so, correct it, as we have said.
And if no such accidents occur, then do not unbind it except after three days or more, and let the patient sleep on his back, and have his hands on his stomach;
and place under the shoulder one cushion filled with wool evenly, and check every hour of the day or night, that the shape of the broken limb does not move, or that the bandages are not loosened;
then set it right by the power of medicine, and give him the food that we have previously mentioned, in such a way that the food is at first light; and when he begins to recover, let it be thick.
And it is customary that the shoulder and the leg should be healed in forty days altogether; and then one should unbind it and administer baths and ointments to heal the place.
And if the constriction is serious and swollen, it takes fifty days or two months to unbind.
of the fracture of the arm
The arm is composed of two bones, which are called the two "fosciles," of which one is small, and it is the one that follows the little finger;
and the other is large, and it is the one that is underneath, towards the little finger;
by chance the large foscile is broken alone, or the small one, and by chance both together.
When the small foscile is broken, the restoration is easy, and the healing;
and when the large one is broken, the healing is difficult, and more serious than when both are broken together.
If it is the small foscile that is broken alone, then it should be slightly extended a little, and set even.
And if it is the large foscile, then it should be pulled harder;
and extend it on a cushion, and hold the little finger of the hand higher than the others, and the little toe lower than the other toes, and let the patient be crossed over himself, and a cushion in front of him higher, so that the patient suffers no hardship;
then let the attendant extend his arm to the lower part of his hand, or to a sling, and another attendant to the other above.
And then let the physician set it even, according to its best form.
And if in the fracture there are pieces, then put each in its place, and if there is any separated that touches the heart, and you cannot restore it to its place, then cut above and remove it, as we have said before.
And if with the fracture there is a wound, I have spoken of it in a separate chapter; then take care of it.
And if at the beginning of the resetting, hot abscesses occur, then glue a cloth of cerate made of rose oil and white wax, that is neither too hard nor too soft; and bind the cloth on subtly, until the hot abscesses are calmed.
And then remove the cerate, and apply the plaster of the mill's powder with plenty of egg, then apply the splints, and let the splint of the fracture always be stronger, and a little wider than the others;
and know that there should be six splints on the arm in several positions: whether the fracture is in one of the bones, or in two;
and pull more on the fracture than elsewhere, and always less as you move away, as I said at the beginning of the chapter; and let the cloths that are on the fracture be soft and moist, and not hard or rough;
and let the cloths that are on the fracture be soft and moist, and not hard or rough; and let the thread, with which it is bound, be of linen, neither too thick nor too thin, as we have said.
And examine the limb and the binding after a few days. And if any bad accident occurs to the limb, such as itching that comes to the limb, then you must wash the limb with warm water, until that itching is appeased;
and do not let the limb rest tightly bound.
And then recommence the binding, and if the binding is loosened and the bone dislocated, and similar things, then redress it.
And take care that nourishment can reach the limb, for if it is too tight, you must loosen it a little, and leave it thus for a few days, until nourishment flows to it, and then tighten it.
And if none of these things that we have said happens to the patient, then do not unbind it until twenty days.
or around, then hang his hands around his neck, and let his neck be straight, and beware of movement and fidgeting, and sleep on his back;
and know that this fracture is healed in thirty or thirty-five days, and perhaps in twenty days, according to the compositions and complexions of the humors.
Of the fracture of the hand
Know that on the back of the hand and at the knuckles of the fingers, few fractures occur, and only sprains happen many times.
And when the palm of the hand is broken or sprained, the patient must sit cross-legged, and sit straight in front of him evenly;
then he places his hand on a stretched cloth, and the assistant extends the broken bones, and aligns them carefully, until they are well-joined;
and applies the plaster and lint, if no abscess forms, then applies a splint according to the size of the area; and it should be wrapped in a linen cloth.
And if the fracture is on the inside around the palm of the hand, make a sling of cloths, and instruct the patient to hold it to his broken palm; and then tie it with a long cloth, and let the splint be soft leather as large as the palm of the hand, and tie it as needed.
And if the fracture is on the outside, you must place one splint on top and another underneath on the palm, so that the hand is open and straight, then tie it all around the hand, and tighten the binding between the fingers.
And if the fracture is in any of the bones of the fingers, if it is the little finger, set it straight as needed; and bind it with the palm, and if you wish, place a small straight splint to lift the fracture, and it should not move;
and if the fracture is in the other fingers, such as the index finger or one of the others, set it straight and bind it with the healthy finger next to it; or you bind them all together in an "I" shape, whichever is better, or you place a splint on top, as with the little finger;
and take care in the restoration and arrangement of a hot abscess, and treat what comes from it, as I have said.
The bone of the thigh is often broken, and one sees it well when it turns front and back;
and the restoration is that one binds one linen above the fracture, and another below. And the patient lies on his face, then each attendant extends his linen to his part equally;
and this is when the fracture is in the middle of the bone.
And if the fracture is close to the root of the thigh, let one of the linens be towards the groin, and the other linen below the fracture.
And also if it is near the knee, then let the linen be near the knee, and let the extension be below;
then let the surgeon set the bone straight with his two hands, until it is according to its natural shape, and then apply the plaster, and bind it, if no abscesses form.
And if there is a hot abscess, let it subside, then return to your work and your treatment; The bandage is made in this manner.
It is necessary that you wrap around the fracture a firm bandage doubled two or three times, and the excess remains, then turn the leg until the heel comes to the root of the buttock, and place a long thread between the thigh and leg, near the knee below, and let the ends of the thread come up above;
then turn the bandage up the leg and up the thigh, then place splints on the fracture, and place a splint on the bone of the leg;
then fill the empty space between the leg and thigh with soft cloths to make the constriction even, then begin to bind firmly three or four turns around the fracture; and the higher you go above the fracture, the less you constrict;
then take the two ends of the thread that you placed between the leg and thigh, and tie the three splints that are above, then return below to the end of the thread, until you come near the foot;
and constrict it so that it does not move from its place, then leave it thus, until neither abscess nor swelling nor anything similar appears. And if it should occur, then unbind it, and treat what appears, as we have said many times;
and if there are pieces of bone that protrude, it is necessary to remove them, if one can; and if one cannot, then it is necessary to split the place, and pull out the splinter; and treat it as we have said, until it is healed.
And sometimes the thigh is broken so that splints are applied, as in the shoulder and arm;
nevertheless, in the restoration thus made the patient does not limp.
And know that the thigh is restored in fifty days, or a little less or a little more, according to the diversities of complexions.
Know that in the kneecap there is rarely a fracture, but it bends many times.
And if it breaks, it is only a fissure, or a hole, and it happens with a wound and without a wound, and this one feels well.
And the restoration is that one puts what is round equal to its fingers, until it is assembled as much as one can;
then put the plaster, and put a round splint on it, if you need it, and bind it as is necessary, then observe all the procedures that we have mentioned in other fractures, such as a hot abscess and other similar things; then apply to each condition what it needs, until it is healed.
Of the fracture of the leg
Know that in the leg there are two bones, of which one is called by right name "tibia", and the other is called "fibula";
and the same fracture occurs as in the arm, and therefore the restoration is the same as that of the arm, and the procedure is identical. And if the two bones are broken together, then the leg turns in all directions.
And if the thin bone is broken, it turns forward.
And if the large bone is broken, one feels great pain, and one sees it well; and it turns downwards.
Then administer extension, and set it straight, and bind the splints evenly;
but however, if the fracture is bad, and there are several pieces, the extension must be less and lighter; and lighten it according to your ability.
And when you have completed your work, take two wooden splints that encompass the leg on one side and the other, and are the length of the leg from the knee down;
then wrap around them two places with a bandage above and below, and bind it in the middle also, and with this binding the leg will not be able to incline to the right or to the left, and thus it is well;
and some administer a splint the length of the leg, which is made of wood, and in it they place the leg to prevent movement, and this is properly done in a fracture where there is a wound;
and move the leg each day, to see if there is a hot abscess or other complication; then treat it until it is healed.
of the fracture of the bones of the foot
At the ankle, fracture does not occur, but at the bones of the foot fracture sometimes occurs and in the toes also, and there is nothing but a crack in many situations.
And if a fracture occurs in the bones of the foot, and you see these bones overlapping each other, then have the patient put their foot on the ground, as if they wanted to walk, and then immediately place your foot on theirs, where the bones are raised, then press it until they return to their place;
then apply the plaster and lint, and place under the sole of the foot a small board with two full sides, then bind it to the foot properly, after you have wrapped cloths around, and other things that you need.
And when three or four days have passed, untie the bandage, for you will find the bones even, whether they were broken or dislocated.
And if any of the toes are broken, restore them as we have said for the fingers of the hand; then place on the broken toe a splint along the length of the toe, and let it be a little wider, then place under the foot that board that I have mentioned, and bind it properly;
and if there are two or three, or more, broken, then place on each toe a splint according to its size, wrapped in a linen cloth, and bind the board under the foot; and let it be resting on the end of the board above the instep, so that it holds it well.
And you must not forget the other things that I have said about other fractures, as we have said; and treat each accident as is necessary.
of the fracture of the bone of the wrist
When the bone of a woman's nature is broken, make her sit upright, then incline her towards her back, and let her be held from behind;
then fill the woman's genitals with cotton, and put in it as much as it can hold;
then stand the woman up, and raise her back little by little, and then the cotton will come out, until it reaches the entrance of the genitals, and the bone will return with the cotton;
and when she wants to urinate, remove the cotton, and when she has urinated, put it back, and do this for seven days or so: the fracture will be healed, and if you wish, take a sheep's bladder, and tie a string to the opening, and put the whole bladder into the genitals; then blow forcefully into the string, until the bladder is inflated inside; the fracture will then be healed;
then it should be filled with cotton, and leave it like that for a few days, until it is healed.
And when the bone of a man's or woman's wrist is broken, restore it as we have said for the hip bone;
and these fractures are not hidden from one who applies himself and practices, and understands my book.
For the fracture signifies in several ways the right way of restoration: understand it then.
In the penis, when it is broken, take a goose's gullet and put the penis in it; then wrap cloths around it, and leave it for three days or so, and it will be healed quickly.
of fracture with wound
It is necessary for one who has a fracture with a wound, especially if it is large, such as the bone of the thigh or shoulder or similar, that he be healed immediately, so that the healings that we have mentioned testify to it.
And if the wound heals, then staunch it with vitriol, if you have nothing else, then begin again to restore the fracture at that same hour, or that day, if hot abscesses do not come.
And if hot abscesses come, then leave the restoration until the ninth day, until the abscesses are calmed, and do not touch it on the third or fourth day, for you would cause bad accidents.
And if the broken bone is apparent on the uncovered heart, it is necessary that you put it in place lightly with your hands, with slight extension.
And if extension is not sufficient to set it with your hands, then reset it with this instrument which is of iron, which is seven or eight fingers long, and the width is according to the size of the wound; and for this it is necessary for the physician that he prepare three or four, according to what he needs for each treatment of a fracture;
and let it be round and somewhat thick, so that it does not bend under compression on the limb in your work, and let it be pointed in front, and thick from the middle forward, thus:
And it is called a "palainche," for which reason the curved head should be placed on the head of the apparent bone; and push it at once, until it returns, and is even one against the other. And if the fracture is subtle, and the instrument cannot well grasp the bone, then you must cut the head of the bone, until the instrument has power over it.
And if you cannot reset the bone, as we have said, then cut it with an instrument suitable for this, whether incisor or saw, to your ability;
then clean that which remains on the bone of roughness and small splinters.
And when the bone is reset, and the patient feels great pain afterwards, know that it is not in its natural place.
So work until it is in its place, then moisten a cloth in black styptic wine, and cleanly if it is in summer; and do not put on the wound cerate or anything else containing oil, lest it cause putrefaction and corruption;
then administer lint when you have reset the bone, and leave the wound uncovered, and cut the covering all around, according to the size of the wound, and take good care that the wound is not constricted with the fracture;
and many times foolish surgeons have done this, and have caused the patient either death or sometimes corrosion; and let the bandages be softer and more gentle than for other fractures.
And if the wound is bad or large, and you fear that bad consequences may arise, as we have said, and you find pain in the place, then you must not put lint on it; but wrap around it, instead of lint, stiff cloths, and bind them.
And when you see after one or two days pus forming at the wound, remove everything you have put on with wine, and apply a wound-healing ointment, such as tetrafarmicon ointment and similar.
And you must unbind the limb twice a day, morning and evening, until it is healed and sound.
And it is necessary that the limb be positioned in such a way that the pus flows down easily.
And if many days pass, and it cannot heal but repeatedly produces pus, know that there are small pieces of bone, wherefore it is necessary that you clean the wound with a tent, and remove all those detached pieces that cause this pain.
And if a fistula forms at the site, or another kind of corruption, then you must treat it, according to what is said in the chapter before this.
And when the bone is broken, and protrudes from the limb, such as the bone of the thigh or shoulder, and similar large bones, do not pull it out, for many times death results, but leave it until it rots;
perhaps it will fall out by itself after twenty or thirty days, then cure the wound, if you can;
and if you cannot, then leave it.
We often see them after the healing of the fracture, especially when it is near the joint, and it is an ugly thing to see the shape of the limb; and perhaps the limb cannot perform its natural functions.
Take care then if the wound is fresh: if you administer styptic medicines, such as aloes, incense, and myrrh, and sarcocolla, acacia, and similar others, so that you take some of these things, or all together, and mix them with styptic wine or with egg white or with vinegar; and apply them to the wound on tampons, and bind it well, and do not unbind it for several days;
and apply them to the wound on tampons, and bind it well, and do not unbind it for several days; and then unbind it, and begin another, until the inflammation is gone;
or you bind on a well-made piece of lead; for the property of lead is that it removes all swellings from the limbs;
and if the inflammation has already turned to hardness like stone, and it is necessary to remove it, then cut it away, and remove the apparent excess; or you shave it with a razor, until it is removed, and treat it until it is healed.
of the limb which is weak after healing
When the fracture of the bone is healed, and the limb remains weak and thin afterwards, this happens for many reasons: one of which is because it was bound too tightly, and was not bound as it should have been; or because there were too many bandages, and nourishment could not reach the limb; or because of a multitude of applications; or because of too much movement, not at the proper time; or because he has little blood in his body, so is weak.
And the treatment is that you make the patient eat, and make the body supple, until the blood is multiplied in him; and administer baths, and give him joy and happiness;
then put poultices on the limb, so that the poultice draws great nourishment to it, and irrigate it often with warm water, until the nourishment flows to the limb; and returns to its natural form.
of the limb twisted after the healing When the limb is twisted after the restoration, and the broken bone is apparent, and the shape of the limb is ugly, nevertheless it does not lose its natural function:
do not believe the fools who say that one should break the limb anew, and many foolish physicians have done this in our land;
and this practice is blamed, and great harm comes from it, and perhaps death;
however, if the knots and the twists are fresh, it is necessary that they be bathed with warm water, or softening herbs be cooked, such as mallow leaves, and roots, and melilot, and similar things;
and make a softening plaster, such as well-made diachylon, and you take the mucilage of mallow, and cook it with hen grease or linseed oil, and make a plaster thereupon;
or you take fat figs, and crush them with pigeon dung, and similar medicines that soften the swelling.
And sometimes the knot is removed by continuously and for a long time rubbing with wet hands. And let movement be given to the limb every hour.
And if the tortuosity is old and hardened, like stone, and needs to be removed with iron, then it must be cut to the bone, with a sharp scalpel lightly; and put skill and diligence into the treatment.
Dislocation is the departure of a joint from its place, because of which it cannot move, and the limb is misshapen, and the patient feels great pain and great injury.
When a dislocation occurs in someone, it must be immediately reduced without delay.
For if one delays, the place swells, and perhaps one reduces it with difficulty to its place;
therefore it is not fitting that one moves it at the time that it is swollen: many times it causes spasms and other pains;
however, when this happens, bleed the patient, then leave him until the abscesses are calmed;
then bathe the limb with warm water and oil, then gently reset it, and treat each limb as it comes back into its place.
And I have ordered the chapters on dislocations from the head to the feet.
It happens that both jaws are dislocated, and the dislocation of both is according to two manners: or they are a little removed from their place, and softened a little; or they are completely dislocated, and hang towards the breast, and saliva runs from the mouth which he cannot hold, nor can he close his mouth, and his tongue is involved with the speech.
When the dislocation is small, it returns by itself in several positions.
And if it is complete and accomplished, then you must reset it quickly, and not delay;
and in such a manner that the assistant holds the head of the patient, and puts his finger of one of his hands into the root of the dislocation of the mandible inside the mouth, if the dislocation is on two sides; and the other two fingers of the hands should be outside, to make it even;
and instruct the patient to soften his jaws, and move them in all directions. And the finger puts it even, until it returns to its place.
And if bringing it back is difficult, especially if it is the two mandibles together, then soften them with warm water and oil, until you can easily reset them;
do not delay in resetting it, as we have said.
And when they are equally reset, and the patient's mouth closes well without softening, then apply cloths soaked in cerate made of rose oil and wax, then bind it lightly with soft bandages;
and let the patient sleep on his back, and his head should be between two cushions, so that he does not move it neither to the right nor to the left, nor does he strain to speak, but take light food, until the pains are removed, and the mandibles are healed;
and then he may eat what he wants lightly, and he should not strain to open his mouth to eat and drink, until the mandible is well healed and sound.
And if the two mandibles cannot be reset at once, and are not restored to their place, then fever and accustomed swelling ensues, and perhaps looseness of the bowels, and perhaps vomiting of pure bile.
And when you see this, then know that it is a loss; and many times he who experiences this dies within nine days.
The clavicle cannot be dislocated inwards towards the rib cage and breast, and is sometimes dislocated outwards, and this is easily felt.
And the restoration is such that the patient lies often on his back, and extends his arms; and then press the place firmly with your palm, and it will return;
then apply the plaster and bandage it, and hold it tight;
and the head which is towards the ribs cannot be dislocated; except perhaps a little, and if it dislocates sometimes, then reset it in its place, as we have said;
then apply the plaster and bandage it, and hold it tight, and instruct the patient to rest until he is healed;
and in the same way is the head of the shoulder reset, when it is separated from its place.
Of the dislocation of the shoulder
Know that the shoulder is dislocated only in three ways:
one of which is that it dislocates towards the armpit below; and the second is towards the breast; and by chance it dislocates upwards, and this happens rarely;
and it does not dislocate backwards towards the shoulder, nor inwards towards the nerves;
and it often dislocates downwards towards the armpit, especially in those who have little flesh, for in them it leaps out quickly;
in those who have enough flesh, it leaps out with difficulty, and returns with difficulty.
And by chance it happens to some men that there is a percussion or fracture, and the shoulder swells with a hot abscess, and one thinks that it is dislocated because of this.
It is necessary then that you test it, until you are certain; and then begin the treatment.
And the dislocation is known when it is lowered towards the armpit, and it makes a difference between the diseased shoulder and the healthy one, and you will find a manifest difference between them; and you will find at the head of the shoulder a hollow, and under the armpit, on touching the head of the shoulder, as if it were an egg; and the patient cannot bring his hand to his nose, nor move it in any way;
and also, if it is dislocated upwards, it is not hidden, for you find it manifestly on touching;
and this kind of dislocation is not difficult to reset, when it is recent, or if the child is ill.
And the method is that the minister raises the hand of the patient upwards, then places his knuckles under the armpit, and raises the joint forcefully upwards into place; and the minister raises the hand, and extends it upwards, then puts it underneath; it will come quickly.
And if it does not come as we have said within a few days, then it is necessary that the patient be bathed in warm water; and the minister a softening and soothing poultice, such as a decoction of mallow and fenugreek and melilot in water, and let it be administered;
then let the patient be placed on his back, and let a wool pad of equal thickness be placed under the armpit, neither too soft nor too hard, then let the physician place his heel on the pad, and lift the head of the shoulder skillfully, and pull the patient's hand;
and another assistant hold the patient's head so that it does not move downwards; that shoulder returns immediately, and if you wish, reset it in this manner:
and it is that you cause to be present a man who is larger than the patient; and let him be straight towards the side, and put his shoulder under the armpit of the patient, and lift the armpit upwards, so that the patient hangs in the air; and another assistant pull the patient's hand downwards towards the belly. And if the patient is too light, let him hang with some heavy thing, and the dislocation returns immediately.
And it is reset also in another manner:
and that is, one sticks a long firebrand in the ground, of which the head should be as round as a pestle, and should be neither too thick nor too thin; then it is placed under the patient, but let there be soft cloths on top, and let the patient be lying along the length of the wood;
then let his hand be strongly stretched downwards on the other side, and the joint will return to its place quickly;
and if it does not want to return for all these things that we have said, then do this treatment: take a firebrand two arms long and four fingers wide, which has a round head to enter deeply under the armpit, according to this form:
then tie soft cloths on the head of the wood, so that the wood does not injure the patient, then place it under the armpit of the patient;
and extend his arm along the length of the wood, and tie the shoulder to the wood, and the arm at the wrist, then place the arm on a rung of a ladder of suitable width, and let the hand be extended downwards, and let the body hang on the other side: the joint will return immediately.
And when it is in, in whatever manner that may be, it is necessary that you place under the armpit an even wool ball, then apply the plaster prepared from mill dust, with incense and egg white, over and around the whole shoulder, then bind it firmly under the armpit, and turn the bandage over the plaster, and embrace the hand to the neck, and let the hand remain thus.
And it is necessary that he eat little, until the limb is strengthened, for it will heal faster;
and then eat more after five or seven days, and move it; and if it is firm and not softened, it is healed.
And if the joint is out of place because of moisture that has come there, or for another reason, it is necessary that you administer cautery to three holes, as it is set forth in the chapter on cautery.
And if you do all this, and it loosens after seven days, and the joint does not hold, and he cannot raise his arm upwards, then know that the nerves at the head of the shoulder are cut or stretched or softened; and know that the joint will never be fixed in its place.
The dislocation which is towards the breast and nipples, or behind, is caused by pushing and stretching of the hands, and another treatment is administered there;
and treat until it is healed.
And if after healing there is stiffness in the limb, and slowness in movement, let the patient use a bath many times, until that stiffness is lessened, and returns to its former nature.
of the dislocation of the rib
Know that the joint of the rib is dislocated with difficulty, and returns with difficulty;
and it is dislocated on all sides, and especially in front and behind, and the dislocation is not hidden, for one sees it well and feels it well; and dislocated according to each form. And when you join the diseased rib with the healthy one, you can see it clearly. For the joint is bent, and cannot bend the arm, nor touch its shoulder at all.
And it is necessary that you reset it before hot abscesses come there, for if hot abscesses came there, it would be difficult to reset it;
and perhaps cannot be completely reset at all, especially when it is at the back; it is worse than other dislocations, and is more painful, and death may result.
And the restoration is, when it is such that one can reset it, that you extend its hand with your two hands; and its arms should be spread, and the hands of the surgeon around the elbow, above and below, and put the joint to its sides together, or to the root of its palm, until it returns to its place.
And if the dislocation is in front, it returns when he doubles his hand to his hand, and grasps the root of the palm near the elbow which is dislocated.
And if it will not return to its place, administer strong extension;
and it is that two assistants extend the arm, and two assistants hold it, so that it does not move during the extension;
then turn the arm on each side, after you have wrapped a long and wide double cloth;
and when the doctor has joined the joint with his hand, let him anoint it with some oil to soften the joint, then push the joint strongly until it returns;
and when it is in place, apply a dry plaster with egg white, and bind it tightly, and hang the arm around the neck of the patient, and leave it for some days, then unbind it.
And if the joint is firm in its place, unbind the bandage, and leave it;
and if you see that the joint does not hold well, redo the plaster and the bandage, and leave it so for some days, until it is firmly set; then unbind it.
And if he feels pain after the resetting of the joint, and it moves, bathe and rub gently, and press until it is soothed; or you place on the joint a poultice of fat mutton, then leave it one day and one night, then remove it, and make him enter the bath; and when he sweats, rub the joint moderately, then replace the poultice, and then enter the bath; and thus do it two or three times, until he is healed;
and if you wish, apply warm, moist cow dung with butter, and bind it on;
then it will return to its proper place.
The dislocation of the hand
The joint of the hand dislocates, and its reduction is easier than other joints. However, it must be returned to its place quickly, at the very moment it is dislocated, before the place swells, or a hot abscess forms there.
And the reduction is that you place the affected hand on a table, and the assistant extends the hand, and places it evenly, so that he places his palm on the appearance of the joint, and pushes until it returns.
However, it is necessary that you look to see if it is well in place; then let the patient place the back of his hand on a table during extension and reduction. And if the dislocation is on the back of the hand, let the patient place the back of his hand on the table, and the assistant place his hand on that appearance of the joint.
If it returns immediately, it is well. If not, restrain it with soothing plasters applied warm, and leave it thus without restarting.
And if he cannot endure it, and you cannot put it in place after a few days, the joint remains twisted;
and it harms the patient not at all except that the hand is weakened, and cannot grasp anything at all: then know that the nerves or arteries are severed;
there is no other remedy except to restrain it with a cautery near the case, and perhaps nothing else helps.
And when the hand is in place, apply the plaster we have described, then bind it and leave it for five days, then unbind it and leave it so.
And if he cannot move it well, and there is some stiffness, moisten it with warm water, and rub it until it is healed.
of the dislocation of the fingers of the hand
Sometimes the fingers of the hand are dislocated on either side, sometimes on the back of the palm or on the belly;
then extend the finger, and put the dislocation back into its place until it returns, then support the head of the finger, and bend it towards the part where it is disjointed;
and leave it for two days, and then set it even with the others that day;
and at night bind it, as we have said, and unbind it by day, and make it move, and bind it at night;
and do this often, until it is straight, and do the same if it is dislocated on the palm of the hand, and do as you have done before, until it is healed;
and do likewise, when it is dislocated elsewhere.
of the dislocation of the spine of the back
When the spine of the back or neck is dislocated, or several are dislocated, there is no cure, for death quickly takes the patient.
And the sign is that the excretions jump forth without will, nor can he retain them, and often some limb is softened, or the two thighs, or the two arms, or one.
And many times the spine moves in four directions;
that which moves backward is called "gibbosity":
The cure is that you consider if the gibbosity came from childhood: if there is no cure or healing at all.
And that which comes from a fall or from blows or similar things, the ancients prescribed methods of cure with great words, where there is not much profit in all;
but I have shortened it according to my intention, and have formed instruments in diverse ways.
I say that in the gibbosity that comes to the breast in front, there is no device or health;
and also that which comes straight on two sides, and one cannot cure except that which comes properly to the back, as I say;
and it is that the patient be stretched on his face in a level place, and have a bolster underneath him, that he not be injured;
then fix one firebrand firmly to the head in the ground, and another to the feet, and tie one rope across the armpits of the patient, and another at the hips, and at the knees, and at the ankles;
and two assistants hold the ropes, one at the head and the other at the feet, between the two firebrands;
and they should be well secured, the firebrands as we have said, and the physician place his palms firmly on the spine until it returns.
And if it does not return by this treatment, then take a board three arms long, and place it under the wall, and let the patient be on his side, and place the end of the board under the wall, then place the middle of the board on the spine; and let the physician place his feet on the other end of the board, and press firmly, until it returns to its place;
and if you wish, do it with a lathe that is hand-turned. And it is that you place two firebrands on the head of the patient at a distance of one arm's length, and towards the feet two others, and there should be between each firebrand, above and below, a hand's breadth of space in length;
and let there be in each firebrand one hole, where the lathe runs, and let the firebrands be firmly in the ground, so that they do not move;
and between each two firebrands let there be one turning firebrand, on which the cords turn, and let there be on the two turning ones two small firebrands of a hand's breadth in length, to turn the lathe;
and then tie the cord which is through the armpits to the lathe towards the head, and the other cord towards the feet to the other lathe, and each of the assistants turns his lathe with all the cord, and the master places the spine evenly as we have said.
And when it is even, then apply a drying plaster with egg white, and then the tow, and then the splint of a tablet three fingers long, which should cover the area of the gibbosity and the healthy part of the spine, then bind it with a cord, as we have said, and let the patient use a light diet, until he is healed;
and if anything comes at the end of the healing, then it is necessary to administer softening and soothing medicines, with the splint that we have mentioned above; and sometimes one administers a piece of lead, and sometimes the appearance comes in the posterior spine of the back, and one thinks that it is a dislocation; and it is the bone which appears, wherefore one should not be presumptuous: by chance it would bring about death.
Know that at the joints of the hip and at the joints of the shoulder there comes forth only dislocations, and it does not come there as with the other joints;
and the hip joint is dislocated according to four parts: inward and outward, and forward and backward;
and more inward than elsewhere, and little dislocated forward and backward.
And the recognition of its inward dislocation is that when one joins the diseased leg with the healthy one, it is longer, and the diseased knee appears more than the healthy one, and the patient cannot bend his knee to the fire; and the place which is nearby is swollen with a hot abscess, because the head of the thigh comes there.
And the sign of that which comes outwardly, is that these accidents are contrary to those above.
And the signs of that which happens in front, is that he extends his leg well according to the fulfillment; however, he does not bend the knee without pain, and if one wants to make it go, it cannot forward, and he retains his urine, and the groin swells, and when he walks, he steps on the heel.
And the signs of that which happens behind, is that he cannot extend his knee, nor bend it, and that leg is more twisted than the other, and the groin is softened, and the head of the thigh is in the place beneath the ribs.
The treatment of this type of dislocation is that you observe if the dislocation is old, and it remains according to its disposition, then there is no cure; and there is no need for presumption.
And in that one where the dislocation is fresh, and it is of the four manners of dislocation, hasten that you turn the joint, and extend it inwards and outwards, and move it to the right and left; by chance it will return, and needs no other cure.
And if it does not return in this manner, then you must prepare a strong assistant, and extend the leg strongly with two hands, or with a rope tied above the knee; and another assistant extends his hand above in such a manner that he puts his hands under his armpits, then binds him softly with a rope above the thigh; and another holds the head of the rope;
and they extend upwards and downwards all at once, until the patient is lifted from the ground at once, and remains hanging.
This method of extension is common to the four similar [cases], and if the dislocation has returned, as we have said, it is well.
If not, then it is necessary to treat it similarly.
When the dislocation is inward, it is necessary that you place the patient on his healthy side, then place the rope on the root of the thigh, and the place which is under the groin, then extend the rope upwards towards the groin, and towards the clavicle;
then let another assistant take his arms, and embrace the large part of the affected thigh, and extend it outwards strongly; then it will return to its place immediately;
and this type of dislocation is easier than others.
And if you cannot set it in the manner we have described, then you must bind the patient's two feet together with a strong, soft rope, above the two heels, and above the two knees, and let the affected leg be extended two fingers more than the other;
then let it be suspended from the top of a beam, and let it be two arm-lengths above the ground;
then instruct an assistant to embrace the head of the thigh, and let another assistant hang with the patient, who firmly embraces the thigh, for the joint returns immediately and quickly.
And when the dislocation is in the hip, let the patient lie down, as we have said in the case of one with gibbosity, and tightly bind a rope around the affected leg properly, and also around the foot;
then place two burning coals, one at the head and another at the feet, then insert a burning coal between the patient's thighs in the middle of the groin; and have moistened cloths placed around, so that it does not burn the patient, then let each assistant extend towards him, and let the physician put the dislocation back in place with his hand.
If it returns, it is good.
If not, put it on a table, and press it as we have said in the case of gibbosity, and let the patient lie on his healthy side.
And when the dislocation is in front, it is necessary to extend the affected leg forcefully, and according to what I have said; and let the physician put his effort on the affected angle, then press with the other hand, and extend it downwards towards the knee.
And if the dislocation is behind, it is not necessary to extend the affected limb downwards, or lift it from the ground, but it should be as if the hip were dislocated behind, as we have said about lying on the two hips; and let him be on his face, and the limb extended as we have said before, and one must press on the joint at the table; and it will be right when the patient extends his legs, and they are equal; then bring the thighs together, and apply the plaster, and bind it with a bandage, so that the hip does not move; and let it rest for three or four days, then unbind it, and apply the plaster again;
and if you see that they are equal, then bind it, as before, and leave it for three days;
then unbind it, and have him walk gently, until the limb is strengthened.
Of the dislocation of the knee
The knee is dislocated in three ways: that is to say, inwards and outwards, and backwards;
and it does not dislocate forward.
And the sign is that you instruct the patient to bend his leg to his thigh, and if it does not bend to his thigh, know that it is dislocated;
and the restoration of all is that you make the patient sit upright, and extend his leg if he can, and put your back against his face, and put his foot on your feet;
then take his knee in your palms, and pull it between your fingers, then bend the two sides of the knee strongly; and another assistant extends his foot, until the knee returns to its place, and the sign is that he bends his leg easily to his thigh;
and apply the plaster, and bind the leg to the thigh, and bind them together tightly for three or four days, then unbind it;
and the patient should not exert himself to walk, until the limb is strengthened.
And if the limb is not set, the assistant should strongly extend it, as we have said in the treatment of the hip, until it is healed.
of the dislocation of the heel
The heel is sometimes sprained, and sometimes completely dislocated, both inwards and outwards.
And the sign is that the ankle is swollen, and more so on the side where it is dislocated:
The reduction is easy, and one should gently extend it with one's hands when it is only sprained.
And when it is completely dislocated, you must make the patient sit upright, and hold him firmly by the leg, above the ankle;
then pull the foot towards you with your right hand, and then with your left twice, then extend it upwards, and gently place the foot upwards;
and do this twice, as we have said, by pushing and pulling the foot;
If it returns, it is well;
if not, then begin the procedure again, for it will return;
and if it cannot return thus, then make the patient lie on his back on the ground, and firmly fix a stake in the ground between his thighs, and tie cloths around it, so that it does not injure the patient;
then let the assistant hold the thigh, and another assistant extend the foot with his hands or with a rope, which he ties above the ankle; then let each assistant extend equally, and the stake should always be between the patient's thighs to restrain the patient when he is extended;
then let the physician carefully reset the dislocation with his hands, and another assistant hold the healthy leg underneath, and the dislocation will return quickly.
And when it is in place, apply the plaster and lint, and bind it firmly, and tie the foot to the leg, and watch the nerves that are on the ankle behind, that the bandage is not too tight;
then leave it for two or three days, and if the bandage loosens, tighten it;
then untie it on the third or fourth day, and forbid the patient from walking for four days; and if he walks before that time, it is not certain that it will not dislocate again.
And if a hot abscess develops, you must soothe it, as we have said elsewhere, until it is healed.
of the fingers When the fingers are dislocated, they must be gently extended without force, and this is an easy thing.
And if the dislocation is in any joint of the back of the foot, you must have the patient sit on a level surface or on a completely straight table, and place your foot on the exposed part of the joint, then press firmly with your foot until it returns;
and when it is even, and nothing shows, then place a two-legged table under the sole of the foot, then bind it firmly, and leave it for three days, then unbind it; and let it rest until it is healed.
of wound and dislocation together
When a wound occurs with the dislocation, and one wants to restore it, it often happens that the patient dies:
so do not be presumptuous in the treatment, if you are not wise in the art and have not practiced it for a long time, and if you are not patient and merciful and slow, not rash;
and use at the beginning soothing things for a hot abscess, and leave the patient in God's hands, if you see no hope of healing; and when you see hope, then immediately restore the limb to its place, before the hot abscesses come;
and when the limb is in place, administer things soothing to a hot abscess, and treat the wound, as is necessary, with drying ointments;
and if with the dislocation there is a fracture, and small bones separated, remove them, and do what we have said in simple illnesses;
and guard yourself from entering the path of fear, according to what I have said, for it benefits you according to your Creator, and for the safety of your soul and your body.
