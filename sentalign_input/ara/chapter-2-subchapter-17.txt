Chapter Seventeen.
On the excision of pterygium and the removal of excess flesh that grows in the eye.
A red, overlapping fleshy growth may develop in the eyes of some people until it covers the pupil, or nearly covers it, or spreads over the eyelids, and sometimes the eyelids turn outward, and it resembles a pomegranate blossom.
The procedure for this is to have the patient place their head in your lap, then open their eyes, and you grasp all of that red flesh with hooks suitable for that.
Or you grasp it with forceps or tweezers, then you cut the flesh bit by bit until you completely excise it all, taking care with the eye so that you don't harm it during the procedure, and your cutting of it should be either with the scalpel that we described for excising pannus or with small scissors.
Like those with which eyelashes are grasped, as their image will appear in the chapter following this one.
When your excision is completed and all the fleshy growth is gone, fill the eye with powdered salt or instill red vitriol and similar corrosive medications, and apply cotton with egg white on the outside of the eye to prevent hot swelling.
If any of the fleshy growth remains and the blood overwhelms you, and you fear hot swelling, then leave the eye and treat it with what calms the swelling, then return to it with the procedure until it heals. And likewise, do this with excess flesh of this type that occurs in the eye.
Except that you should avoid treating any eye weakened by nature or by accidental cause with iron instruments, and do not put your hand to any of these procedures until you see that the organ is able to withstand the procedure.
