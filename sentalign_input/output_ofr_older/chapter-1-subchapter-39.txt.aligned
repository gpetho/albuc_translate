of the uterus When the womb is cold and moist, not preventing conception, and the menses are corrupted and their periods are delayed; and when they come, great pain is felt: then make three cauteries around the navel, as mentioned in the cautery of the bladder, and two cauteries on the back; and let the cauteries be clavile, as mentioned.	On cauterization of the womb. When matter arises in the womb from chill or humidities and she is thereby prevented from conceiving and her menses are upset; their flow fails or, as they pass, pain accompanies them; then you must cauterize her three times around the navel, as we have mentioned in cauterization of the bladder; and once or twice in the lumbar region in the lower part of the back over the hips.	0.8011518
