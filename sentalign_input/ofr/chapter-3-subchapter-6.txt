of the fracture of the shoulder
It rarely happens that the shoulder breaks in a wide place or in the middle, and it is not known except by touch; so treat it according to the nature of the fracture, and reset it according to its natural form, in all the ways that you can; then place on the area mill dust with egg white, and light compresses, and put on a double cloth; then put on a wide and thin splint, a little wider than the shoulder, and if under the splint there is a hollow in any place on the shoulder, fill that hollow with linen compresses, so that the splint sits evenly; and then bind it tightly with a large bandage, so that the splint does not move from its place, and check the bandage every day; and every time it loosens, tighten it, and adjust the splint if it is out of place, and let the patient lie on his side; and the shoulder is healed in twenty or twenty-five days. And when this period is complete, untie it, and be confident, for this is not a bone that is easily dislocated.
And if a piece of bone protrudes, and points under the skin, then cut over it and remove it, and do what we have described in the fracture of the clavicle to soothe a hot abscess.
