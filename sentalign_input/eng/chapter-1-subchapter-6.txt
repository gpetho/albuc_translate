 CHAPTER six.
Cauterization of the twisted mouth.
 The twisting of the mouth which is curable with the cautery is of that nature which arises from phlegm, as we have already noticed in the sections on sicknesses.
But cauterization is to be carefully avoided in that type which is due to dryness or spasm of the tendon.
When this kind of deformity has been treated with electuaries, errhines, and gargles, and your treatment is ineffective, you should use three cauterizations: one at the root of the ear; the second a little below the temple; and the third at the junction of the lips.
Let your cauterization be on the opposite side to the affected side, for the relaxation will arise in the side which seems normal.
The form taken by the cauterization is that you burn him a little below the frontal prominence, on a level with the upper tip of the ear, and also on the temple the length of the thumb; carry the burning to a depth of about half the thickness of the skin.
The shape of the cautery.
It is a variety of the bladed cautery such as has already been described, but is rather more slender as you see.
Its blade should have a certain thickness.
Then dress the place with what we have mentioned till healed.
