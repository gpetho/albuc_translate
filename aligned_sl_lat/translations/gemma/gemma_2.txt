After I have finished with you, my son, this book, which is the most recent treatise in the science of medicine, together with its complement, has been completed by me. I have followed its exposition and its pronouncements, so that I may complete it with this treatise which is a part of the art of surgery, that is, medicine with the hand.
Since surgery with the hand is a matter of great importance in our time and age, and is private to us, and has passed away along with its author: except for a few brief descriptions in ancient books which have been changed by the hand: there has arisen an error and hesitation, until the intentions of these books have been closed and their meaning prolonged: It is necessary, therefore, to explain this treatise in such a way as to restore order in this branch of learning, and to make known the forms of instruments such as the Cautery, and other instruments of surgery, which are mentioned in the declaration and are necessary for the preparation.
Moreover, because a true artist in this craft is not to be found easily in our time, since the art of medicine is vast, and the author must exercise himself beforehand in the science of anatomy as Galen has said, until he knows the functions of the members, their forms, and their connections, and their separation and joining, and has knowledge of the bones, nerves, lacerations, and their number, and their emergence, and the pulse of veins, and quietness, and the places of their exit
And thus Hippocrates said, "A name is much more important than a name, and work is little, especially in the art of the hand.
We have already spoken of this at the beginning of this book.
For he who is ignorant of what we have said concerning anatomy will fall into error, and will endanger human life: as I have seen many who have been taught this science, and who practice it without knowledge and without experiment
What is this, since the hand of the physician has secured the swollen abscess of the scrotum in the neck of a woman, and has pierced some arteries in the neck: wherefore does the blood flow from the woman until it dies between her hands?
And the hand of the physician has also suspected that it should extract a stone from the bladder, which was in the process of growing, and the stone was great. And thus it came to pass that he extracted it with the bladder full of urine Therefore the man died on the third day.
And I was called to extract it: and I saw from the greatness of the stone and the condition of the patient that he would die.
And I saw another physician who was receiving a fee from a certain Duke of our land for a medical treatment: and it happened to a black eunuch who was with him, that he fractured his leg near the heel: and the physician, in his ignorance, bound the fracture with wool and nails, and tight bands, and did not allow the wound to drain.
And he died according to his desires. Then he dismissed him after a few days and commanded him not to break the ligament: and he stood thus until the abscess of his leg had burst, and his foot and leg, and came to ruin
I was called to him again: and I commanded him to break the ligament: and there was peace, and he was freed from his pains
However, the corruption had already been confirmed in the limb: and I was unable to restrain it
Therefore the corruption ceased to spread in the limb until it died
And the physician went to another, who had perforated the cancerous abscess: and it was ulcerated afterwards, until the malice of the latter grew great with the master himself.
When the cancer is pure from melancholic humor, then it does not suffice to endure it with the whole of the iron, except in the limb where it can be excised altogether
And because of this, O Son, you must know that an operation is divided into two parts: that which is associated with health, and that which is associated with peril in various dispositions.
I am excited in every place of this book concerning an operation in which there is terror and fear.
Therefore you must be careful of this, and be modest: so that they do not find fault with you for speaking idly, or dishonestly
Accept therefore this measure with diligence and protection, and the sick with ease and firmness, and use the gentler method which brings greater glory to God for the preservation of health and the achievement of praiseworthy succession: and banish the terrifying diseases which are difficult of healing: and take away the souls of your patients from that which makes them fear, so that there should be no hesitation in your faith and confidence concerning you
For this is the remaining wonder for the glory of your faith, and the sublimation in this world, and finally for the greatest number of souls.
For Galen has said in some of his admonitions. You do not heal a bad ailment: do not blame the physician for the name of the malady
I have, however, divided this treatise into three Chapters.
Chapter 1
Of Cauterization with fire, and Cauterization with acute medicine, capitulated, and arranged from head to feet, and concerning the forms of instruments, and the materials of Cauterization: and all that is necessary for the operation.
Chapter two.
Of incision and perforation, phlebotomy and packing, and wounds: and the extraction of arrows, and things of that kind: and the whole of this is capitulated, arranged in order of the instruments.
Of burns and their treatment. Â¶
Of restoration, and dislocation, and the treatment of twisting, and things of that kind: capitulated, arranged from head to feet, and concerning the forms of instruments.
But before anything else that we recall of the operation, it is necessary to say what is the quality of the instruments and the preparations of the said operation: and in what complexion it should be displayed
I say therefore, that the discourse of the quality of the application of the Cautery, and its preparation, is a lengthy, subtle, scientific, and hidden art.
And it has been said by many of the learned, and they have differed in their opinions: and indeed little is sufficient from their discourses, fearing the prolongation of the discourse.
I say therefore, that the Cautery is universally applicable to all complexions, that is with material and without material: except for two complexions which are the hot complexion without material, and the dry complexion without material.
When heat and dryness prevail with the materials that are being dispersed. Some have said that the cautery iron is useful in this. Others again say the opposite, that is, that the cautery is not suitable for wounds that are caused by heat and dryness: for the nature of fire is heat, and it is inappropriate to remove a wound caused by heat and dryness with heat and dryness.
He also says that the cautery is suitable for all wounds caused by heat and dryness that occur in the bodies of men: for when you compare the body of a man to the heat of the fire, you find the body of a man to be cold
And I myself have often seen that it works in this way
However, it does not suffice to know only this, that the cautery is suitable for wounds caused by heat and dryness; for it must be learned in the final exercise of the cautery course, that is, to know the variety of human complexions, the nature of wounds, their causes and their consequences.
And in cold and humid wounds there is no fear of this For all doctors agree that it is useful to use the cautery in these instances, and do not dissent concerning its use in them.
And learn, my son, that the cautery with fire is more beneficial than the cautery with burning medicine: for fire is simple, whose action does not extend beyond the member being cauterized, and does not harm any other part connected to it, except for a slight burn.
Burning medicine, on the other hand, extends its action to the surrounding parts: and it often causes an obstinate wound that is difficult to heal, and sometimes causes death
Fire, however, because of its subtlety and the goodness of its substance, does not make it bad.
Fire, however, is proved by experience to be beneficial on account of its subtlety and the excellence of its substance; for it does not render it bad
Though it may not be appropriate for this book, I may nevertheless confess that I know of a hidden secret concerning fire, and its power in expelling ailments from the body, which is demonstrated by philosophical discourse and confirmed by the minds of the learned.
Note that the translation includes the last sentence which is not part of the original Latin text.
And I say that cautery is useful in every time: for in the course of an operation, the document [i.e. the patient] is immersed in moisture, which is drawn towards the cautery. Above all, if the cautery is applied to severe and urgent pains, which cannot endure delay, because they are accompanied by great anxieties, which are more dangerous the longer they remain unchecked
They do not understand this, either the learned men or the unskilled: for that which is cured by cautery is not always cured by excision; for it sometimes changes the complexion of the body, and dries up humors which are the cause of disease
Indeed, fire surpasses all other means of treatment by its speed, its excellence, and its wisdom: for it is possible that the disease will return at some later time according to the temperament of the patient, the location of the disease, and the excellence of the operation. And all these things are prepared within the body from the collection of superfluous humors that exist there. And they are acquired by the patient from the cause itself, or from the cautery. But this is not the case in every disease in which cautery is administered.
Acute pain in a limb with few superfluous and humid swellings, like the cautery of a tooth, due to suffering, and similar to it, is possible that it will not return in that place with pain. But that is in few cases.</start_of_turn>
Indeed, the latter speech is more correct: for the latter says that the cautery is the most perfect of medicines. For they believe that there is no cure which can restore as well as the cautery.
However, the thing is contrary to that. And the meaning, that the cautery is the most perfect of medicines, is not except when we administer other modes of treatment for some ailment, and these treatments do not restore: then we administer the cautery at the end, and it restores. Then it falls out that the cautery is the most perfect of treatments, not according to the intention which the vulgar people and many learned doctors understand.</start_of_turn>
The ancients said that the cautery is better with gold than with iron: and they did not say that except because of the equality of the gold and the fineness of its substance: and they said that it does not form pus at the site of the cautery.</start_of_turn> But that is not absolutely true: for I myself have seen that it does not cause that in some bodies without other things.</start_of_turn>
And the cautery with gold is good, and better than with iron, as they said.</start_of_turn> However, when you ignite the cautery with gold in the fire, you must not declare it finished according to the quantity of gold, because of its redness: and when it approaches the cold, and if you add more fuel to it, it melts in the fire and turns into plates.</start_of_turn>
Why does the artificer depart from his business? Because of this, the Cauterium is made with iron more rapid and close to the operation, from the straightness to the operation.
I have also ordained this Chapter on Cauterium, according to the chapters: and I have ordained them from the head to the feet: so that they may satisfy whatever anyone desires from it
Chapter 2.
Here is the cauterization of the head with regard to the lord of humidity and frigidity above the brain: which are two causes of sweat, and a multitude of the flow of humors from the head to the parts of the eyes and ears, and of a multitude of sleep, and toothache, and throatache: and generally of all ailments that arise from frigidity, such as palsy, and sweat, and epilepsy, and apoplexy, and things similar to these ailments.
The mode of cauterization is as follows: it must be done immediately when the patient is feverish: and it must be evacuated in the first place with a physician who uses a solution of vinegar and oil for three nights, or four, according to what the nature of the patient, and his age, and his custom require
Then command him to make a wound in his head with a needle. Then make him sit between your hands square, so that you can place your hands over his chest.
Then put the root of your thumb over the root of his nose between his eyes Wherever your middle finger reaches, that is the place of the burn with the cautery
Then bring the Cauterium with Olive Oil: thus is its form
Then place it upon the marked spot with an incision, descending gradually, so that your hand may grasp it slowly and you may withdraw it. Then grasp your hand quickly and touch the spot.
When you have grasped it as much as the bone of the head of the forearm or the quantity of thyme, then grasp your hand again And if not, grasp your hand firmly with the iron itself, or with something else which is cold: until the bone has become visible, as I have told you.
Then take something from salt and dissolve it in water, and drink it from that basin, and apply it to the spot: and leave it for three days.
Then put upon it a basin of butter which has been drunk, and leave the dressing above the spot until the eschar has been consumed by fire. Then care for it with unguents of four herbs, until it is healed.
It has been said that the more the wound remains open, the more pus it emits: which is better and more useful.
And some of them say that the skin should be cauterized until the bone is reached: and keep the Cauterium until something of the thickness of bone has been consumed
Then withdraw after that which has been consumed from the bone, and then care for it
And others say that it is necessary that the cautery should continue until the very end, so that an imprint of the thumb is left in the bone, as if a nail had been driven into it: or an instrument which women put into the alphabet with an infusion of small letters: and they say that from this place vapor of the head escapes, and the wound remains open for a long time
Then it heals, until it is solidified.
Neither of two species of cautery is to be used in any man except in some cases according to the degree of fear.
And discharge it away from me. It is better for me with the health of this person.
The head weakens from the continuity of its natural solution: as we have testified in other limbs: and especially when the head of the sick person is weak by nature. And the first kind of cautery is more safe and better for me in health. And it is useful to work with it in health.</start_of_turn>
Head section III.</start_of_turn>
When in the whole head there occurs a chronic pain which prolongs in the sick person, and which is accompanied by fever, and boils, and carbuncles, and oils, and applications.</start_of_turn And especially if it has already been cauterized with one kind of cautery, which we have mentioned, and you do not give it anything of those things: then consider.</start_of_turn For if the head of the sick person is strong by nature and not weak, and if it has a fever and a chill: then cauterize with another kind of cautery under that little bit.</start_of_turn Then cauterize it over all the hair of the head with that kind of cautery, so that it does not penetrate the skin, and uncover the quantity of bone as we have narrated.</start_of_turn And cauterize it with one kind of cautery in the nape of the neck, in the place which is called the uas: and it is the place where the marrow is placed. And elevate your head in this and do not uncover the bone.</start_of_turn The infirm is pained thereby because of that pain which is more intense than the rest of the head's pains.
I say this of the Cauterium: it must be applied in such a way that it cauterizes the horns of the head and the back of the head more delicately, while it cauterizes the middle of the head more thoroughly.</start_of_turn>
Chapter III.</start_of_turn
When it happens in the part of the head that there is pain and swelling, or that the pain extends as far as the eye, and is evacuated with medicines that soothe the head, and the rest of the treatment is administered as I have said in the discussion of diseases, and it is not necessary to do everything: then cauterization is useful in this case in two ways: either with acute burning medicine or with the iron.</start_of_turn
But the cauterization with acute burning medicine is, that you take a tooth from another and burn it, and scrape it, and cut off its extremities from both sides.</start_of_turn Then split the place of the pain at the same time as a wide phlebotomy, until there is in that place under the skin, where the tooth is grasped.</start_of_turn
Introduce it thus into the skin, until it is hidden: then bind it over it with a bandage of moderate constriction, and leave it for fifteen hours, then remove it, and extract the foreign body, and leave the wound open for two or three days: afterwards place over it a covered dressing in butter, until the place has healed. Then care for it with ointment until it is healed.</start_of_turn>
If anyone wishes to do this like some of the burning doctors whom I mentioned in the twelfth tractate on Medicine for the Renowned.
If anyone wishes to do this like some of the burning doctors whom I mentioned in the twelfth tractate on Medicine for the Renowned. It is done in this manner by cauterization with iron. The iron for cauterization is of this shape.
And it is called Clavicle: because its shape is like that of a key, in which there is something of a curvature, and in the middle there is a small prominence
Then place it upon the place, and hold your hand: and slowly rotate the iron with your hand: and let the amount of heat that arises from the thickness of the skin be as much as half of it And lift your hand, so that it does not burn the artery which is below, and that the blood flow does not increase
Then soak the wound in salt water, and place it upon the place, and leave it for three days: then place the wound with butter: afterwards care with unguent until it is healed.
And if you wish, cauterize this hemimelanism with the second extremity of the knife following the Cauterization. Burn from the incision of the artery in this hemimelanism, not backwards as usual.
In the usual hemimelanism.
When you are treating a hemimelanism, when what we have said about the treatment of ailments has been done, and what we have said about the methods of treatment for ailments has not been of benefit: and if you observe from the ailment that it does not suffice for it what we said about the first cauterization with medicine, or with fire, then you must burn with the cautery knife until the mark of pain is seen on the place with a line, the length of which is half a finger, or as much. Then remove your hand with the thumb and index finger and tie the vein until you have cut through it.
It is necessary to soften the jaw, lest it continue to bite during mastication, and thereby damage the wide surface or the nerve which moves it, from which the spasm originates.
Be cautious, and take care lest there be bleeding from the artery which has been severed In excision there is danger, especially for the ignorant who are careless and unskilled: he departs from the work immediately upon its commencement
And I shall remind you of the regime of the flow of blood which occurs in the event of an embolism of an artery, according to my method, in this book itself
If you are in pain, and the Cauterium is not sufficient for you, and you are able to tolerate it in the middle of the head, as we have described, then take care of the wound, until it is healed
If you wish, apply Cauterium, as we said in the chapter on the excision of an artery with Cauterium having two blades. For in cautery there is more benefit and less pain.
How to cauterize in the pain of the ears
When there is pain in the ear from cold, and it is cured with solutions, and the rest of the treatment which we have mentioned in the preceding sections has not removed the pain, then apply Cauterium: and this is called the Punctum, which has this shape.
Then touch the Punctum round about the whole ear, as it is rolled: or round about both, if the pain is in both And stretch the Cauterium from the root of the ear downwards, after you have marked the place with the burn: and let the quantity of Cauterium be ten points in each ear, and as much as that
Then care for the place until it heals.
Until the place is healed, care for it diligently.
Chapter VII.</start_of_turn>
Torture that is cured with cauterization is not except for those kinds which arise from phlegm, as we said in the discussion of the causes of ailments.</start_of_turn>
And you must cauterize the kind that arises from exhaustion and nerve spasm.</start_of_turn
When you have cured this kind of torture with urine and purging and vomiting, and the cure does not suffice, then it is necessary to cauterize the patient with three cautery instruments: one at the root of the ear, and the second a little lower from the temporal region, and the third at the junction of the two lips.</start_of_turn
And place the cautery instrument from the opposite side of the diseased part.</start_of_turn For the softening does not take place except in the part which appears healthy.</start_of_turn
And the form of cauterization is that you cauterize the Cautery itself directly at the extremity of the upper ear under the horn of the head slightly: and the other in the temporal region: whose length should be as long as the thumb.</start_of_turn And hold your hand with the cautery until the quantity of middle thickness of the skin is burned.</start_of_turn
And this is the form of the cautery, and it is like a knife whose form is as follows: it is not finer than a needle, indeed it is rather thick. And you must make sure that the knife is of a suitable thickness.</start_of_turn
Then care for the place, and do this until it heals.</start_of_turn>
On the method of cauterizing in ancient apoplexy.
When the ancient apoplexy has become quiescent, and treatment has been administered as described above, and the patient does not have a fever, then cauterize four times over every horn of the head, and cauterize in the middle of the head, as described above, and cauterize in the back of the head, as required: and the method of cauterization is as described above.
It is also cauterized with a cautery over the bone of the stomach: and this is the ultimate treatment
Then treat according to what has been described above
On the method of cauterizing in Oblification
It is necessary to administer in the first instance large doses of hyra and nourishing pills for the brain
Then cauterize the whole head of the patient, and place upon the back of his head a layer of sponge described in the treatise on sponges: and put some more of it on top
This is the method of cauterization: and do this according to the order mentioned above
If he therefore recovers through this, it is good If not: then make for him three cauteries on the back of his head, which are descending from the upper part of the head down to the lower part of the eye: and place between every cautery the width of a finger
Then treat the cauteries, as described above
If, however, the patient is able to tolerate it, then make for him a Cauterium in the middle. If indeed you desire to add something: then cauterize it over two horns.
Then care for it until it is healed: let the Cauterium remain olive-shaped as it should be.
Thus cauterize in Paralysis and mollification.
Chapter X.</start_of_turn>
You must proceed with the dressing of the head with sponges and with what we have said.</start_of_turn>
Then make the head of the patient: afterwards make a Cauterium in the middle of the head, and a Cauterium over every horn of the head, and a Cauterium over the back of the head, and three over the bones of the neck.</start_of_turn
If, however, he endures it neither in the softening of the body by these many, nor the patient is able to tolerate it, and the inflammation is strong: then make for him four Cauteriums over the bones of the back, and the last one with a Cauterium, until it burns through most of his skin, and lift up your hand.</start_of_turn Then care for it until it is healed: and thus the Cauterium will remain olive-shaped.</start_of_turn
Thus cauterize in Epilepsy.</start_of_turn
An epileptic does not receive Cauterium, except for one whose epilepsy is from phlegm.</start_of_turn
You must therefore first soften the brain of him with sponges and with the rest of the treatment which we have said: when the patient is great, or is able to tolerate the medicines.</start_of_turn
If, however, a boy endures not medicines, then gargling and nourishing foods are administered, and biting exercises which stimulate the brain, many days before with benefit to the food.
Then the head is bandaged, afterwards it is cauterized with one cautery in the middle of the head, according as has been said before in this manner: and with another cautery on the nape of the neck, and over all the hair on the head with a third cautery.</start_of_turn> If the patient be strong and enduring, then cauterize with cauteries as I have said in those who have paralysis, and softening of the body over the vertebrae of the neck and the vertebrae of the back: and let the cautery be olive oil according to the manner which has been said.</start_of_turn
If the patient be a boy, then apply the cautery gently, according to this manner.</start_of_turn>
Method of cautery in melancholy.</start_of_turn
When the cause of melancholy is corrupted humors and thick phlegm, then cauterize with the aforementioned cautery.</start_of_turn
And if the cause of melancholy is excess of inclination towards melancholy, and the body of the patient be soft, then give him to drink that which will stimulate his brain, according as has been said before in the explanation: then bandage the head of the patient, and make afterwards a soft cushion made of linen, like a circle.</start_of_turn
Then place it in the middle of the head: and the patient sitting square is held by all sides.</start_of_turn
Then apply liniment.</start_of_turn It is more honourable to use fresh butter than old. Heat it over a moderate fire, until it can be comfortably handled by a finger when it is introduced into it Then, evacuate it into the middle of the head in a circle, and leave it until it has cooled down
Do this every week to the sick person, with the rest of his treatment, until he is healed.
Or if you wish, cauterize it by making many small punctures, since by holding the hand with the cautery: in this case, there will be an odour.
For this kind of cautery is very moist for the brain
Then place upon it a pad soaked in butter, or fat from a hen
In descending water, cauterize towards the eye
Chapter XIII
When it is declared that the water has begun in the eye by the signs which I mentioned in the preceding discourse, then begin to bathe the sick person with it, so that it may soften his head
And guard it from all dampness, and let him sit in a bath for a few days.
Then command him to move his head, and cauterize it in the middle of his head Then cauterize it over two temples with two cauteries, if there is an incipient descent of water in both eyes simultaneously: or from one side only, if there is an incipient descent of water in only one eye: and dissect with the cautery all the veins and arteries which are under the skin: and let there be cauteries in their midst of the same length as the temples: and burn from the flow of blood.
If anything is spilled from it, then cut it off immediately with whatever medicine is available: and I will come with wisdom, which is in the extraction of arteries, and the cutting off of them, and precautions against the flow of blood.
And when cauterized in the groin, under two bones, two cauteries are made at the end of it.
Regarding the cautery in the ancient lacrimal glands
When the tears of the eyes are ancient, they are sticky: and they are above the veins which are in the manifest head outside, it is verified that this is from excessive cold, phlegmatic: then cauterize with the same cautery which I mentioned in the beginning of the descent of water, the cautery in the middle of the head, and two cauteries over two temples, and two cauteries in the groin under two bones And if digestion is not sufficient, then cauterize itself in every side of the eye cautiously over the eyebrow with a small cautery.
Regarding the cautery of the nose.
When you are treating it, with that which we have said in the explanation, and the medicine does not help: then prepare, and give in the strong vinegar three nights: then harden its head, and cauterize it with the middle cautery, with the olive cautery Then cauterize it with the claw cautery with two cauteries, over two eyebrows under the hair a little
And guard the artery, that you do not cut it.
This is the form of the cautery of Claudius.
And this is the shape of the cautery of Claudius.
When the Palpebra of the eye is softened by inflammation or moisture: then cauterize the Palpebra with a cautery that is like a crescent moon
And if you wish, cauterize it above two upper lashes slightly two at a time: and extend it for two times: and let the length of each cautery be according to the length of the lashes: and do not bring your hand close to the cautery, but rather according to the quantity that is to be cauterized of the third of the Palpebra
When the hair is burnt with the cautery, so that the eye is not damaged by the point of the cautery: then cauterize the Palpebra with a cautery that is like a crescent moon.
There are two kinds of cautery: either with fire or with a burning medicine.
But in the cautery with fire, first of all instruct the patient to expel his hair, if there are any that are moving, until they are prolonged and equal If however the hair is burnt at the root: then compress the eyes with a cloth, so that they do not move, until they are burnt through
When they are burnt through and equal: then place the head of the patient on your hand: then sign over the Palpebra of the eye with charcoal, indicating that it is done according to the shape of the leaf of the Myrtle: and let the beginning of the sign be close to the hair
Then place the soaked cushion in albumin or: on the mucus of hair over the eye.
Then apply the cautery, which is shaped thus.
Then burn over the mark, which you have shown gradually in many veins, until the surface of the skin is burned, which is like the shape of a leaf of Myrtle, throughout its appearance
And the sign of the success of your work is: if the eyelashes of the eye are drawn towards the pupil and the hair is plucked from the point of the eye.
Raise your hand then: and leave it for three days.
Then place upon it a cushion with butter, until the scar is eradicated Then care for it with unguent, until it is healed
If any hair remains after an hour, and the eyelashes are softened: then repeat the cautery in the same place as before
If they are in the lower part: then burn the hair itself, until it is raised to its natural place: and make sure that the eyelashes do not become painful
It is like dealing with a sick person, that you remove the hair, until it becomes long and even Make a mark on a piece of paper in the shape of a Myrtle leaf
Then take from soap known from the heel, and from the heel of the foot unction of one or almost two ounces: then mix these together with good force, and do it with speed, so that it does not cool down Then take from the end of the thumb the thickness of a leaf of myrtle, and place it over the pupil of one eye, or over both. And place under the eye a little bit soaked in albumen: and the head of the patient lies in your hand.
And place your index finger over the medicine, and press it gently. And you will move it whenever the patient feels the biting of the medicine: because its biting is like fire.
When you have done this as he has told you that he feels the biting of the medicine, then take away the medicine, and move it with your finger. When the biting has ceased, then remove the medicine, and wash the eye with water.
Consider then, if the pupil dilates with the contraction like fire, or with incision, that is well: and if not, then repeat over the medicine in the place where it does not stick, without damaging it, until your operation is finished, and the eye is contracted
Then place over it a little bit of butter, until the skin of the wound is eaten away. Then care for it with an ointment of diaphanicon, or something else, until it is healed.
And it is necessary for you at the operation, as the last care, that nothing of the medicine should fall into the eye
Which if after a few days the pupil softens, and something from the hair gets into the eye, then repeat the medicine over the place where the pupil softens itself naturally, as you did at the beginning. Then care for it until it is healed
This is the shape of the myrtle leaf.
You know that the eyes of men differ in size and shape. Therefore you must take into consideration: and not to conceal the straightforwardness of this art, which is the study of this craft
Concerning the cauterization of the fistula of the tear duct.</start_of_turn>
When you treat the fistula, when you do not see that your treatment brings relief: then you must cauterize it according to this method.</start_of_turn
Command the patient to place his head on your lap, and keep his head between your hands like this, so that it does not move or be disturbed with his head.</start_of_turn
Then put a soaked sponge on the white of his eye, or on the mucous membrane of his eyelashes over his eye: then apply the Cauterium, which is of this shape.</start_of_turn
Hold it concave, like the shape of a penknife blade that has one end bent: and if you see that it has penetrated up to the other end, or if you see that it has gone too high, then hold it like this.</start_of_turn
But hold it concave is better for your work.</start_of_turn
Then express the fistula, if it is open, and extract the pus from it, and dry it up: and if it is not open, then open it up, and extract the pus from it.</start_of_turn
Then put on it again the Cauterium, which is now ignited slightly.</start_of_turn
Hold your hand firmly beside the Cauterium from the eye to the nose, so that your hand does not move, or disturb the patient: then place the Cauterium on the fat of the eye and burn it.
If you proceed cautiously at the beginning of the Cauterium until the bone, it will be good If not: then repeat the Cauterium once or twice if you find it insufficient: and leave it for three days.
Then put the ointment with butter, and care for it with an exicator until it heals.
If after forty days it has not healed: then put upon it a sharp corrosive medicine until the bone is exposed: and then remove it according to what is written in its chapter
There is another method for cautering a fistula, which some of the first physicians mentioned. Aim for the location of the fistula and find it: then put under the fistula a fine sponge, that is, a sponge which has this shape. And pour into it the quantity of lead which is equal to a penny, and hold your hand firmly with the sponge in place, and do not move the patient in any way, so that it does not run, or cause the liquid lead to reach the eye
And it is necessary to put upon the eye of the patient ointment infused with alum or in water
Lead will burn the location of the fistula and will heal it with a remarkable healing.
When the fistula has healed, as we said from the Cauterium and the care, that is good If not, it is necessary to make a hole in the nose and reduce the fistula to the course of the nose, according to what is found in its own place
On the method of cauterization in the fissures of the Labiorum.
Many things are liable to occur in the fissure of the Labium, which are called Pili, and especially in the lips of children.
When you have cured the fissures, when we said in the enumeration of diseases, and the cure has not been effective, then you must burn the cautery, in this form
And let the curve of it be according to the sharpness of the knife
Then place the flame quickly in the fissures, until the cautery has reached the depth of the fissures.
Then care for the wound with the cautery until it is healed
On the method of cauterization in the fistula of the Oris
When there is swelling in the root of the gingiva, or in the palate, or in the roots of the teeth: then pus forms, and it ruptures: afterwards it is cicatrized, and pus runs out, and a fistula is formed: then you must cure the fistula itself, and not in its cure, then you must burn the cautery according to the quantity that is in the fistula Then introduce the flame into the cavity of the fistula and hold your hand, until the iron has reached the depth of its cavity, and the end of it: do this once, or twice more.
Then care for the wound after that, as we said concerning the cure until it is healed
If it is separated cleanly and is healed, it will be good. If not, it is necessary to remove the place and lift out the corrupt bone according to what comes to pass in his head.
In respect of cauterizing in Gingivae and softening of teeth.
When softened is the gum by humidity, and teeth are loosened, and care is taken with physicians, and it does not improve: then put the head of the patient in your lap
Then ignite the cautery, whose form will arise afterwards, so that you place the Cannellum over the tooth: and introduce into it the burning Cautery quickly: and keep your hand steady, until the patient feels the heat of the fire to have reached the root of the tooth
And lift your hand: then repeat the Cautery several times, as you wish
Then let the patient wash his bone with salt water, and keep it for one hour: and then expel it.
The tooth will thus become firm, and the gum will be softened and stretched, and the humidity will be dried out from the corruption
In respect of cauterizing in toothache
When tooth pain is caused by cold, or if the cold itself is in the tooth or the worms are there, and no relief is found with doctors: then Cauterium is used in two ways: either with butter or with fire.
Or with fire, as you take butter in quantity and put the burning coal inside the tooth or in the cavity.</start_of_turn> Then take tweezers and put the burning coal on the tip of the tooth.</start_of_turn> Then immerse it in butter, put it on the tooth that is causing pain and hold it there until it gets cold: then repeat it a few times until the fire has reached the root of the tooth.</start_of_turn>
And if you wish, soak wool or tweezers in cold butter, put it on the aching tooth and put on a burning iron until the fire has reached the depth of the cavity.</start_of_turn>
The use of Cauterium with fire is to reach the marrow or iron.</start_of_turn And let there be something of size in the body, so that the fire does not reach the bone of the sick person.</start_of_turn
Then take the Cauterium, whichever shape it is in, and put it on the tooth: and hold your hand there until the Cauterium gets cold.</start_of_turn
Do this a few times, for pain will subside either on the same day or the next day.</start_of_turn
And it is necessary to leave an imprint of the Cauterium in the cavity, so that the sick person may put butter on it and keep it for an hour: then take it out.</start_of_turn
This is the form of the Cauter.
The cautery is to be performed with whatever extremity is possible: and this is the form of the cannula.
In this way the cautery is to be performed on the strophe.
When the strophe are affected by phlegmas and by cold humors, and do not obey digestion by medicines, and you wish to expedite their digestion: then you must make a concave cautery, whose form is like this
Having two open extremities, so that the smoke of the cautery may escape from the other extremity: and place the flame itself over the other part once, and a second time, if you find it still unhealed, until it has reached the depth of the tissue
If the part is small: then make the cautery according to the quantity of the part
Then remove it after three days, and place upon it a poultice of butter, until the burnt parts have disappeared
Then care for it with tooth unguents, until the shape of the cannula is restored
In this way the cautery is to be performed in raucedine uocis, and constriction of the anhelium.
When the mucus becomes wet upon the channel of the lungs, and especially when it is with the coldness of the complexion: then it is necessary to evacuate the sick person at first with medical solutions
Then make the cautery at the root of the guttur in a depressed place: and burn, so that you do not bring the cautery too close to the guttur, neither to the skin, except for some of its parts
Then burn it with another burn at the junction of the neck in the last third of its span: and let the Cauterium remain closed according to the manner which preceded.
Then burn it with another burn which preceded it, until it is healed
In diseases of the lung and the chest.
When there is cough and lung disease from cold humidity, and the patient has neither fever nor phthisis, nor old cough: then burn it with two burns above the carina in the depressed places, on the lymph nodes, on the veins.</start_of_turn> And burn it with another burn in the middle of the chest between the two breasts: and let the burn of the cannula be according to the form which preceded it.</start_of_turn
And if you wish to burn it by pricking with the burn, which is called Punctum, whose form preceded the puncture of the pain of the ear: and let the puncture be from thirty punctures up to almost to others.</start_of_turn>
Then burn it with another burn which preceded it, until it is healed.</start_of_turn>
And now let the burn have three branches: according to this form.</start_of_turn Because it alleviates with this burn when you do it with three burns at once.</start_of_turn
Chapter XXVII.</start_of_turn
When the head of the ulna is dislocated by the cause of humidity, and does not return to its place in an hour after dislocation, until it has become accustomed to the restitution of its place, then it must be displaced by a small movement, as we have testified above: then it is necessary to reduce the dislocation at once.</start_of_turn Then the patient lies upon his back, or upon his side towards the sound limb. Then lift the skin, which is inside Tilliculus to the upper parts with your left hand: and if the joint is dislocated inwards
Then take the Cautery with two hooks. Whose form is this?
Then burn the skin until it penetrates to the other side, and the figure of the burn will be as four cauteries
And when the burn is made with a cautery that has three hooks, because of this the figure of the burn will be as six cauteries: and these are the hooks according to their thinness.
And this is the figure of a cautery that has three hooks
And when one more is added in this way, there will be eight cauteries in total
Then put upon the cautery soaked sponges with salt Then make the patient adhere peacefully, so that he does not move the limb for some time, until he is comfortable
And if the dislocation is to the upper parts, and this is rare, then burn the bone above the humerus with a needle cautery, or with many punctures
For the joint becomes firm, and the swelling subsides: and the patient is healed
In this way the Stomach is cauterized
When there is cold and much moisture in the Stomach, until it is expelled from its composition, and the catarrh is multiplied to it, and there is great care, and he does not fear: then it is necessary for the patient to lie upon his back and extend his limbs and hands Then cauterize with three cauteries, a cauterium under the pectoral cochleus equal in quantity to the thumb with a cauterium of the claw, and two cauteries below from two sides of one cauterium, until the figure of the cauteries becomes triangular. And elongate between each [cauterium] so that they do not join, when they make pus.
And the depth of the cauterization is the quantity of two-thirds of the thickness of the skin.
And the figure of the cauteries is in this shape without addition: and if you wish to cauterize with a large cauterium in the middle of the abdomen according to this shape: and let the cauterium be as much as this single cauterium according to the figure of the circle according to this shape
And cauterize the abdomen by puncturing it at the place where this cauterium turns away: and it is that there should be signs above the abdomen at the puncture according to quantity, as much as you wish with the encasement: then cauterize the puncture itself with a cauterium; then care for it until it is healed
In this way cauterize the Epar with cold.
When it happens in the Epar that there is pain from cold and humidity, or from great moisture, until it escapes from its natural composition by excessive discharge, and the patient is cured, as we said, and does not increase in this: then it is necessary that the patient be placed upon his heel, and that signs be made with three cauteries according to this shape and this quantity below the hypocondrii, where the elbow of a man lies: and let there be space between every cauterium according to the thickness of the thumb: and let the cauterium be according to the length of the body of the rectum: and do not press your hand too much with the cauterium
And let the quantity of the said [substance] which is absorbed from the thickness of the skin be not added to the middle quantity: and let the patient remain standing on his feet.
If he is not standing, then let him be lying down, who has extended his limbs and raised his arms
This is the form of cauterization.
And indeed it is possible that these carbuncles be cauterized with a cautery knife, when there is subtlety and skill in the art.
Beware that you do not proceed too far in the cauterization, and that the thickness of the entire skin is not burned, because the body is thereby burned throughout, and comes to the intestines: for the skin there is thin, as you know well
Concerning the cauterization of the after-effects of the liver.
When the discharge occurs, and you wish to write, if this after-effect is in the flesh of the liver, or in its membrane: if it is in the flesh of the liver, there is dull pain and moderate degree of severity: and if it is in the membrane of the liver, with acute pain which endures: know that the physicians are fatigued concerning its treatment.
It is necessary therefore that the patient lie upon his chest Then the position of the after-effect with respect to the burn: then ignite the cautery which absorbs by radiation. This is its form And cauterize with one cautery until the entire skin is burned, and comes to the intestines, until all discharge is expelled: then care for the after-effects of the discharge until they are healed.
Neither should any instrument of cautery be used except by one who has diligently studied the art of medicine for a long time: for by whose hand these diseases occur along with experience in other cases.

And thus some ancient writers have said that there are men who make use of fire similar to a cautery: they ignite it and insert it into the body between the ribs, until it reaches the spleen, and then it emerges whole and the patient is healed: as we have said concerning the spleen of Epates.
But in this perforation with the cautery there is fear that either the patient will immediately die or that a fistula will occur in the place where there is no healing
In this way the cautery of the spleen should be performed on the head of the second rib.</start_of_turn>
When you are treating a spleenic ailment, with that which we mentioned in the discourse on the treatment of ailments, and it does not bring about a cure, then the cautery is to be performed in three ways, all of which are correct.</start_of_turn>
One of them is to make three cauteries or four in a line according to the length of the spleen, following the figure of the cauteries of Epates which precedes this figure.</start_of_turn
And let there be between every two cauteries the quantity of the width of a finger, or less.</start_of_turn
And let the manner of performing the cautery be as we have said concerning the cautery of the liver.</start_of_turn
Do not press your hand down with the cautery: let the patient lie supine on his back.</start_of_turn>
Another way of performing the cautery is to take the cautery having two handles, as we have mentioned in the chapter on dislocation of the humerus: and raise the skin which is over the spleen directly, where the elbow of the patient's left arm is: and raise your arm as much as you would raise the skin according to the width of the body, so that the cauteries are parallel to the length of the body.</start_of_turn
Then introduce two ignited sponges soaked in oil until, when the instrument pierces the skin from the other side: then withdraw the cautery: four cauteries remain.
And if you cauterize with another cautery having three sponges.
Then care for the cautery after it is finished to emit pus for many days: for this is more favorable than the remainder of the things which precede it in the cure.
In the manner of cauterizing in Hydropisi.
The cautery does not fall in Hydropisi, except when applied properly.</start_of_turn>
When you are curing Hydropicum with the methods of treatment which we mentioned in the previous discourse, and the cure does not take effect, then you must cauterize four times around the belly button, once over the stomach, and once over the liver, and once over the spleen, and two on the back between the ribs, and one directly over the chest, and one directly over the stomach: and let the quantity of the depth of the cautery be equal to the thickness of the skin.</start_of_turn
Then withdraw the cautery open, so that it emits pus for a long time.</start_of_turn
And do not neglect the sick after the cautery: for it must be accompanied by two intentions: and it will quickly heal with the help of God.</start_of_turn
The form of the cautery which is to be used for the belly is of clamshell: according to the form of the former: and that which is to be used for the back is of olive leaves according to the form of the latter.</start_of_turn
On the manner of cauterizing Feet and Limbs.
When the swelling has subsided in the Hydropleg, and it is filled with yellow bile: it is necessary to cauterize over the back of the Foot between the cubical and navicular bones: and hold your hand with the cautery, and do not twist it: then lift your hand and do not move it at all.
The bile remains yellow, and the cautery should be carried out in this fashion
Then make two cauteries on each limb at the extremities of the cautery knife: and make the cautery according to the length of the limb, one under the knee and the other below it, approximately in the middle of the limb: and on every heel make two cauteries: and withdraw the cautery gradually without pressure for a long time: so that some water may remain from it: then care for the rest as we have said before.
On the manner of cauterizing in the solution of the Belly
On the manner of cauterizing in the solution of the Belly
When the solution of the belly is cold and wet, until the hardness of the retention and digestion, which are in the stomach and intestines: and it is cured in the manner of treatment, and not by nature: and you should give the sick person the cautery which can tolerate the excessive virtue, then cauterize with a large cautery over the stomach, according to what has been said concerning the cautery of the circle, and four cauteries around the navel, under the skin, with a fine cautery of the claw under the skin: and a cautery over the fatty substance above the intestines, or two cauteries.
If the moisture of the wounds has increased and the patient tolerates it, then burn the wound with the cautery over the navel and over every lobe: and perhaps add two small cauteries near the greater stomach.
This is a proficient healing method whose application does not err
How to cauterize hemorrhoids.
Chapter 6.
When there are many old hemorrhoids in the rectum, or one, and they are of gross, cold, or corrupted humors, and they do not heal with the things we have mentioned previously, then burn three cauteries over the lower part of the spine below the almonds in a triangular shape, and a cautery under the navel as if with two fingers
And if you think that his stomach is hardened, and his food does not digest, and that his face is pale, then burn him with a great cautery over the stomach, as we have said before: and a cautery over the spleen and another over the liver, with a cautery of the tail: and let the open cautery rest for some time: then treat him until he is healed
When the afterbirth has been separated, and there remains some of it, burn it with the cautery over the greater part of the navel and over the surrounding area, and perhaps add two small cauteries near the greater stomach.
When you have separated the afterbirth, then burn the cautery that absorbs the afterbirth Then introduce the burning cautery into the separated afterbirth: and keep your last hand until the cautery reaches the opening of the vagina, from which blood runs: do this once or twice.
If there are many little ulcers, then burn each one individually according to what has been told. Then care for them, with the things which are poured on them, until they are healed
And if you burn them with a large cautery over the ulcer, that is the greatest remedy in healing.</start_of_turn>
In this way burn the fistula in the year.</start_of_turn>
Chapter XXXVIII.</start_of_turn
When the patient does not obey the section and the work which we have narrated in its place, and returns from it, perhaps it will be healed with a cautery.</start_of_turn
When there happens to be an ulcer, and it grows old, pus comes from it, and moistens the corrupted parts.</start_of_turn Therefore it is necessary that you try with a subtle finger.</start_of_turn Then know the quantity of its depth with the finger.</start_of_turn
Then burn the cautery, which is like a ray.</start_of_turn Then enter yourself with the fire into the fistula and the quantity in which the thread has entered.</start_of_turn
And repeat over the cautery, until all the corrupted bodies are consumed, once, or twice, or three times, according to the necessity.</start_of_turn
And take care that there is no burning of nerves, if there are any, or great veins: or if the fistula goes to the body of the intestines, or to the body of the bladder, then take care that there is no burning of these places.</start_of_turn
Do not do this, except when the fistula is in a fleshy place: and think, for it is not penetrating.</start_of_turn
Then care for the place until it is healed.
If, however, the place is sealed and material is removed from it, and it remains thus for a long time: then you know that it is now completely healed.
If it is not removed from it material: then you know that it has penetrated, or that a bone in its depth is corrupt, or almost like that from these. In such a case the memory of it will come to the place itself.
In this way the testicles are cauterized.
When it happens in the testicles that there is pain from cold or from large wind, and that it becomes diminished for this because of that from which the sickness is caused: then it is necessary to cauterize it over the semen over the testicles, cauterizing over every testicle with the cautery claw whose progress has preceded a memory of it.
And perhaps we must also cauterize it a second time in the very membrane. Because three lines come together. Therefore there will be two last things in the treatment.
In this way the bladder is cauterized.</start_of_turn>
When there is weakness in the bladder, and softening from moisture from the urine, until the sick person does not retain the urine: then cauterize it in the lower part of the belly over the bladder, where the hairs of the testicles begin, and cauterize from the right side of the belly and from the left side of it: and let the length of this cautery be as much as the width of the thumb: and cauterize it with the lower cautery, or with two cauteries, if you like: and let it be according to what has preceded the cautery claw.
How to cauterize the Matrix.
When the Matrix is cold and moist, and is prohibited by that from impregnation, and its menstrual blood is corrupted, and its period is delayed, and there is pain in its neighborhood, then it is necessary to cauterize three times around the navel, as we said in the cauterization of the uterus, and to cauterize over the lower belly, or to do two cauterizations: and let the cauterium be small.
How to cauterize the Ancham in dislocation
When moisture of the mucous membranes flows down to the heel of the Ancham and causes it to slip from its place: and the sign of that is that one thigh is prolonged over the other thigh when compared with the normal position: and the place of dislocation is found in that space.
It is necessary therefore to cauterize the injured part above the heel of the Ancham with a cautery similar in size to a circle: after which the mark of the burn will disappear: and let the heel fall into the middle of the circle.
And if you do not find this cautery here, then cauterize it three times with a great olive cautery: and let the depth of the cautery be according to the thickness of the skin all over
Then care for it until it heals
How to cauterize in Sciatica
When pain occurs in the testicles due to cold and moisture, the patient should be treated with large doses of foul-smelling pills or artificial pills of a similar kind. And then cauterize him.
There are two methods for cauterization: with the use of medicinal poultices or with fire.
Cauterization with fire is done in various ways
One method is to cauterize the testicles with three triangular cautery instruments in the shape of that figure And make the depth good or bad There should be a space between each cautery mark equal to the width of a finger, and the cautery should not touch each other
When the cautery is done in the middle of the upper part of the testicles There should be four cautery marks
And if you cauterize in a circular fashion, with a surrounding form of the testicles in the cautery, do so with one: so that the circle encompasses the entire testicles
Burn the hair of the entire skin
This is the method for cauterization in Sciatica, when the pain is adhered to the testicles and does not extend up to the knee and thigh
If it extends up to the knee and thigh, then cauterize the two testicles on the knee, in the place where the patient feels the pain, and cauterize from the heel of the hand four fingers wide towards the outer side: and let the cautery be blunt
The depth of the burn should be in accordance with the depth of the lesion on the skin.
If the patient complains that the pain extends up to the toes, then burn only in that place where the pain reaches, with a point, a line, or four, or more, as necessary.</start_of_turn>
If the pain is under the knee, then burn only in that place with a single knife.</start_of_turn>
And burn in all your burnings, that you do not reach the nerves or great arteries, and that you do not cause pain or contraction.</start_of_turn
And indeed I have seen one who, having burned above the knee, and having completed the burning, caused the leg to swell, until the whole foot was swollen, and the whole foot was perforated and corrupted: then the solution of the belly followed, and death soon after.</start_of_turn>
If the pain is in two parts simultaneously, burn both according to this method.</start_of_turn
And some wise men have said concerning the burn of an abscess, that this is the method.</start_of_turn Make like a likeness from iron, whose diameter is half of the palm: and let it be at the orifice according to the size of the kernel of the thumb, or less.</start_of_turn
And let the space that is between every two samia be as much as the thickness of the thumb node: and let the samia be open from two parts: and let the height of them be like a node, or two nodes: and make a handle of iron suitable for the samia.</start_of_turn
Then ignite in fire, until it turns red, and it shoots sparks: then put on top of the sponge an old bandage lying on the healthy side. Then ignite three round cautery instruments in the pan at once
Then throw away the three instruments after three days. Then apply with butter: and throw away the opened wound after many days. Then care for it with ointment, until it heals.
Albucasis says: We rarely use this cautery for children, because of its fearsome appearance: and because few people expect it over them
However, it is good for the best cautery with which you are familiar, and you will find it useful in this place.
The cautery is good with burning doctors, as you will make two holes in the armpit having perforated the arm, in which the nerve of the armpit comes out from the bone, either of iron or of length equal to the height of the two nodes, or as if similar to these two
And there should be space between the two quantities equal to the thickness of a finger, and there should be an opening below and above: and that they should contain themselves within the curve, following this shape.
Then place the sponge on top of the old bandage, lying on the healthy side And compress your hand on the sponge over the bandage very much Then pour between two circles of hot water, which should be heated with fire a little, and keep the sponge in the quantity of an hour: and the patient will tolerate the pain of the cautery, and he himself brings it about like fire, until the pain subsides.
Then raise your hand with the instrument and bathe the entire wound with warm water and sweet water: then leave it for three days.
And put butter on it, until the black of the wound be gone: and leave it for a few days, and pus will flow out from it. This is the utmost.
Then care for it with unguents, until it is healed
If the pain extends to the hip or the thigh: make for it a posture in which there is water, as you did in the wound
This is the way of warm water: and I have written it in the treatise on the rectification of diseases.</start_of_turn> Take alkali, and pounded lime of both, mix a portion of each: there should be two of each, and put them into a new vessel, the lower part of which is pierced with a small hole, according to the quantity which is to be introduced: and put under the bottom of the vessel another vessel filled with water: and pour over the alkali and lime from sweet water, which submerges both to the depth of a finger: then press with your hand well: and leave the vessel until the acute water has descended from the lower part of the treated vessel.</start_of_turn>
Then gather up the whole water, and pour it over the other lime: and leave it until it recovers.</start_of_turn>
These are themselves strong and acute, which are administered in many medical operations, and in the cauterization of the rest of the limbs.</start_of_turn For it does the work of fire itself.</start_of_turn>
And there are physicians who, when they cauterize wounds, also do so with tessies, and mastic resin, and saffron with soap, thus that both are mixed together.</start_of_turn
Galenus also reports that an ancient physician treated a pain in the groin and a sciatica: and extolled his skill. He said that he did not deem any other treatment necessary, and that he was healed with one bath only, since he himself perhaps went into the bath delighted, and came out of it already healed.</start_of_turn>
It is like that of a green-bearded man: if it is not found green, take the dry, burn: and rub much with oil, and apply it over the ache, whether in the groin, or the thigh, or the hip: and bind it, and let it go for three hours, or as much as the patient can bear until he feels the pain subside.</start_of_turn> Then put him into the bath.</start_of_turn>
When his body becomes soft, put him on the bed.</start_of_turn For the pain retreats, and he is healed.</start_of_turn>
And you know that no other cautery should be used with these physicians, except after the evacuation of the body.</start_of_turn>
Dioscorides also says that the dung of goats, when cauterized with a sciatica, brings relief: and it makes the cautery in this way.</start_of_turn Take wool, and soak it in old oil, and put it over the deep place which is between the thumb of the foot and the ankle, and is near the heel.</start_of_turn
Then take the dry dung of goats, and burn it in the fire, until it becomes charcoal.</start_of_turn
Then put it on the wool and let it go out, until it is extinguished.</start_of_turn Then do it again. Do it again until the sensation returns above the middle until the pain ceases.
This method of cauterization is called cauterization of the Vaccinum.
On the cauterization of the back pain
When there is pain in the back from many causes, or from a wound, or from a blow, or from excessive evacuation, or from similar things, except for the following kind, cauterization is not sufficient, except in this single kind which is done by the infusion of cold and moist matter
After evacuation of the patient with foetid pills and similar things, three lines should be made on the back where the pain is, along the width of the palm of the hand, after which signs with cautery should be made on each line five times, or more according to the patient's tolerance. And let the cauterization be done with a cautery needle
And if you wish, cauterize three or four times with a middle caulking needle, according to this shape
On the method of cauterizing the hip.
This pain often occurs in young children.
The sign of its inception in children is that it occurs with a spasm in bending the knee towards elevation and bending: and that it is found in the last vertebra of the back and the nodes of the back, which begin to protrude over the rest of the vertebrae
When you see this, and you wish to do it, then cauterize it with a needle which is circular in this shape
Capture the cautery over every part of the spine equally: and if you wish to cauterize around the circumference of the spine along with the cautery of the points, make two or three lines. And let the points be close to one another.
Then take care of the place, until it is healed as we have said.
And be cautious, lest you administer the cautery in a swelling, which happens in a spasm of the nerve
In the case of the podagra and joined pains.
When the pains of the joints are from cold humors, which flow to every part of the body, and when they happen in the feet, it is the custom of doctors to call this Podagra specifically
When it is cured by cold causes of Podagra, and the pains are not removed, then the cautery will remove them
And it is necessary to cauterize around the joint of the feet after the evacuation of the bowels with multiple cauteries: and let the cautery be of Olive oil
And if you do not wish to puncture the surface of the foot, then make it with the cautery of the points When the pains rise up to the knees, or the remaining joints, and this happens frequently, then cauterize over every knee with three or four cauteries, with the same cautery of Claudius
If it is necessary to do more than this, then cauterize it Do not immerse your hand with the cautery, but rather let the thickness of the skin be sufficient
If, however, the pains ascend to the knee and the back: then administer what we said concerning cautery in its chapter.
If the pains are only in the hands: then puncture around the nails, as two lines are twisted together
If, however, the pains remain in the fingers: then puncture over every knot and over the palm of the hand.
If, however, the pains ascend after days to the elbows or to the shoulders: then cauterize both from every side.
Do not neglect the sick person from the regulation of good care, from the supply of medicines. For if a good regimen be made, and phlegm be evacuated, health will be restored by the aid of God with this cautery.
Regarding the method of cauterization in ruptures.</start_of_turn>
When a rupture occurs in the groin, and the intestine or the bladder descends to the testicle, and it is in its beginning near: then it is necessary to cause the patient to vomit immediately on that day.</start_of_turn> And let him be relieved from the harshness, by which the stool descends from its belly.</start_of_turn
Then sit between your hands over his back: and command him to hold his breath, until the bladder or the intestine comes out, or until it appears.</start_of_turn
Then reduce it with your fingers, and sign with the cautery under the rupture over the bone of the pelvis, with the sign whose extremity is similar to the middle of the circle to the upper parts of the body.</start_of_turn
Then the cautery is ignited, its shape being such that when it arrives at the white [stage], it ejects sparks. Then the intestine, or the bladder to its concavity Then the hand of the minister is placed above the place [of the wound], so that the intestine does not escape: and you have already opened between the ribs of the sick person, and you have placed under it powder, and another servant above the ribs of him, and another above his breast which holds the hand.
Then the cautery is placed upon the very sign, your hand with the cautery standing straight And hold it [the cautery] until you reach the bone: or do it again with oil, if you have not followed it with oil from the first time until the bone.
And cautiously observe the escape of the intestine at the hour of your cautery, that you do not burn it, and that it escapes through that over the sick person or the blood, or great malice.
And you know, when you do not follow with the cautery the bone, your operation will be in vain.
And it is necessary that the cautery of the children be subtle, according to their measure
Then care with the remaining unguents, until it is healed.
And let the sick person lie upon his back for forty days, until the wound is healed
And it is necessary to give him nourishment during the time of his cure, which will soften his belly: so that the intestine does not escape at the end and be egested
Then when you want him to rise after forty days, then manage the ligature of the navel made, and keep it for another forty days
And they will not return from toil, neither will repletion of food and drink, nor from the use of strong medicines.
When this regimen is used, the whole restoration of health is achieved.
I will speak of the treatment of ruptures with incision in its chapter.
When, however, ruptures happen in the rest of the belly, and are beginning, and one wishes that they should not be added, then cauterize the rupture with a round cautery according to their quantity: and let that be as much as is necessary to make it as white as a third of it Then care for the rest, as we have said: and do not add anything further
And some people say: cauterize the rupture with a triangular cautery, according to this form.
After it has been signed with the cautery, and a line is drawn which is through the width at the upper side of the rupture, and another line at the lower side And place your hand in the middle with the cautery of the claw
But the first cautery is easier and better
In regard to the cautery of pains caused by falling or percussion
Chapter XLVIII.
When something happens in some part of the body from a fall or percussion, and the pain persists for a long time, and does not yield to treatment with doctors: then it is necessary to cauterize with the Point cautery
And the cautery of every member must be according to the magnitude of it, and its proportion, and its toughness, and its softness, and the twisting and the pain from it
If, therefore, the patient be cured by the first cautery, it is well. If not: then do it again with a greater cautery.</start_of_turn>
For the custom of these diseases is that they change from one member to another, approaching that which is nearest to them.</start_of_turn> Therefore must you follow them with the cautery until the patient be cured.</start_of_turn
In leprosy the cautery must be performed with great care and accuracy.</start_of_turn
Leprosy, however, is sometimes cured by a great cautery.</start_of_turn And especially of the kind of leprosy which arises from the putrefaction of phlegmas and melancholy: in such a case, consider only the cautery of the same.</start_of_turn
If, therefore, the leprosy is obstinate and does not yield to the first cautery, which we mentioned before, and if it has not descended, neither does it remain: and sometimes over the patient, which comprehends the corruption throughout his body: then burn him with five cauteries: one in the middle of the head, at the back of the head by the hair, and two on the two horns, and one behind the nape of the neck.</start_of_turn
And finally touch your hand with the cautery close at hand, until you make an imprint in the bone, and the fragments are loosened from it: so as to relieve the emission of the thick vapor from it. And burn also the spleen with the cautery, as we have said before.</start_of_turn
If, however, the leprosy has become sparse upon the patient and appears manifest: then you must burn with these cauteries which we mentioned in the head, and a cautery on the tip of the nose, and two on the two cheekbones, and two on the thyroid cartilage, and six on the vertebrae of the neck, and one large one on the flanks of the hips and one on the buttocks itself: and two on the armpits: namely one under each arm, and two on the knees: one under each knee, and two on the upper arms, and two on the forearms, and two on the chest.</start_of_turn
And take care of these nerves which are above the heel, so that you do not burn them.
When you cauterize with the cautery above the tarsals, and also above the stomach bone, and also above the liver.
And know that the more often you cauterize, the greater the damage, and the greater the suffering
And know that the sickly man does not find ease in the cautery, just as he finds it in health: because his body is already stunned by the illness
It is necessary that the cauteries be of moderate size, and in number according to the members and joints: according to what precedes from the species of instruments.
Then take care of the cauteries with barley flour with honey, and the rest of the treatment, until he is healed.
In this way you cauterize in the heel.
When some limb is stiff and does not recover with physicians, and oils, and poultices, and compresses, then cauterize the stiffened limb with cauteries, according to the size of the limb or its hardness
Let your cautery not go through the thickness of the skin too much. Then take care of it with unguent until it is healed
And when you cauterize for some stiffness of the hand or foot, in the spines of the back near the exit of the nerves which move that limb: and the stiffness will vanish
But do not presume that it is sufficient to know about the anatomy of the limbs and the course of the nerves only
On the manner of cauterizing in Albaras.
When the old Albaras has become firm, and no remedy of medicine can be of use: then cauterize over the cauterium itself deeply, according to the quantity of the thickness of the skin, until the white be restored, and the color be changed.
When the old Albaras has become firm, and no remedy of medicine can be of use: then cauterize over the cauterium itself deeply, according to the quantity of the thickness of the skin, until the white be restored, and the color be changed.
How to cauterize in Cancer.
When Cancer is beginning, and you wish to stop it: then cauterize it with a circular instrument around its circumference, as it turns around.
The wise men say, however, that it should be cauterized with the last instrument in the middle
I do not see that, however: for I fear that it will ulcerate: and I have seen that happen many times before
It is better to cauterize around it with a circle, as we said: or with multiple cautery instruments.
How to cauterize in Adubelati
When someone has Adubelati, and it is delayed in maturation, or because of excessive fatness, or because of old age which makes the veins weak, or because of time, and you wish to hasten the maturation of the Adubelati: then cauterize around its circumference with multiple small cautery instruments puncturing Then remove the dressing. For it will itself mature with maturation
If, however, you wish to perforate it with the cautery, then ignite the cautery, which has this shape.
And place it in the middle of the Adubelati, until it penetrates the skin: and keep the cautery away from that which follows the infirm, so as to avoid harming the pure blood flow
Then care for it until it heals
How to cauterize in a corrosive ulcer
Head Chapter 48.
The swelling is not other than a corruption in a limb that is in motion, and it corrupts itself: just as fire consumes dry wood.
If therefore you apply a cautery with fire to the swelling in the place where it tolerates it, then you will burn away much of the swelling, small and great nails, according as it will be convenient in the place where the swelling is located
Then burn it from all sides until you have removed the whole corruption, and nothing remains of it inside.
Then keep it clean for three days, and put over the burnt place sulfur three times daily, until all the pus is eradicated and all the corruption is gone.
Then care for it with nourishing unguents that contain meat.
If therefore after three days the wound has healed naturally without corruption, it is good
And if not: then burn again the part that remains from the corrupted places
And the swelling is treated whenever necessary with acute medicine. It itself arises from the place of the cautery.
But indeed the cautery with fire is more rapid in its action: and indeed I have said that the cautery of this kind is to be used with acute medicine. Take therefore this accordingly in that place when it is necessary
In this way the cautery is to be performed on claws and verucas.
Head Chapter 50.
There are many things that happen in the lower parts of the feet with this ailment: and it is a great, filtered thing that troubles the foot
And the cautery is also used in the bowels according to two methods: cautery with fire, and cautery with hot water.
As for the cautery with fire, it is like branding iron which is made of iron and which has a claw of every part: and it should be fine on the margins
Then place the fire under the claw Then move the hand with the cautery around the circumference of the claw, until the cautery has reached the depth of the claw: and leave it for three days, until pus begins to emit from it. Then cover it with sponges moistened with salt: and leave the dressing on it overnight. And the cautery will thus be eradicated from its roots.
Then take care of the place where the flesh has been cauterized, until it has healed.
If they are not concaved, and are very numerous on the surface of the body, especially in the hands and feet: then you will apply cautery with hot water: and for this you will take a tube of air, or iron, or from the sponge. And put it on the claw, or the like. Then pour a little of the hot water into the tube: hold your hand, and move the cautery with pressure against your hand, so as to imprint the mark of the tube at the root of the claw, and to reach the depth of the claw: and expect the patient to stay for an hour over the cautery with hot water
Then remove it, for the claw will be eradicated with its roots.
Do it thus with one hand after the other, until you have finished with all that is on the body from the cautery.
Then care for them afterwards when they are eradicated, since from the pus that is generated comes flesh.
Then care for them afterwards when they are eradicated, since from the pus that is generated comes flesh.
When it happens to anyone to have a tremor from cold in the nerve, or from a quartan fever, or anything like that: then it is necessary to cauterize it with four cauteries, or five over the vertebrae of the back, and between every vertebra cauterize, and in its belly cauterize, and over its stomach cauterize.
The tremor will quiet down with the cautery of olive oil, and the health will be restored to its normal state of warmth
The tremor will quiet down with the cautery of olive oil, and the health will be restored to its normal state of warmth
The tremor will quiet down with the cautery of olive oil, and the health will be restored to its normal state of warmth
When pus is expelled from the body of the Albathir, that is, boils which arise from corrupted thick material
It is necessary therefore at the outset when they appear to cauterize over every head of the boils with a fine cautery with a twig of myrrh whose extremity is kindled with fire. Or with the root of aristolochia longae Or with a lenticular cautery
And when they are cauterized properly at the beginning of their expulsion in this way: and they do not grow: they will break down superfluousness making them whole, and will be healed from the pus
But it is necessary to do this after the expulsion with phlebotomy.
In respect of cauterizing in the flow of blood from an artery in a wound.
Many things happen with the flow of blood from an artery that has been cut near a wound, which happens outside, or at the incision of the apophysis, or by the cautery of a limb, and the like: and this makes it difficult to stop it.
When this happens, then you must promptly take hold of the tip of the artery with your hand, and place over it your index finger: and press it firmly, until the blood is overcome under your finger, and does not flow out of it any longer
Then place on the fire a small cautery of olive oil, and a great number more: and blow over them, until they are ignited somewhat.
Then take from these one, or two, or three, according to the wound and the place where the artery is ruptured, and place the cautery on the wound itself: and when you have moved away your finger quickly: and hold the cautery firmly, until the blood is stopped
And if it spurts out when you remove your finger from the orifice of the artery, and you extinguish the cautery, then take another cautery quickly from those which are prepared in the fire.
Do not cease doing this until the blood is stopped.
And be careful, lest you burn the nerve that is there, and do not cause any other harm to the patient
You know that when blood is flowing from an artery, it is impossible to stop it: especially when the artery is large, except with four fingers. As with the cautery, as we have said. Or when extracting, when it is not extracted For when it is extracted, its extremities recoil and blood is torn away. Or it is bound with strong ligature Or they are placed above the said medicine, which has the property of cutting off blood, and are bound with a constriction of the thumb
Whoever performs an incision with ligature and tightening with a cloth, or with the application of burning things, and the like, does not cause him great pain, except rarely.
If, however, it should happen to anyone of these, and there is no physician or medicine present: then he should begin with the position of the index finger over the orifice of the vein itself, as we have said, and constrict it tightly, until blood is driven out from the upper part of the wound, and over the artery And do not move the finger away, but keep it against the cold water or cold always, until the blood has congealed, and has become tough, and is cut off
And in the meantime consider what is necessary with regard to the cautery or the medicine
On Incision, Perforation, and Phlebotomy in wounds, and things like these
We have already said in the first chapter that every ailment in which coexisting with the cautery and burning medicine is concerned, and the occasions, causes, and instruments of these
And I place the heads from the vertex to the foot.
And I proceed in this chapter in the same way: as in order to join together that which is wanting concerning this matter
Before I begin this, it is necessary to say that in this chapter there is something which is dangerous concerning this matter which was in the first chapter on cautery.
And because of this it is necessary to take precautions in this matter, because in the operation which is in this chapter there often falls out evacuation with blood when the vein is opened, or when there is an incision over the bone, or when the belly is opened, or when the gut is opened, or when an arrow is extracted, or when there is an incision over the stone, and these things are similar to one another: from all of which there is associated tremor, and fear, and falls out in many of them.
And I tell you, do not let this thing which is causing hesitation fall upon you, for often it falls to you in this art like men with illnesses like the sick themselves For there is that which is running away with its sickness, and is light in its matter: because of its weakness which comes from its illness and the length of its suffering And when sickness is from fear, it signifies death.
And from this is that which gives the patient hope, and says to you with this, hoping for health, and its sickness is treacherous.
It is not necessary for you to consent to that which comes to you from this thing whose way is like this And be more cautious than your desire and your bravery And do not presume about anything from this, except after certain knowledge which verifies for you that which will follow is praiseworthy success
And thus in the treatment of all female patients, in prognostication and indication of what is suitable for their health.
For in this lies your help in acquiring fame and glory, and memory and praise.
May God inspire you, son, your intellect, and do not take away from you direction and inspiration: for it is in his hand
And I have set this chapter apart by chapters, according as it follows the chapter of Cautery, from the hip to the feet: so that you may understand what you desire from this and what you need.
Of the treatment of water which accumulates in the heads of children.
Chapter I.
Know that this infirmity often happens to children at birth: or when the midwife tightens the head of the child without gentleness
And sometimes also from an occult cause which is not known
And I have not seen this disease in anyone other than children: and for all those whom I have seen it, it has been accompanied by swelling: for this reason it is suitable for me to send an operation for it.
And I have seen among children whose heads were filled with water, and the head would swell every day, until they could no longer sit on their own because of the size of their head: and the humidity increased until they died
This humidity, or that which accumulates between the skin and the bone: or that which accumulates under the bone on the soft parts
And the operation in this case, if there is humidity between the skin and the bone, and the swelling is slight, then it is necessary to make a single incision in the middle of the head: and let the length of the incision be like two knots, until the humidity is cured
This is the form of a sponge.
If there is too much moisture, and the pus is greater, then make two incisions, according to this form
If the moisture is under the bone, and its sign is that the edges of the head of the bone are open from all sides: and the water is dried up when you press your hand into the interior, and it is not hidden from you: then it is necessary to make three incisions in the middle of the head, according to this method.
And after the incision, extract all the moisture.</start_of_turn> Then bind the incisions with bandages and wool.</start_of_turn> Then leave it covered with wine and oil until the fifth day.</start_of_turn
Then loosen the ligament and care for the wound with tension and pressure.</start_of_turn
And do not make the head taut with equality.</start_of_turn And feed the patient with dry food with little moisture, until the limb is comfortable and healed.</start_of_turn>
And another method of incision is to consider the size of the pus and the collection of water.</start_of_turn
For sometimes it is in the occiput more, or in the eyebrow, or on the right, or on the left.</start_of_turn>
Proceed therefore with the incision wherever you see pus and fluid: and cut it according to what is possible for you.</start_of_turn>
And observe that you do not cut an artery, and that there is no escape of blood, and that the patient does not die from that escape of blood with the evacuation of the moisture.</start_of_turn
On the incision of arteries which are behind the ears.
On the incision of arteries which are behind the ears.
When swelling occurs in the eye or the chest, and the condition persists, and no medical remedy helps: then the last remedy is the incision of these two arteries.
It is necessary therefore when one wishes to make an incision, that he do so with care, so as to avoid damaging the patient's life Then let him wipe the area with a rough cloth, so that the arteries may appear. Then let him tighten the patient's neck, with whatever towel he has available Then let him consider where the pulse of the vein is to be found And the places where both are found are those which are behind the ears depressed: and they are rarely hidden, except in some people.
Then let him mark with a burn the two of them: and he shall cut both of them with a lancet as sharp as possible, the incision running to the bone: and let this be done over the breadth of the head
And if he wishes, let him insert a sponge under the artery, and cut upwards with the incision
Let the length of the incision be like two joined fingers
For when an artery is cut, blood flows outwards with the pulsation, which leaps to the interior in frequent jumps
If however the artery does not appear to be pulsating, then it is necessary to take a measure of the quantity of the space between three fingers Then let him mark with a burn, and find until the bone
And that which must be emitted from blood is six uncia, and perhaps more or less will be emitted from it. The amount that must be emitted from blood is according to the quantity which appears to you from the wound of the patient and the refill of its artery.
Consider the wound. Then if anything remains on the bone from the clot of something, then cut that away, so that there does not occur a thick clot: then bind the wound with strips of linen cloth
Then care for the wound with unguents, until it is healed
About the extraction of arteries, which are in the times
Chapter 3.
When it happens to a man an old hemorrhage, or an acute catarrh due to acrid humilities and heat in the lacerations of the times, or an old soda, which cause swelling, and things like these: and they are medicated with the methods of treatment of medicine, and it does not suffice: then we are experienced in these ailments of the times in extracting arteries from the times, or cauterizing them, as we shall narrate.
And the way of operation in extracting them is that the patient grasps the hair which are in the times, and brings them to the apparent artery in the time. It itself is shown to you from its pulse, and rarely is it hidden except in a few men, or from coldness.
If it is hidden to you, then the patient grasps his head with whatever he has: then he rubs the place with rough cloth Or vaporize the place with warm water, until there appears to you a clear sign Then take hold of the sponge, which previously formed the shape. Then scrape away the surrounding skin with it [the sponge], until you reach the artery. Then push in the needle through the skin, and draw it out towards the upper parts, until you have withdrawn it from the skin, and make the wound close with the layers beneath it all around
If the artery is small: then encircle it with the end of a needle. Then cut from that part a quantity equal to the length of its extremities, and tighten, so that the flow of blood is stopped For if neither is cut nor bound, the blood will not ascend whole
Then evacuate from the blood a sixth of a unit, up to three
If the artery is large: then it is necessary to ligate it in two places with a double thread, strong, of silk: or with a silken suture, so that it does not swell before the wound is consolidated, and that the flow of blood is restored
Then cut off the excess, which is between two ligatures Do this in an hour, or after an hour has passed
And if you wish, burn the wound with a cautery until it reaches the bone, with a cautery knife: until its extremities are incised and its place is stabilized by the work itself.
It is better to do the work when the patient is not feverish, or has a high temperature For the cautery is from earth, which is drying. Therefore it is better to administer treatment
And it is necessary after the extraction of arteries that the hollow place be closed up with the old skin: and cloths be placed upon the middle of the wound.
And after closure it is cared for with dry medicines which cause the flesh to grow, and with dressings, until it is healed
Which if during the operation blood flows from the artery, then it must be immediately cauterized or clipped: and press your hand, until the blood is stopped. Which if nothing of these things is present, then put upon the place your finger, until the blood clots And bind up the place with cold water or ice, until the pain subsides, and tie according as it should be.
And thus that which is easier and more convenient for the extraction of an artery is to cauterize with a cautery having two blades: and that the pain of the two blades is equal to the amount of alum. Indeed, the pain of two blades is much less than that of two knives. For if they are acute, like two knives, both are prepared by cold: and they do not tear the flesh with speed. When there is a little breadth in the thing, it is held in the hand of the fire, and is cut quickly: with this therefore the work is better in every way, and more gentle, and easier
This is the form of deep cautery
And the space which is between the two blades is as much as the breadth of a finger, after which you mark two points with the cautery: and put out both flames cold, until they reach the bone, and touch the artery in two places: that the length which is between their extremities be elongated They do not solidify with this deep cautery.
Chapter III
For the care of acute tears that are excessive from the eyes.
When tears are excessive and flow from the eyes, which are above the external part of the head and do not adhere to any other part of the body, and do not cause any other ailment with physicians, and cause the face of the patient to become red, and causes him to feel a wandering sensation in front of his eyes, as if he were walking like ants, and his eyes are swollen and wet, as if they were corroded by their own tears: then the old ones used to perform an operation for their treatment and called it "Ens.
And it is like shaving the hair on his face for the patient Then make three equal incisions on the forehead according to the length of the forehead: and let the length of the incision be like two fingers, and let one incision be at the distance of the nose from the middle of the forehead, and the second at the distance of the movement of the lacerations, and the third at the other side: and cauterize from the arteries which are in the two sides: and stretch out your hand from the continuation of your two mandibles, and let the space of the incision be as much as the thickness of three fingers joined together: and let there be a sponge or dry cloth prepared, with which to soak up the blood
Then introduce a sponge soaked in two acute extremities, whose following form is like this From the incision at the temporal side up to the second incision: and scrape with it the whole skin between the two incisions, with chaff, which is over the bone. Then do it also from the middle incision to the second incision. Then extract the instrument from the first incision and introduce another instrument, called the cultellare acute, from the softer side, not from the sharper side This is its form
And place its sharp edge towards the flesh with the fat attached to the skin, and its softer edge towards the bone: and press it in until it reaches the middle incision: and cut through everything that descends from the head to the eyes: except that which continues from the skin.
Then do it also from the middle incision to the second incision
And when the bleeding has ceased, express from the wound an equal amount of coagulated blood from the flesh.
Then place on every wound a piece of old cotton, and place over them soaked wool, and butter, or vinegar. And see that no swelling forms
And on the third day restore the ligament, and give an abundant infusion with warm water Then care for it from the ointment of basilicon, and for the rest that heals the wounds: until it is healed
Chapter V
Regarding the care of acute tears and catarrh of the eyes from the inside of the head.
When any acute, severe, or persistent catarrh occurs: and you find the eyes extended, parched, and their aspect languid: and the eyelids ulcerated, and hair falling out from the eyelashes, and there is severe pain in the depth of the head, causing sneezing: then take away from these causes whatever does not cause the matter or the catarrh, except for many tears
The best care in the case is this. And it is, that you should shave the patient's face promptly. Then make a single incision in the middle of the face, or on the other side along the width, and commence with the incision from the left ear to the right ear: and let the incision reach the bone: and pull your hand away from the soft parts that move at chewing: until the bone is discovered: and you will dry all the blood with a sponge.
Then separate the two lips of the incision with a piece of cotton wool, or with strips of linen Then string up from above with threads: and soak the threads with wine and oil, so that they do not cause a cold abscess
And when you have finished this, and you have seen that a cold abscess is imminent: then it is necessary to massage the bone, until it begins to heal naturally.
And then care for it with the regular dressing which causes healing: like if you take from wheat flour two parts, and from colophony four parts: and prepare from this an ointment, and apply it to these wounds
(The text provided does not include any information regarding "care that falls in the autumn," so I am unable to translate this portion.)
And concerning the care that falls in the autumn.
All things that fall in the autumn are of four kinds: or mineral substances, or like stones, such as iron and copper: or are of a plant origin, such as beans and peas: or are fluids, such as water, vinegar, and blood: or are of an animal origin
When such things fall in the autumn, as mineral substances or stones that do not grow in autumn, or which are not added to it, they expose the autumn to the sun: if you wash a stone with water, then distill from the oil of violets or from cumin something out of the vinegar. Then administer the extraction [of the tooth], and make the cheek firm with pressure, and apply pressure to the nostrils above the cheek pressure, after you have placed around the circumference of the ear a plug of cotton wool or wool, and have extended the ear upwards.
Many things are done with this care.
If they do not come out, then administer the extraction [of the tooth] with oil, that is, with fine sponges: which are of this shape
If they come out with the sponge, that is good.
And if not, then administer the extraction [of the tooth] with a blunt needle of small size.
If they do not come out by this, then make a hole in the air, and introduce the extremity of the needle into the ear cavity much, and apply pressure with what is around the needle with soft wool so that there is no air in the ear except for the needle: then extract with your hand the attraction strong
Many things are done with this that we have said. If they do not come out in this way: then take from barley or from vinegar, that is, prepared gluten with which birds are caught, and put it in the extremity of the radius after you have enveloped over the thumb the part which is below the middle: then introduce it into the ear hole with ease, after you have dried the ear from moisture.
If they do not come out with all that we have said, then prepare to split, before the black abscess comes, or spasm
The way of splitting is as follows: as a phlebotomist would do a sickly person in the first place in the temple: and extract from him from the blood according to his measure of virtue. Then sit the sick man between your hands, and draw his golden hair upwards, and find the wound parallel to the ridge of his ear near his cheek in the depressed place: and let the wound be of a crescent shape until you reach the stone; then remove it with the instrument.
Then withdraw the wound quickly with your hand and take care of it, until it is healed
Which if a falling stone is in the hair from one of its grains, which grow and swell: then carry out its extraction.
But if it does not yield to your extraction, then take a soft sponge, fine and round, according to this shape.
And administer with it the excision of that kind from the grains which fall into the hair, and do not make it, when you think, that that grain is already moistened by the vapor of the ear, until you put it to dry with much powder: then extract it with hooks, or with fine forceps, or with suction, as we have said, for its extraction alleviates it
But in water which enters the hair, it is necessary that the patient should sneeze vigorously at the beginning: and then pour oil onto his head with a little coarse wool: and let it rest upon it, where the water is. If thus it comes out, it is good.
And if not: then take many stones, according to the length of a finger, thin and round, and heat them with fire nearby, and introduce the patient from one ear into the ear: and sprinkle on his foot one of those parts, and strike with another stone over that which is in the hair Do not cease to do this with the stone and the stone, until all the water comes out
And now go forth with water thus: take from the fire one part, or from the fennel one, and introduce the extremity of the former into the cauldron: and raise up the latter extremity with fire, until it is consumed for the most part. And then repeat with the other fennel, and make it much the same until all the water has gone out: and draw out the same with a tube according as it is prescribed on the stone
In the extraction however of an animal that is within the vessel, as for example a flea, or that is like it, take care of it as I have said in the explanation.
But if it is a body of great size, which appears to the sense: then manage the extraction of it with hands and instruments: and it will be easier for all who hold it in the cauldron
In the extraction also of worms that are generated in the cauldron, when you have cured them with that which we have said in the explanation, and in the treatise on distillations, and it does not suffice your cure: then it is necessary that you uncover the cauldron in the sun. If therefore anything appears there from the worms: then draw it out with hands or with subtle instruments.
If however nothing appears there: then take a tube, which has a narrow lower part and a wide upper part: and introduce the lower extremity into the cauldron according to the capacity which the sick man tolerates: then draw out with that strong suction Make it much the same until all the worms have gone out
If however they do not obey you to go out, then pour round the circumference of the tube with chaff, as I have said in the stone
Which if they do not go out with that which we have said: then manage distillations which the ancient ones are experts in for the interruption of worms: and you will find it in the treatise on distillations.
And let your effusion be such as that which flows out with oil and medicines into the ear with this instrument, whose form is depicted here. As from silver or gold, or from air, make it lower strict, in which there is a small hole, and the upper part is wide
Thus let what is driving out be in the curvature of the tube, be made from air in the center And if you wish, take a globule and place it at the end of the tube: then pour oil, or gum, or whatever you wish of these medicines into the tube: and let it be in the ear: then introduce the globule with the cotton above, and press it with your hand in a temperate manner, until oil is driven into the curvature of the ear, and the patient feels it inside: what is poured into the ear must be warmed with gentle heat: and beware that nothing which is distilled in the cold should be put in: for medicines do not tolerate this.

Regarding the care of the accidental injury of the Ear.
Whenever some children come out of their mothers' wombs unpierced.
And sometimes also to some men the hair grows in the ear from a wound, or is born there naturally.
And this hair, when it is in the deep cavity of the ear, does not follow custom: and when it happens outside the cavity a little, and follows custom
That which happens in the deep ear, and which does not comprehend the sight, is in many cases difficult to heal
And in that which follows custom, it is necessary to place the ear of the patient on the sole, and to touch it: then if the visible hair is seen, open the ear with a fine spatula, whose form is this which follows, and let its extremity be in which there is some small width, and some part of it be acute: and the rest of the spatula be soft on both sides: so that it does not irritate the ear.
If, therefore, an inflammation has arisen from the flesh in the ear: then hold the thumb close to the ear, and cut through it with ease until the entire flesh is removed.
If, therefore, the inflammation is deep in the ear: then take a slender needle, lancet, and burn it with fire: then insert it into the flesh of the ear
If, therefore, you feel an inflammation with pain, which causes the patient to suffer from deafness, try to open it with ease: and take care, lest you damage the nerves of the ear.
Then place in the ear a plaster according to the quantity of the opening which you have made in the cartilage: do this for a few days, until you are certain that the wound has healed
Or take plaster, and soak it in rose-water, and grind over it some powdered ochre, and use it thus.
If, however, you see the ear to be swollen: then it is necessary that you remove the plaster, and put in another plaster which you mix with rose-water, until the swelling subsides: then care for it until it is healed
If, however, blood flows: then immerse a sponge, or pack in cold water, and place on the ear: and use the rest of the treatment which expels the blood mentioned in the treatise on distillation.
On the care of the eyelids of Al-Khalili.
(The provided text does not include any information regarding the care of the eyelids, so I am unable to translate this section.)
These are the Al-Khalili who are afflicted with the eyelids of the eye when they are wet, and are dry.
It is necessary, therefore, to hold them with hooks: or with a thumb, and cut them with a needle from their roots. Then place above the wound a layer of cheese.
If blood flows from the wound, then cauterize the surrounding area with a fine lancet.
Cautering is better after the incision has been made. Many things return when something remains of its roots And when cauterized with fire, those roots are consumed, and do not return
Take care of the large palpebrae of the eye.</start_of_turn>
Chapter IX.</start_of_turn>
Many things happen in the palpebrae of the eye which assimilate Crandini in its firmness and its toughness, and because of this it is called Grand: and it is an accumulation of thick moisture in the upper and lower palpebrae.</start_of_turn>
The operation is therefore in the eye, as you must consider, if there is a Grand proceeding from the palpebra, which appears from the palpebra and moves to all parts, and its result is easy.</start_of_turn
Find therefore above the wound along its width.</start_of_turn Then scrape away the surrounding area from all sides with ease, until it is clean.</start_of_turn Then suspend the wound with a suture, and cut through it.</start_of_turn
If, however, the cut is not prepared, except when you pierce the palpebra with a small incision, then it will be harmful to the sick in some way.</start_of_turn
If the incision is large: then gather it together with a suture: and take care of it until it is healed.</start_of_turn
If it is small, it will not cause you harm from it. If it is small, it will not bring you harm from it.
And if it is large, it inclines towards the inner parts of the ear towards the surface, then turn the eyelashes inward and suspend the large piece with a hook: except that you do not wish to make an incision, and press it away from all sides.
And if the eyelash is stretched by incision, it does not harm in any way
Then wash the eye after the incision of the large piece, with salt water: and take care of the place with it which is incathed, until the patient is healed.
Concerning the care of the eyelashes.
Chapter X.
The eyelash is a piece of wax that is generated in the upper eyelid: and most often this happens in children: and it weighs down the eyes of them, and they cause them to have tears in the mornings, and they are not able to see the light of the sun, because the tears run down their face, and because of this their eyes are always wet under their eyebrows, which has been caused by the swelling: and the prominence of the eyelash appears in the eye, and when you touch it with your fingers, you feel the eyelash between your fingers.
And the way to deal with it is that you put the patient's head in your lap
Then take a piece of linen, and prepare in it a hook, and make from it a circle according to the quantity which contains the eyelash from all sides Then put it on the eye, and press with your fingers from all sides, so that the eyelash is gathered in the middle of the circle
Then find in the middle of that humidity with the spatula the incident fissures by breadth, and let there be no fissure greater than that which is made in phlebotomy in depth.
Or it is necessary that you find the whole skin, until you reach Axirnath in many positions, since Axirnath comes out of the fissure according to the shape of the white fat
Extract therefore the said cloth with which you have infiltrated between your fingers towards the exterior: and you will turn your hand to the right and left, until it is dispersed: and take care, lest you add to the fissure, lest you reach the eye with the spatula, and damage it
If indeed Axirnath does not appear at the beginning of the fissure, you will add in the fissure a little with ease, until Axirnath proceeds. Then extract the said cloth, as we have said.
Then soak the cloths in vinegar and water, and place them on the place, and bind them with threads.
And from the people there are some who smear salt, and put it into the cavity of the fissure, so that the remainder of that humidity may liquefy.
Then take care of it until it is healed.
If indeed a hard swelling should happen in the place of the clot, then take care of it with soothing compresses, until it is healed.
About the methods of Ataxmir of the eye, that is, when the eye is softened, from which it results that it swells like it should not.
Chapter XI.
When hair is added to the eyelashes besides the natural curve, and is of great quantity: then it harms the eye, and makes the methods of injury, such as excessive tears, and the softening of the eyelids, and pus, the cause of the destruction of the eye.
The eye is treated according to four methods. Or by cauterization with fire. Or with acute medicine, as is mentioned previously in the chapter on cauterization. Or by incision and stitching of the Ataxmir.</start_of_turn> Or by tubes, as I shall say.</start_of_turn>
You must put the head of the patient in your lap.</start_of_turn> Then grasp the eyelid of the eye with your left hand.</start_of_turn
If it turns, that is good.</start_of_turn And if not: introduce the needle into the eye, at the place where the eyelash root is, and make the needle penetrate with the thread above, and let it rest close to the hairs themselves, that is, close to the margin of the eyelid, in which the hairs grow: and draw the thread upwards with the eyelid, and tie the knot with the thread.</start_of_turn
Then find inside the eyelid under the added hair with a sponge soaked in the greater and lesser tears.</start_of_turn
Then draw out the thread, and put under the eyelid a small piece of cotton or gauze: then sign over the eye with cautery, so that it is like the figure of the leaf of Myrtle.</start_of_turn
However, it must be known that the figure is made according to the quantity and elevation of the eyelid: because it is varied in men.</start_of_turn
From this it is evident that the quantity of the eye which must be cauterized must be according to the quantity which is softened by the eyelid.</start_of_turn
Then when the spatumili lies upon two lines which you have marked, and you commence from the greater tear until the lesser, and there be one split close to the natural hair, as is the size of a radius.
Then insert the hook into one of the two angles of the skin. Then strip off the whole thing. Then join together the two lips with a suture, with a needle and a fine thread: and drain the blood, and make fast what is superfluous from the threads over two eyebrows, with some useful things, if you wish to do so: and if not, do not worry
Then take out the suture and the thread for three days, or four: then care for it
And if you wish, let go of the wound without a suture, and care for it as before, which will dry up and contract For the eyelid swells up at the sealing of the wound and the adhesion of its parts: but the future is better.
Thus this method of treatment is taught by the old doctors of Ataxmir
However, in this is solicitude over the sick person, and it is from a good operation, and not from fear
And another method is in Ataxmir also: and it is that the signs on the eyelid be like the figure of a myrtle leaf, as we have said.
Then raise the eyelid with three separate needles, or gathered together, according to this figure, and then cut away what is superfluous with small scissors, according to this figure, with the equality of the incision.
If, however, it is not possible for you to hold the needle, and it does not equal this: then grasp the point where the thread is, and insert it into the middle of the figure: and insert another thread close to the greater tear, and another thread close to the lesser tear: and join together the two threads with the equality of the stitches
Then elevate your hand upwards with an even elevation: and elevate the skin above that which is marked on the limb, as we have said.
Then join together two lips of the wound with suture: and care for it until it is healed.</start_of_turn>
If indeed a swelling should arise at your incision or wound: bind up that swelling with a bandage, and do the same with similar swellings, from settled ointments.</start_of_turn
And when the eyelashes also swell up, as they are twisted, grasp their hair.</start_of_turn
It is necessary therefore that you use what we have said concerning the incision: but the suture of both is artificial.</start_of_turn With regard to care for Ataxmir with dogs.</start_of_turn
And indeed, you should cover the eyelash, and split the wound which is within, according as I have said.</start_of_turn> Then make two incisions, or two twigs of a moderate size: whose length should be according to the length of the eyelash, and the width of them should be less than the width of the pupil: and you will have pierced at the extremities from both parts where you have the thread.</start_of_turn
Then join together each one with a piece of substance over that which remains from the eyelash of the eye, and string up two incisions from both parts tightly, and let go of them every few days.</start_of_turn The skin, indeed, when tightly closed will die, and become black, and putrefy, until it falls away of itself.</start_of_turn
If indeed it is delayed, then cut through it with scissors.</start_of_turn Then care for it until it is healed.</start_of_turn>
When the fracture is consolidated, elevate the eyelid: and do not puncture the hair.
This is the form of two needles which you make according to this figure and quantity in length and breadth.
Chapter XII
Regarding the elevation of hairs that puncture the eye with the needle
The operation in this case is that you take a fine needle and insert it into the silk thread, which is lenient Then you gather the extremities of it, and knot both knots with a fine knot: and let the length of the thread be one palm.
Then you make another fine knot in the middle of the thread and knot the extremities of it if you wish.
Then you place the patient's head on your lap, and let it be close to the ground so that the operation is perceptible: for the operation is fine, or even less
Then insert the needle with the knot at the root of the eyelid, and make it penetrate the eyelid quickly, until you have pulled out the natural hair
Then pull out the hair until above the knot: and insert into the knot the light hair: if there is one, or two, or three, not more
Then pull your hand away with it, until the hair comes out with the knot in the eyelid with the natural hair.
If, however, you pull out the knot, and the hair does not come out with it: pull out the knot to the lower part, with the thread which you made in it, until the knot comes out of the upper hole, and you see the eye: then indeed you pull out the knot and the thread, and draw out both, and close the eye: and leave it closed for two days, or three, until the hair has grown back in its place, and has become visible on the surface of the skin.<start-of-turn>
If the hair is short, then either associate it with a long hair from the natural hair, and elevate it with it; or let it go, until it has elongated over space, and then elevate it.
If the hair is short, then either associate it with a long hair from the natural hair, and elevate it with it; or let it go, until it has elongated over space, and then elevate it.
When such an injury happens in the upper eyelid, it is called Leporina.
Such an injury is either natural or accidental
Accidental is that which happens from the consolidation of a wound, or from a section, or from a burn, and similar things
And the method of treatment in these is, that you find the consolidation, and that you separate the lips, and put between them something which will stick to them, and bind them up, until it is healed
And it is not proper to use those things which dry and harden: for if you do, the injury will become worse than before; rather use those things which soften, such as barley-straw: and mix with water, in which is boiled alum, seed of flax: and oil of ravens, which is liquefied with some oil: and apply with this the bandage.
And your skill in treatment should be such, that you can overcome every ingenuity, so that it does not consolidate, according to the form which was in the beginning
And this is indeed the operation which we mentioned, not without some restoration of the Alxatrati, so that it does not return to its former form
On the care of the Alxatrati which is done in the lower eyelid, and is a groan or contraction above to the right and left.
On the care of the Alxatrati which is done in the lower eyelid, and is a groan or contraction above to the right and left.
This is the lower Alxatrati, which is called by its true name Alxatrati. It is natural and is accidental
It is caused by a wound, or a split, or a burn, and things like these
And as for the operation in this, take hold of the needle with the left thumb and index finger, and with the right thumb and index finger make the needle penetrate from the left lacrimal gland to the right lacrimal gland, until the thread reaches the two extremities of the flesh.
And then stretch the flesh upwards with the needle, and cut through it with a spatula that is broad enough. If the figure of the eyelid returns according to what is desired, it is good
And if not, grasp the suture and put it into the split, and close it with it: and find two holes in the inner side of the eyelid, and let the two extremities of the two holes be from two angles of the incision, until they meet and make an angle: until when they gather together the figure of them is like the Greek letter lambda
And then remove the flesh by the quantity which is the width of its obtuse lower angle, from that which follows the eyelid. And then join the separated parts: sew them together with a thread of silk
And then care for them as we have said, with soothing medicines, and compresses, until they heal
If a wound has been sutured or cauterized by Alxatrati, it is necessary to find the wound edges even under the eyelashes. Then separate the two lips with a lancet, as we have said before.
And the sum of the speech concerning the care of Alxatrati, when it is above or below, is that it should be carried out in this operation, as is prepared from the form of Alxatrati.
For itself, there are many variations in form: and the skilled artificer prepares the material in whatever way is possible, until it returns to a natural shape, or almost so, and even the patient himself, according to what is suitable for him from the operation and the instruments in many arrangements
Chapter 15.
Concerning the adherence of the eyelash of the eye with the conjunctiva, or the cornea.
When this adhesion occurs in many people, it is necessary for the upper eyelash to be consolidated with the white of the eye, and to prevent it from interfering with its natural operations
Therefore you must introduce the edge of the radius under the eyelash, and elevate it upwards: or extend it with a hook: then cut through the adhesion with a fine spatula, which should not be as sharp as the edge of the spatula, but rather blunt, so that it does not irritate the patient during the operation, and that the spatula can be withdrawn, and the eye can be restored to its natural shape: and that the incision should be made as if you were scratching that adhesion with ease, until the eyelash returns to its natural shape and the adhesion is completely healed
Then pour water with salt into the eye, with water that washes it out: or distill into it from a vessel made of lead, from vinegar dissolved in water.
Then separate between the eyelid and the eye with a strip of linen: and place upon the eye a lanolin soaked in alum: and on the third day use a knife, and with solid substances, until it is healed.
Regarding the incision of the nail and the elevation of the carbuncle of the tear-ducts.
Chapter XVI.</start_of_turn>
You know that the nail exists in two ways.</start_of_turn It is either fleshy: and is similar to a hard sponge, fine. Or it is not fleshy, similar to frozen white moisture: which when it touches iron, or when you try to grasp it with a hook, it breaks, and does not remain in its nail.</start_of_turn
Both of these kinds do not begin until they have been irritated by a greater lacrimal discharge, until which time they are closed together, and prevent light and the movement of the eye.</start_of_turn
And the way to perform the incision is: you place your diseased head in your lap.</start_of_turn Then open the eyes and elevate the eyelid with your hand.</start_of_turn Then grasp the nail with a hook of few doublings, and stretch it upwards.</start_of_turn Then take a needle, and penetrate it through the hair of the hair of a horse, and soak it in oil or ointment: and let the thread be strong, and double the end of the needle close to the head, and fix the thread in the middle of the nail: and pierce the nail with the needle, and bind it with thread to the nail, and stretch it upwards: and scrape away with the nail the hair that follows the pupil, as if you are scraping the nail with the hair until you reach its tip.</start_of_turn
Then penetrate the remainder in the root of the lacrimal gland with a fine spatula, or with small scissors: and discharge the natural flesh of the lacrimal gland, so that it does not obstruct the course of the tears.
And when the nail is extended with a single claw: or with thread, as we have said. Then it is to be scraped away with a soft spatula, whose shape is this
Take care not to touch the tough membrane of the cornea with the spatula, and cause a break in it, and perforate the pupil
Then after the incision, pour onto the eye some powdered salt, or mix from barley, and discharge it until the next day. Then care for it as is necessary, until it is healed.
If the nail is not sensitive and does not have much meat within, nor does it protrude in it, then it is to be treated with many remedies by the physicians, and it will heal as I have said in the discourse.
If you wish to make an incision in it, then open the eye of the patient, and grasp the spatula under the nail, soft, flexible and of slight sharpness, according to this shape And remove the nail above the root with skill and dexterity If it is seen that it is becoming rareified and crumbling, and prints in the ratio, then distill from your hour in the eye from barley, or from millet, or from salt: and bathe the eye until the next day
Then repeat the operation above until it is fully healed Except that in the eye there be a thick pus: then indeed discharge it, and care for the pus, until it is healed
Then repeat the operation on itself with care until healed.
The prominence of the lacrimal caruncle, if it causes great discomfort in the eye, is to be suspended with a suture and the part of it is to be excised: and not to make the last incision, lest the flow of tears be obstructed.
Then let the blood clot in the tear duct be washed out with a red powder, or made from alum, until healed.
As for the incision of the almond and the native tissue in the eye.
Chapter XVII.
It sometimes happens in the eyes of men that a red mass of flesh is formed, either superposed or underlying, which covers the pupil, approaches or tightens over the eyelids, and perhaps turns the eyelids outwards: and it is assimilated like a rose petal
And the operation for this is also to put the diseased part in your hand. Then open his eyes and collect all the flesh with the sutures which are coming together to this: and hold it with one forceps, or grasp it with your hand
Then make an incision in the first place, until all of it is finished with the knife And burn from the eye, so that it does not damage itself during the operation: and let your incision be like that which we said in the cutting of the nail: or with small forceps, with which the fat is collected, as it will appear after this head
When your incision is complete, and you have moved all the almond out, then wash out the eye with salt, or sprinkle it with a red powder, and do the like with medicines that are corrosive: and put over the eye a cold compress with alum: so as to secure from the heat of the afterburn
If anything remains from the wound, and your hand is dominated by hot blood, and the time after the inflammation has cooled: then discharge the eye, and care for it as you would for the inflammation itself.
Then repeat over the area with the operation until it is healed.</start_of_turn>
And do the same with added flesh which happens in the eye from this kind of thing.</start_of_turn>
It is true that one must take care of the health of the whole eye, both naturally and by chance, operating with the instrument: and do not put your hand into any of these operations until you know that that limb can tolerate that operation.</start_of_turn>
On the collection of pus from the eye.</start_of_turn>
Chapter XVIII.</start_of_turn>
Pus is a kind of red wool which is woven over the eye, and which hinders the operation of the water: and it debilitates the eye with the length of days.</start_of_turn
It is necessary therefore for you in the first place to consider whether the eye in which there is pus is strong, and that there is no other inflammation in it apart from the pus: then collect the pus from it.</start_of_turn
And it is necessary for you to put your head in your lap.</start_of_turn
Then suspend those threads with one thread, or two according to your prudence: and let the needle be fine double the size, or two threads be united in one body, according to this form.</start_of_turn
Then collect with fine forceps those threads with attention, and wash away the blood hour after hour, until you know that those threads have been removed from the eye, and have dissolved: and beware lest you damage the eye with the tips of the forceps.</start_of_turn
And let your operation be in the middle of the day before the sun, and be firm in your operation lest you cut save those one.
When you have completed your work, then distil into the eye a white, or red, unguent: that its sharpness may consume what remains of the wound.
If it is not possible for you to collect all of that in this hour, then close the eye with this, which will soothe the eye: and let it rest for a few days, until the pain has subsided: and keep it from the cold: then repeat the procedure above until it is healed.
This is the manner of the forceps.
Of the reduction of the swelling to the nose.
Chapter XIX.
Physicians call the swelling of the face Arisa, which they cure with cautery, or with acute medicine that burns, as the case may be
And if it does not heal, then there is no wisdom in it except that you find pus upon the swelling near its origin, and you extract all the moisture which is in it and pus, until the bone is cleansed
When the bone is cleansed, and there is corruption or blackness in it, then you must burn it with an instrument whose form is this
This is called the aspersion of the head
Make it from iron inside, and let the head be round like an azir, which is pierced with the point of lime, or with the point of an awl, or with a fine puncture: and place it upon the place of the corrupt bone.
Then roll it between your fingers, and keep your hand near, until you know that that corruption is gone: and do this frequently
Then restore the place with the physicians who have been called for with the styptics.
If therefore the place is consolidated, and there is produced in it flesh, and the flow of blood is stopped: and it remains for forty days, and does not return, and does not soften, and does not happen in it any accident: then you know that it is healed.</start_of_turn>
And if not, then it is not in that limb, except to reduce the swelling to the size of a nail, according to this fashion.</start_of_turn>
And it is, that you discover from the second bone downwards with iron, or with acute medicine: and when it is detected, then grasp firmly according to this fashion, that the extremity of the iron is triangular: and the wood of it is a protracted pyramid up to the end, like a vein.</start_of_turn
Then place that upon the bone itself: and let that be close to the tear-duct: and lengthen your hand from the eye a little.</start_of_turn Then move your hand with the grasp until it penetrates the bone, and feels itself firm: by this you will know that the blood vessel has escaped from that place, when you keep your hand upon your nose.</start_of_turn
Therefore then restore the place with the physicians who have been called for with the styptics, as I have told you.</start_of_turn
When therefore flesh is produced and the place is hardened: then the matter which flowed outwards returns to the nose: and that is therefore easier on the painful area.</start_of_turn
(The provided text does not include the translation of this section.)</start_of_turn>
Chapter 20.</start_of_turn
When the eye protrudes with its entirety, and does not happen in any vessel, neither diminished: then it is necessary to dissolve the swelling: then perform phlebotomies on it: afterwards place poultices in the sky without making an incision, but with suction.</start_of_turn
Then apply upon the eye a liniment made from acacia, aloe, olive oil, and ochre. Then bind the eye above with a dressing of many small feathers
And as for the feathers: take many soft feathers, multiply each feather four times: make many from these: then put one upon another, according to the quantity which the eye requires: then bind over these with a strong cloth
Repeat the process with suctions without causing a cut.
Then remove the suctions and keep the eye tightly closed day and night.
If the ligament is again softened, then it is necessary to bind it firmly: then remove the ligament after a day and a night, as we have said
If therefore the eye has become swollen again, do this: renew the dressing, the feathers, and the binding, and the suctions, until the eye is healed
Of the incision of the edge of the eye.
Chapter XXI.
When a rupture occurs in the membrane of the eye, then it will protrude and proceed outside the eyelids like a grain of sand, and will be distorted in the form of a man because of this, and it is necessary to cut this: then the operation in this case is as follows: and it is that you introduce the needle into the radix of the eye from the lower part to the upper part
Then introduce another needle into which is a double thread from the lacrimal part, and make it penetrate: and remove the first needle according to its position.
Then cut the place of the double thread and bind with it the edge of the eye around the needle: and bind it firmly
Then extract the thorn, and place over the eye a lanolin-soaked wool pad in the bug-bite: and leave it until the thread comes out with the wound.
Then care for the eye with that which soothes it, until the wound is healed.
When the thread has been drawn out from every part with a circle of cloth, until it adds prominence to the eye.
Then perforate with a fine needle which reaches the depth of the eye, and apply moisture of lanolin, and let the eye descend, and mix: then draw it out when it is healed.
Of the treatment of the eye.
Chapter XXII.
This ailment which is called Alcomnati, is not except for health which is gathered in the eye, similar to descending water, and is not itself
And the way of working in it is that you make the patient sit on a prepared seat, or directly
Then grasp his head with your hands from two parts, and move it, until you see health come to the lower parts of your eye Then fix it, and do not let it descend, and uncover the light: and he will see the infirm as he saw: and if it does not descend downwards, you know that it is water
If however the preparation of the descent of health is not made with that which we have said, then make the patient sit between your hands Then grasp a fine needle, and find with it above the corneal membrane a part corresponding to the continuation of the conjunctiva with the cornea in a circle, until the health comes out.
When the eye has gone out, then distill in the eye warm water in which was mixed honey: or water in which was placed barley and honey: and then care for it with the remaining treatment until it is healed.
Regarding the care of the water that descends into the eye, or a cataract.
The head of Chapter XXIII.
We have said ten times different kinds of water in the preparation, and which agrees with the declaration and exposition, then take that which is according to the health.
Then you must make the patient sit with his hands square, opposite the light, near the lamp: and bind his healthy eye, and tighten it gently: then take hold of the eyelid of the eye which has the water in it with your right hand, if the water is in the left eye: or take hold of the left hand if the water is in the right eye
Then take hold of your right hand with the sponge, if the eye is left: or take hold of your left hand if the eye is right
Then put the extremity of the sponge near the corner of the eye for the width of the radius of the apparent tear of the eye: and then press the sponge with force: and you will rotate with it until it penetrates the membrane of the eye: and you will feel that the sponge has reached the bottom of the eye.
And it is necessary that the measure of the movement of the sponge be to the depth, the measure of the space from the pupil up to the end of the black part: and is the circle of the eye You will see it in the pupil of the eye by the clarity of the cornea
Then put the sponge until it reaches the place where the water is Then immediately after one, the lower one.
If water therefore descends immediately, the sick person will feel that which he has opened up will be relieved immediately, and the swelling in his eye will disappear.
Then rest a little while. If water descends therefore, then remove the instrument which has been put in, except that which is coming out with the swelling
When it has become fixed and does not ascend: then draw out the swelling easily: and you will gradually move your hand back again.
Then dissolve in water something from clear salt of a pearl: and wash with it when the eye is closed Then put over the eye the whole pad of cotton, or soaked wool with rose oil, and alum: and bind with this the sound eye
We also, with those who are with us at this time, put upon it a hard plaster with alum.
If it does not yield to you the swelling at the entrance of the eye because of its hardness, because of a man from among men whose eye is hard and cold: then it is necessary that you take up the sponge which is called Alberid, which has this form.
Press therefore with it along with this the swelling just as much, and do not put your hand away from the hole: and do not make any movement except that you make the swelling go down to its proper place
Then draw out the swelling, as we have said
And in addition to the completion of your work, prepare for the sick person a resting place made in the center, in which he will sleep on his back in a dark room: and be forbidden from all movement, and from coughing: and give him food which will soothe the nature of his ailment: and do not move his head to the right or left at all.</start_of_turn>
And let the ligament be according to its usual arrangement until the third day.
Then dissolve it in that dark chamber, and try its effect: and let it assist with the matter Then reduce the ligament until the seventh day.
And it should not be made in the hour of treatment, or immediately after incision: indeed it should be delayed, because the water ascends quickly through the inflamed area
If, however, a cold abscess occurs: then it is necessary to dissolve the eye before the seventh day: and correct it with that which settles the abscess, until it is settled: then immediately take away its cause, and apply to its face an oral medicine which will restore the use of that which has been lost in those few days, which exists in that dark chamber
Then depart from the chamber gradually, and return to one's case.
Know that in this matter the pupil is not excused from the vision at any time: then he will hear about the operation
And indeed it comes to pass that some of those from Alayrach are present with us, who say that in Alayrach the great magdalan has been perforated, through which water flows
Truly no one in our land has made it: neither have I read of it in any of the ancient books: and it is possible that it is new
And these are the forms of the spirits of the magdals, as they remain over those who do not know them.
Let them be of their own air: and their extremities shall be like those of a triangle with a pointed base and acute angles.
Chapter XXIII.
On the care of the newborn flesh in the nose.
When the newborn flesh of various kinds is added to the nose, there is something which is absorbed from the scorpion of many feet: from which is cancer, stone, dusky-coloured flesh: from which is soft flesh, not dusky-coloured.
Therefore, in that which there is soft flesh, not fraudulent, neither cancerous, which comes from these meats, it is necessary that you make the diseased part rest between your hands facing outwards, and open the nose of it, and expel the mucus from it: then draw them outwards, and cut off what you have seen from them with a fine, sharp knife from one side, until you know that all the flesh has been removed
And if anything remains of that from which excision is impossible: then cut it off with a fine instrument easily, until nothing remains of it If blood dominates it, or if a hard swelling occurs: then oppose to it what is necessary for that: or that of bad swelling, then burn it with cautery, until the blood is separated, and remove all the flesh
Then expel from the nose after the incision of vinegar, water, or liquid. If indeed the nose is opened, and moisture proceeds from it until the palate, then you know that it is already healed.
If indeed moisture does not penetrate, according to what is necessary, then you know that there is still flesh born in the upper bones of the nose, which does not go away with the incision of the instrument
Therefore it is necessary that you introduce a thread of linen which has some thickness, and tie knots in it many times: and put between every knot the quantity of digit, or less: and make the diseased part rest, so that you may send one end of the thread into the nose with a handle, or in any way you can, and pull out the stench until it has passed out through the throat, and disappear from its guttur.
Many do like him in schools, that young Attomi: it is an easy matter for him.
Then place two extremities of the child, one that projects beyond the nose, and the other that remains in the nose And as you suture the flesh, take hold of the knots that are in the thread. Do this until you know that the flesh is together with the knots of the thread
Then draw out the thread: and put it in the nose after you have washed the blood away with a decoction of Egyptian unguent: do this for three days, or more, until the unguent has eaten away all that remains of the flesh
Then put at the end of the matter in the nose a lead cannula for a few days, until it is healed
If however urgent is the treatment that requires it, use this treatment also
For a head wound, when oil and other medicines are distilled in the nose, do this with silver, or with air: let it be like a small barley, open like a conch shell: and its passage be like that of a worm.
And if you wish to make a closed cannula, like a tube.
And a tube for a head wound should be full, closed: which has a handle at its back, with which you can grasp it, when you heat it in oil, or when you wish to take from its succus, and its contents fluid
Chapter XXV.
Many are born in the extremity of Theulus's nose, and grow greater, and increase with the days, until the ulcer has taken on the appearance of the aspect of his face.
And therefore it is necessary, that in the beginning of its appearance, it should be cut through, and its entirety extirpated. Then place above it, or cautery, or a burning medicine which is in its place
If, however, its incision is delayed until it has increased in size, then consider, if it is a stone, hard, of a dark colour, with little sensation: then do not touch it with the iron: for the swelling is cancerous
Many indeed are the waters which flow out of it, which cause the swelling of the apostema, and proceed from it a great malice above that which it has.
And if the apostema is soft to the touch, not of a dark colour, and the waters which flow out of it are such that the incision can be made throughout its entirety: then evacuate the patient, and cut it without fear, without pain: and care for the place with that which covers and supports it, until it is healed.
Chapter XXVI.
Of the suture of the nose, and the lip, and the ear.
You know that when a solution of continuity is accomplished in a cartilaginous substance, it offers little support in that operation, except in some individuals.
It is necessary therefore when anything has happened from it, that you consider whether it has a wound with its own blood: and then join the two ends of the wound with a suture: then care for it until it is healed
And if the continuity of the lips has already been separated, and each part is sound: then it is necessary to scour all the parts from the outside, until the blood has clotted. Then join the two lips with a suture, and tighten them, and smear upon it the blood of a dragon, and olibanum pounded: and place above the powder a piece of plaster of Paris, and some other solid plaster: and leave it bound for two days, or three Then loosen it up, and move the medicine: and let it go, until the threads are severed by themselves. Then care for it with the unguent, until it heals.
As for stitching, it is like gathering the solution of continuity, or with the knot, as we have said in the belly stitch: or gather the solution with the thread, as you were told.
Chapter XXVII.</start_of_turn>
About the extraction of lip knots.</start_of_turn>
Many people suffer from swelling in the insides of their lips due to teeth that remain lodged like rough seeds of herbs: and some of these are small, and some are large.</start_of_turn
Therefore it is necessary to cover the lips, and find over every knot of them, and suspend it with a thread, and cut it off from all sides.</start_of_turn
Then fill the place after the cutting with coarse salt, until the blood is clotted.</start_of_turn
Then it is to be bound with vinegar, and the place should be cared for with it, in which there is styptic action, until the wound is healed.</start_of_turn>
Chapter XXVIII.</start_of_turn
About the incision of a natural abscess on the gum.</start_of_turn
Many times there is formed on the gum a piece of meat which the ancients call an abscess.</start_of_turn
It is necessary therefore to suspend it with a thread: or to grasp it with forceps, and cut it off at its root, and let the pus run, or the blood.</start_of_turn
Then put on the place of the cutting some coarse salt, or other powdered astringents.</start_of_turn
If it returns not to its original place after treatment, for it has returned many times, then cut it off in the second instance and burn it: for it will not return after being burned.
Chapter XXIX
On the reason for extracting teeth with a steel instrument
When teeth gather on the surfaces both inside and outside and between the gums become rough and black, and when they decay and become yellow, until corruption spreads to the gums and causes inflammation of the teeth
Therefore you must make the patient sit between your hands and hold his head in your lap, and grasp the tooth and the gum in which you see the cortices, and do the same as with sand: until something remains from what was there, and do the same with blackness, and yellowness, and yellow spots, and other things until they move
If therefore you remove what is in it from the beginning of the reason, that is good: and if not, then repeat the reason on the second and third day, until you have finally completed your study in this matter.
And you know that teeth require different rasps of various forms, many figures: according to the preparation for your operation: because the rasp with which the tooth is scraped from the lower part is different from the rasp with which the teeth are scraped between, according to other forms
These forms of rasps are prepared for you, which you will find.
Chapter XXX
Chapter on the extraction of painful teeth
It is necessary to treat the tooth from its pain with all your skill, and later to eradicate it No ailment can be cured without eradicating its cause: for its essence is lofty. Therefore, when the eradication of its cause is not indicated, it is necessary to consider the patient's condition when ordering the eradication of the ailment itself, that firmness and security be established, and that you be confirmed in your report of the patient's pain.
Many times the patient suffers from pain and believes that it is in the tooth and eradicates it: but the pain does not cease until the diseased tooth is eradicated itself
We do not do that from the procedure of phlebotomy.
When you are confirmed that the pain itself exists in the tooth, then it is necessary to sacrifice around the tooth with sponges, in which there is some virtue, until the gum is separated from all parts: then move your fingers or use fine forceps at first slowly, until you have crushed it
Then place in that place large forceps at a good location, and the patient's head between your knees: which you have held firmly, so that it does not move: then draw out the tooth following its direction, so that you do not break it
If it does not come out, then grasp some of those instruments and introduce them under it from all sides with ease, and move it, just as you did at first
If the tooth is perforated or corroded: then it is necessary to fill the hole with gauze: and tie it with a fine thread, so that it does not break during your handling with the forceps.
And it is necessary to take care that there is great bleeding around the excision of the gum from all parts.
And keep your courage, so that you do not break it, and remain part of it, and depart from the ailment from which it suffers more pain than at first.
Neither do you attempt that which ignorant phlebotomists do in their frenzy, nor dare you eradicate it altogether, for you shall administer what we have mentioned.

The extremities are made like a limb of a boot, or like an almond.
If, therefore, they do not yield to you at the exit with these instruments, then you must break the heel [of the bone] at the root and detach the entire flesh, and introduce the small hook, which is called Palanca. Its form is like this.</start_of_turn>
The extremities are short, thick and blunt; and they must not be immersed, for they will break.</start_of_turn>
If the root comes out through that [hole], that is good: and if not, it is necessary to tear with these instruments which have a similar form.</start_of_turn
The form of the first triangle of the extremity, in which there is some thickness.</start_of_turn
The form of the small triangle of the extremity.</start_of_turn
And with other instruments and implements which are necessary for the teeth.</start_of_turn
It is also used with this instrument which is similar to a large nail of this form, triangular extremity twisted, in which there is some thickness, so that it does not break; and it must not be immersed.</start_of_turn
And you know that the instruments for teeth are many: and like the rest of the instruments they do not agree, and the prudent artist, skilled in his art, finds by himself the appropriate instrument according to the operation and the ailments.</start_of_turn
For the ailments from which the ancients did not speak of these instruments, because of the diversity of their species.</start_of_turn
If, however, the bone be fractured from the jaw-bone, or from any other bones of the mouth, or be putrefied: then inspect above it in its place with the instruments and forceps which I mentioned in the extraction of roots, and handle it with care, whose form is this.
Sit there something of the length which will gradually tighten, or be retained with it, so that it does not flee and recede, until the bone has gone: and restore the place with the physicians who are suitable for that.
If, however, there is a small putrefaction in the bone, then remove it from its putrefaction and care for it, until it is healed
Chapter 2.</start_of_turn>
About the closing of the tooth which projects over others.</start_of_turn>
When teeth project not according to their natural course, a wound is made thereby: and especially when this happens in women and girls, namely in the lower jaw.</start_of_turn
Therefore it is necessary to consider this.</start_of_turn For if a tooth has been born after another tooth and has not been placed, or if it is possible to suture it, or to file it: then extract it. And if it is united with another tooth, then cut through it with this instrument which has this form.</start_of_turn
It is like a small face, made of iron, with acute extremities blunt.</start_of_turn
And make your incision such that you may cut through it on many days, because of the hardness of the tooth, and that it does not damage any other teeth.</start_of_turn
If, however, it projects exposed from the surface of the liming: then file it away with a file made of iron, which has this form.</start_of_turn
Sit whole from the belly, and the hand of it [tooth] small of points like a nail when it is made: with which it is limited gradually in many days with ease, that it does not move the tooth, and falls off: then smooth it, in the end rub it with some rasps.
If it is a tooth from which a part has broken off, and it is painful: then it is necessary to limit it also, until the sharpness of that fracture has gone away, and it is equal: and it is flattened, and does not cause pain, nor corrupt speech.
Chapter 33.
Of the restoration of teeth with gold wire.
When it happens to the front teeth concussion and commotion from blows, or in a case: and the patient is unable to bite without fear of falling: and it is necessary to bind over it with physicians' stitches, and it does not help the treatment: then it is necessary to have a gut feeling in the mind, that they be bound with gold wire: for silver becomes yellow and putrefies after days: but gold never changes.</start_of_turn>
And let the wire be of medium thickness and of the size which can grasp between the teeth.</start_of_turn>
And the form of the restoration is that you take the wire, and pass through its double between two sound teeth: then you weave with two ends of the wire between the moving teeth, either one or more, until you reach with the thread until the other sound tooth.</start_of_turn And repeat the weaving until you reach the part from which you began: and tighten your hand with wisdom and skill, so that it does not move forward: and let your tightening be such as to bind the wire at the roots of the teeth, so that it does not break.</start_of_turn
Then insert the superabundant extremities of the male with scissors: and unite each one, and bring them close to the palm of the hand: and hide them between the sound tooth and the moved tooth, so that it does not harm the tongue: then draw away again so tightly as to remain.
If, however, it is loosened or cut through, string them up with another thread, and keep them firm in this way throughout the whole time.
This is the shape of teeth, and the figure of the rotation of two sound teeth and two moved teeth, like water
And when it is finished, as when one tooth or two have fallen out after biting, and they have returned to their places as we have said, and remain: this does not happen except by a skillful and experienced artist.
And when some piece of bone or flesh has been adjusted: and it is made like a tooth, and is placed in its place, from which the tooth has been removed and the thread has been passed: and it remains, and serves its purpose for a long time
Chapter 34.
When this ligament which happens under the tongue is cut, it is either natural, as it is born in man, or accidental, from an injury which has hardened
The operation in this case is to open the wound of the patient in his head in your hand, and lift up his tongue: then cut through that ligament which is nervous, until the tongue is freed from its retention.
If there is something hard and knotty in that place, and if that has come from the consolidation of the wound: then I draw up that nail, and I find that by the width, until I have cut through the ligament, and the knot is loosened
And so, let there be no tear in the depth of the flesh, and cut the artery there, and the flow of blood will increase.
Then it is to be bound in the opening with rose-water, or with vinegar, or with cold water.
Then place under the tongue a pad of linen which shall hold the patient at night: so that it is not consolidated in the second instance.
If however the flow of blood increases, then place upon the place a piece of burnt alum. If blood boils over, then cauterize the place with a cautery of charcoal, which is suitable for this: then care for the same with the rest of the treatment, until it is healed
Chapter 5.
When indeed under the tongue there appears a small abscess which absorbs the small ranula, hindering the natural operation of the tongue: and perhaps it becomes so great that it fills the mouth.
And the operation in this is that you open the mouth of the patient only in front of the sun: and consider the abscess
If indeed you see the same of a reddish or black, hard kind, which does not cause the patient any sensation: do not touch it, because it is cancer
And if it is inclined towards whiteness, in which there is moisture, then project into it a thin needle, and cut it with a slight sponge, and free it from all sides. If indeed blood boils over in your hour of operation, then place upon it a piece of burnt alum, until the blood is clotted: then return to your operation, until you have extracted it with its complement
Then it is bound with vinegar and salt: and care for the rest of the treatment which is suitable for that, until it is healed.
Treatment for wounds of two amygdalar.
Chapter six.
When the contents of the guttur godad, that is, the glands which resemble almonds, occur outside: and are called two amygdalar: when you treat them as we have said in the previous discourse, and they do not heal, then consider them
If the wound is hard, dark brown in colour, and has little sensation: do not touch it with iron.
And if it is red in colour, and its root is large: do not touch it even with iron, fearing the flow of blood, better let it alone until it matures Then you either pierce it or it ruptures by itself
And if it is white in colour, round, and its root is thin: then you must cut it open
And the operation in this is as you consider before your operation, if the wound has become calm completely, or if there is any diminution: then do sit the patient facing the sun, and place the head in your lap: open the wound, and take out the serum between your hands, and pull down the tongue with an instrument of this shape
Make it from silver, or from air, which is subtle like a knife
When you have finished with the tongue, and the wound is shown to you, it falls upon your hand: then grasp the hook, and bind it to the almond, and pull out the contents as much as you can, without tearing the tunics
Then strike the flesh with the instrument whose form follows this. The instrument's tip is like scissors: its extremities are bent inwards so that the opening of each one is acute towards the other. Care must be taken that it does not slip or be soaked in alcohol.</start_of_turn>
If the instrument is not available, cut with a spatula whose form follows this.</start_of_turn> It is acute from one side, not from the other.</start_of_turn>
And after you have cut through one layer of tissue, cut through the other in the same manner.</start_of_turn
Then let the patient gargle with cold water, or with vinegar and water.</start_of_turn
If blood flows from the wound, make the patient gargle with water in which coriander seeds have been boiled: or leaves of myrtle, and things like these from sponges, until the bleeding stops: then care for the wound until it heals.</start_of_turn
And when there are other swellings in the throat besides the two tonsils.</start_of_turn Cut them in the same way as the two tonsils.</start_of_turn
I myself have treated a woman with a swelling in her throat, which was causing her to choke, with little consciousness, which was making her gasp for air: and I forbade her from eating and drinking water: she died within one or two days.</start_of_turn
The swelling would only ascend as far as it could pass through two nostrils, until it came out through the two nostrils.</start_of_turn
The veins are thus swifter, and fixed in one common loop. Then I draw it out, and from that is the greater part.
Then I cut it off at the root of the nose
And I make that which projects from the other nostril proceed from the root of the nose.
Then I opened its mouth, and pressed its tongue: and afterwards I fixed the loop in itself, and then I cut off from it a part of it, and no blood escaped from it: for it is the gut of a woman, and immediately she drank water, and then she accepted food.
I do not cease to cut from that appendage for a long time: and the appendage follows the place where I cut it, until it is prolonged and together with it
I devised, and cauterized the appendage between the gut
It stood there from the addition: then I went away from that part, and I do not know what God did with it after me
Of the incision of the little appendage.
Chapter 7.
When the catarrus descends to the little one, and is swollen, and is long: then it is called perpendicular: and if it is in the lower part large, round, then it is called uua.
When it is cured with that which we said in the explanation, and the cure does not suffice: and you see that the appendage is soft and quiet from it: then it is necessary to cut it off
And what is gathered round that which is round, and is not of length, and is bloody, or of a brown color, or black, and has no sensation: then it is necessary to make an incision of it There is fear in every ailment over the sickly one.
There is fear in every ailment over the sickly one.
And it is necessary that you do not cut from that [area of the body] except that which adds to the natural limit without addition.
For if you cut from that more, you will wound and damage the speech and the voice.
Then after the incision use what we mentioned concerning the incision of two amygdals: and care for it until it heals
If however the sickly one returns from the incision: then it is necessary that you use your skill in cauterization without fear and without haste
And the mode of cauterization in this is not except with acute water: and it is that you place the head of the sickly one in your palm. Then press his tongue with the instrument which we mentioned. Then take from the water which I mentioned before in the chapter on cauterization, and mix with it burnt lime, and put it not thick, neither sparse, and press from it the concavity of this instrument
So that the extremities of it in which the medicine is placed is like the concavity of the radius of a spiral
And place the instrument with the medicine upon that very thing: and the sickly one lies upon his side, so that the saliva runs out from his mouth from the intrinsic medicine, and does not descend from that to the gut of him anything, and harms him.
Then hold your hand with the medicine. And you from the first hour until midday you must stay by the patient, until the fever has departed, and give the medicine without delay.
And if you wish to take a seat, place your hand on the outer side of the limb, apply the medicine to the limb, and insert the limb into the canula above, until the limb adheres to the limb above
Do this many times until you observe that the pulse has ceased to be affected by the burn. Then depart from him: for he will himself rise and fall in three days, or four.
If you do not find that she is better when you return, return to her: and after the burn, remove from the circumference of the limb all that is moist with medicine, and dry with oil; and keep her cool with cold water.
Care for the outside with bandages, and the inside with gargles, until she is healed.
Thus is this kind of treatment safer than incision and longer lasting than fear.
And when the limb is healed even with the burn, it is better to treat it with fumes than by incision or burning: for it is healed by means of fumigation in this way. Take calamine, and hyssop, and origanum, and rue, and chamomile, and wormwood, and saffron, and similar herbs: and mix them all together, or some of them in a pot, and immerse them in vinegar, and boil: and put the pot on a tripod in the middle of the pot.
Make it from silver, or from brass: and insert the extremity, in which is the pomegranate seed, into the patient's bone, until the vapor reaches the limb above the canula, until the limb becomes very dark
Then repeat over the area several times until it swells.
Do not perform this treatment at the onset of an abscess.</start_of_turn> Increase the heat in the abscess: do not perform this treatment until the abscess has cooled down.</start_of_turn>
If you do not have this instrument, take a willow branch and apply its bark to the extremity: so that it does not burn the sick bone: because the bark of the willow prevents the vapor from burning the bone: and this is from a good treatment with safety.</start_of_turn
On the extraction of thorns and bones from the jaw.</start_of_turn
Chapter 38.</start_of_turn
Many thorns adhere to the jawbone, or fish bone, or something else.</start_of_turn
It is necessary therefore that you extract what is visible from the wound after you have put the tongue with the instrument at the angle of the jaw, and you declare that it is in the jaw.</start_of_turn
And what is not visible to you and is hidden in the jaw, you must make the patient vomit before it is digested in the stomach.</start_of_turn Perhaps the foreign body will come out with the vomit.</start_of_turn
Or the patient may swallow a piece of chaff, or a radish, or a piece of dry bread, or take a sponge of dry seaweed: and bind it with a thread, and then swallow it.</start_of_turn When it has reached the place where the thorns or bones are, and they are extracted, then they are ejected.</start_of_turn
If therefore he does not depart with me as we have said: then use the instrument of lead according to this shape.
If therefore he does not depart with me as we have said: then use the instrument of lead according to this shape. Let it be thicker than the Radius minor and have a curvature at its extremity, which intrudes into his guttur with ease: and let him have his head raised above.
And beware of his epiglottis, that it does not suffer from pain, and drive with him bone, or thorn, or introduce himself the physician his hand.
Truly, that the patient intrudes: this is better: because of his science of the place of the annexed thing: and drives downwards, or pulls his hand upwards with the instrument, throughout all this according to the quantity that is prepared for him, until he departs
Of the extraction of blood.
Chapter XXXIX.
When he is treated for bleeding with that which I have said in the preceding discourse concerning the treatment with physicians, and it does not suffice, then consider in the guttur of the patient before his tongue, or behind the tongue after having grasped his tongue with the instrument which I have mentioned to you
If therefore your hand slips from the bleeding, extract it with a small hook, or with fine fingers from the middle.
If this is not possible with the hook: then grasp a curved needle, and introduce it into the guttur of the patient almost up to the guttur: then introduce into the curvature of the needle a burning iron with fire. Do this often: and let the patient abstain from all water throughout the day.
Then give him a full treatment of cold water, and open his mouth with it: and clench his jaw with it, and do not swallow anything from it: and let him drink water an hour after another with his hand. The bleeding ceases when it feels water falling from it.
If it does not stop when the water is poured on it, then smother the diseased part with wool or with an instrument as I mentioned in the explanation of the sponge
Do it often, for it will stop bleeding by itself.
The method of operation in the application of the sponge is as follows: take a ball of cotton wool which has been boiled with urine and which has been made dry by fire: put the pot on the instrument and make a hole in the middle of it.
Then pour the sponge onto the wound and hold the diseased part in the extremity of the instrument and clamp it so that the sponge does not escape until you know that the sponge has stopped the bleeding For bleeding stops immediately.
If it does not stop, repeat the application of the sponge often
And the patient can sit still and eat garlic and onions, and does not drink water.
It is necessary therefore that he go out like this.
This is the way in which the bleeding is extracted from the gut when it falls onto the urine.
It is like tweezers, as with urine: except that it has this hardness which penetrates the gut And its extremity is like the beak of a heron which is named ciconia, in which there is the hardness of lime: when it grasps something, it does not let go of it at all
Of the opening of the rectum, and its cutting, and care in general
Chapter XL.
There are many different kinds of abscesses, of various degrees, according to the recollection of their nature, namely one kind, and one of this kind in this book: and they differ in perforation and cutting from two modes.
One kind of abscess is that which originates from moisture.</start_of_turn>
The other kind is that which arises from the body itself.</start_of_turn>
Since abscesses arise in the head, they are different from those that arise in the belly: and an abscess that arises in a fleshy part is different from one that arises in a joint: each one of these has its own judgment based on its operation.</start_of_turn
There are also abscesses which do not require perforation, except after the passage of time and the completion of its complement: and there are those which require perforation while they are raw and have not matured, according to their complement.</start_of_turn
For example, abscesses which are close to joints.</start_of_turn
An abscess which arises near a joint and persists, may possibly corrupt the ligaments or nerves of that joint: this is the cause of the contraction of that limb.</start_of_turn>
Or an abscess which is near a principal limb: for if you delay its perforation until it matures, it will cause pain or swelling or both in that limb.</start_of_turn
Or it is close to an organ, perforate it immediately: it is not right to perforate an immature abscess, except if it is close to an organ, so that it does not putrefy deeply and reach the interior of the belly, and form a fistula, or remain unhealed.</start_of_turn
It is necessary that you know the time of perforation of the apostemate, which has matured according to the complement: and it is among the sedation of pain, recession of fever, reduction of redness, and pulsation, and the acuteness of the apostemate of the head: and the other signs.
It is necessary that you make the perforation in a lower place of the apostemate, and more cautiously: and let the perforation be wide in length of the body, if the apostemata are in the parts of the hands and feet, and in the places of lacerations, and strings, and nerves, and arteries, and finally in all the places where there is no reflection
But in those which reflect, be cautious with the perforation according to that limb.
When indeed the aposmate is in carious places: then it is better that you delay the perforation of it until its digestion has been confirmed, as we said according to the complement
For if you perforate it before that, you prolong the course of the evil from it, and there is much pain and swelling, and perhaps the lips will swell up, and deepen its extent
And some apostemata are perforated according to the width of the body for necessity: or according to that which the limb requires
And it is necessary that you manage in small apostemata a moderate perforation, and in great apostemata a wide perforation: or many sections like the magnitude of the apostemate.
And there are some apostemata in which it is necessary to sew the skin: and this happens when it has been made like a piece of leather, and has been made at the end, which is dead: as happens in many things, as in wounds of the gut, and abscesses.
And from bones there are those which are cut with section having three angles. And from bones there are those which are cut like the shape of a myrtle leaf.
Like the heel of the foot.
And from bones there are those in which are administered round section and lunar section: and similar bones from sections.
This, however, which has no head, like the superficial heel bones, must be perforated through a superficial perforation, or only plane
And it must be, when the heel is thick, and when it is united with much flesh, and you perforate it, that you do not break it and extract all the pus at once: rather extract from it a part of it Then oil the heel until another day. Then draw out some of the pus again.
Do this often according to the degrees, until it is expelled: especially if the patient is feeble of virtue, or a pregnant woman, or a young child, or an old man who is decrepit: for the spirit of the animal is dissolved with the expulsion of the matter: and perhaps the patient will die, and you will not perceive it
Therefore take heed of this chapter with great caution
And after you have perforated the bone, which you must perforate the heel bones, you must remove the clot: and consider If there is a clot in the heel bones, or if it is a flat section, then administer ointment from liniment, or old fat And if the heel is large, and there are many wounds of perforation, then you must introduce into every wound ointment, until they reach the innermost part
And if you have excised a part of the skin in the apostemate, or if you have cauterized the circumference: then it is necessary to apply to the wound either fat or as it is wont when a bandage is taken off, or to spread over it a covering of wool without moisture: and to draw it tight until the third day.
And draw it tight, and care for it as much as is necessary until it is healed
But if there should be a flow of blood in your operation at the time: then give cold water and vinegar, after having swallowed in some sponge: and place it over the site of the flow of blood many times over.
But if the flow of blood should persist: then it is necessary to administer treatment, care, and powders, which I have mentioned in many places of this book, and from experience.
But if it is in the winter, and the site of the apostemate is of many nerves: then it is necessary to instill sponges with wine and warm fat: and place them over the place.
And if it is in the summer, and the place is fleshy: then it is necessary to place sponges soaked in water and fat, or in wine and fat, and all of this cold. Until then, as we have said, on the third day you must loosen the apostemate, and remove it, and administer to it what is suitable for it until it is healed.
This is what is necessary to know concerning the treatment of apostemata in general
According to the manner of distinguishing things, as I have said of every apostemate, how it is necessary to treat each one separately
Chapter 41.
Of the section of apostemata which happen in the head-skin.
The head has small abscesses in its bones, which are of the kind of knots which contain tunics, which are like sacks: as if they were the breasts of a hen.
There are many kinds of these knots
They are of many kinds: some contain fat, others moisture like mud, others moisture like blood and pus, and some like stones
And in their section and their extraction there is no fear, as long as one does not do violence to the arteries during their section.
The operation for their section is to be learned with the instrument which has the form which follows these things, which is called the Intromissum, until you know what it contains.
For if it contains moisture, then dry it out by the superficial section: by this form
Begin by making an incision from point b to point g. When the moisture has been evacuated, remove the knot which contains it, and do not leave anything behind
There will be many of them remaining, if anything is left behind
Then immerse the head in Egyptian unguent, if it is present: or in water and salt. And apply to it a willow twig, and keep it until the next day. The abscesses will be softened by this.
Repeat the operation on the head with Egyptian unguent three times, and if it does not improve, until you are confident that there is nothing remaining of the abscess. Then apply a bandage with unguent until it is healed
If the swelling continues to contain a pimple: then dry it out with this form, by cutting with a blade having the shape of a cross: and project the hooks between the two cuts, and scrape it clean from all sides: and strive with your skill in the extraction of the tunic which contains it.
If, however, it makes resistance, the artery has burst: then do that which I shall tell you afterwards.
And in a swelling which contains a stone, do the same from the cut, and the treatment is the same as before.
The cutting above a swelling which contains a stone is easier: because there is little blood and moisture. And sometimes there are some swellings of the head in some people, in which there is no moisture at all
Because I have cut above a swelling of a woman's head, and I found a swelling like a solid stone, hard, rough, white, which could not be broken: and if I pierced it with anything, it wounded it.
In other swellings of the head which occur, except for these which occur in the heads of children, and at the roots of the ears, the complete cut is a superficial cut
Or make the perforation always from below upwards, so as to drive the blood downwards.
Then care for it as suits the case.
Note: The provided text does not include any information regarding the section of the thyroid in the neck, so I cannot translate that section.
Chapter 42.
Many swellings of the neck occur under the chin, under the armpits, and in the groin: and sometimes in other parts of the body.
And above all that happens from the things which happen in the neck, there is one, and many: and they are generated from one. And every Strophula comes from the things themselves which are inside their own tunic, as in the nodes and the apostemata of the head, as we have said.
And the species of these Strophula are many.</start_of_turn> And from things there are soft: and from things there are which contain humors: and from things there are malignant, which do not obey treatment.</start_of_turn>
And concerning the things from which good humors arise in the touch, the manifestation of which is near the color of the skin, and which move to every part, and are not attached to the nerves of the neck, neither to the arteries, nor to the veins, nor is it deep: it must be cut away by a superficial section from the upper part to the lower part of the body from the line, be it from the line, or from below, and remove it from all sides: and spread out two lips of the skin with one finger, or with many fingers if necessary, as we said concerning the apostemata of the head, and remove it gradually.</start_of_turn>
And it is important to be cautious that the bone, or the nerve, does not be injured.</start_of_turn
And let the sponge be not too acute, so that it does not add its hand to the incision, or disturb the patient, and cut only what is necessary.</start_of_turn
If however you cut a vein, or an artery, or if you are forbidden by the operation, then put in the wound a piece of sponge which has been well-soaked in powder which absorbs blood, and compress the wound, and hold it still until the bleeding has ceased: or until the swelling has gone down.
Blood is severed by the clamp of Redi, until the operation is finished.
Then inquire with your index finger whether anything remains from the other small trophues: if so, cut them away and wash them clean.
If there is in the root of the trophue a large bone: then it is necessary that you do not cut through that trophue from its root: but rather that you bind it with a strong doubled thread, and let it go until it falls off by itself without any suture
Then apply a sponge soaked in Egyptian unguent to the part which you have immersed in the unguent Take care of yourself.
If the entire trophue is cut through, then it is necessary that you join together two lips of the wound: and hold them in place immediately, after you have washed because there remains no surplus.
If, however, you wash and find there remains surplus due to the size of the trophue, then it is necessary that you insert it to the cutting of its root and pull it out: and administer a suture as we have said.
And what remains of the trophues, keep it moistened with a perforation made with a superficial hole: so that you may see the place of its maturity: and put the perforation from that which follows below the body as we have said
Then administer after the perforation a lint with unguent, and similar things, so that it may consume what remains of the corruption: until when you wash the wound will be healed: then take care of yourself with the unguent of the generation of flesh, until it is healed
Chapter 43.
Regarding the section of the epiglottis from the epiglottis to the gullet by accident.
They say that in the Epiglottis of the ancients, no one in our land has made it: this is the writing of their discourse.
But in other parts of the body, if the section of the Epiglottis be not delayed, it must be made: for if it be not done, all the veins and the lungs will be diseased.
In those who have a soft swelling in the mouth, or the gullet, or in two tonsils, when there is no inflammation in the channel, it is necessary to make a section of the Epiglottis in order to escape the destruction which results from its prolapse
It is necessary therefore, when we wish to do this, to cut through the Epiglottis under three or four circles of the Epiglottis, with a small section across the width, in the place where there is a section in cartilage, not in bone: and this place is convenient for the section, because it is devoid of flesh, and the blood vessels from it are long
If the surgeon is timid, then it is necessary to extend the skin of the gullet with a finger. Then grasp the skin, until it reaches the channel: there will be bleeding from it.
Then cut through the cartilage which we have mentioned: and it is signified by the escape of phlegm from it, when it is ruptured, and by the cutting of the mucous membrane.
And hold the wound open for a while.
When the time has passed in which the prolapse is overcome, gather together the two lips of the wound in the skin, and close it alone without cartilage
Then give medicines which promote the healing of the flesh, until it is healed
Albucasis said. Albucasis said.
And that which I saw with mine own eyes, that a handmaid took a knife and put it into her gut, and it went into a part of the pulmonary canal.
I was called to care for her, and I found her to be dead like a corpse
I saw that there was a wound, and I found blood which had escaped from the wound of the heel I was doubtful that she would recover, neither would she guide me: and the wind was going out of the wound.
I did well, and I bandaged her wound, and cared for her: and the handmaid did nothing else, except that she wept in the water: and she returned after a few days in better condition than before.
Hence it is said: there is no fear in the section of the epiglottis
Of the section of the hernia of the gut
Chapter 44.
This is called the hernia of the gut, and it is a large swelling, according to the colour of the body: and it is very common among women
It is of two kinds: either it is natural: or it is accidental
In the natural kind there is no wisdom.
The accidental kind is of two kinds: one of which is like a swelling of fat knots The other kind is like a swelling which comes from the bursting of an artery And in this there is fear, and it is not right to presume that it is only with the knife, except in the case of the heel: and you must prove it, and examine it with the introducer. If therefore you find the thing like a knot of fat, and it is not suspended with any of the veins: then dry it up like knots are dried up: and draw it out with that which contains it from the cyst, if there is one in the cyst: or if not, then examine all of it. Then take care of the place with that which is necessary for the cure, until it is healed.
Chapter 45.</start_of_turn>
Regarding the excision of things which are like knots.
There are many kinds of knots, and I have already mentioned all their kinds in their discussion: and it is necessary to say here the difference between a knot and an excision: in case of doubt.
I say, therefore, that when an excision has heat, fever, and pain which are unbearable, until the boiling point of superfluousness is settled and corruption is completed: then the fever and heat will cease
When there is no heat, fever, or pain with a knot, and it is contained in a cyst which is its own sac, which is according to the color of the body: and it is like cicer, and makes like a batrachia, and is greater and less.
And there are two kinds: either fat or containing moisture And the colors of moisture are many, as I mentioned in the discussion
It is necessary, therefore, when you come to the treatment of the knot, to experience it, and to inquire about it at first with the instrument which is called Intromissum, according to the form of it which will be in the following chapter.
And the way of inquiring about the heel, and all knots, is that you take this instrument and introduce it into the moist place which you find in the heel: and you gradually draw out your fingers with that until you know that the instrument has pierced the skin Then lastly touch your hand according to the measure of the magnitude of the apostemate.
Then extract the Intromissum, and consider that which emerges from its nest
If therefore it emerges moisture running, whatever its colour be: then dry it with a superficial section, as I have said concerning the other apostemata
If it does not emerge moisture in the nest of the Intromissum, then you know that it is fatty: dry it therefore with a section having the shape of a cross, according to this shape, as I have taught you: and suspend it with threads, and scrape off the skin from all sides with ease: and keep the fat if it remains upon it, until you have extracted it whole with the Node.
If however it is ruptured in the bladder during the operation, and it is not possible to extract it whole, as often happens in this case: then extract it broken, until nothing remains of it from it
For if anything remains of it little or much, it returns to the Node according to much.
If it incites you, and there remains little of it: then make an incision at your completion, with some corrosive powders sharp: and ligate the incision, and place above that which sits the cold apostema, and care for it with the rest of the care, until it is healed
If there is a large Node, then tie its two lips together, and care for it with that which is contained within it
If however there be a contrary swelling painful, or not painful: then strengthen, and make an incision at the place of the wound, and let it go loose for two or three days, until the wound has decayed, and the blood-boil has rested: then return to the incision of that which remains of the Node
Concerning the instruments outside for section and perforation.
Concerning the instruments outside for section and perforation.
The instruments outside are of three forms.
The instruments outside are of three forms: a large one, a medium one, and a small one
Let them be of iron, with rounded ends, so that they hasten the entrance into the abscess.
And these are the forms of those which are for experience, that is, for perforation: and one of them is called a buris, which is a perforator, and there are three forms of them
The instruments outside are of three forms: a large one, a medium one, and a small one
They agree, so that they may investigate through these abscesses, and exits, and fistulas, and bubbles from what is between them and the bones.
And others are round, tapered, smooth, like a great needle which is hammered under a shield, from citrine, or from air, or from iron, or from silver
And the best of them are those which are made from citrine.
And experience is also made of black lead, which agree so that they may pass through these fistulas, whose concavity is reflected, so that they reflect with their smoothness with those reflections
And there are three forms of them once more For since they are of iron, they are long, medium, and short, according to the quantity of the breadth of the fistula and the tightness of it
The form of needles, and there are many forms of them
For since they are of iron, they are simple, that is, they have a single curve: and there are three forms like liquids, large, medium, and small
From the veins there are five kinds of caeci: there are three sorts.
From the veins there are five sorts of caeci: there are three kinds which have two curves, and three kinds which have three curves.
These are the shapes of scalpels, which cut and scrape knots and abscesses: there are three kinds: for large, medium, and small.
Their extremities which make the cut are acute, other extremities are not acute: they must not be placed thus, except when a vein or nerve is to be lithotomized in the excision of knots near the fear of cutting the vein, or a nerve: and that the patient may recover quickly from the pain which he endures in the excision of an abscess.
They are made of air, and are similar to a radio with which alcohol is made: and in their wide extremity is a hidden Spatumilis point: and in this runs inwards and outwards whenever desired, like water
The shapes of the Spatumiles which are driven between the fingers at the perforation of an abscess: and they are not perceived by the patient: and there are three sorts, large, medium, and small
The shapes of the veins when their flow of blood is separated: and there are three sorts, large, medium, and small.
They are made of air, or of citrine, round, to the length of a palm, like water: and they are flexible.
And it is necessary that these sorts of veins be large and small with you: so that you can cut the blood quickly when necessary, and then when it is not necessary for the physician to be present
Truly, you must not use silk in the incision of blood in every part of the body, and must not use it except in places where there is carnation: such as tears of the leg, and hip, and tears of the arms, and breasts, and belly, and groin, and similar places, from tears of carnation, humidis.
And when there are other small instruments of silk of similar shape to the knuckles of fists, according to their form: with which blood is severed when it flows from the place of phlebotomy, or at the incision of the vein, or artery: and when there are wounds of a round shape according to this form.</start_of_turn>
Chapter XLVII.</start_of_turn>
Of the care of the breasts of men which are absorbed by the breasts of women.</start_of_turn>
When the breasts of some men swell because of sleep (that is, when they begin to become soiled during sleep) until they resemble the breasts of women: and they remain after the sleep.</start_of_turn
Whoever dislikes this should cut across the breast with a lunar section, according to this shape from the line, to the line, and then scrape off all the fat.</start_of_turn Then apply alum from the ointment of the incision.</start_of_turn Then join together the two lips of the wound with a suture, and care for it until it is healed.</start_of_turn
If, however, the breast leans downwards and becomes soft because of its size, like women: then it is necessary to find in its two upper sides two similar circular sections like the moon, each of which contains the other at the ends as far as the greater line includes the smaller, according to this shape from the line, to the line, and then scrape off the skin which is between the two lips, and remove the fat, and administer what we have said about the suture and powder, which is necessary for the care, until it is healed.</start_of_turn
If, however, you do not perform the incision which is necessary, either because of the patient's anxiety or because of the flow of blood: then it is necessary to insert a sponge soaked in corrosive unguent beneath the wound and withdraw it, until that which remains of the fat has been corroded. Then care for it until it heals.
And concerning the perforation of the apostematis, which occurs under the nail of the thumb.
Chapter XLVIII.</start_of_turn>
These apostemata which occur under the thumb are of the kind of hard strophe, which contains vesicles, and from these are the things which contain humors.
And these things which are from the humors which contain moisture, it is necessary to cut with a lunar section, in the manner of this figure, from the line b to the line g, as when all that is in the apostemata from the marrow is evacuated, then insert a sponge soaked in corrosive unguent beneath the wound and withdraw it until that which remains of the fat has been corroded
Then remove the piece of bone, and care for it with a suitable unguent until it heals.</start_of_turn>
If the apostema were of the kind of nodules of the strophe, then cut through the top of it, as we said concerning the strophe which is equal in size.</start_of_turn>
If, however, a wound has extended in this way as to emit pus, then apply cautery to it, as we said above.</start_of_turn
Chapter XLIX.</start_of_turn
And concerning the incision of the apostemata which occurs because of the artery and the vein.</start_of_turn
When the artery is torn and the skin above the wound is consolidated, then many times a wound occurs from the apostema: and in the same way a wound occurs in the vein also, as in these aposmata and swelling.</start_of_turn
And the signs which show that swelling and elevation are caused by an artery and a vein are: because when swelling is caused by an artery, it is long, aggregated in the depth of the body: and when you press the swelling with your fingers, you feel as though there is a stridor.
And that which is caused by a vein is rounded in the manifest body.
And the incision above this swelling is an error, especially if it is under the armpits, and the groin, and the nape of the neck, and in many parts of the body: and it is great danger. It is necessary therefore that its care be taken with fire, and that from iron also in the limbs, or in the head, care must be taken
Because of that which is from iron is from the swelling of the orifice of the artery, find in the cut in the length. Then open the cut with hooks, afterwards the artery: and loosen the swelling from the tunics until it is detached.
Then introduce under these the needles, and make the swelling penetrate up to the other side, and ligate the artery with a double thread in two places, according to what you were taught in the extraction of two arteries which are in the times
Then tie the place which is between the two ligatures with a sponge, until the blood which is in it has gone out, and the swelling is dissolved
Then give treatment which generates pus, until the ligatures fall away: afterwards care for this with suitable unguents until it is healed.
If it should be swelling because of the cutting of a vein, then you must hold your hand as much as you can from the swelling with the skin. Then insert the needle under the place where you have held your hand, and make it penetrate: and there be in it a doubled thread, until you extract it from the other side. Then bind with the thread itself the surrounding tissue: according to what I have told you concerning the thread of the vein, from two parts with two extremities of the thread.
If, however, you are about to draw out the thread, then insert the needle again with another thread under the whole surrounding tissue at the incision of the needle: first, and then draw tight your thread in four places.
Then dry the surrounding tissue in its middle, until when it comes out what is in it: then cut away the excess of the skin, and let go what is bound from it.
Then place upon it a little powder which you have submerged in wine, and oil. Then apply treatment, which is done with poultices and unguents, until healing takes place.
(The remainder of the text is not included in the request, so I cannot provide a translation for it.)
And concerning a wound caused by the twisting of nerves.
Like that which happens with a wound in an artery and a vein, in the same way happens a wound in nerves: which happens in a violent percussion, or happens from excessive labor, and similar things: and it is most common in the armpits, or the calves, and in every place in which there are joints: and it is a serious wound.
It is like the color of the rest of the body, and is in various dispositions without pain: and when it is squeezed with force, feels in it a weakness similar to fainting
And it is not a wound gathered in the depth of the body, but is under the skin, and it is moved to every part, and does not go forward, or backward, or to the sides
That which is in the joints from the bones should not be pierced with iron. Perhaps thereby a contraction will happen.
However concerning that which is in the head or in the face, find the skin with a spatula. If there is a small swelling, then hold it with forceps and cut it off from its root.
And if it is large, then suspend it with a thread and scrape it off: then take it away and join it with a suture: and care for it until it heals.
Chapter 51.
Concerning the cutting away of a swelling that happens between the bones.
It often happens to many people in the depths of their bodies, and in the rest of their bodies, a swelling which is named Fungalia because of its likeness to mushrooms.
Whose root is thin and their head is large, and their lips are closed over them And it is from a small bone: and it is from a bone which becomes large downwards
And I myself once saw a man, and in his belly were two swellings which were greater than any other like mushrooms: there was no difference between them, white or black, as regards the root, and they were closed over their lips, and they were found to be soft and moisture always ran from the bone.
I cut them away, and I found in one almost eighteen ounces and in the other almost six ounces. And the operation in their incision is like this: if the patient is moist and the colour of the swelling is white, moist and thin of root: then cut it with a wide spatula and be quick about it.
Many blood vessels are expelled from the vicinity of its section: be careful therefore if blood incites you, then cauterize it.
If you see a sickly and timid patient from an incision with iron, then take lead from leaden thread made into a loop, and tighten it with this: its method is as we have said, and let it go in two days.
Then add lead to the tightening. Do not cease tightening the lead until it is broken, and it falls away without toil.
If, however, the vessel be large of the root, then in its incision there is something fearful and small: especially that which is within
It is possible indeed that you cut through its middle Then cauterize it, so that it does not return
Then care for it, until the wound is healed.
And beware lest you cut through a vessel which is of a dusky colour, little sense, and bad aspect: for that is a cancerous swelling: and I will remind you of cancer after this
Chapter 52
Of the care of the great Vmbiliculus.
The great Vmbiliculus swells from many ulcers. Or from rents in the bowels which are above the belly: and comes out from them either blood vessels or intestine, according as happens in the rest of the ruptures. Or from blood which flows from the vein, or from the artery, as has been said before Or from a clotted mass in that place
If, however, it is because of a wound of the scrotum, and the exit of the testicle: then the colour of the swelling is similar to that of the body: and it is soft, without pain: and appears in various places. And if it is because of the discharge of the intestine, then its place is as we have mentioned, with an increase in various places. When you touch it with your finger, it is hidden: then it returns, and perhaps there is a sound with it: and it swells greatly at the entrance of the bath, and causes great pain.
If, however, it is because of humidity, it is soft: then it is not hidden when you touch it with your hand, neither does it constrict, nor does it swell.
If it is because of blood, then it appears like a black mole on the scrotum
If it is because of a dead animal: then the swelling is great, thick, hard, and is formed according to the quantity of one
If it is because of wind, then its touch is soft.
And the treatment for this is as you consider, if the swelling of the navel is because of a vein or an artery or the wind: then it is necessary to abstain from its treatment For in this there is fear and danger, as it was taught you in the chapter where I said that swellings caused by an artery or a vein.
If the swelling of the navel is because of the intestine or the spleen: then it is necessary to expel the patient, as long as he holds his breath, and to keep him standing extended Then signs with a cauter in the circumference of the whole navel Afterwards command him to rest his head between your hands over his back. Afterwards encircle with a broad bandage the circumference of the belly around the place where you have cauterized.</start_of_turn> Afterwards extend the middle of the belly towards the upper parts with a large hook.</start_of_turn> Afterwards bind him firmly around with thread or silk cord: and make a knot that will not slip.</start_of_turn>
Afterwards open the extended middle of the belly above the ligament.</start_of_turn If therefore you find that the intestines are caught by the ligament: then draw out the ensnared, and introduce a finger of the index into it, and press the intestine inwards towards the belly: and if you find a tumor, then grasp it with a hook, and cut off its excess.</start_of_turn
But if it is a vein or an artery: then encircle it much.</start_of_turn Then return to your operation.</start_of_turn And grasp two needles, and introduce them through two strong threads: and introduce two needles around the circumference which you made around the belly in the manner of a cross, which you make penetrate.</start_of_turn
Then tighten the belly in four places over the needles: and if you wish, remove the needles and leave the place, until the extended flesh decays: and it will fall away by itself: or cut it off when it becomes thin and decays.</start_of_turn
Then care for him with what is necessary from the unguents, until he is healed.</start_of_turn
And if there is a prominence of the belly from the flesh or from moisture: then it is necessary to concave the belly, as we have said.</start_of_turn And extract blood, or moisture, as you find it in it.
Then care for the place with that which solidifies it.
Wound care
And care for the wound
We have already spoken about the different kinds of cancer, and how they are treated by physicians: and we must be careful not to cause ulcers while treating them with iron. We have also said that cancer is generated in the matrix, and we must be cautious in treating it
The ancients have also said that when cancer is in a place where it can be extirpated, as for example that which is in the breast or in the thigh, and the like, from the limb which is to be excised in its entirety: especially when it is in its beginning and small.
When it has advanced, and is great, it is not right to approach it
I cannot cure anything from that: neither can anyone else before me
And the operation for that, when it is in the place which we have mentioned, is to precede and evacuate the black bile somewhat. Then perform a bloodletting if you find it with a manifestation of repletion.
Then prepare the patient for the operation, in which you place it with the operation
Then remove from the cancer the nails which are contiguous to it Then bandage the wound from every side with the skin, according to the prescription, until nothing remains of its roots: and let the blood flow, and do not bind it up too quickly, but rather express the place, and extract the thick blood entirely with your hand, or with whatever instruments are available
If, however, it causes the flow of great blood from an incision in an artery or a vein: then cauterize the vein until the bleeding ceases. Then care for it with the rest of the treatment until it heals.

(The provided text does not include any subsequent sentences or headings, so the translation stops here.) We shall now discourse of the variety of dropsy and how water is aggregated: and the signs of each kind, and their treatment with physicians.
And that which is cured with iron is not except for one kind of swelling alone: and it is not approached with iron in the case of tympani: neither in the case of acute dropsy: for that is deadly
When you are treated for this kind of dropsy by a physician, and the treatment does not please you: then consider it For if there is weakness alongside the dropsy, or if there is any other illness along with the dropsy, such as if there is also a cough or solution of the bowels, and things like these: then do not give him iron
If, however, you see the patient exuberant with virtue, neither is it puer nor old: then the mode of operation in this case is that you support the patient sitting between your hands, and express his belly with your hand, pushing the water downwards towards the lower part of the belly
Then take a sponge with thorns, according to this form. Sit two acute angles, long and acute at the extremities like a sponge with thorns But there is something slight in this which is useful gradually, so that it does not pass through to the intestines during the operation until it has healed the wound itself.
Then consider. Then consider. If there is a generation of hydrosis from the intestines, then it is necessary to lengthen with a section from the navel to the quantity of three fingers below the navel.
If, however, the generation of hydrosis is because of the disease of the liver: then let your section be to the left from the navel three fingers.
If it is because of the spleen, then let the section be on the right side: and it is not necessary also that it should be on the side above that which the patient wishes to vomit, in order that there may not be excessive flow to the place of weakness
Then pierce with an instrument the whole skin. Then introduce into that section and raise your hand with the sponge between the skin, and scrape, as though you are scraping yourself: and let the quantity which is scraped be equal to the quantity of a finger, or somewhat less
Then pierce the sponge until the sponge reaches the place of emptiness: and that is the place of water Then draw it out, and introduce it into the opening of the instrument, which has this shape And it is like a cannula: it is made of silver, or air, or gold, flexible, thin: in its lower part there is a small opening, and in its sides there are three openings, two from one side, and one from the other side: and its extremity is cut off, according to the manner of cutting a hook, like water: at its upper extremity is an arm.
For when the instrument reaches the water, then immediately it descends above the instrument, ergo it evacuates from the water in an hour the quantity of a medium
If you evacuate more than is necessary, at some time the patient may die from the resolution of the animal spirit. Or perhaps there occur to him syncope which approaches death.
Evacuate accordingly according to the quantity of virtue in him, and according to what is significant to thee the patient's condition from the virtue of his pulse, and from his health
Then withdraw the instrument, and retain water.
For indeed it is retained immediately because of the skin which retains the orifice which I mentioned before: as I said, perform it accordingly.
Then repeat the instrument on the other side, if you find the patient can tolerate it: and also evacuate from water the quantity which is fitting.
Do it a few times on several days without fear, and take care from error: until there remains from water almost nothing.
If however at any time you fear the patient, and you discharge from water a great quantity: then care for him with burial in warm sand, and much sweating in a bath and in the sun, and expect above the seat: and care for him with physicians of the bath, until he is healed: and cauterize upon the stomach, and the spleen, and the liver, after the discharge of the water: as I have said before
Concerning the care of infants who are born in unperforated urine-places.
Chapter 55.
When anyone is born from the belly of his mother, and his head is not perforated, or the opening is narrow, or is not in its place.
Therefore one must immediately perforate it with a fine needle when it is born with Spatumil under the tongue, according to this fashion
Then place in the cavity a small lead weight and bind it: and keep it for three days, or four.
When you wish to urinate, move the weight and mix it in Then reduce it.
And if you do not place lead, it is possible that the urine flowing over the place will not allow it to close
That which has a strict opening is treated with lead, as we have said, for many days, until it becomes enlarged.
In those where the opening is not in its proper place, they are treated with lead. For that which is born from the head of the bladder, the opening is at the end of the bladder: therefore it cannot mix towards the front, until it lifts the bladder up to the upper parts Neither is there generation, because the sperm cannot pass through to the womb following a straight line: and it is a grievous wound to be left open
And the method of treatment in this is that the sick man rests on his back Then extend the head of the bladder with your left hand, and place the thumb of your right hand over the head of the bladder, at the root of the penis, with a sharp knife, or with a pointed instrument like a chisel: as it is the cutting of the penis, or as you would a root, so that half of it comes out like the head of the bladder: and that the opening falls in the middle according to what is necessary.
And guard yourself at the operation from the flow of blood. Many times this happens Opposition therefore should be made with that which cuts blood, and care of the wound, until it is healed
Regarding the swelling which occurs in the preparation and head of the scrotum, and corruption, blackness, and adhesion.
Regarding the swelling which occurs in the preparation and head of the scrotum, and corruption, blackness, and adhesion.
Many such swellings occur in the testicles, and are caused by the putrefaction of the flesh.
And among these there are both malignant and non-malignant kinds
The malignant kind must be treated by suspending it with a fine thread and cutting it off, until the root of the pain has disappeared Then apply over the wound a soaked sponge of Egyptian unguent. And afterwards care for the wound with a fine unguent until it has healed
If the swelling is malignant, of a reddish colour, then it is necessary to administer cauterium on it after making an incision, and to reduce the cause of the swelling itself
If, however, the swelling is in the preparation of the testicles and is not circumcised, and is part of the swelling which is inside the preparation and part of the swelling which is outside: then it is necessary to increase the swelling which is inside first, until it is consolidated, and then care for the outside; for when you care for the outside at the same time, the preparation may be damaged
There may also be swelling in the testicles, and blackening of the preparation and corruption It is necessary therefore to remove everything that is blackened and corrupted, and which wishes to corrupt
Then apply over the wound a layer of honey which has been consumed with barley flour and trefoil herbs.
And care for it with the remaining treatment until it has healed
If blood flow increases, then apply the cautery with a lunar cautery, according to this shape.
The cautery is useful in two situations: for blood flow and for a wound that has become corrupted
When the head of a vein is damaged and is completely destroyed in an hour: then it is necessary to introduce lead into the marrow of the bone, so that the diseased part may adhere to it
In the adherence of the membrane with the head of the vein, and this adherence does not happen unless the membrane itself is healthy, and does not require excision: and when adherence does happen by a wound or swelling: it is necessary to remove the clot with a blunt spatula until the ligament is severed and the head of the vein is freed from all parts.
When it is difficult to discern these things, then it is necessary to remove something from the head of the vein and from the membrane Because the membrane when subtle, perhaps is pierced by its swiftness.
Then separate the membrane from the head of the vein with fine linen cloth, which has been made soft in cold water, so that they do not adhere again
Then treat with balsamic wine, until it is solidified
Chapter 57.
Regarding the treatment of children, and the healing of errors from accidents.
Excision is not a continuous solution like the rest of wounds: indeed when it is done by our operation, by our will, and when it is in children of their own kind, it is necessary to sign in this operation for a better result, and to remove any excessive pain that may arise from it.
I say therefore, that the ancients did not speak of circumcision in any of their books: because they did not make use of it in their own practices, and there is nothing except what we have learned through experience.
For indeed, I have learned from experience that a great part of the surgeons make use of circumcision, both with ligature and with cutting, by making an incision with a nail or with shears: and they bind with thread or string, and they cut with a nail.
I have also myself tried all these methods, and I have not found a better way of treatment than with the shears and the thread or string.
For in the treatment with the nail, much skin is driven out. For the prepuce has two coats of skin: thus perhaps the upper skin is rent, and threatens the lower coat: it is therefore necessary to make an incision to rent the other, and to prevent further pain And when the treatment is made with the fingers, as the doctors do, it is not secured by the incision at the end of the member: for perhaps it goes into the hole of it.
But in the treatment with the nail, perhaps the iron goes through, and ruins your work: and the skin of the child is short of nature, and many are born thus, which does not befit treatment: I have seen this happen to me
But the treatment with the shears and the thread or string has proved a good experiment to me: for the shears are proportional to the incision: thus the greater the height, the greater the depth. When you therefore take hold of your hand, the two acuities are proportional, and they are made in one operation at the same time: and there is a similar compression of the figure, containing the skin of the member from all sides, so that no mistake is made at all.
The method of the present operation is as follows: make the incision, particularly with respect to the child, only if there is an understanding of the matter from those who are competent; otherwise, do not perform the operation except to ligate the thread in its place. Release the patient until another day.
Release the patient immediately and make him rejoice in every way possible, so far as his understanding allows Let him stand between your hands prepared for the operation, and do not sit: hide the instruments in your sleeve or under your foot, so that the child sees nothing of them, neither anything of the instruments
Then insert your hand into the wound and blow on the skin, and draw it up, until the head of the wound comes out. Then remove what has gathered in that cavity
Then ligate the marked place with a double thread. Then ligate beneath with the remainder of the thread. Then hold with your index finger and thumb the place of the lower ligation, and cut between the two ligatures. Then lift the skin up quickly and remove the head of the wound. Then let the blood flow slowly (for it is better thus) and put powder on it: and put a bandage over the powder in which the swelling has subsided, beaten up with recent good oil: and release him until the next day: and care for him until he is healed.
The form of the forceps for this operation is as follows
Two handles are required, and two blades: do not let the handle go into the wound: and let the length of the two blades be equal to the length of two thumbs together
The error often occurs in the process of dressing: because perhaps the intrinsic skin has escaped entirely, or a part of it at the incision.
Therefore it is necessary to expand the bandage an hour before the closing of the wound: and make an incision according to the equality of the parts.
If you are unable to hold the bandage firmly with your thumb, then remove the bandage with a finger and make an incision
If, however, three days have passed and that which is under the swelling has remained inflated, remove the dressing: then let the swelling subside of its own accord, and gently remove the pus with the finger, and make an incision as before: and take heed from the head of the wound It will not do any harm to it.
Care for it as we have said in the treatise on powders: and if it occurs on the skin above the measure, and it extends upwards, it does not harm it even so
Care for it as we have said until it is healed
Chapter LVIII.</start_of_turn>
(Translation of the subsequent section is omitted due to its brevity.)
The retention of urine in the bladder is caused by the formation of a stone, or by frozen blood, or pus, or flesh, or similar substances which we have mentioned in the methods of treatment of dysuria.
If the urine is not cured, and the retention is caused by a stone which is in the neck of the bladder: then it is necessary to make the patient sit with his knees bent over his thighs Then they must place their feet on the back of their thighs and stretch out their belly from the upper part of their back, and grasp the painful area with their fingers as much as possible He considers therefore that when the heel of the bladder approaches the stone in the back: the bladder becomes absolutely empty.
If this does not succeed, and the case is severe: it is necessary to perform the extraction with an instrument called a siringa. This instrument is made of silver, is slight, flexible, and has a shape like a goose feather quill in the thickness of a palm of the hand, with a fine needle at its tip.
The evacuation of the bladder through the instrument itself is as follows: grasp a doubled thread and bind its extremities with wool or cotton, a good ligation. Insert the extremity of the thread into the lower part of the siringa. Then, with scissors, if anything remains of the wool, pierce through it, truly insert the needle into the bladder through the wound.
Then apply the siringa with oil or butter and alum. Place the patient sitting over a seat. Palpate the heel of the bladder and grasp the bladder neck. Incise the stone with oil and water.
Insert the needle into the bladder gradually, until it reaches the root of the bladder neck.
Then grasp the upper part from the navel.
Pull the siringa into the bladder until the patient feels the stone pass: do not do this in any other way, except when the tract in which the stone is passing is tortuous
Then gradually withdraw the thread with the wool The bladder follows the wool.
Then withdraw the needle and allow the bladder to drain through the urine stream. Repeat the process of inserting and removing the siringa until the bladder is empty and the patient experiences relief.
On the quality of cistilization of the bladder with Clepshydra.
On the quality of cistilization of the bladder with Clepshydra.
When a wound happens in the bladder, or blood is frozen in it, or is congealed in pus, and the urine is distilled into water and medicines: then is the instrument called Clepshydra to be used, and this is its form.
It is blunt, that is, closed And there are three holes in it, two from one side, and one from the other side, like urine
And the bulging part, where that which drives it is situated, should be in proportion to the quantity which is to be driven without addition, until when it is drawn with it something is attracted from the humilities: and when it is driven, when it is expelled at length: according as that which makes Clepshydra, which throws naphtha, that is, Greek fire in the battles of Mars.
When therefore urine is to be thrown out from the bladder, introduce the extremity of Clepshydra into the urine, and draw with it that which drives towards the higher parts, for the humidity is drawn into the concavity of Clepshydra
Then introduce its extremity into the urine, according as we said in the syringe Then drive out the humidity with that which drives, and indeed the humidity immediately returns to the bladder, as the sick man feels
The gentle form of cistelization of the bladder
It is made of silver, or gold: whose head is higher like a small bowl, and under it there is a sinus between which the ligament falls.
Then take a sponge of goat hair, and put in it moisture, wherewithto moisten the vessel. Then bind the two sinuses together with strong ligature like a doubled thread: and heat it with slight moisture above the fire.
Then insert the extremity of the catheter into the bladder, afterwards draw your hand over the vessel with slight tension of the moisture, until the patient feels that the moisture has gone into the vessel.
If however the vessel is not present, then take a piece of sponge of papyrus, and make of it a circle, and pierce it through from every circumference Then insert a strong thread into these holes like a ring Then gather the circle like a ball of wool: when you have placed in it what you will from moisture, and oil, and water.
Then bind it in an instrument: and make like this with the vessel as with the expressing of the hand, until the moisture has gone into the vessel

Â¶ On the Extraction of the Stone.
We have spoken in the discourse about the species of the Stone, and its treatment with physicians: and we have spoken of the difference between the Stone which is generated in the bowels and the vessel, and its signs: and we have spoken of the Stone in which the operation is performed with the hand and incision: and that is the Stone which is generated in the bladder itself: and that which is formed in the urine: and I am speaking of this with a clear explanation and abbreviation
I say therefore, that the Stone which is generated in the bladder, most frequently happens to children
And from its signs it is known that the urine goes out of the bladder like water in its substance: and there appears in it white sand, and it grinds the patient's bowels, and works with it, and hangs about with it often. Then it arises, and goes out with it the anus in many ways
And it is easy to heal the children from this, until fourteen years have passed And it is difficult in old age In youth, however, it is middle-aged, in which there is between these two things: and the greater the Lapis, the easier the cure: and if slight, the care is more economical
When we come to the treatment, it is necessary at first to administer the purgative clister, which draws out all the stool from the intestines: for this often hinders the discovery of the stone during the investigation
Then the patient is taken with his feet, and is beaten, and moved downwards: so that the stone may descend to the depth of the bladder, or is thrown from its high place somewhat.
Then make him sit between your hands prepared, and your hands are under his buttocks, so that the bladder may be all downhill to the bottom
Then inquire of him, and touch him externally
If you feel the stone in the space, then act immediately with incision above it
If it does not fall under your touch at all, then you must remove the index finger with the left hand if the patient is a child: or the middle finger if he is fully grown: and introduce it into his anus, and inquire about the stone, until it is under your finger: and gradually bring it to the neck of the bladder.
Then first above the aforesaid with your finger, and push it outwards against the place where the incision is to be made: and command the minister on your right hand to ligate the vessel above, and command another minister on your left hand to expand the testicles on your right hand upwards: and another of your men to move the skin which is under the testicles in the part from the place where the incision is to be made.
Then introduce the sponge which is of this form. And find in it what is between the intestines and the testicles, and not in the middle, to the side of the left hip: and let the incision be above the great stone, and your finger be in the anus: and make a transverse incision, so that the external incision be wide and the internal one be narrow, according to the quantity which is possible for the stone to come out of it without causing greater damage
Perhaps your finger which is in the anus will be compressed by the stone at the incision, and will come out without difficulty.
And you know that there is a stone from which there are angles and margins, because of which its exit is difficult because of that
And from this one is soft, like a gland, and round: and it makes its exit easy
Therefore to him who has angles and margins, add in the wound.
If it does not come out thus, then you must know how to manage above it: or tie over it with a grasp which is like the moon, which will bind over the stone, and will not slip from it: or that you put into it an instrument which is fine, which will curve at its end
Or if you are unable above all, then widen the opening a little more. If anything bloodstained comes to your attention, cut it off with a saw
If there is more than one stone, then drive in the first one to the os vesiculae. Then drive in the rest of them.</start_of_turn> Then drive in the small ones afterwards: and do the same if there are more than two.</start_of_turn>
And if the large one is hard, then ignorance is equal to cutting through it with a large section.</start_of_turn For indeed it happens to a sick person that either one of two things: either he will die, or his urine will be excessively concentrated: because the place is not consolidated at all.</start_of_turn
Truly manage the expulsion of it until it goes out: or cause a fracture of it with forceps until you have extracted it frustrated.</start_of_turn
When you have finished your operation, then apply a sponge of wool, aloe and dragon's blood: and bind it up, and put upon it a soaked pad of oil and wine, or oil of roses and cold water: so that the swelling will subside.</start_of_turn
Then rest the patient on his chest and do not move the ligaments until the third day.</start_of_turn When you have finished treating him, bathe the place with water and much oil.</start_of_turn
Then care for him with unguents of beeswax and balsam until he is healed.</start_of_turn
If, however, in the wound there is added a cold swelling and pus, and similar things: as if blood congeals in the bladder and is prohibited from coming out by urine: and this is known from the passage of blood with the urine.</start_of_turn Insert your finger into the wound and extract the clot of blood.</start_of_turn If it remains, it promotes corruption of the bladder, and its putrefaction.
Then from the bladder let you evacuate with vinegar, and water, and salt: and oppose every sort with whatever is suitable for the cure, until it be healed.
It is necessary in the course of the treatment of every case that you bind up two joints, and aggregate them, for the cause of the physicians who place above in position
If the stone is small, and is in the body of the bladder, and is fixed in it, and hinders the flow of urine: then treat it with that which I have mentioned before you reach the section Many are excused from the section for this treatment, for I have proved that it is useful
And it is, that you take a perforator of iron, which has this form, triangular extremities, acute, fixed in wood
Then take a thread, and bind with it the bladder under the stone so that it does not return to the bladder.
Then insert the perforating iron into the bladder with ease, until the perforator reaches the stone: and withdraw the perforator from the stone gradually: and make a perforation in it, until you cause it to penetrate from the other side
The urine indeed departs immediately.
Then press your hand over that which remains of the stone from the outside of the bladder. It will break itself, and go out with the urine, and the patient will be healed
But if this treatment is not prepared for him, because of something which hinders it: then bind a thread under the stone, and a thread above the stone Then dry above the stone on the very edge between two ligatures. Then draw it out. Then suture the ligament and bind the frozen blood which is in the wound
And it is not necessary to pass the ligament under the stone, except that it does not return to the orifice: and another ligament must be passed above, except when the thread is withdrawn after the passage of the stone, the skin returns to its place, and coapates the wound: and for this reason it is necessary for you to pass the thread above the upper ligament, so that you lift the skin to the higher parts, so that it returns at the completion of your work, and coapates the wound, as we have said
Chapter 61
On the extraction of a stone from women
Stones are rarely formed in women
If, however, it should happen to one of them that a stone occurs, then the treatment is difficult, and is prohibited because of the many methods.
One of them is: perhaps the woman is a virgin
And the second is, because you will not find a woman who will confess to the physician that she has a stone, when she is a virgin, or is married
The third is, because you will not find a woman who is well learned in this art, especially the operation with the hand
And the fourth is the distance of the stone from the place: because it requires a deep section, and there is fear of it
If necessity compels you to do this, then you must take a female physician who is well learned: and it is rarely found
If however you first observe it [the stone], then seek a skilled doctor, subtle, and present a woman obstetrician who is well learned in women's matters, or a woman who has been initiated into this art and has a part of the art: make her present and especially tell her to do everything that is prescribed to her from the inquiry about the stone.
Firstly, if she is a maid, let her insert her finger into her belly and feel for the stone.</start_of_turn>
If she finds it, she should grasp it under her finger and then command the obstetrician to insert her finger into the lower belly of the woman, and inquire about the stone after she has placed her left hand over the vulva and compressed it firmly.</start_of_turn>
If she finds the stone, she should gradually move it from the opening of the vulva downwards with all her skill, until she brings it down to the root of the coccyx.</start_of_turn
Then she should cut across it at the middle of the vulva at the root of the coccyx, from whichever side she wishes, and she will feel the stone in that part: and do not move your finger from the stone, holding it under it: and make the incision small at first.</start_of_turn> And then insert radium over that incision.</start_of_turn
And then insert radium over that incision.</start_of_turn If she feels the stone, then add to the incision a second time as much as the stone has come out of it.</start_of_turn
And you know that there are many kinds of stones.</start_of_turn> Among them are small and large, soft and rough, long and round having a branch.</start_of_turn
You know well the sort of thing it is, as it is signified by this above concerning that which you desire.
If it is blood that stirs you, then add in the armpit some absorbent material, and keep it for an hour, until the blood is drained away
Then return to your work, until the stone comes out: and make ready with the instruments which I mentioned in the extraction of the stone from the bladder, to aid you in that work.
If blood flows from the incision and you know that the cause is a broken artery: then put powder on the place and bind it securely with ligatures: do not delay: let the stone go and do not extract it. Perhaps a woman in childbirth will die. Then take care of the wound
When the pain of blood has subsided after a few days and the place is putrefying, then return to your work until the stone comes out
Chapter 12
About the section of the super-Herniam aquosam.
A swelling is not caused by water, except for the gathering of moisture in white pus, which is under the testicles containing eggs: and it is called a scrofula.
And when it is in the testicles themselves which nature has prepared for it in part of the egg, until it is burst: which is another egg, and the white of the testicles between the white pus, which we mentioned: it does not happen except rarely
The formation of this swelling is from the weakness which occurs in the testicles: and it flows out to this matter. And when it happens from a blow upon the testicles.
And this moisture has many colors. Or it is yellow-orange in color, or it is reddish-brown blood, or greenish-brown like feces, black, or white watery, and this is more
And the signs by which it is known where the gathering of water is, are these. For if it is in the white of the testicle which we mentioned, then the swelling is round to the length like the figure of a yes: and the testicle does not appear, because the moisture contains it from all sides
And if the moisture is in the proper sac of the testicle, then the swelling is round with a part like a yes, and because of this the man knows that there is another one
And if the moisture is between the skin of the testicles and the white of the eye, then it falls under the sense.
When therefore one knows the color of the moisture, then to experience the color of the moisture in the swelling with an introduced square, whose form precedes According to that therefore which proceeds from the sign of the introduced square, judge about that which is between them
When therefore we come to the treatment with iron, then it is necessary to expel the patient, to perform a phlebotomy if it is possible, and to fill the body with liquid
Then it is rested upon his back over a high low thing, and put under it many cushions
Then sit you on his left side, and order the minister, to sit on his right side, who extends his arm to one of the two sides of the skin of the testicles, and to the part near the navel
Then take hold of the wide sponge, and dry the skin of the testicles from the middle to the navel: and make a cut according to the direction of an equidistant line which divides the skin of the testicles, until it reaches the white fat which surrounds them: and scrape it away and observe, or remove it by cutting in this way: and let your scraping be such as that which you would use if you were scraping the other side which hangs with more than one testicle. And scrape cautiously with the scraping as much as you are able.
Then pierce the full bladder with a wide hole, and drain out all the water.
Then separate the two lips of the incision with hooks, and extend the bladder upwards, and do not touch the testicle skin which is included: and cut the bladder as you see fit, either completely or in pieces, especially its wide underbelly which is subtle For if you do not take great care, in its incision there will be no security, for the water will return.
If however anything external to the skin escapes from you during your operation: then when you have completed the incision of the bladder, reduce it Then join together the two lips of the skin of the testicles with a suture.
Then care for it like the rest of the wounds, until it is healed
And if you find anything corrupt from black bile, then it is necessary to ligate the veins, which are the suspenders, fearing the flow of blood.
Then remove the testicle with its suspender, and extract the urine: afterwards care for it as we have said
If indeed water is gathered in two parts, then you know that there are two branches: dry therefore the other part equally as you did the other
If the bleeding is equal, make the operation at once. Then withdraw the blood. If the bleeding is equal, make the operation at once. Then withdraw the blood.
Then draw out two cloths, and press, and apply a soaked cloth, according to this likeness: and let the extremities which are sent from the flank, or wet wool: and gather with a stricture in the lumbar region of the arms: and one extremity shall take over a knee until the loin, and the second shall take over to the part of the belly: and the two extremities above two lower thighs, and the two extremities above two inguinal regions, and gather the entire stricture in the lumbar region of the arms.
And when it is necessary, these haemorrhoids are treated artificially with a cautery in the place of the section with a knife: and it is that you take a fine cautery needle and cut with it the skin of the testicles: and it is ignited, as we have said: until it is detected that there is a white clot containing water: then take the cautery again, according to this likeness.
The Greek letters are assimilated.
Then pierce with it that clot, and it is ignited, until all the moisture has gone out
Then stretch out the clot with hooks, and scrape with a fine ignited cautery, and cut itself according to what is possible to you, until you have excised it all
And burn from outside, so that it does not touch the fire.
And you know that this operation is safer and longer lasting than the one with a section
If, however, an opposite action occurs in the hour of incision, or in the hour of cauterization after the apposition of the calidum, or a flow of blood, or something else: then it is necessary that the treatment which counteracts the action which has occurred be applied along with the treatment which is appropriate for the case.
If, however, the patient is timid and does not expect to undergo this operation because of his horror: then I administer perforation according to what I have mentioned above: and thus.
When it has been ascertained by you that the patient is aware of what we have mentioned regarding the significance, which is that it is an aquose edema: then you must cause the patient to sit on a raised seat
Then perforate the apposition in the lower part of the limb with a wide spatula: and place the perforation according to the length of the body, and leave the opening wide open until all the fluid has drained out
Then place over the place the limb, and bind it, and let it drain out the remaining fluid: then care for the limb until it is healed
If, however, there is an impediment to the egress of the fluid in the hour when you perforate: and this is not except for the fact that a white clot opposes the egress of the fluid from the wound, and hinders the exit of the fluid: then it is necessary that you introduce a needle into the wound, or an instrument with which the fluid is extracted, whose form has preceded: or add in the operation of the wound a little of the fluid.
And you know that the fluid returns and accumulates again after six months, or thereabouts. When it has accumulated again, then it must be drained in the same way, and the patient will pass his days in peace.

(The text following this section is not included in the request and has been omitted.)
Know that in the section above this Ramus, fear is driving towards madness in many arrangements. Therefore its dismissal from this is seen
And I remember the operation in this, and the kind of after-effect.
I say therefore, that many after-effects happen in the body, from which testicles are composed: and this is from excessive moisture.
Or from an acute or acrid moisture which flows down to the testicles. Or from a blow
And the color of the after-effect is according to the color of the body, and it is not found to be painful: and it is a serious after-effect.
And perhaps it is a stony after-effect, whose color is dark, and there is no sensation in it
And sometimes it is from the tying of arteries, and the swelling of them: as I have already mentioned concerning this: or from the swelling of veins
Therefore it is known from the arrangement of the after-effect when you touch it with your fingers And it is not proper to touch it immediately.
This however, which comes from the swelling of veins, is not dispersed by anything from the compression with your fingers
And it is possible that above this kind of after-effect there will be a section, and above the rest of the flesh: and that is to cut the skin of the testicles Then stretch out the palm of your hand upwards, and extract it with white silk: and remove the clot from the belly, and bind the belly: and cut off the clot when you have freed it from all parts of the body.
If any solid object is consolidated with these meats, then it is necessary to draw out the object and cut it.
If adhesion exists between something from a vein, or in that which is between the bowels: then it is necessary to free the whole adhesion and cut it with a round incision.
But if there is a native growth of meat in the place of adhesion which is behind: then it is necessary to cut through all of it, and draw out the object, as we have said.
When your work is finished, then put a sponge dipped in fat into the wound in rose-oil and wine: then care for it with the rest of the treatment, until it is healed.
Chapter 122.
Regarding the care of branches, which are with veins.
Uitis is a swelling which is surrounded by four folds like a bag, similar to a bladder, with softening of the testicles: and it makes difficult the walking of the infirm and their exercise, and their gait.
And in the treatment of this ailment is fear, because of that which precedes it reminds.
It is true that we must say that the operation for this must be performed as the first ones did it.
I say therefore, that it is necessary to make the infirm sit on a raised seat Then drive the suspension of the testicles downwards. Then hold the skin of the testicles with your fingers, with the nails towards the veins: and hold it by another person, and extend it with stretching.
Then cut with a sharp knife with a transverse section through the middle of the veins, until the veins are exposed
Then from all sides remove the skin, as we said to you concerning the extraction of the arteries which are in their season.
Then fix in place an awl in the place where the doubled thread lies, and bind it at the first place where the nerves meet: and bind it again at the last of these places. Then dry these things in the middle section straight according to the length of the body, and extract what accumulates from the corruption of the humors of the bowels
Then take care of the wound with the care of the other wounds, in which oil is generated to cause the discharge of the things which nourish one testicle There is no evil in this thing.
If, however, a vein should happen to be opened by all these things, then it is necessary to extract the testicles along with the veins: so that no nourishment may be wanting for them on account of the incision, and that they may not become rotten or dry, and not be useful for anything.
Chapter 65.
On the care of the intestines.
The event of this branch is from the section which happens in the large intestine above the belly in the groin part from the belly.
Because the intestines descend from that rupture to one testicle. And this rupture is either from the siph or from the extension of it
And these two kinds of accidents happen from many causes: either from a blow, or a jump, or a shout, or the elevation of a heavy thing, and things like these
And the sign is when it is from the extension of the siph It happens slowly in a long time, and does not happen immediately: and is equal to the after-effect of a wound: because the siph compresses the intestine
And its sign when it is from the excision of the spleen, is that it makes the pain suddenly arise from its origin: and it is a diverse aftereffect, appearing under the skin nearby: and that is because of the exit of the intestine, and the course of its evacuation to the outside of the spleen.
And when it comes out with the intestines, it is called a gut-rake, and a swelling: and sometimes with swelling
And when it runs into the intestines, it brings out stool, and remains there: and that is with it that the sickness is dangerous: because it makes the pain arise in the loin, and especially when it is expelled
And in the treatment of this disease with iron, there is fear: because of that it must be feared that the case will be increased in it.
And the method of treatment is, that we must expel the solid matter from the patient, so that the intestine may return to its natural cavity, if it obeys the return And then it rests upon its collar between your hands: and lift its edges.
And then spread the skin which follows the skin upwards, and dry the whole of the testicles' skin along their length And then fix in two hooks two nails of section, according as it is necessary to open the section with them: and the section should be made according to the amount, as much as is possible, so that it may be evacuated from it quickly.
And then scrape the spleen, and what is under the skin of the testicles, until when the white spleen is detected, hard throughout: then introduce your finger of indication into that which follows the testicle, in that which is between the white spleen and the spleen itself, and between the spleen and the posterior part of the testicle.
Then move the thumb of the right hand inwards to the inside of the testicles. And with this extend the white patch upwards with the left hand. And elevate the testicles with the white patch to the part of the incision. And command the minister to extend the testicles upwards. And you shall solve the adherence, which is the complete reverse solution.
Inquire your fingers, that nothing be lodged in the white patch or the hard gut But if you find anything in it: then drive it downwards to the lower belly
Then grasp the needle, which has a thick thread, made of ten threads: and introduce it through the back of the white patch, that is, the tunica which follows the incision: then cut off the extremities which protrude from the thread until four threads remain. Then make a loop with some of them above some with the shape of a cross: and bind with two threads, of which we have spoken, because it is the ligament under the testicles which connects them, until it cannot cause any of the things which nourish them to send anything to them: that it does not happen that the scrotum becomes hot And make the ligament again outside the first ligament, long enough from it by less than two fingers. And after these two ligaments draw out from the white patch, which is under the testicles, the quantity of the measure of a finger: and cut off the rest entirely according to the roundness, and take out from it the testicles.
Then dry the lower part of the skin of the testicles of the incision from which blood runs, and heal: as we have said before
Then apply wet wool under oil, and put on a bandage: and administer the ligament which we have mentioned. And when the white fat is cauterized, after its incision, fear the flow of blood. Much blood will therefore occur from it. And let go of the ligament, until it drops by itself
If, however, its case is delayed, it will be bound up with warm water: and place upon that which we have mentioned above, until it drops down.
Then care for the wound with the rest of the treatment of wounds, until it is healed.

Of a wound with an entrapped bone fragment.
In such a wound no one should dare to place anything above its treatment with fire.
And first of all they say, that it is like that which we narrate in the wound which is with the Bone of the Shoulder That is, as we stretch the skin after its section above that with ease: then dry in the middle, and care afterwards with that which opens it up, until the bones drop down: and care for the wound, as we have mentioned above, until it is healed

Of the disruption which happens in the groin
When a rupture happens in the groin, as we have mentioned, and the place eminates, and nothing descends from the intestines to the testicles: and if it descends, it is little and returns in all hours: but if it prolongates with that time, an opening is added in the fat, until the intestines descend into the fat
And this happens from the extension of the fat, which is in the groin, as we have mentioned When the swelling has been extended, it is softened, and the place relaxes, and it swells up again.
Its treatment is like that of a burn, as has been mentioned previously.
When it is treated with a burn, in this way: the patient lies on his back between your hands. Then dry the site of the rupture, which has swollen up, by cutting across its width, according to the quantity of three fingers wide
Then bind up the swelling and what is under the skin until the white swelling, which is under the skin following the swelling, is detected.
Then take an egg-shaped piece and put it over the swelling that is protruding from the swelling, and press it into the depth of the wound.
Then take two points of prominence on the edge of the swelling from the swelling, and stitch them together with one suture: then pull out the edge of the swelling.
Do not at all cut through the swelling, nor stretch anything, nor anything else, as I have told you in the treatment of intestinal branches.
Then care for that wound. When you have finished cutting the suture, soften that area, and restore the wound until it has healed
The swelling will not return, and no further swelling will occur of the rupture
The burn is better in this place: because it is closer to the flesh.
Chapter LXVIII.</start_of_turn>
About the softening of the skin of testicles.
The skin of the testicles is softened in many people, because the meat which is between them is softened, and the appearance of the scrotum is improved.
Therefore it is necessary for him who is asking for care of himself, that he make the sick man lie upon his back, and cut through all the skin which has been softened above the natural skin.
And then two lips are to be gathered with sutures: and if desired, sweat in the first place the superfluous skin which has been softened by three or four sutures, and confirm the sutures.</start_of_turn>
And then cut through between the sutures.</start_of_turn>
And then care for the rest of the wounds, until they are healed, and the thread is cast off.</start_of_turn>

(The provided text does not include any information regarding castration, so I am unable to translate that portion.)</start_of_turn>
You know that castration is excluded from our law: and for that reason I am forbidden to remind you of it in this book: and it is not necessary to remind you of it, except for two cases.</start_of_turn
Of which one is that it should be in the science of medicine when it is inquired about: and that he should know the care of it which happened.</start_of_turn
And the other case is that we must often abstain from castration for some animals, because of our laws concerning them, such as oxen, horses, and cats, and similar animals.</start_of_turn
I say therefore, that castration is done in two ways.</start_of_turn Or by cutting off.</start_of_turn Or by incision, and section.</start_of_turn
In the former case, however, the operation is painful: for we make the animal sit in warm water, until the testicles soften and relax, and hang down: and then cut off the testicles with your hand, until they are dissolved and do not appear to the touch.</start_of_turn
In castratione autem per fissuram et sectionem, oportet ut teneas animal, et premas cutem testiculorum eius cum manu sinistra.
During castration by incision and section, it is necessary to ligate the animal, and premate the skin of the testicles with the left hand.
And thus is the better method of castration by attrition: for in attrition there is a risk that something may be left behind from the testicles, which the animal may desire to mate.
And then care for the wound, until it is healed.

There are two methods for caring for hermaphrodites
A hermaphrodite is of two kinds according to two methods. One of them is that which appears in the loin, or in the skin of the testicles, in which there is a figure like that of a female dog, which has hair: and sometimes urine escapes from that which is in the skin of the testicles
And in women there is one kind, which is the female dog above the navel like a small male testicle, which extends outwards: one of them is like the penis of a man, and two like two testicles.
And the care for these three kinds, of both the male and female kinds, and of the one kind of woman, is that you must cut away the added flesh until the impression of them has fled. And then care for the rest of the wounds
As for the second kind of man from whom urine comes, which is in the skin of the testicles, there is no operation, nor any care for it whatsoever
On the incision of the Tentiginis, and the protruding flesh in the vulvas of women.
On the incision of the Tentiginis, and the protruding flesh in the vulvas of women.
The Tentiginis sometimes adds itself above the natural position, until it becomes swollen and ugly in appearance: and sometimes it swells in certain women to such an extent that it expands as far as the groin, and persists until the coitus.
It is necessary therefore to ligate the supernumerary flesh of the Tentiginis, either with a single ligature or with two: and you should not delay in the incision, especially not at the depth of the root: in order that there should not be an outflow of blood
Then take care of the healing of the wound, until it is healed.
But the flesh which is born in the mouth of the uterus, until it is implanted: and sometimes it is extruded outwards according to the shape of the tail: and because of this some call it caudal fistula It is necessary therefore to make an incision as we did with the Tentiginis, and to care for it, until it is healed
Of the care of the Alratica, which is the vulva of a woman which is not pierced.
Of the care of the Alratica, which is the vulva of a woman which is not pierced
The Alratica is, as it is the vulva of a woman which is not pierced, or as a small hole. It is either natural or accidental
It is accidental from an injury which preceded it: and it is made either from the natural flesh added, or from the soft pus, or from the spiss; and it may be either in the depth of the uterus, or in the flanks, or in the upper part of it, or in the lower part: and it hinders coitus and pregnancy, and childbirth, and perhaps it hinders the menstruation
Knowledge of that is made by the aspect of the obstetrician, if the apparent opilation is close at hand.
If it is not apparent, then seek with your fingers or with an instrument.
If the opilation is from a slight fissure and is close to the two lips: then grasp it firmly and break it off.</start_of_turn>
And it is like placing two little pins over the two lips.</start_of_turn>
Then place your two indices of both hands together, and the woman should sit with her back against her thighs spread out.</start_of_turn Then stretch out the two lips with force, until the slight fissure is broken and the opilation is opened.</start_of_turn
Then grasp the wool, and soak it in oil, and place it in its place: and the woman should keep it together every day, so that it does not adhere to any other place.</start_of_turn>
If the fissure is large and thick: then it is necessary to cut it out with a knife like the handle of a myrtle leaf.</start_of_turn
If the opilation is from natural flesh: then suspend it with hooks and cut it out: and be with physicians who can stop the bleeding without causing damage, such as acacia, and dragon's blood, and thus gather it with alum or whatever else.</start_of_turn
Then give a broad lead from lead, so that the wound does not stick or close up too quickly, keep it for a few days: and give an ointment of dry lint, then care for the rest of the treatment until healed.</start_of_turn
And whenever there is birth in the matrix of other flesh: it is necessary to cut according to this method: because if there is no cancerous tumour of the matrix, there is no contradiction with the use of iron in any way.</start_of_turn
On the care of hemorrhoids, Athehelil, and Bothor of the red kind in the veins of women.
On the care of hemorrhoids, Athehelil, and Bothor of the red kind in the veins of women.
Hemorrhoids are indeed an opening of the veins of the rectum, from which there flows out a great amount of blood tinged with blood clots.
When hemorrhoids exist, they become acute: and I have already mentioned in the enumeration of their species and their signs: and I will now tell what comes from their veins in regard to treatment and what does not
I say, therefore, that hemorrhoids which are in the belly and not apparent to the eye: for them there is no treatment with iron
Those which however are in the belly above those which are apparent to the eye, are those which are cured
It is necessary therefore to put the woman in a cold house Then stretch out Athehelil with forceps, or with rough cloth, and cut away the roots from them
Then powder over the wounds with some of the powders from the incisions without causing harm: such as acacia, and dragon's blood, and thus, and the like of these things
Then put her feet to the wall for an hour. Then put her down in cold water
If the flow of blood persists: then make her sit in a decoction of rue, and nutmeg, and barley, and the like of these things.
Then take barley flour and mix it with honey and vinegar, and make a plaster with it on her back
If blood is severed with this, it is good: and if not, make the edges adhere to each other, and the veins and arteries, without incisions.
Then take wool, and soak it in pitch, or in vinegar, or in the fat of almonds, that is, beeswax, wine, and make it adhere to the wound
When the swelling has subsided, then care for the place with unguents, until it is healed.
Though it is red like a head of garlic, and has a rough appearance
It is necessary therefore that you cut away what appears from it, as I have said previously: and care for it, until it is healed.
Chapter 74.
Concerning the perforation which occurs in the matrix.
There are many kinds of swelling which occur in the matrix, such as cancer, and stone-abscess, and ulcer, and foreign bodies, and swellings caused by herpes, aestiomemus, and fistula, and hemorrhoids, and piles, and swelling of the head, and cold swelling.
And I will say further concerning the cold swelling which occurs in the matrix, when it is caused by other swellings which join in healing, and how it is opened with iron
It is necessary to consider these things carefully When the pain of the swelling is acute from its beginning, with percussion, flame, and fever: and you see it reddening: if it falls beyond your senses, do not attempt to pierce it: care for it until the acute pain of the accident has subsided
Then it is fitting that you do thus: make her sit upon the seat which beats two seats, and recline, or lean against her back, and bring her feet to the lower part of her belly: and let her knees be spread wide, and put her arms under her knees, and bind both her ligaments together.
Then let the midwife sit on the right side, and handle the instrument with which the opening of the womb is made.
And it is fitting when you are about to handle this instrument, that you keep the liver with the rib of the deep matrix of the woman: so that there should not be more of it than that which enters from the instrument than the depth of the womb, and that it does not grieve the lower part.
But if the instrument be greater than the depth of the womb, then it is fitting that you put sponges upon the covering of the depth of the womb: that the entrance of the instrument to the depth of the womb be obstructed: and that you place a sponge, which runs in the instrument, from the upper side: and that you hold the instrument, and that you turn the minister of the sponge until the depth of the womb is opened
When it appears, and the hand reaches it, and it is soft and gentle: then it is fitting that you cut it off at the head with a broad spatula.
When it is evacuated clean, then it is fitting that you put into the wound a sponge soaked in saffron or in green oil, in which there is some astringency: and put on the sponge, and draw out the section from the womb
And put outside upon the matrix, and upon the flank a wool bandage soaked in water in which there are bad bubbles.
Then he will care for it for two days with the unguent which agrees with it, until it is healed.
When the matrix and the vulnus have been bathed, then let it be plastered with water and honey: then with water in which the radix lilii, or long aristolochia, has been boiled: then return to the unguent.
If the vulnus has been hidden inside the matrix, then it is necessary to hold off its treatment with iron, and indeed to treat it with that which we mentioned in the treatise
Chapter Lxx.</start_of_turn>
How the doctor should treat the embryos of a woman, according to an unnatural figure of emergence.
It is necessary for the Obstetrician to first recognize the natural figure of birth.
From the signs therefore, it is known that when a woman is pressed downwards by the waters and wishes to smell the air, and alleviates above what is above her from the birth, and hastens the issue of the embryo: then you know that this birth is according to the natural figure, and that its exit is above its head, and secundina with it: or suspended, or hanging from the navel
When therefore you see these signs, then it is necessary to compress her belly, so that the embryo comes down more quickly
For when it descends above its head, it descends secundina with it, and comes out with those superfluities which are useful for a good birth
Whoever is outside of this birth is unnatural and harmful.
For when the fetus comes out over its feet, and its body goes before its head, and its feet and hands together, or one foot: or it comes out with its head and hands: or its belly: and perhaps it turns over its neck, and similar things happen from harmful figures.
The Obstetrician must be cautious, prudent in all these matters, and beware of error and neglect: for I shall demonstrate every figure and its quality in this, and it is signified by that, and it stands above all else.
When the fetus emerges upon its head during natural expulsion, and the head of the fetus comes into contact with the woman, and the delivery becomes difficult, and the power of its virtue is impaired: then let the woman sit down, or let the women hold her up: and let steam rise from the vinegar of its urine with boiled barley and with oily substances.
Then the Obstetrician inserts his fingers into the vagina of the parumulus, and finds the second part, and sews it with his nail, until it is cured of the moisture: and he presses the belly of the woman until the fetus descends
If it does not descend, then it is necessary to administer an enema to the woman with barley mucilage, with the addition of sesame oil
Then command her to drink after the enema, so that she may contract: and let her strain with a groan, and hold her hands and nose for an hour. The fetus will immediately depart.
If two hands of the fetus emerge at once, it is necessary to reduce them gradually with ease If it does not obey in delivery, then let the woman sit down and raise her feet above: then strike the seat against the ground: and the woman must be held, lest she should fall from the concussion.
If, however, the hands do not depart and the fetus dies: then cut through the abdomen, and extract the remaining fetus: and bind up its hand with cloth, and extract it with equal force: for it will depart by itself
The embryo has emerged above its feet. When the fetus emerges above its feet, it must be stimulated upwards: then gradually constrain it: afterwards it will become even.
Then take one foot and extend it gradually.</start_of_turn>
When they emerge up to the hips, then command it to bend, so that it is compressed, and make it cry out with force: it will go out if God wills it.</start_of_turn>
And if it does not go out with this, then gradually reduce the fetus until you have set it according to its natural form.</start_of_turn> For it will go out of itself when its time comes.</start_of_turn>
If it is delayed with all this, then take from the high mucus, and saffron and gum tragacanth: pierce all through in the mortar with a good blow: then join it with the blood of the woman and the lower part of her belly.</start_of_turn Then make her sit in warm water, until the afterbirth comes out.</start_of_turn
When her lower parts are softened by the heat, then make her drink a sip of myrrh: and put her to sleep.</start_of_turn When an hour has passed since she drank the myrrh, then make her sit on a seat.</start_of_turn Then make her cry out: and bind her jaw and nose: and press the lower part of her belly with ease.</start_of_turn For the fetus will come out immediately.</start_of_turn
The fetus has emerged above the knees and hands.</start_of_turn> When it departs following this fashion, then it will enter inwards gradually introducing your hands. Then the woman rests on her heel, and her feet hang downwards: and she lies upon the bed, and she joins her hands together Then press above her belly gradually. Then draw out what is under her feet from the nails until it is prepared in the lower part If the fetus does not depart, then grasp her feet and move them quickly forward Then press what is above the navel gradually, until the fetus ascends to the upper parts Then introduce your hands inwards, and equalize the fetus gradually: and command the woman to compress, until the fetus departs
The fetus exits laterally hanging from the hands It enters into the reduction of her hand. If, however, it is not possible to reduce it, then raise the woman up and make her walk.
If she is still unable to walk, then make her lie upon the bed: and strike her thighs together forcefully
Then administer the ointment which you have prepared from the mucilage
If she grasps the parts, then make her sit upon the seat Then study in the reduction of the hand, and equalize the fetus according to the natural form: and command the woman to tighten, and tell her to compress herself, until it departs
The fetus exits upon her heel, with her hands expanded, and its face is towards the back of her mother The obstetrician must hold the hand of the fetus firmly, then gradually release it, and equalize it with ease.
When it is equal, then place above the vulva what we have mentioned from wax and mucus
Then command it to move gradually. When you have done this, then make it sit on its side, and command it to incline to the right side Then command it to contract: and make it breathe with effort.
The fetus is prepared for birth on the right side. When it descends to the opening of the uterus in this way with the second [finger], then split the second [finger] with your thumb until it is evacuated from the moisture.
If it is suspended on the face of the fetus, and its neck, then cut the cord from the navel: so that it is not retained and does not die.
Then urge the fetus inwards, until you place it according to what is necessary: and command the woman to press against it a little: for it will itself go out through the easy exit.
The birth of twins, or of many fetuses. You know that twins are often born together: and sometimes three, or even four are born at once. But this is extraordinary, and is rarely seen.
Five or more is a thing beyond nature, and does not often survive: and they continue to exist together, though multiplied, by one: and they are separated by the navel cord of each of them.
And sometimes they come out like a single fetus through the natural exit, easily: and they come out through the difficult exit, as we have mentioned.
If any of them prove difficult at the part, and arrive at that which we mentioned from unnatural figures, then care for them as we have narrated: and let there be a skilful midwife, and let her do what she does with ease and delay, and she shall succeed according to every figure as with that which is prepared for her from her knowledge to the health of the patient.
Remember that which is formed in the matrix from embryos, and is aborted.
When one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, or more are formed in the matrix: and I have seen that a woman has aborted seven, and another fifteen, all of them being formed.
That which is done by the measurement of the glorious wise man.
Therefore all this belongs to the science of Midwifery Perhaps therefore it will arrive at something similar to this: oppose it with that which is fitting for it
Chapter 76
Of the extraction of a dead fetus
When you care for a dead fetus with that which I have mentioned from the medication, and it does not go out, and you must perform an operation with the hand: then you must consider carefully
If a woman is healthy and virtuous, and is not with any of the accidents from which they are afraid to have a miscarriage: then it must be laid on the couch, on her back, and her head should be inclined downwards, and her legs should be elevated: and the midwife should hold the patient firm from two parts, or it is bound to the couch, so that the body is not pulled out during the extraction of the fetus
Then moisten the os matrice with oily slime with high mucilage, and barley flour, and poppy seeds.
Then let the Obstetrix take hold of his hand with these oils and mucilages: then he shall introduce it into the matrix with ease. Then he seeks where the nails of the fetus are situated, and the convenient place for it
Consider therefore then, if the fetus is ready to descend over its head: then fix the nails in its eyes, or in its throat, or in its mouth, or in its palate, or under its beard, or under its ribs, or in nearby places to the costae, and under the hypopondria
If however the descent is over its feet, then in the chest, and the middle ribs.
And it is necessary that he should hold the nail with the right hand: and put his thumb in that which is between the left thumb and index finger: and introduce it with the hand with ease, and fix the nail in one of those places which we mentioned, until it comes to the useful thing
Then fix the other nail, or the third, if necessary: so that there is an equal contraction, and it does not incline towards the side
Then extend with an equal extension, and it is not to be extended only in a straight line, but rather to move to all parts, so as to relieve its exit: thus as it is with a tooth when it is extracted
And it is necessary at that which is between these, so as to soften the extension. Which if it is retained from that part, then let the Obstetrix take hold of some fingers with oil, and introduce them from the side, so as to rotate with them what is retained
If therefore the part of the fetus comes out, then exchange the nails to another place which is higher: do this until the whole fetus comes out
If, therefore, a hand departs from its fellow and is unable to be restored by virtue of its retraction: then it is necessary that it be included above the palm. If then it has departed throughout, it must be excised either at the base of the joint or at the cubit: and in this case it is necessary that you make the other hand participate in the support of the palm and the two fingers.
If the fetus's head is large, or if it has suffered constriction on delivery, or if there is fluid in its head: then it is necessary that it introduce between the fingers the thorny spatula, and bind it with it, and extract the fluid: or that it break it with the instrument called Almisdac, which is shaped like the remainder of the instruments in the following chapter.
Proceed in the same way if the fetus has a large head; then it is necessary to dissect the membrane: or to extract it with a clamp, as we have said before. Then grasp the bones with forceps.
If the head departs and is caught at the furcula: then it is found until the moisture which is in the chest is discharged.
If, however, it does not become loose, neither does it yield to exit: then cut off the head as much as possible, as is possible for you to do.
If below the belly there is an abscess, or if there is fluid there: then it is necessary to perforate it, until the moisture escapes from it
If, on the other hand, the fetus is above its feet: then its traction is easy, and its direction towards the maternal os is smooth
If, however, it is constricted at the abdomen or the chest: then it is necessary to extract it with the cloth which you have placed over your hand: and bind the abdomen or chest until it is cured
If however the remaining limbs are removed, and the head returns: then the Obstetrix inserts his left hand. If the os of the matrix is opened, then he inserts his hand deeply into the matrix, and seeks with it the head, and draws it with the fingers until it reaches the os of the matrix: then he inserts into it one or two hooks, and draws it with them.</start_of_turn>
If however the os of the matrix is closed, because of a thick clot that has happened to it: then it is not necessary for him to labour over it, rather it is necessary for him to administer an effusion of humors, fat: and administer plasters: and sit in waters which soften and moisten.</start_of_turn>
If the fetus is over its limit: then it is possible to equalize: then it is administered as we said in the fetus itself.</start_of_turn>
If it is not possible to do this, then it is done with difficulty, and it is extracted.</start_of_turn
And it is necessary that you do not let anything remain inside entirely.</start_of_turn>
When you have completed your operation, then administer what we said in the postpartum care which happens in the matrix.</start_of_turn
If there happens to be a flow of blood, then descend into the waters of styptics, and administer the remaining treatment.</start_of_turn
And indeed I saw a woman in whose womb a fetus was dead: then it was impregnated over her with another, afterwards another fetus was also dead.</start_of_turn This happened to her after a long time there was a clot in her navel, and it became swollen, until it was opened: and it began to emit pus.</start_of_turn
I am summoned therefore for his cure, and I have treated him for a long time: and it is not consolidated [has healed].
I place above him some strong adhesive plasters: and it has come out from its place Then a few days passed by, and it came out again from another place. I am amazed at this, since there is no bone in the belly
I think therefore that there were dead bones of a fetus.
I inquired about the wound, and I extracted many bones, the woman being in better condition: and I have treated him thus for a long time, and it has healed from the place of a little pus
And I did not fix this foreign body here, except that there is science in it, and an assistant who administers an antidote with his hand in the treatment.
Chapter 77.
On the forms of the necessary instruments for the extraction of a fetus.
The shape of the Vertigines which opens the matrix
Here below is the form of the Strictor, with which books are equaled, to which are equal two rings at the ends of two sticks. Truly this Vertigo must be under the strictor: and that it be either of ebony or of polished wood
And the breadth of every stick is like two fingers: and the margin of each of them is like one finger, and the length of each of them is palm and a half: and in the middle of the two sticks are two additions of the same kind of wood, which are fixed in both, of whose length is half of the palm and a little less: and the breadth of each is like two fingers, or less
And thus two additional [instruments] are introduced into the matrix bone, so that it opens with the hand when two Vertigines are turned.
Another shape like that, but finer and lighter.
It is made from the wood of the os bone, or from horn, according to the likeness of pincers. Truly there are two additional things at its end, as above: and the length of each additional thing from the hand is like the palm of the hand: and the breadth of each is like two fingers.
When therefore you wish to open the matrix with this, then make the woman sit over the lectum, with her feet hanging down, and open that which is between her thighs Then introduce these two additional things together into the matrix: and you hold the lower extremity of the instrument between her thighs Then open your hand with the instrument, like you do with pincers, equally according to the quantity of opening desired from the mouth of the matrix, until the Obstetrix has done what he wishes
The other shape of the Vertigines is called the Shape of the Impeller which drives the fetus.
The shape of the Almsideh, which counteracts the large head: and it is similar to pincers, which have teeth at the end, like the above-mentioned things.</start_of_turn>
And when it is bent, like the pincers in this shape, like the above-mentioned things, which have teeth like serrations, with which it incides and counteracts.</start_of_turn>
The neighbour having a spine which is one.
The neighbour having a spine which are two
The shape of the spatula having two extremities to abscind the head
The shape of two spatulas also lateral
These instruments are all used, and the more various their kinds are and the more are prepared by the artificer, the more rapid is the operation and the greater is the profit for men, on account of their quantity
It is not proper to despise any of these instruments, since they are prepared for thee Neglectful is anyone who is in want of them
Head seventy-eight
About the extraction of the second
When the second is retained at the birth, then it is necessary to extract the lower lip, so that it may retain its breath. Then do thou make the opening with the forceps: and grasp the hand over his bone, and close his nostrils. If it comes out through this, it is well
If not: then grasp the head, and perforate at the navel: and put in it herbs that open the bone like calamine, rue, and rue anetum, chamomile, and hyssop, and cassiaLigneam, and centaury: grasp all these herbs, or some of them, and immerse them with water, and put them over fire.
Then put a bundle of reeds over the perforation of the navel of the jar, and the other extremity into the bone of the belly: and keep it firm until the steam has ascended to the cavity of the belly
Then make the incision as we have said. The incision shall be made easily as we have already said.
If, however, after this treatment the wound still persists and does not discharge: then command the Physician to immerse his hand in the fat of a chick or in high slime.</start_of_turn> Then introduce the instrument into the wound and seek with it the source of the discharge.</start_of_turn> When you have found the source of the discharge, grasp it and gradually extend it.</start_of_turn
If it be an appendix in the depth of the belly, then introduce the hand as we have said until you find the source of the discharge.  Then gradually draw out the appendix along with the surrounding tissue without damaging the matrix.  It is necessary, therefore, to alter the position of the appendix to the right and left sides: then add in the quantity of the discharge.</start_of_turn The wound itself will then obey, and will be cured, and will depart from its adhesion.</start_of_turn
As for the fractured matrix, as we have already said: treat the wound with packing and apply an ointment of oil with herbs.</start_of_turn
If it does not discharge as we have said, do not strain too much in the attempt to extract it.</start_of_turn
It is necessary that what discharges from the matrix to the surface of the belly should be bound to the woman's thigh.</start_of_turn Then keep the wound moist with a unguent composed of four drugs.</start_of_turn The wound itself will become putrid after a few days, and will dissolve and discharge.</start_of_turn
When it has become rotten, it emits a bad odor from the stomach and head, and it harms the bowels. It is therefore necessary to administer suitable fumigations for this.
Certain of the ancients are experts in fumigation with rue and powdered gypsum.
The way in which a woman is fumigated during the retention of the second and the periods.
Let there be a like amount of incense or aloes: and one should place the extremities widely over the flame: and let the fumigation be placed upon the berries: hold it there until the fumigation has been consumed: and do it again
Section 79.
Of the treatment of an unpierced wound.
Many boys suffer from boils, and their wounds are not pierced, which I have treated with subtle saffron ointment. It is necessary therefore that the obstetrician pierce it with his finger: and if not, pierce it with the sharp spatula: and let blood flow, so that it does not touch it
Then place upon it infused wool in wine and oil And care for it with unguents until it heals
If however it happens that it is pierced, then put in the wound a lead cannula for several days, and take it out when the boy wishes to remove it.
And it sometimes happens that a boil ruptures from the consolidation of the wound, or from a fistula. It is necessary therefore to dry up that consolidation, and then care for it as we have already said concerning the treatment and lead
On the treatment of fistulas that occur in the lower part.
On the treatment of fistulas that occur in the lower part.
Fistulas that occur in the lower part are of two kinds: nodulous and gross. They occur close to any bone of the limb: or in the space of one part: and are one fistula or more.
When the nodulus is thus removed, it is opened and a white watery moisture or subtle pus runs out of it
And sometimes these fistulas are penetrating They are recognized as penetrating because they are accompanied by discharge, swelling, and possibly worms when the patient passes feces.
The fistulas are of the latter kind when they extend from the penetrating part to the bone of the limb and to the meat of the limb itself And from the penetrating part to the hip joint and to the tailbone
From this, however, it is recognized that a penetrating fistula is not always so, for example when a finger or a piece of wire is introduced into the fistula from the air or from the iron: when there is no swelling
When there is swelling, then introduce into the wound a piece of lead or a hair from a horse's tail until you feel the tension or a hair in your finger
If neither of these is present, nor any discharge, swelling or worms, as I have said, then you know that it is not a penetrating fistula: suffice therefore for treatment
When the fistula is penetrating as far as the bone or the urinary bladder, its meaning is the discharge of urine from it, and the prohibition of this until the place is consolidated with the physician
If the wound extends up to the hip joint or the hip bone: then its sign is that the limb will hang down, unless there is a twist of the limb up to the bone: and there is pain around the part, and discharge of pus from it always occurs: and it does not respond to treatment, neither is it solidified with ointment.
In all these penetrating wounds there is no complete cure: the cure for them is toil and perseverance on the part of the physician, above whom they are formed.</start_of_turn>
But in those which are neither penetrating nor old, healing is expected when the wound is closed: as I have said before, and as I have proved: for let the patient lie between your hands upon his back: and elevate his limb up to above his hips, and let his thighs be bent towards his belly.</start_of_turn> Then introduce lead or air, if there is a twist of the limb, until you know where the limb hangs.</start_of_turn>
If the patient meanwhile feels pain around the part, then it is necessary to insert your finger as an index into the part.</start_of_turn>
If you feel the limb attempting to pierce itself through your finger, beyond that which you feel between your finger and the flesh, or between the flesh itself: then you know for certain that it is penetrating: do not toil in it, for its cure is not like that which we have mentioned.</start_of_turn>
They say that in some people the wound heals by itself, and by the medicine which is expected to be given: that is, that you should apply a subtle cautery according to the size of the wound, as it has been said before, and introduce the flame into the wound, until it hangs around the part.</start_of_turn Then repeat it twice or thrice until you know that all the added flesh, which is similar to the quill of a bird's wing, has been absorbed.
Then repeat it twice or thrice until you know that all the added flesh, which is similar to the quill of a bird's wing, has been absorbed.
If it thus heals, that is good.
If not, it will not heal with any other treatment.
If it comes out as far as your finger which is in the year, and is between the thumb and the great toe, and there is a thick piece of flesh or pus in it, or if there is an abscess in it: then you should make an incision on the surface of the skin following the track of the fistula, and dry the wound with the finger that is in the fistula until the incision reaches the extremity of the finger, and you will thus free the finger and make it fall off.</start_of_turn>
Then dry those filtered flesh which absorb like the quill of a bird's wing, so that nothing remains of it.</start_of_turn>
But if blood flows and so dilutes between you and the operation that you must cut those flesh: then it is better to cauterize it with fire or with acute medicine.</start_of_turn
For cauterizing with fire unites good habits, brings together the added flesh and blood, and dries blood and moisture.</start_of_turn
Then repeat it twice or thrice until pus comes out, and the added flesh is expelled in the pus.</start_of_turn
Then apply an ointment of solid unguents and solidifiers, generating tough flesh: these are medicines which have stypticity and drying power.</start_of_turn
When the restoration is complete, then healing begins: and not by repetition.
When the fistula persists deep within the body, and is prolonged by the abundance of the body: then introduce your finger into the rectum and inquire concerning its condition.
If you feel resistance, and between you and the other there is blood, either fat or flesh, and it is close to the perforation: then there is no operation in that, except as a result of trust and hope.
For in that there is one of three methods which are administered: either that you cauterize it as we have said: or that you dissect it, until you have reached its depth, so that you may afterwards insert instruments, and perform the cure Proceed not much with the incision, lest you tear the membrane containing the rectum, and cause excessive discharge without benefit. Then care for it as we have said.
Perhaps it will heal: or you will extend the said membrane and cleanse it when it is dry, as we have said, or with your finger, or with another acute instrument. Then cleanse the raw flesh which is in the incision, until where fat is seen with careful inspection
Then attempt to restore the entire wound with the incision, and the upper orifice where it is consolidated: and the fistula will remain open in the inner part of the rectum, and will be more manageable over the infirmness.
And when the fistula is sutured in this way: that is, when you introduce your finger into the fistula: and it is on the side of the rectum surrounding the surface of the body with skin and the margin of the rectum: then grasp the perforated extremity, which is like a needle with a head, that is, one that prepares the skin, according to this shape. And enter into the belly of the filament involved from five of the filaments, and circle around them. Then insert a hook with the thread into the pocket, until you follow its curvature.
If there is a perforation in the inner margin of the anus near the edge, then draw out the thread from that hole: thus you will insert your finger into the anus and draw out the end of the thread, and gather together both ends: and tighten both of them, and let go of that day, or two days: and the more the thread has gone into the flesh, tighten it well, until those parts of the flesh which are between the two ends of the thread have gone down and fallen: then care for the wound, until it is healed, and restored to health
But if the opening of the pocket is not perforated: then make it so in whatever way you are able, except if it is too deep It is not enough for you to make it penetrate because of the tear, lest you should damage it
Then do as we have said, until it is healed
Form a sponge-like cushion around the pocket which is found in the pocket, whose curvature is acute towards the outside, and the other part is not acute, so that you do not damage that which is not necessary, like water
Chapter 81.
As for the stitching of hemorrhoids from which blood runs from the incision of them: and care for the incisions.
There are hemorrhoids in two ways. Or they are inside the anus, like the stones of a carob or a plum: or they are like the seeds of a bean And they are small and large: and blood runs from them always, and there is one, and there are many of them And there are outside the limb, and at its extremities.
And those that are outside the limb are mostly small humors, from which yellow bile or a sluggish flow of blood proceeds: and they are according to the color of the body.
And the treatment of what is inside the limb is to cause the patient to cough: and to evacuate, until the anus is expelled, and the tumor appears externally. Therefore, hold it suspended with hooks: or grasp it with your finger. Then cut it through at its roots.
If, however, they do not remain within the grasp of the hook, because of the moisture of them and their softening: then cover them with rough linen, or with felt from a sheep's wool, and pull them out with your fingers Then cut them through, and powder over them after cutting whatever powders are warm, so that they remain in place like a burn Or burn them according to what has been said in the chapter on burning Then care for the limb with the remaining treatment, until it heals
And if the anus does not yield to evacuation, then instill for him a small enema in which there is a little bite, so that it may flow quickly when the patient coughs, and yield more quickly when he is expelled.
And if the tumor appears outside the anus, then the matter is light and easy: and it is as if you grasp it with your finger, or grasp it with a hook, and cut it through Then care for the limb as we have said, until it heals.
Whoever abhors an incision with a [sharp] instrument must then administer suture accordingly in this manner. Take the twisted thread and pass it into the point of the [needle]. Then draw out the little loop to the upper part and cause the needle to penetrate at its root from the opposite side: and pass through two extremities of the thread, at the lower part of the needle, and make them lateral: and tighten the little loop firmly. Then knot the thread and draw out the needle.
Do this with all the little loops, and let go of one: do not keep it, lest it cause excess bleeding
Then place upon a piece of lint soaked in saffron, or alum, and place it upon the wound: and command the patient to rest. Then let go of the needle, until it falls off naturally
When the loops have fallen off, care for the wounds with the unguents, and leave the treatment until the wound has healed.
(End of excerpt Many times these arise from the extrusion of feces, and the constriction of nature.
When these things happen, and it does not avail in medicine: then it is necessary to make incisions with the point of the Spatumilis needle, or with your nail, until they become moist, and the outer layer which hinders adhesion is removed Then care for the wound, until it is consolidated according to what is necessary
If, however, they do not consolidate: then make the incisions again with greater reason than before, until much blood flows, and they are scraped away. Then care for the wound, until it heals
On the treatment of boils of the armpits and not of the armpits: and of the biting of lice and of ants.
On the treatment of armpit boils and not of boils: and of lice bites and of ants.
You know that Almirmar is not anything except a round knot according to the color of the body, like a nail head: and it occurs throughout the body, especially in the lower parts of the feet and the toes: and it happens from an inflammation of pain during walking.
It is necessary therefore that you cut away what is around the head [of the boil], and hold it with forceps, or with a hook, and eradicate it from its root.
Then care for it: and if you wish, cauterize it according to what is written in its chapter
As for lice, their bite is a small, rough, filtered, round elevation above the surface of the body And they appear many times in the hands of children.
And their treatment is to extend the lice and cut them: or to tie them with a silk thread: or with hair, until they fall out And if you wish, cauterize them according to what is said above with fire, or with acute medicine: and thus you will eradicate the biting lice, both those that are outward and those that are inward, with the instrument that I say.
And as for ants, they are also a small, filtered elevation, large, above the surface of the body, which bites deeply: and when it bites, it feels like the bite of an ant, and it happens throughout the body: and most of them happen in the hands.
And their treatment is to take a needle from the wing of an ostrich, or a strong hair, and put it on the ant, until the circle of the needle surrounds the parts of the ant. Then withdraw your hand with the cannula until you reach the circumference of the Ant: and place the same in the depth of the flesh, and extract the Ant from its root.
If you wish, do this with an air or iron cannula, according to this form.</start_of_turn>
Let the upper part of the cannula reach the base of the thumb which is being grasped, so that the thumb will be alleviated from its tension and its withdrawal.</start_of_turn>
If you wish, cauterize the Ant according to what has been stated concerning the cauterization of the Athelia in the chapter on cautery.</start_of_turn>
Chapter 83.</start_of_turn
As for the forms of the instruments which are administered to the Clisteria in ailments of the Animal, and the solution of the belly, and the colic.</start_of_turn
When the Clister is made from silver, or gold, or blown glass, or hammered metal.</start_of_turn
And when they are made from these small and large instruments, according to those in which they are administered.</start_of_turn
This is done in the treatment of young children with thickened lungs, for they are small: and when the animals are weak or painful, thus also the Clisters.</start_of_turn
Large Clister.</start_of_turn
The upper part of the cannula, that is, the head in which the uterus is bound, is to be broad according to this manner: and there should be a distinction so that the uterus may be bound like water, and the lower part which goes into the belly should be deaf, that is, not open, soft, flexible, drawn towards thinness: and on one side of it there are two holes, and on the other side one hole.</start_of_turn
The breadth of the hole should be according to the length of the rays, neither too great nor too small. And let the belly be in which the medical instruments are placed be from the belly of an animal: or from parchment paper which is according to the shape of the asofrat of a date. And its root is one palm.
The hole is made with many perforations as it is twisted, and there should be space between each perforation equal to the breadth of a finger Then insert into these holes a strong thread from a strong thread, which is from ten threads, or thereabouts, and gather it together like the asofrat of a date When it is thus placed in this belly, it is strung in the head of the stitches between two distinguishing constrictions of force. Then stitch with it.
This is the form of the circle which is here represented, and of the holes.
The quality of the stitching with this is: so that you implement both the belly or the belly from the medicine, which is warmed according to the quantity of the patient's tolerance: and be careful that it is neither too hot nor too cold, nor too cold.
Then the patient is laid upon his back, and he raises his legs towards his chest: and put under this is a cushion, that is, skin over which men lie, or a bandage
Then cover the extremity of the stitches with wax, or with alum, or with barley mush, or something similar. Then insert the instrument itself into the hole with ease. Then take hold of the belly with two hands and press it out with your hands until it has completely evacuated all that is in the stitch into the intestine.
Then extract the Clistere, and elevate the patient's limbs towards the side.
If the physician considers that the patient must be discharged, let him retain him as much as he can And if he sleeps throughout the whole night, that is the greatest benefit
If, however, you apply the Clistere to the bowels of the solution of the belly, and the evacuation is imminent: then repeat the Clistere until the patient is healed.
If there are hemorrhoids or painful apostemata in the rectum, then let the Clistere be gentle and soft, from the Clisteres which are given to children
And this is the form of the gentle Clistere above which is strict of the skin
Head wound number 84
I have already spoken in the discourse about the treatment of wounds which is contained in the book, and I will now speak of the treatment of these with the hand and with the physicians in accordance with the supplement.
I say therefore, that wounds are varied according to the thing which causes them, and according to the place where the wound falls.
Wounds which are caused by many things are like the blows of a stone: or the cutting of a sword or knife: or the percussion with a spear, or wood, or arrow: and like these from many things.
Wounds which are caused by the place of the body are like those which fall on the head, or the neck, or the chest, or the belly, or the back: and like these from many parts of the body
I am relating the treatment of some wounds, in order to set forth their ratiocination and regulation in relation to the rest of the wounds.
I shall begin with simple head wounds: for the recollection of compound wounds will arise in the third chapter
I say so. When a simple wound occurs on the head and there is no fracture of the bone: consider then, if there is an excrescence of stone, or like things, and if it has only rent the skin: and it is a great wound, and the time for the dressing of the wound is great: then stop, and perform a cephalic phlebotomy immediately: and do not delay it: and draw from it according to the quantity of its virtue: if there is nothing to prevent it by phlebotomy, especially if there is little blood flowing from the wound. And let the phlebotomy be from the opposite side of the wound
And let the phlebotomy be from the opposite side of the wound And let the patient be guarded against repletion, and wine, and coarse food
If, however, anything prohibits the reduction [of the wound], then let the diet be reduced, and do not approach meat, nor drink wine
And put upon the wound if it happens to him a soft dressing of clotted butter, or with wine in which there is stypticity
If, however, you are secure from the soft clot, then put upon the wound, if there is a residue with blood, and it has not changed its air, some powder which I shall tell you of later: and if it has changed its air, then put upon it some unguent until it is healed
If, however, the wound is great, or is from the incision of a sword, and like things: and the lips of it do not adhere by threads, then adhere them together with suture, according as I shall tell you in the wounds of the belly concerning the suture of these
If, however, a bone has been detected by the touch and hangs loose, and its retention is not possible, except for a small suspension: then cut it off. Tend to the wound with the physicians, and restore the flesh firmly in its place with the skin, and command the patient to eat food which has a large bulk, such as heads and cooked wheat, until the pulse: and such things are like them.
If you find in the wound putrefaction and it does not adhere to the bone: then cut off the putrefied part entirely, and throw it away: then care for the wound afterwards
If, however, in the wound there is an artery or a vein from which blood flows: and it is not severed by the physicians: then inquire concerning the artery. If, however, you find it not severed, cut it off with sponges, or ligate it.</start_of_turn> If, however, necessity compels you when it does not confer what we have said: then cauterize it, until the bleeding is stopped.</start_of_turn>
If, however, these wounds are small and simple: then the matter is easy and light: so that you sprinkle them over this powder: because it strengthens them before they change from air.</start_of_turn>
Method of applying the powdered dressing.</start_of_turn Recipe: take one part of olive oil, two parts of dragon's blood, and three parts of unburnt lime: mix them all together thoroughly, and make a fine powder: and apply it to the wound, and bind it securely, until it adheres well to it and coagulates with the blood.</start_of_turn
Then stretch it out over sponges, and let it go, and do not wash it until it has dried, so that it does not become dissolved.</start_of_turn Unless it is cured, it does not vanish from there by medicine.
When only lime is used for this, when it is not accompanied by olive oil and dragon's blood, it performs the same operation in many great wounds, when it is put on them and bound, as in fresh wounds with their own blood, which has not altered the air.
When it has altered the air somewhat, especially when in summer, the intention of this powder is not here: care for it as we have said, so that you put on over it some emollient ointment: or put on over it balls of barley flour made with water and honey, until pus comes out Then care for the rest of the treatment until it is healed.
If indeed it happens with a fracture of a bone that is small, then extract that with a needle: and I will tell you the treatment of fractures of the head in this which the future is
Of wounds of the neck.
If indeed a wound happens in the neck, then there is no difference between it and a wound of the head when it is simple
If, however, the nerve or an artery is cut: then if it is the nerve, it is not in its wit, except as you must direct the treatment of its haemostasis, such as staph, and sponges, and things of that kind For they do not know the nerves, and they are against them
Do not put anything cold on the wound at all: for the substance of the nerves is cold, and their continuation is with the brain, which is the soul of the limbs: and it is better to treat them with gentle medicine, such as lime with sweet oil slightly infused with honey, or with rose water, and oil of ravens, when it is washed away with sweet water: and the rest of the mineral stones, in this way, and moist ointment.
If the wound is large, then administer a suture: or close its lips with hairs. Then care for it until it heals.
If the wound is deep, or if it has occurred in a sinus in its lower part, where pus is accumulating, then perforate it in a depressed place in that area
If the wound has been incised in an artery, and its blood is flowing: then separate it, or dry it up, and ligate it: or burn it, if need be for that.
If the ribs of the gut have been fractured, or the whole gut, and the edges are raw: then gather the skin lips with a suture over the neck of the gut, and do not touch the gut, but rather stretch it out to its natural figure. Then bind it tightly with a bandage, and let it go in a few days. Then care for it with poultices which have astringency and drying power, until it heals
If the wound has made an imprint in the bone, then inquire about it: then if there are fragments of bone in that, extract them all, or whatever can be separated from it: and what cannot be prepared, let it go, until the wound has healed, and the fracture has been separated and restored to its natural position.
If the wound has been burnt, then powder over it the powder which I have mentioned If bone is seen in the wound, and a fistula has formed: then care for it as is mentioned in its chapter.
(The provided text does not contain any further relevant content regarding "Wounds in the Spatulas", so the translation ends here.)
If there is a wound from a lance or a knife, and you see its depth, then consider it carefully. If blood flows from the wound while the patient groans in pain, then you know that the wound is deadly
If it is not deep and the bleeding is accompanied by pain: do not put powder or string it up in the first hour, but let the blood drain naturally. Put on a compress over the wound and keep it bound for two days.
If there is no bandage over the wound, put on a thick wad of cotton in the opening of the wound to absorb the blood that comes out from the moisture: and make the patient sleep over the wound so that the blood clots together in it
If after three days or more the patient has neither a spasm nor a bad tremor of the heart nor a stricture in swallowing, nor any other bad symptoms, and the bleeding has stopped, then you know that the wound is healed Care for it diligently and with care, and with proper treatment, until it is healed.
If after that the healing is delayed and the wound always opens, then you know that a fistula has formed Care for it from its head to its tail
And if the wound is from a cut or a knife and is simple on the surface of the chest or back: then care for it as if it had been sutured, if it is large: or with powder if it is small
If however it has made an imprint in the bone and has burst out: then inquire about the wound and take care to remove the burst bone, if it is separated If, however, they are not separated, then let them go, until the limb putrefies, and the extraction will be easier for them.
The remaining wounds of the accident in the rest of the limbs is a matter of judgment in the treatment, as we have said.
Of the wounds of the belly, and the issue of the intestines, and the issue of them.
The rupture which occurs in the belly is great, medium, or small
From the great one indeed when the intestine, or the number of intestines, comes out.
Therefore the introduction becomes more difficult and more difficult the more there is of it
And the small rupture is also difficult from another way Therefore it follows that the reduction becomes more difficult if you do not promptly intervene in the introduction to its place: because it swells, opens, and swells: and thus the entrance becomes difficult
Therefore the medium rupture is better: because with it the reduction of the intestine is not difficult, as it is in the two former cases
You know that the suture of the belly is done in four ways.
Two sutures are common with regard to the suture of the belly, and in the suture of the rest of the wounds of the body: and two other sutures communicate properly with the rest of the wounds. The true ones are those which are proper with regard to the suture of the belly: and I shall tell you one and the rest with exposure and declaration.
I say therefore that when the wound is small, and something comes out of it from the intestine, and it is difficult to reduce it: then this is because of one of the two modes Neither because of the abundance of disruption [of the bowels], as we have said: Nor because there is inflation in the intestines from the cold of the air.
When this is the case, then it is necessary to warm it [the affected area], just as you would immerse a sponge or a wet cloth in warm water Or boil it with squinance, and cypress, and mustard, and bind it with the intestines, until the inflation is resolved.
When it makes a slimy liquid: it is better than plain water for resolving the inflation.
When the inflation has been resolved, then moisten the intestines with the warm liquid in which it was boiled, or with vinegar For in this way it will soothe the entrance of the intestines with little things.
If however it vomits after this treatment, then find it in slight disruption, with the instrument by which hemorrhoids are cauterized.
The first treatment is better when it is prepared than when it is forced: and it does not cause the intestines to contract excessively after necessity and defect of the instrument
Let one part be acute and the other not acute, and the extremity soft not with the softness of the sponge, but rather with a slight bluntness: and this is what resembles vomit, like liquid
When the belly is distended and the intestines are introduced, then it is necessary to reduce it according to its natural shape in its own place, if possible: for this is better.
When the disruption is wide in the lower part of the belly: then it is necessary to make the patient lie flat on his back and raise his knees above his head. If it is in the upper part of the belly, then place its head above and its belly below.
If there is a disruption in one of the two parts of the belly, then place your intention and consideration always in this, that the part which has the wound should be above the other part
It is thus necessary, that you observe this in great wounds and in medium wounds.
In small wounds, place it according to what is prepared for you
Then make it present between your hands the pious minister who will hold the entire disruption of the hand: and join its lips together. Then draw from this that which follows the suture something after something: and this is the way of common suture of one thing.
And it is necessary, that you take an awl or the number of awls according to the quantity of the wound's amplitude Then draw from the extremity of the disruption the quantity of an index finger, that is, the doctor: and fix the awl one before which you introduce the thread into the skin, with two extremities which you make to bleed from the inside, until you have made the skin penetrate from another part, and when you have joined together the two extremities of the skin, and the two extremities of the bleeding, there are four orders
Then string with a double thread around the circumference of the awl several times from two parts simultaneously, until two lips of the wound are aggregated with a decent aggregation.
Then draw the length of a finger also, and fix in the skin another awl: afterwards tighten the thread with the hand as you did with the first awl. Do not cease until you have completed the constriction of the whole wound.
The needles must be of medium size between the thickness and fineness: for the fine needles penetrate the flesh too quickly, and the thick needles are difficult to pass through the skin: therefore it is necessary that they be of medium size in fineness, and thick in thickness.</start_of_turn>
It is not permitted that the needle should be fixed at two points close together on the skin: for the flesh will thus be pierced too quickly and the wound will open before it is consolidated, and will not be consolidated even when sutured, for it will be hindered by the consolidation.</start_of_turn>
Then pierce the extremities of the needles, so that they do not wound the patient during his sleep: and place over them small cushions of wool from all sides, which will hold the extremities of the needles: and draw them out, until you know that the wound is consolidated.</start_of_turn>
And thus is this sort of suture more suitable for small wounds.</start_of_turn> For it is sufficient in the suture of these to use one or two needles, or a few.</start_of_turn
The second sort of suture is common, that is, to join together four extremities: two of the skin and two of the fat in one wound, with a needle through which the thread is passed, equal in fineness and thickness.</start_of_turn
Then when you have pierced through with the needle you have four extremities, reduce the needle from the part from which you began and let the thread hang down from the upper part of the wound: so that the suture will be like that of a thread which is drawn through cloth, and put between every suture as much of the thickness of a small finger.</start_of_turn
Men know this stitch.
When such a stitch is made, men know that a wound has occurred in the belly which has been caused by a knife, and that the wound has been severed more than half way through: and that there has been a rupture of the intestines about two palms from the middle of the intestine, and that there has been a rupture in the middle of the belly.
Therefore, in this case, when the intestine has been placed outside the wound for twenty-four hours, it is reduced
It is consolidated in that space where it had been for about fifteen days: and it was treated, and it healed: and it remained well for many years, restored to its own state.
And the physicians knew that it would not heal.</start_of_turn>
And indeed, it was a wonder that it healed without ointment because it was in a place where ointment was not to be found, and no doctor had it.</start_of_turn> I put upon the wound a thick wool cloth twice a day, and I bathed it with scented water until it healed.</start_of_turn>
And there are two kinds of stitches which are called by their own names according to the narration of the sermon.</start_of_turn>
And it is thus that you commence with a sharp stitch: and you pass the point from the exterior towards the interior part.</start_of_turn
When you have thus pierced the skin, and in the lacteam there is a small hole according to the length and breadth of the whole body: you draw out the extremity which you had passed through at the side where you introduced the point, and make penetrate from the inside towards the outside in the opposite extremity.</start_of_turn
When you have finished penetrating from the exterior to the interior, then penetrate again from the inside to the outside of this limb: let go of the limb that is on this side and penetrate the point on the opposite side from the inside to the outside. Penetrate with the same movement as you use to penetrate the limb at the point where you penetrated the limb itself until you have penetrated the whole thing.
Begin again from this same side and bring your limb along with the limb that is from the outside to the inside, and withdraw the needle from the skin where it entered.
Then withdraw the needle from the skin and bring the limb along with this limb: and withdraw the needle from the skin from that side, and do this twice in order that the limb becomes whole again according to this example
And the sum of all these sutures is like the sutures of the skin which join the skin: so that you will let go of one part of the limb from one side and the other part from the other side, until you have completed it.
The second kind of proper suture which Gale has mentioned.
This is how it is said in the case of these sutures which are like those which some physicians make: for they collect every part in relation to its own kind by nature: and they apply the limb to its opposite limb, and the limb of the heel to the opposite limb of the heel. And this is done as I have said above.
It is necessary to bring the needle close to the heel from the outside, and to make it penetrate from the outside towards the inside in this place alone: and let go of the two limbs. Then withdraw the point and make it penetrate from the outer side inwards through two extremities of the sponge, namely both.
Then withdraw both [needles] and make both penetrate both inwards to the outside, through two extremities of the sponge which are on the opposite side.
And this method of stitching is better than common stitching, and is the stitching whose progression is remembered.
This is just like Galen's words also.
And some people say that The stitch is corrected inwards with two squares That is, that you insert both threads inwards through two points: and you begin by inserting the needle from where it is towards you, and make it penetrate until it reaches the opposite side, following the line of the suture that joins the pieces of skin equally
And you know that when a disruption is in the middle of the inwards: then the suture of that is more difficult than that of the rest of the inwards
The judgement of the healing of wounds is the judgement of the rest of the wounds.
That is, because when you follow the wound with its blood, before it changes itself by air: and you reduce the gut, and take hold of it, and bind it: then you put over the powdered ochre
For if the air has already changed the wound: then put over it some unguents which are present, until they make pus: and the threads will fall out, and the sponge will be consolidated, and dry it off Then care for this as for the care of the rest of the wounds, until it is healed
If, however, there is no physician present, then immediately place above the affected part, from which the discharge of pus commences, a cover for the wound: and change the cover twice a day until the patient is healed.
For indeed you do not require any other medicine in many instances when the wound is simple.
If, however, the wound communicates with the principal parts of the body in the lesion, then it is necessary to immerse wool yarn in lukewarm water, or in rose water: and place it around the parts which are between the groin and the armpits, and under the flanks.
If he feels pain, or swelling, or putrefaction in his intestines (for this often happens), then bathe him with wine vinegar, black, warm: especially if the putrefaction has already spread throughout the intestine, and has made an opening through it
Know that that which comes from the large intestine is easier to heal: and that which comes from the small intestine is more difficult to heal.
The small intestine, however, which is called Ieiunum, does not suffer healing from the wound which occurs in it throughout: and this is because of the multitude of its veins, and the greatness of their number, and because of the fineness of its body, and by its proximity to its own nature of nerves
If, however, what proceeds from the wound is flesh, and follows: reduce it according to your reduction of the intestines.
If, however, it has passed beyond that space, and is black, or dark: then you must bind it up with thread over the place which has been denatured by it, so that there is no flow of blood. For in flesh there are veins and arteries.
Then let him penetrate that which is beyond that ligament, and place two hanging threads from the lower part of the wound outside the wound: so as to alleviate the traction of the former, and the extraction of the latter at the time of evacuation of the abscess, and the emission of pus from the wound.
Remember the wound which happened in the intestines.
When a disruption occurs in the intestines and it is small: then it is possible, in some people, to restore it: because I have seen that which was wounded in its belly with a lance and was on the right side of the stomach, and was old: and a fistula was made, and it went out through that egestion, and there was swelling
I put in place therefore a cure, until I am not prevented by the healing of it: neither will I cease to apply it until it is healed, and the place is consolidated
When I have seen that the place is consolidated, I fear over the sick man, that something bad might happen to him in his belly: and nothing of that kind happened to him from that thing. And it remained in better conditions, eating and drinking, and hopeful, and went into the bath, and exercised in his diet.
And some experimenters say, that when in the intestines there is a wound and it is small: then it is necessary to tie it in this way And take ants of great heads. Then gather up two lips of the wound, and place an ant upon one of those which have an open bone above two lips of the wound When there is a head over these, and you have bound up its bone, cut off its head, and it will adhere to it, and will not dissolve.
Then place another sponge close to the first, and do not desist from doing this until the sponge following the first is as much as the whole wound.
Then reduce the wound, and wash the wound. The head of the appendix remains attached to the intestine until the intestine is evacuated, and it is healed, and does not cause pain to the patient.
It is also possible to ligate the intestine with a fine thread: which has been removed from the intestines of an animal, and is brought together with that which is introduced into the wound
And take hold of the end of this thread from the intestine, and remove a great deal of it Then ligate at the end of it the thread which is introduced. Then introduce this thread into the wound, and join it with the intestine Then reduce the wound in disruption
And this method of stitching with sponges and intestine is not without danger, except according to the amount of trust and hope
You know that a wound which is great and wide, especially if it is in one of the large intestines: then there is no skill except fine suture, and its healing is not at all possible
About the care of ulcers and fistula.
You know that every wound, or swelling which has become old and hardened, and which emits pus constantly, and does not heal, is called an ulcer, and we call it a fistula in any part of the body where it exists
And a fistula is a filtered nodule, hard, white: which has no pain, which has the consistency of a feather of a bird: and for this reason they call some of them Risati, that is, feathers
In some instances, the air is humid and emits pus. And sometimes the humidity breaks down in certain hours. When it is much humidity, and little, it is great and soft.
And I say beforehand in the division, that when I spoke of wounds, that no wound which does not heal, neither is born in this body, is not without a new cause.
For one of these causes, or because of the scarcity of blood in the body: or because of its malice: or because it is closely surrounded by tough flesh which hinders the birth of tissue: or because of the abundance of pus and discharge: or because the wound itself is putrid and the matter that comes out of it is of bad quality: or because the treatment is unsuitable for the condition: or because there is a corruption of the surrounding area which is a kind of epidemic: or because of the nature of the area, as it sometimes happens in Caesaraugusta, where digestion is difficult for ailments, and the healing of wounds is delayed by nature: or because there is one bone, or many bones.
And I have shown you all these causes and signs and their treatments with the doctors in the division: and it behooves you here to write down the treatment of fistula and abscess, which is done by one operation with the hand
You know therefore that fistula occurs in all the members of the body. For there are fistulas which extend to great veins and arteries, or nerves, or the intestines, or the bladder, or to some of the ribs: or to some of the vertebrae, or to some of the connected tissues: such as the hand and foot: and these are of those which arise from proximity to the main member, and from like things
That which proceeds from his fistulas according to this method is from difficult-to-heal diseases, and does not accept treatment, and is accompanied by toil and ignorance.
If anything proceeds from any fistula whose depth does not reach these parts which I have mentioned: and you hope, and confide in its treatment, and wish to reach an understanding of it, then take an attempt from the air, or from iron, if the fistula lies according to its rule, and inquire about it with the fistula itself.</start_of_turn>
If, however, there is a twisting in the fistula, then investigate it with a subtle lead weight.</start_of_turn> For the lead, with the softness of its body, will yield to the twisting.</start_of_turn
If the fistula has many orifices, it is not possible for you to signify over it with a probe.</start_of_turn Close them up from their orifices with their orifices.</start_of_turn
For the humidity which closes them up will go out through the other orifices, and will run out from their bodies.</start_of_turn
Then inquire accurately according to what method is possible: that you may know whether it is bone or nerve, and whether the fistula is long or short: or whether the fistula is one which has many orifices, and rests upon all of these things, with the sum of your strength: with your inquiry of the patient, which you make of him, and the finding of pain in compression with your hand on the place, and similar signs and symptoms following.</start_of_turn
When you have stood upon all these things truly, then make an attempt at treatment with confidence: and know that if the fistula appears close to the surface, or in a safe distance from the junction, or from the nerve, or artery, or vein, or any other place which I have mentioned: then dry the fistula according to what has been said above, and remove what is in it from filtration, and putrified flesh, which is born from its orifice in the flesh, or pus, and the like: and treat it until it is healed.</start_of_turn
If, however, the fistula is of great length and depth, and is according to the rule of rectitude: then it is necessary that the section be made as deep as possible. Then it is necessary to ligate all the corrupted flesh of it
Then apply ligatures with sharp instruments: and introduce them until you reach the depth of the fistula as you have comprehended it with the iron: do this as often as necessary, until the sharp instrument has eaten away everything that remains in the depth of the fistula from corruption
Then restore the thing with bandages which generate healthy flesh, until it is healed.
If indeed it does not heal by this, then burn it as we have narrated.
If indeed the cause of the fistula is bone, and you suspect that to be the case: then inquire about it, and section it as we have narrated: if it does not prevent you from doing anything from the bone, or nerve, or principal limb, as we have said
If indeed it is found to be bone, and there is something of corruption and blackness in it: then cut it away, until the corruption of it is completely removed Then care for the wound which has been made, until it is healed
Which if it does not heal, and discharges pus like this: then you know that you have not reached the whole eradication of the corruption.
Therefore investigate further concerning this, and make a reason for it, and ligate it with your utmost skill.
Then restore it. If indeed it heals, that is good: and if not, then you know that that corruption is in great depth of the body, which you have not been able to follow. There is no such thing as an accident in this matter, except for that which nature itself sends.
If the bone is fractured, and it is possible to grasp it, draw it out with fine forceps which are suitable for this purpose.</start_of_turn>
If there are many bones, then take hold of them all and do not let anything escape your grasp by reason of your strength.</start_of_turn>
If anything opposes you from the moistness, and there is no fear of incision, or of an error: then cut through the moistness and the flesh, if they are there, and free the bones.</start_of_turn>
If you are not prepared to remove the bone at this time, then put upon it something that will cause it to decay: and let it go, until it decays from the surrounding flesh and moisture.</start_of_turn
And keep the wound closed so that it does not harden.</start_of_turn> And bind up the incision which you made in your operation.</start_of_turn And put upon it, if you wish, a bandage soaked in sulfur trioxide with oil: or a bandage soaked in Egyptian unguent, or some other unguents of your choice.</start_of_turn
For when they decay, these moist things, and are separated from the bones, the pain will be alleviated and the attraction of them will cease.</start_of_turn
If however there is a large bone, such as the femur or the hip bone, and the like of them, and if that is fractured, it is a great matter: then break it off by its root, until the black part is gone and the fracture has healed.</start_of_turn Then restore the wound.</start_of_turn
If indeed that which is in it corrupted is great, and the corruption has already followed to the marrow of the bone, then it is necessary to cut through it entirely up to the place where the corruption persists: then care for it until it is consolidated.
And I shall tell you of a fracture which occurred to me in my leg: that you may take it as an example and aid in your operation.
A young man about the age of thirty suffered pain in his leg, because something had become displaced within his body, that is, from the inside outwards, until it reached the thigh, and a large swelling ensued: and there was no external cause for it
It remained extended for a long time with an error of the doctors, until the swelling was opened up, and many materials came out with it And after that his cure was settled, until the leg was bound up, and many holes were made in it: from which pus and moisture of the body were emitted
They treated it for a long time with many doctors for two years, and there was no skill in their art of hand, until I saw it and washed the leg and the things which were coming out of those holes in great quantity: even all the flesh of the thigh was wasted away, and its colour was pale yellow
They introduced their hands into one of the holes and reached the bone.
Then I examined all the holes: and I found that they all led to each other throughout the whole thigh
I proceeded thus, and closed one of the holes, until I found a part of the bone: and I found it corrupted: for it was corroded and dilapidated, and had become putrid, and had holes in it, until it had penetrated right through to the marrow
The bone is thus serrated where it has been detected, and prepared from a broken bone.
And I declare that it is not in the bone except for that which has been fractured, which I have cut out, and serrated. I have excised it.
Then I place the restoration of the wound with the consolidating physicians over a long space. And it is not consolidated
Then I tried again, and I found above the first detection a second break: and I found continuous corruption with the bone: and I serrated that which appeared to me also from that corruption
I attempted to restore it And it is not restored.
I found thus again above it, and I did not cease to cut the bone piece by piece, and to try to restore it: and it is not restored, until I cut from the bone almost up to the wrist, and I extracted that with the marrow
Then I restored it with the physicians, and it was quickly consolidated, and healed: and no further operation was necessary concerning this, except for the disposition of the weakness of the patient, and his little tolerance, and my fear of death for him, because he was fainting from excessive evacuation of urine in all his hours
He was healed thus whole: and was born in the place of the hard bone, and was made good the disposition of his body: and returned his strength: and conversed with his attendants: and did not make him any obstacle in walking at all
If, however, the prominent bone in the body is fractured: then it is necessary that you serrate it thus: and it is thus: that you grasp the ligament and string it at the extremity of the prominent bone: and command someone who will extend it upwards: and put another ligament from a thicker thread than the first ligament. Then bind the ligament above the flesh, which is over the bone: and stretch out its extremity, so that you may draw the flesh downwards: and you will see the flesh above the place where you wish to cut, so that it does not damage the flesh.
Place a stick or board under the lower bone in the center: because when you do this, it does not prevent the cutting of corrupt flesh.
And it is necessary that the suture be above the corrupt place rather than in the hollow of the bone corruption: and that it should not appear to the sense, and should urge to the suture of itself without any other thing.
If the bone is corrupt and is not prominent, continue its part with its part: and the corruption is in the middle of it, or in the part itself: then remove the flesh from all around it whole Then place a stick below.
Afterwards cut it from the first part where the corruption is, until the suture is continued from the other part: and let the suture be according to the length of the corruption, as we said before
If the corruption is at the junction, cut the corrupted junction itself and cut the bone where the suture is continued from the other part
If indeed the corruption is in the continuation of two junctions, then it is not in vain except for abrasion.
If the corruption is in the palm of the hand, or in the palm of the foot: then the matter is difficult indeed It is true that you must inquire about the nature of the corruption. And scrape away the flesh, and cleanse it as much as you can, and with whatever ingenuity you can manage: when it does not make you break the Vein or the Nerve.
You know that the incisors and the serrae are many in number, according to the situation of the bones, their preparation, their size, their slenderness, their magnitude, and their density. Therefore it is necessary to prepare an instrument appropriate for each kind of operation.
You know that these operations are significant above the kind of instrument which is not enough when one has studied for a long time. And the knowledge of the methods of this art is the testimony of the methods of healing: for indeed you will find that it coincides with them from the instruments to all diseases.
I am firm in the last of this chapter concerning the number of instruments which you have mentioned, and the examples which you have given concerning those which you cut, and the test which you have experienced on others.
The shape of the other serrae
The shape of the joined rasps Let the head of this rasp be according to the shape of the head of the star-shaped key: and its points according to the shape of the holes of the lichens.
And it does not fit unless it is grasped with its head when the head is fractured, or when the bone is wide and large
Form of greater Rasassa.
Form of lesser Rasassa.
Form of Rasassa in which there is a concavity
Form of other Rasassa fine
Form of other Rasassa with curved extremities
Form of small, fine Rasassa
This is like Radio, and the extremity is like a saw: it appears in many places because of the cause of the bones.
Form of Rasassa which agrees with the cause of its perforation by bones
Its extremity is triangular, and the extremity is acute
It is from India And in the same way it should be, as regards all that we have said concerning Rasassa, and Incision, and Saw
Concerning the incision of the extremities, and the suture of the bones
The extremities putrefy, either by an external cause, or an internal cause.
When therefore you have treated the disease with medicine and it does not yield, and the corruption continues: then you must cut off the limb in which the corruption appears, so that the sick person may be saved from death or from the greater defect of the limb
And the sign of this is that the limb is blackened, until it is consumed: for fire burns it, or it putrefies after blackness: until that putrefaction of the limb is complete, and it spreads throughout the body
Properly therefore when the incision has been made, and if the cause of the corruption is from a blow to some marrow bones: such as the bone of the scorpion of the sea, and the viper's bone, and the marrow bone, and the like.
If therefore the corruption exists at the extremity of the finger, then cut off the finger, and do not leave space for the corruption, but cut until the rest of the hand is reached.
And in the same way if it happens in the palm, then cut away from the root of the ulna, and do not leave space for the corruption, but cut until the wrist is reached
And if it occurs in the forearm, then cut the forearm at the elbow joint
But if the corruption has passed, and you see it around the elbow: then in that is the root of the infirmity. And to manage besides this from the treatment, is the quantity of the wound
And do the same with the foot, when the corruption has occurred in the finger, then cut the finger at one of the bones: and if it has reached the heel bone, then cut off the whole foot. And if it has ascended to the knee, then cut the thigh at the knee joint
What if the corruption has gone above the knee? Then it is not in that it is incurable, except for amputation, and letting the infirmity die.
And as for cutting off the limb, or preserving it, it is like tying the ligaments at the lower part, which you wish to cut: and tie the other ligament above the place. And extend one ligament downwards: and extend the other ligament upwards And you separate the flesh which is between two ligaments, with a sharp knife, until the whole flesh is detached Then it occurs, or it returns.
Then it occurs, or it returns. And it is necessary that you support the limb from all parts of the bandage, and do not touch the healthy area: and it comes to pass that the patient's wound becomes added to, and the swelling becomes cold.
If, however, during the operation, there occurs an internal bleeding, then cauterize the place quickly: or place above it some powder that absorbs blood. Then return to your medicine until it is completed.
Then bandage the wounded limb with the bandage that is suitable for it, and care for it, until it heals
And I tell you what happened to me in my foot, this is what I tell you
That is, because in his foot there was blacking, with a coaling that resembled the burning of fire: and the corruption of that occurred in his finger, until the whole foot was affected
He was saved from this by himself, after he had cut off the corruption of the limb with his instrument, because of the pain and the coaling: and he put it in the bandage, and it healed
And after a long time had passed, the same corruption occurred in the thumb of his hand.
He came to me, and I attempted to restore it with what I found among the physicians after the cleansing of his body: and the superfluity did not return, but it began to spread to another finger: until the corruption spread to the hand itself
He called me to cut off his hand: and I did not do that, hoping for the return of the superfluity: and I was also afraid of the death of his hand itself Because the boy was very sick on the case.
When he had despaired of me, he recovered to his land: and he came to me from there because he had become urgent, and he put his hand entirely into my hand: and he was healed.</start_of_turn>
And I do not approve of this narration, except that it be of help concerning that which has fallen from the kind of this disease: and that it be meaningful, and according to how it is done.</start_of_turn>
About the care of bones, and the quality of blistering with physicians.</start_of_turn>
When it happens that a swelling occurs in some limb through carbuncle, and the space of the swelling is prolonged until the collection of pus has taken place: then the swelling is broken, or pierced, and the pus which is in it is evacuated, and the cavity which remains is like a wound: and the skin which is over it is like a membrane which has been stripped away: and it does not reach its ultimate corruption, neither does it affect the bone, nor the nerve, nor the ligament: it is called a sinus, and not a fistula, truly; but if the space of the former is prolonged, until corruption is made in some part of the limb, then it is called a fistula.</start_of_turn
And its care is that you cut off the whole skin as it is wrinkled: and especially when it is stripped away, and is made like a membrane: and trust that it does not adhere to the place, because of its corruption.</start_of_turn
But if you hope that the skin will adhere, and that it will not result in the last consequence: and if there is roughness in the skin from the flesh, then cure it with blistering: and consider it as a sinus.</start_of_turn
If it be great, and the pus which proceeds from it be foetid of odor: then clisterize it with Egyptian medicine, which is vinegar, oil, and rue, equal parts, which are gathered in a vessel: and they are decocted over fire until the medicine turns red. And then it comes to the consistency of honey.
When it is great, and the pus which proceeds from it is foetid of odor: then clisterize it with Egyptian medicine, which is vinegar, oil, and rue, equal parts, which are gathered in a vessel: and they are decocted over fire until the medicine turns red. And then it comes to the consistency of honey. Then take from it what you need: and dissolve it with water and honey, and clisterize it with vinegar. And bind its orifice, and give the medicine in it for two hours.
Then extract it with pressure: do this every day, until the sinus is healed, and the odor is gone.
And when it is clistered with vinegar of flowers, when it is not present in this medicine: take ashes of wood or of boxwood, and sprinkle them on water. Then let it rest, and clisterize it with these things, until you are confident that the sinus is healed.
If the patient does not tolerate vinegar or water of ashes, then clisterize it with water and honey, to which something of ground rue has been added. Or clisterize it with honey and wine mixed together, because of the property of honey to heal and soften: and the wine makes the sinus adhere, especially when there is excess of astringency and dryness in the wine.
When you have done this often, and you are confident that the corruption of the sinus has passed away: then clisterize it with something which makes flesh grow in it.
Take from the plaster the deep-acting agent: dissolve it with rosewater and vinegar of wine: or mix it with some medicine, and apply it with others, as described in the treatise on unguents.
If the opening of the sinus is narrow, so that a catheter will not pass: then widen it with a small iron: or place within it a pledget of lint in Egyptian unguent, or in basic ointment, until it is enlarged.</start_of_turn>
Likewise, if the opening is also large, then sew together its lips: and discharge from it the quantity which enters the fistula without addition.</start_of_turn>
Likewise, if pus runs from the opening, let it be raised upwards: then dry it in the lower part which is in the sinus itself, so that it runs down from there: for pus, when it is collected in depth of the sinus, hinders the generation of flesh in it.</start_of_turn>
If it is not possible to dry the sinus around its lower part as desired: then try to prepare the limb with a preparation which will cause the pus to flow more easily according to what is prepared.</start_of_turn> Try that no pus remains in it at all: and take solidifying medicines which are placed over the sign, suitable for this purpose.</start_of_turn> And extend the ease over the edge of the cloth.</start_of_turn> And let the cloth be of such a quantity as to make communication throughout the sinus.</start_of_turn Then with forceps, cut straight through the opening of the sinus, slightly widening the opening of the sinus.</start_of_turn Then extend from the soft unguents on the other cloth, according to the quantity of the hole: and place it upon it in a long position far from the opening of the sinus, so as to alleviate the discharge of pus from it: and do not make the cloth too large, except after a few days or so when one has used up one.</start_of_turn
Whoever is above the opening of the Sinus cavity, he must frequently move it, so that what is aggregated there from pus may go out; and you will know whether that which runs out from it is much or little, whether it is digested or undigested.
And thus also consider the position of the Sinus itself, whether it is painful there or not, and whether there is swelling there or not.</start_of_turn>
When you thus perform your treatment in this way, and you see what comes out through the opening of the Sinus, then you will know whether the Sinus is adhered, or approaches adhesion: then therefore you must remove it in its entirety, or after three days. And when you have removed the wound, then change the bandage, and apply ointment again.</start_of_turn>
If, however, something flows out of the Sinus after a long space of time with a fine discharge, then do not despair of its adhesion, for its healing approaches, because there are people who are late in the generation of flesh in their wounds, and there are those who work contrary to that.</start_of_turn
If, however, something flows out of the Sinus after many days with undigested pus, then you know that the Sinus is not adhered.</start_of_turn
If thus the adhesion of the Sinus is delayed and its condition is prolonged: then add in the treatment of these doctors, who will make the medicines both moist and dry: for example, unguentum diaphionicum, when added to it increases the quantity of the addition of alum.</start_of_turn
And from the last of these things which are done, it is that you take diaphionicum unguentum, and mix it with rose water, and apply it over the old wound equal in quantity to the substance itself.</start_of_turn
Then confirm it with me and use it.
Then do like this, when it is not present, an unguentum of the diaphinicon, honey, until it has become thick, and use it with me. Or take myrrh, aloes, and olibanum: mix them all together, and sprinkle that over honey while it is over the fire. Then smear over the wound a bandage, and bind it over the Sine: and smear with the honey which you boiled until it has thickened: and sprinkle over the wound the species, and put over the wound the bandage, and bind it again.
And when it is given in that place, long aristolochia, and roots of lily of the valley, and is lily: and barley of herbs, and centaurea. Use them singly or together, there is enough of them, and the salve itself: and sprinkle over the honey which I mentioned before, and use it with me.
If the matter of the Sine persists, and does not recover from this treatment: then you know that there is a corruption in its depth: or that it makes an impression in the bones, or in the other hard parts, or ligaments: then cure the fistula according to what has been said before
Of the care of panaritium and nails grasped, and incision of the finger added, and section.
Panaritium is a swelling that arises under the nail of the thumb or finger, or perhaps in the other fingers.</start_of_turn>
When it persists like this, and is neglected, and becomes inflamed, it swells up, and pus comes out of it: until it corrupts the root of the nail: and perhaps it corrupts the whole thing, and perhaps the corruption reaches the bone, and there is a foul odor: and the limb becomes swollen, and its color becomes dark.</start_of_turn
When you are treating yourself, with whatever we have mentioned in the discourse, and the cure does not take effect: then it is necessary that you cut off completely the superfluous tissue which remains from the nail. Then cauterize the vessel afterwards. For cautery is very useful indeed.
If indeed the bone is sound, and the nail is also sound, and the additional growth of the nail is pressing against the flesh inwards, and it begins to pierce itself, and causes pain: then it is necessary that you place radium beneath the angle of the nail which is causing the flesh to split, and drive it upwards: and cut away the flesh with ease, and place over that which remains of the flesh from the burning and corrosive medicines until it is all removed Then care for it with unguents until it heals
But if corruption has already set in the bone, then it is necessary that you cut away that bone and extract it: for it will never heal as long as it remains corrupted within that bone
And if you see the corrosion and corruption increasing in the finger, then cut it at one of the joints, as its remembrance has been mentioned previously. Then care for it until it heals.
But if there should happen to be attrition or percussion to the nail: and this causes pain, then it is necessary that you perform a bloodletting in the first instance. Then dry the nail with sharp Spatumil from above downwards to the end.
And take care, lest the cutting should reach the flesh which is under the nail, for you will thereby cause an increase in the pain which you are relieving, and this will be the cause of the addition of flesh in that place.
Then care for the place with that which rests pain.

The veins are involved, large, filled with melancholy humors which occur in various parts of the body: most frequently in the thighs, especially in the thighs of those who are walking and laboring, and those who are carrying burdens.
It is therefore necessary to administer a purge from black bile occasionally with a strong emetic.</start_of_turn>
Then let blood be drawn from the patient with ease.</start_of_turn>
The treatment of these things is in two ways with iron.</start_of_turn One is to cut them off and extract the black blood.</start_of_turn The other is to elevate the vein and extract all of it.</start_of_turn>
The cutting of these things is in this way.</start_of_turn Embolize the thigh first with warm water much, until the thick blood has dissolved.</start_of_turn Then bind the limb of the patient from the upper part of the thigh down to the lower part of the knee with a bandage.</start_of_turn Then cut the vein in one place, or two, or three wide sections.</start_of_turn
Then elevate, that is, draw out the blood from the lower part of the thigh towards the upper part, and from above let blood be drawn so as to make the patient vomit in the beginning.</start_of_turn Then dry the limb until below: until the quantity of blood which you have drawn out is equal to that which you have ejected, and as much as the patient can tolerate without vomiting.</start_of_turn
Then bind up the limb: and order him to abstain from foods which generate black bile: and repeat the evacuation and the phlebotomy when the veins are full, and it will be good for the patient.</start_of_turn
The elevation of this [tissue] is thus done in this manner. If there are many hairs in the wound, shave the diseased limb. Then immerse the limb in a bath: or embroider it in the limb with warm water, until it turns red, and swell the veins: or exercise a strong treatment, if there is no bath available, until the limb is warmed
Then dry the skin directly over the section of the vein: or at its end near the knee, or at its lower part near the heel.
Then open the skin with needles, and scrape the vein from all sides, until sensation returns: and it is at the return of sensation that the vein has been freed from its congestion When the vein comes out of the skin, tie it like a cord
Then insert under it radium, until it comes out of the skin: suspend it with a slip knot, soft
Then dry the other part near that section three fingers distance. Then scrape the skin from the upper part of the vein, until sensation appears Then elevate the limb with the radium as you did before, and suspend it with another slip knot, as you did before
Then dry the other part, or several parts, if you wish Then elevate and bind the last part near the heel.
Then remove the limb up to the section that is above the limb
And do this until you have removed the limb from all the sections, until the whole limb has come out: then bind the limb
If it does not obey you to extract it, and it swells: then introduce a sharp instrument with a strong thread doubled, and ligate it, and extract it. Or introduce it under that radium: and move your hand over every part until it comes out. Take care, lest you injure yourself. For if you injure yourself, it will be difficult for you to extract the instrument from the wound, and it will enter deeper into the flesh from that wound
When you have extracted it all: then place upon the wound a soaked lamb's wool or linen cloth in wine and oil of roses, or oil of vinegar: and care for it until it is healed.
If the vein is contracted, having twists which are closely connected to parts, and is not as we have described according to the straight rule: then you must find upon the instrument over every part of the twists of its connection.
Then suspend the instrument with wires, until you have extracted it all: and take care at the incision of your hand over the instrument that you do not cut the vein, or wound it: for it will be difficult for you to extract or remove the instrument from you Be prudent in your dealing with it.
The form of the wound in which the vein heals.
The form of the surrounding flesh
It is not curved like the rest of the veins, neither is it acute at the extremities, so as not to cut the vein: and it is thick and flexible: for if it were thin, it would tear the vein by its flexibility: and if it were too thick, it would be useless.
On the extraction of the vein of the limb
This vein is generated in the thighs in warm lands, like Alizegi, Arabia, and in dry, warm lands, few plants grow there, neither trees.
It may also be generated in other parts of the body besides the thighs.
Its generation is from the decay which occurs under the skin, like that which happens in the bodies of serpents and worms, and the worms which are generated between the skin and the flesh
The sign of the beginning of this vein is inflammation in the thigh which is painful. Then the area swells up. Then the vein begins to emerge from that swollen area, like the root of a plant, or an animal.</start_of_turn>
When it appears from that extremity, then it is necessary to apply a bandage over the area of the pain, which should weigh from a drachma to two drachmas and a node: and let go of the suspended lead from the thigh.</start_of_turn>
Every time something comes out from that, wrap it in lead and bind it.</start_of_turn If this persists for a long time, then cut off part of it, and wrap up the remainder.</start_of_turn Do not cut off the root until all of it has emerged.</start_of_turn> For if you cut it off, it contracts and enters the flesh: and causes inflammation, decay in the place, and a bad ulcer.</start_of_turn
Therefore it is necessary to withdraw it gently and gradually, until it has fully emerged from its root: and from this vein comes out in some people as long as five palms and ten fingers.</start_of_turn And thus it remains with me, because he has gone out of the belly from twenty palms.
And if indeed it happens to you in the hour of your treatment: then introduce radium into the cavity of its belly, and perforate the belly with a long bore, as with the body, until all that is in it from that material is evacuated: and administer the putrefaction of the place with physicians for a few days. Then care for the aftercare of the matter.
And thus indeed the vein sometimes has many branches, especially when it appears in the junction of the foot, or in the foot itself: and it has many orifices, and the branch comes out from every orifice.
Care for it thus, as we said in the instruction, and with what has been said before
Concerning the incision above the worms generated under the skin, and it is called the bovine disease.
This disease is called in this land among us the bovine disease: because it often happens to cows, and it is a small worm which is born between the skin and the flesh
And it goes throughout the body, ascending and descending: and it is perceived by the sense during its walk from limb to limb, until it breaks through the skin in the place and comes out
And its generation is from the putrefaction of some humors. Just as worms and serpents do, that is to say, lice and roundworms in the belly.
And they are fearful of its malice For when it itself goes into the body, and it ascends to the head, and comes to the place: then perhaps it will open in that place and come out, and destroy the eye: and that often happens
When the limb is to be cured and extracted, it will not succeed except along with its ambulation and the sense of its apparition.
It is necessary, therefore, to ligate that which is above and that which is below with strong ligature Then dry over it, and extract it.
If it has gone deep into the flesh, and you do not find it: then put a cautery over the place with fire until it dies.
And greater than this is the corruption of its eye, as we have said before.
If, however, you see it going towards the eyebrow near the eye, then ligate under it with good suture Then dry over it, and extract it
It is necessary that the sick man should be treated with the improvement of his bodily humors, with physicians resolving harmful humors.
And beware of foods that generate putrefaction
Of excision above the navel Nakir.
This ailment is called Nakir in our land: and it is a pain which happens in some limb: then it changes from limb to limb.
I myself have seen it happen, as I have said before I was called to a woman who was sick in some village And I found her arm swollen, and saw an inflation of the bone in the elbow of the arm
And after an hour had passed, I saw another inflation growing with a worm, like a worm, ascending to his shoulder more quickly than is possible: as if it were silver being driven from place to place
The pain has receded from that place and is fixed in the arm.
Then let us wait one hour, and it will run into the rest of the body until it reaches the other arm.
Then he told me that it was returning to its whole body, as I saw
I am amazed at the speed of its change from limb to limb And I did not believe my eyes that such an ailment could change like this from one moment to the next. But I have seen many who have had their pain change from limb to limb, and I have not seen one of them change their pain in the same way as this woman
I do not believe this, except that it is because of the swelling of the veins which are detected from the roots of the body: from this it appears that the pain is altered by this sensation
It is necessary that in those who are delicate and have moist bodies, and in whom the veins are hidden, these things should not appear in this way
When therefore you see the pain in this way, grasp above and below with greater force: and dry above until the swelling has gone away: then cauterize the place.
If you do not see it with your eyes: treat it with the exclusion of the body, and with that which drives out the swelling, and give it rest with aromatic pills and belladonna pills and the like.
(The provided text does not include any information regarding the extraction of Sagittarum, so I am unable to translate this sentence.)
Arrows are varied according to their kind and according to the place from which they fall from the body.
Their variety is indeed great: for some have large cusps, others have small, and some are concave and some are convex. And some have three angles. And some have tongues And some have stars
As for those which are according to the limbs on which they fall, it is according to two modes. Or else the limbs are from limbs which are concave inwards, such as the brain, the heart, the spleen, the lung, the kidneys, the intestines, and the bladder, and things like these When therefore it falls into any of these limbs, and its signs of death appear to you, which I will tell you later, then you must immediately draw out that arrow from the limb, for death follows its wound in many positions And when you do not see these evil signs, and the arrow is not hidden in the depth of the limb, then draw it out and care for the wound
Signs are indeed present in the brain when the arrow penetrates it, and comes out through the substance which is above the brain, for from that there arise soda which is vomiting, and swelling, and dizziness, and redness of the eyes, and inflation, and redness of the tongue, and spasms, and mixture of the intellect, and vomiting of bile. And perhaps blood comes out from the nose or ears. And perhaps speech is lost, and the voice is destroyed And there comes from the wound a white moisture like pus And comes out like the moisture of meat.
If therefore this sign is seen, then abstain from treatment, and draw out the arrow if it does not come out naturally.
The signs of an arrow that has fallen into the flesh are: that it is close to the left nipple; and that it feels as though it were fixed in something hard, not in something soft The arrow may also move in a manner similar to the beating of the pulse; and it runs out from the wound bloody. And following this are chills, cold sweat, and fainting spells. You know therefore that death approaches with doubt.
The sign of an arrow that has pierced the lung is the exit of bloody foam from the wound: and the swelling which follows the chest, becomes painful, and the colour of the patient changes And the great and high spirit departs: and seeks the attraction of cold air
If an arrow falls into the belly, which is in the chest: then it is near the lower ribs: and there is a great sigh with pain, with breath-holding, with trembling: and all the arms hang limp
If an arrow falls into the stomach, then perhaps it comes out of the wound with some undigested food.
If an arrow falls into the abdomen, and is fixed in it: something of stool or urine or intestine which has been broken is ejected from the wound There is no hope of treating it, neither in the removal of the arrow
If an arrow falls into the bladder, and urine comes out: and something proceeds from it outwards, and the pain is greater over the patient: then you know that it is mortal.
The remaining members, namely the face, neck, gut, spatula, aider, shoulder blades, furcula, hip, thigh, and ankle, are similar to each other and are arranged in various ways: when neither an arrow nor a nerve is found.
And I tell you that I have seen no such arrows as you describe, for that would signify that you are not taking care of your case adequately.
That is, because I take care of the matter as it should be, I find no arrow in the tear of the eye, in the root of the nose. I have taken it out from the other side, under the fat of the ear: and it healed, and no mark remained on his eye.
And I extracted another arrow from a Jew who had it under his lower eyelid: the arrow was hidden, and I did not see its tip until I had taken hold of it: it was a large arrow, like those which the Turks make with lead in them, without any feathers
The Jew was healed, and no harm was done to his eye.
And I extracted another arrow from the gut of a Christian.
It was an Arabian arrow, which is like that which has feathers. And I found it between two ribs: and it was immersed in his gut I took hold of it with care until I had extracted it: and the Christian was healed.
And I extracted another which had been pierced in his belly: and we thought that he would die from it.
When thirty days had passed, and there had been no change in his condition regarding the arrow, we gave up hope concerning it: and we took hold of the arrow and extracted it: and the Christian was healed, and no harm was done to him.
And the wound which was caused by the arrow in the back of the man is consolidated by a nut above it. After seven years, the arrow which was in the knee of the man came out of its root
And the wound which was caused by the arrow in the belly of the woman is consolidated by a nut above it, and the arrow remains inside it: and it has not changed from its natural arrangements, and the woman has not had any other surgery.
And the wound which was caused by the arrow on the face of another man is consolidated by a nut, and remains, without causing him much pain: and similar things are many.
And I extracted the arrow from the King, which had wounded him in the middle of his nose, and which had bent towards the right side below: and the arrow was completely hidden
I was called to care for him after the wound of the arrow for three days. I found the wound of the arrow to be strict and wide
I questioned him and learned that he had suffered no pain: and he himself also recognized the puncture and the pain from the right side I hoped that this was the end of the puncture from the arrowhead
I plastered the place with an adhesive plaster which was nourishing and easy to digest, trusting that the place would recover, and that the sign of the arrow would disappear on it: and it did not happen in the place where the accident had occurred that the arrow had followed the place
I took care of the plaster for many days: and no accident happened, and the wound was consolidated in the meantime: and he felt the arrow in his nose on the following day. And he told me that.
And he told me that. And he told me that.
And he told me that
And he told me that And he told me that
And he told me that And he told me that.
And he told me that
And he told me that
And he told me that Or by extraction from the place from which it came. Or by cutting off the other part
Or that which came out from where it came in, or is a sagitta proceeding in a fleshy place: it is attracted and comes out.
If it does not come out at the proper time when it falls: then one must wait a few days and let the carrion putrefy which is around it: and the attraction of it and its egress will cease.
If it remains in the bone and does not yield to you at the outlet, then let it go even for a few days. And repeat it every day with traction and movement until it comes out.
If it does not yield to you at the outlet after days, then you must cut around the bone all around with fine wire from every side until the bone is fully exposed. Then draw it out and extract it.
If however the bowstring is already hidden in the body and is hidden from the sense: then inquire about it with your hands.</start_of_turn> If you feel it, then draw it out with some instrument that is suitable for its traction.</start_of_turn>
If, however, you cannot do more for it because of the constriction of the wound or because of the length of the bowstring in the depth: and there is neither bone nor nerve nor marrow there: then find over the bowstring until the wound is enlarged and the bowstring can be easily extracted.</start_of_turn
If the ears be retained by the tension of the flesh, then loosen the flesh firmly from all sides, by every possible means, and with all ingenuity, unless it be possible to remove the flesh from the fracture of the ears, and to twist them until it is healed.
When you perform the extraction of the arrow, in whatever place it is, then use the twisting of your hand with the forceps at all parts, until you make it evacuate: and at the last moment of evacuation, lest the arrow be broken, and that it be difficult for you to draw it, and for its own extraction
If it is not possible to remove it in an hour, then leave it for a few days, until the surrounding parts become putrefied. Then do it again: if indeed it opposes the flow of blood, then administer what we have said concerning the cure in its chapter: and guard your virtue from the incision of the vein, or nerve, or cord.
And administer all possible ingenuity in order to remove the arrow: and let it be with ease, and tranquility, or slowly, and firmly, as I have said
It is necessary that you do as you pull out the arrow, so that the wounded person is in accordance with the figure, as it is in the case of the arrow in itself. How much is good enough. If it is not possible for you, then administer what is possible from the figure.
The arrow which goes out from the contrary side, or which proceeds from something to the exterior: or it causes a swelling of the extremity of the arrow by the sense of the upper part of the skin close to it, and it dries up: dry therefore the above-mentioned area, and make the incision according to the quantity which they grasp in their forceps
Then draw it towards you: for it itself becomes easy to come out.
If indeed it is retained in the bone, then twist your hand according to the circumference, until you impress the Arrow in the bone, and expand it for itself: then draw it out.
If not: leave it for a few days: then try it again, until it comes out naturally
If the Arrow of the Bone is in it, then drive it through with that itself
If however the Bone-Arrow has fractured, and you wish to give it support: then introduce into the wound an instrument with a concave surface, so that the concavity of the instrument fits against the head of the Arrow: then drive the Arrow through with that itself.
If the Arrow is concave, then drive the Arrow through with the instrument entering into itself The Arrow shall go out through that itself.
If the Arrow is poisonous, then it is necessary to cut away all the surrounding flesh where the poison is: if this is possible Then care for the wound with that which is suitable for it.
If the Arrow is falling in the chest, or in the belly, or in the armpit, or on the side: and it is close to what you touch with your hand, and it is possible to cut above the wound: then cut, and burn away from the bone or nerve, and draw out the Arrow
Then bandage the wound, if necessary, and care for it until it heals
And this is the form of Forceps with which Arrows are drawn out.</start_of_turn>
The extremities are like the beak of a bird, which are made like iron: when they grasp the Arrow, they do not slip from it.</start_of_turn>
There are many kinds of wounds, large, small, medium, according to the quantity of the magnitude of the arrow, and the density of its substance, and the width of the wound, and the constriction of its edges.
The form of the wound is concave.</start_of_turn>
And the form of the wound is blunt.</start_of_turn
This is like the extremity of a radius, so that the entrance of the arrow into the concave sagitta is alleviated, and is driven with it.</start_of_turn>
About the phlebotomy of veins.</start_of_turn
The veins which are usually phlebotomized in the body are thirty in number.</start_of_turn
Of these, there are six in the head: two pulse veins, which are behind the ears, two Herbae veins: two arteries which appear in two temporal regions: and two veins which are in the two lachrymal ducts of the two eyes, which are called Aspicientes: and a vein prepared in the middle of the forehead: and a vein which is at the extremity of the nose.</start_of_turn And two Guidegi veins, which are in the neck.</start_of_turn And two veins which are in the upper lip of the mouth.</start_of_turn And two veins which are in the lower lip.</start_of_turn And these are the veins which are called Algecherich.</start_of_turn And two veins which are under the tongue.
The veins which are cut in the arms are five in every arm
One of them is the Cephalic vein, and it is on the side of the collarbone: and it is called the great vein of the head. And the Espalata. And it is the Middle vein, and it is composed of the branches of the Basilic vein and the Cephalic vein: and it is called the great vein of the body And the Basilic vein, and it is placed on the side of the abdomen: and it is also called the Pallicis. And it is called the vein of the belly And the Brachial vein, and it is placed over the elbow: and it is that from which the blood is drawn, and that which appears above the thumb when pressure is applied.
And the Lesser Scalene vein: and it is the vein which is between the collarbone and the mandible: and there are two branches to it
And in the leg and in the foot there are three veins. One of them is which is under the little finger at the bend from the side of the collarbone. And the other is the Saphenous vein: and its place is beside the heel from the side of the abdomen And the Popliteal vein: and its place is beside the heel from the side of the collarbone
And in the other leg there are three veins similar to these
As for the bleeding of the two veins after the Aures.
The bleeding of these two veins after the Aures is useful for treating ancient cataracts, headache, haemorrhoids, and head ulcers.
And what is the quality of a bloodletting according to what I have said? And it is that the head of the patient should be raised: and the occiput of him should be scratched in the place of two veins with rough cloth in good friction. Then the patient should be made to strain his neck until two veins appear. And their places are behind the ears in two depressed places of the head. Seek therefore what is easy for your finger, and where you feel the pulse of them under your finger, there are the signs with burnishing
Then take the bloodletting knife, which is called Incidens. Then insert it under the vein into the pith, until the bloodletting reaches the bone. Then raise your hand with the vein and the pith towards the upper part, and cut the vein with the incision corresponding to the case And let the length of the incision be the quantity of two joined fingers, or thereabouts: and let blood flow out as much as you wish.
Then bind up the patient with bandages, and let him go, until he is healed
And thus it has been said in the beginning of the book, that the cauterization of the veins is done after their incision
The two veins which are in two seasons of bloodletting are useful for ancient migraines: and for the swelling of the head and the excessive flow of acute humours to the eyes.
And the quality of a bloodletting is easy as I have said above. The sick man stretches out his neck very much, until two veins become evident to the sense of touch. And their pulse is shown beneath your finger. Then the signs are as with a burn.
Then lift the skin above the vein to the upper parts with your index finger, and make an incision below, and draw out the blood, and lift the vein to the upper parts. And make an incision like this in two other veins: and let the blood flow out according to the quantity you need.
Then loosen the patient's compression, and place your finger over the vein for an hour. Then put on the heel and the toes, and bind up the limb above the constriction: and let it go, until it is healed
And thus remember the incisions and extractions of the veins at the beginning of the book
The true effect of bleeding the front of the head after the bleeding of the Cephalic vein is to bring about the old ailments of the face: and for headaches, and redness: and wounds and sores.
And its quality is like that which I have told you The sick man stretches out his neck with all his might, until a vein becomes evident. Then take the instrument called the Fossorium.
Place the prominent point which is at the head of the Fossorium over the vein, and pierce through it with a needle, or with something else in the same way: and let the blood flow out according to the quantity you desire. Then solve the perforation of the patient, and tighten the ligature until healed.
And when opened with a wide lancet. It is not proper, that it be a sharp lancet at the extremity, like the rest of the lancets, but rather that it be blunt at the extremity. The lancet must be passed through according to the passage of the vessel: because the bone is close: and perhaps in that it will break the lancet when it is slight
The support of the two veins which are in the two tear-ducts of the two eyes, is for the eye from scabies and redness: and for the swelling in the eye, and the pains of the face.
And the quality of the phlebotomy of them is, that it tightens the patient's neck with wit Then the phlebotomy is easy: and you stand over his head
And do the phlebotomy according to the passage through to a small length, with a small lancet, broad, because in this place there is no flesh If the lancet is sharp at the extremity, perhaps it will break
Then let run out blood as much as is necessary to you And put over him the foot of the bed, and tighten him up one night, and solve him.
The veins of the nose are phlebotomized because of acute fever, and swelling of the head, and pains of the face, especially when it is ancient.
And what is the quality of his phlebotomy, that it may tighten the patient's neck. Then take his left hand and grasp the phlebotomy below the tip, long: and fix it in the middle of the animal itself, between that which distinguishes the second nose from the upright line. For the nail does not appear to the sense there, and because the blood begins to flow immediately.
And it is necessary that you should keep your last hand with the phlebotomy together: and make the blood run out according to your need. And bind it up at night once. The limb itself will restore itself quickly.
But indeed Guidegi considers phlebotomy to be useful for constriction of the chest, for the beginning of leprosy, for melancholy, for swelling and ulcers, and for wounds, that is, for herpetiform affections of the bowels
And the quality of their phlebotomy is that it may tighten the patient under both arms in his neck with a ligature: and the artificer should stand above the head of the patient, and the patient should sit upon his seat
Then make the phlebotomy of the vein to the length of the wide phlebotomy together. Then draw out from the blood the quantity that you consider necessary, or according to what you wish for the necessity. Then do the same with the other vein.
Then loosen the ligature and tighten the two veins with the middle knot: so that the patient is not stifled. Leave him until morning. The patient must be left until morning.
Regarding the evacuation of blood from the veins, according to Alberich The veins, however, according to Alberich, are suitable for phlebotomy: because they afford nourishment to the cheek in the mouth, and corrupt the gums: and cause ulcers of the mouth, and cracks in the lips, and ulcers of the bowels, even those in the nose and in its vicinity
And the quality of the phlebotomy of these veins is that you must make the patient sit before you: and tighten his collar with a wit Then loosen his lip and look at two veins: one is on the right side of the lip, and the other on the left side: and their indication is by the darkness of both. And this is true: because around them are small veins, black. Therefore make an incision on each of them as it lies.
If, however, you are in doubt and do not know which of them is suitable: then you must resort to the greater incision of both of them, and their manifestation
And similarly do the two veins which are in the upper lip: and most of the time it runs in custom with them: and make an incision of two veins which are in the lower lip
Regarding the evacuation of blood from the veins under the tongue after the cephalic phlebotomy For indeed the veins which are under the tongue are suitable for phlebotomy: because the cephalic phlebotomy is for the prevention of those things which are in the throat, and the pain of the jaw, and the pains of the mouth.
And the quality of the bloodletting is such that the patient should sit between your hands facing the sun: and raise his tongue, and look under his tongue from one side a vein, and from the other side a vein: and the color of both should decline to blackness.
And the bloodletting should be equal on both sides: and take hold, lest you leave your hand behind in the bloodletting. For under his hand are arteries, and perhaps blood will flow from them.
And there are three veins in the elbow which are bled in: their bleeding is customary in all men
And their bleeding is done in two ways. Either by pressing with a blunt needle: or by squeezing with oil to its thinness: or by drying with a needle, and that is Alnesil. And this is its form
And from these there are wide and narrow species according to the width of the veins and the tightness of their form. The form of the bloodletting needle is wide like oil And it agrees with opening wide veins, full, protruding, apparent, coarse, and those which contain thick blood, turbid
And this bloodletting is of smaller width and greater delicacy
And it agrees with the bleeding of delicate veins which contain thin yellow blood
Basilica is one of the three veins which are bled in the bloodletting. Since it draws blood from the ailments which are under the gut and the throat, from thence follows the chest, and the belly: and it joins the phlebotomist with the phlebotom, in order that it may cause fear, and be above the risk from that which is under it, for there is an artery below that. If it should err, and add in the puncture of the phlebotomy, it will cause that artery to bleed, and there will be a flow of blood. Therefore it is necessary not to join the phlebotom with the phlebotom which is puncturing: rather let it be dry like Alnesil.
If indeed it does not appear with an obvious sign, then it is necessary, that others do it, and change to another, or ask someone of its branch: or to phlebotom in the place of it the cubital vein It is itself evident, and dry with the phlebotom of Anesil, as we said before
If however you wish to phlebotom yourself, then it is necessary before the pressure of the arm, so that you may reach the place, until you know the place of the pulse Then signs over the place with the nail, afterwards the arm, and dry the area with a concave section with the phlebotom of Alnesil, as we said before. And be careful not to strike the percussion over the space from the place of the artery.
And when you go, when you tighten the ligature, the inflation in the place which you signed with the nail, then that inflation is the inflation of the artery: you must therefore do it thus
And if blood goes out at the phlebotomy like urine of a child, and it is thin, red: then you know that it is from the artery Then proceed accordingly. Place your finger upon the said spacious area and withdraw your finger. If blood is severed (which often happens), then tighten the arm and let go: and let the patient beware of its movement: and stay above its fear.
Do not move it for a few days until it is healed.
If however blood is not severed, and you suspect it: and you are not present in your moment with medical supplies, then cut the artery if necessary For its extremities contract and blood is severed
Or take the cork of a vessel and find the place: take the middle one and tighten it upon the place of the stricture with ligament and nails until the next day.
Then if blood is severed, that is good. And if not: then care for it as before remembering the evacuation of the blood from the place of the broken blood vessels: and the clotting of blood in this is not difficult in many situations because of the smallness of the wound and the possibility of the ligament from the arm
The veins of the cubital phlebotomy are said to be useful because they draw blood from the upper part of the head and the lower part of the body: because they are composed of the branches of the basilica and the cephalic veins, as we have said.
It is convenient for the phlebotomist that there is fear of phlebotomy because under it there is a nerve. If therefore he adds in the puncture of the phlebotomy, and finds the nerve, there occurs in this a stupor, and the healing of it is difficult, and perhaps it will not heal completely
And this nerve appears to be very sensitive. And if it is hidden in some people, and is slight, and is not visible: then it is necessary to perform a vein-cutting as you would perform an Alnesil section, and to ligate the nerve with your own hand.
If it is between two nerves, then find the vein along its length.
Of the cephalic vein. The vein of the head is to be cut because it attracts blood from the head and supplies it to the eyes
And it is necessary in this vein to make its own puncture, if you will, with a puncture like that of the olive, or like that of the myrtle: because it is safer for the veins of all than to cut an artery or a nerve.
Indeed it agrees with you concerning the puncture of the head vein, that you must ligate it only at the level of the lacerated part and that you inquire about a softer place: and it does not harm if it is not found with the first percussion, as it returns later with repeated punctures.
Indeed perhaps it is postponed in some people when it is not cut in the first percussion, but it does not harm that postponement in anything
Of the usefulness of phlebotomy, and the precautions to be observed in its practice. The quality of phlebotomy, and the accidents that arise from it, in whose rectification you must reflect
Firstly, you must know that phlebotomy is not administered except for the conservation of health, and the preservation of life, and the care of ailments.
And as for the making of a phlebotomy in one of the three veins which are in the cubit, namely Cephalica, and Fusca, and Basilica. And as for the making of a phlebotomy in the beginning of spring after fasting, in summer, and in autumn, and in winter after a meal, when there are signs of repletion.
The phlebotomy shall be made on the first or third day, after three hours have passed
However, the phlebotomy which is given in fevers has no fixed hour: but when there is convenience and necessity for it, at night or day, at any hour, and at any time.
And it is not permitted that phlebotomy be made of children until they are fourteen years old. Neither is it permitted to make phlebotomy of a pregnant woman except from the fourth month until the seventh month. Neither is it permitted to make phlebotomy of old people who are already past sixty years old.
When anyone wishes to make a phlebotomy for any reason whatsoever: it is necessary that he should have previously purged his bowels with a mild laxative, if there is much stool retained in the bowels: in order that they do not attract the veins near the phlebotomy by the putrid matter of the bowels.
Neither is phlebotomy to be made of a patient who is suffering from acute nausea, nor of a constipated or drunken patient, until these things have been removed from the body. Neither of a patient with dropsy.
And caution must be taken that phlebotomy is not repeated immediately after a meal, or vomiting, or flux of the bowels, or abundance of coitus, or labor, or exercise, or wine, or eating.
Consider then the condition of the humors before this, if blood is thick with food and drink, and with the physicians: if it is possible for him.
Consider then the bath, if it does not prohibit it: or some exercise is performed, in order to refine the blood.
And make a phlebotomy of him in the chest, about the third of the day, as we have said: and strive that he evacuate his chest from all bad animals: such as distress, and anger, and fear: and from all bodily accidents, such as work, and pain, and luxury, and such like things.
And let his food be such things as are wont to men from aromaticness, and fragrance, and pleasure and such like things, according to the quantity which is possible for him
Then sit the phlebotomist above the knee, which is higher than the knee of the phlebotomist: then extract his arm, and wipe him with the hand of the phlebotomist twice, or three times.</start_of_turn> Then bind the ligament with a bandage, and bind it twice.</start_of_turn>
And let the bandage be temperate, because when the bandage is unequal, or by excess in the bandage, it hinders the course of the blood: or in softening, then it hinders the course of the blood also.</start_of_turn>
Then after the bandage, it is necessary that the phlebotomized man wipe his hand towards his navel, until urine is expelled, and the senses are restored.</start_of_turn>
Then the phlebotomist washes the phlebotomy with a little oil, as is proper.</start_of_turn
Then he places his finger of his left hand on his left knee under the place where he wishes to make the phlebotomy, slightly: so that the urine does not escape, and the blow does not strike.</start_of_turn Because from veins is as much as from intestines like a flying cord at a phlebotomy: and from solids is that which is filled with wind: and when you put a phlebotomy above the solid, it contracts under the phlebotomy, and tears the phlebotomist, and does not open the vein: and if it opens, it is strict. Because of this, it is necessary that the phlebotomist should be firm and attentive in all these matters.
And then let go of the phlebotomy If indeed a vein opens from the wound of one, then that is good. And if not, then do it again in that wound a little lower or a little higher with force: if the place does not swell
Which if it swells, or if the patient becomes pale, then leave him for a day, or two: and do not tie the ligament. Perhaps the swelling will draw out the cold. Neither put on a compress.
And then repeat the phlebotomy if necessary.
Because if the opening is small, or if blood runs slowly: and be mindful that it does not escape from the blood more than is necessary: then repeat the phlebotomy in the same place following the rule, and add a little to the operation
And do it with force, before the place swells, for the swelling is in many people in the operation before.
If indeed you see the place swollen already, then do not repeat over it entirely, for that does not excuse you from doing something else And put on something of the faeces of oil above it: because it will soothe the course of the blood. It is better here than pure oil and than any other oil.
Similarly, apply the fat of oil to every phlebotomy you make, which you do against the course of the blood: and they will make that blood clot, and solidify, when put on one of them over the place
Blood becomes thin and dissolves when it is thick.
If this happens in the place of the phlebotomy after a large opening, for many do this, especially for those who are not phlebotomists except by their own fault, or who have made a small incision, then immediately apply and put over the place a sponge soaked in water and salt, warmed up: and bind it for an hour: for it will dissolve
And it is necessary that you do this after the blood has been let out of the vein itself, with its complement, or from another vein.
If anything remains in the place after a few days black or yellow, it does not harm: and if it does, put over it something of aloe, or myrrh of the simples: or something of the juice of mint, that is, camomile or something similar to that.
And many indeed happen clots and swellings at the phlebotomy of the Basilica.
Put your hand over it then, and if you find softness under your compression over it, then that is bad Because thus you will put over it something which we have said. For perhaps blood will flow out of it from the artery.
But make a plaster of it with that which has styptic properties, so that the place is bound up. Then care for yourself with the rest of the treatment, until you are healed.
It is also necessary to remove all blood from a person according to the quantity of his virtue. And what appears in the blood that is red in colour.
For blood that is black, let it go out, until it becomes red: and in the same way if it is thick: let it go out until it is thinned: and in the same way if it is acute: until its sharpness is gone
And it is necessary for the full, strong, and indigent person to take only one bloodletting, in order to strengthen the one which is being taken out, and to make the phlebotomist wide: and in the one who is weak, let the contrary be done
And it is necessary to take it out in veins, and that the opening should be strict: and it is better that it be administered by the cutting across of a vein, not by puncture
And this method of phlebotomy is safer from the flow of blood, and from cutting nerves: and it is more praiseworthy and safer than phlebotomy by width and length
And whoever has become faint during phlebotomy, it is necessary to give him some bread soaked in pomegranate juice before phlebotomy: or vinegar, if he is feverish: and let him take from the blood in three veins, or four
And if his complexion is pale, let him take before phlebotomy bread soaked in honey syrup, or in scented honey syrup with spices, or in scented fragrant syrup.
If a fainting occurs during phlebotomy, and the cause of it is too much bloodletting: then it is necessary to give in the pot some water with meat, and fragrant syrup: and to mix it with aromatic herbs, and to support his chest with these things: and to do all the things which we said in the chapter on fainting in order to evacuate
Whoever wishes to drain his arm and stop the flow of blood should perform a phlebotomy because of the great evacuation, and his power should be mild so that he may gradually stop the blood in proportion to the amount of power used on a daily basis.
Whoever wishes to drain his arm and stop the flow of blood should perform a phlebotomy since his power is great: let him do this after seven or nine hours of the first phlebotomy.
Whoever wishes to draw blood from his body towards the side opposite to that from which he is leaning: let him do this every second or third day.
In whose body there is much hot and acute blood, which causes fever: let him draw from this blood in a single vessel and extract a great quantity of it: and increase the opening until syncope occurs: after he has restored all the conditions of phlebotomy, and has placed his hand over the pulse of the blood, so that there be no risk of syncope at that place Many times this happens when the phlebotomist is ignorant and neglectful
Neither should he attempt to drain the arm and stop the flow of blood when the orifice of the vein is closed, and when the blood flow is difficult, as he may thereby cause a premature evacuation of the blood exceeding what is necessary, and causing swelling to extend quickly. For indeed that is bad, rather let him leave it alone until the next phlebotomy is performed
Or move with the sharpness of the phlebotomy that which has coagulated from the blood in the vein, and put upon it some dissolved salt in water. And put upon it some of the lard of pork, or rue, and compress it mildly, until the blood has drained out
If indeed the bone has slipped down, then let it go, and do not hold it, until the slipped bone settles.
If indeed the need compels you to drain the blood secondarily, and this is not excusable, then either perform phlebotomy in the same place above the wound, or in the arm or bone elsewhere in the limb.
But as for the veins of the arm, phlebotomy must be performed at the place of the cubital fossa and the elbow, when they cannot be found, for they are hidden, because they are composed of bones.
And the quality of this phlebotomy is that the patient dips his hand into warm water, until the wound turns red, and the bone reappears visible.
Then it should be bound up over the wound with a slight median constriction Then phlebotomy should be repeated gradually across, not along, and neither in length: and let the opening be wide, and your phlebotomy should be as little as that which is done over the nail of the little finger
If it is prohibited that the blood should escape, then repeat the dipping of the hand into warm water, and let the blood run through the water until you achieve your need.
If indeed you are in the summer days, then you are excused from the repetition of dipping the hand into warm water. And most of all, blood is set in warm water in the wintertime.
And this bleeding of this bone is more harmless than all the other bones, because there is no pulsating vein or nerve under it
Phlebotomy indeed of the right hand is equal to the treatment of the liver ailments.
And the quality of this phlebotomy is that you bind the wrist of the hand with a ligament or your hand itself, after you have introduced the hand into the warm water, until the bone swells and the sense of cold disappears Then the phlebotomy is performed across. And if you make the incision completely, it will not cause him any damage in any way.
And take care, do not move your hand with the phlebotomy Beneath it there are naked nerves of the fingers from the flesh.
Then move the hand to warm water, and let the blood flow out of it. For if you do not move it into warm water, the blood will coagulate in the opening of the vein, and will be prohibited from flowing.
When you have extracted from the blood the quantity necessary, then put upon the vein oil and salt: so that it does not harden too quickly.
And in the same way it is necessary to do with every strict limb.
The remedy for the pain of the left hand is: because it is related to the spleen's ailments: and do the same in the phlebotomy of the right hand, just as you did in the second one equally
As for the veins of the phlebotomy, their remedy is for ailments that are in the lower part of the body, such as the ailments of the uterus, and retention of menstruation, and kidney disease, and ulcers of the buttocks and thighs of old age, and similar ailments
And the quality of this phlebotomy is that it allows the sick limb to enter warm water: and make over it friction, until the vein bursts: and bind above the junction of the limb with a bandage And the veins are located at the heel, appearing under the thumb: and they are stretched out from it on the face of the foot of many limbs
The vein is therefore to be taken in a larger branch of itself, or at the heel in its collection: for this is better and safer.
If the vein is taken from the face of the foot, then take care from the nerves that are under it over the face of the foot
And place your vein which you take from the transverse [artery], as though you wish to cut through it: and let the vein be strong.
If, however, the blood is prohibited from coming out, then wet the foot of it in warm water: and let the blood run in the vein until it is evacuated.
If the phlebotomist makes a mistake in the first attempt, then he must go up with the phlebotomy to the upper part, for the place is safe, and it is not necessary to fear from there any harm, when you cut from the nerves, as we have said
And in the same way with the other saphenous vein of the foot.
The veins of the sciatica, however, the place is at the heel from the side of the Achilles.
The cause of the pain of the ankle is because of the cold blood.
The quality of the phlebotomy is that you must make a firm ball, and hurry: and bind up the leg from the side of the ankle up to the heel four fingers, with a fine thread that does not show except for that.
When it appears, then the phlebotomy must be taken according to whatever method is possible to you, or according to the incision: and it is better to cut through the vein by incision, or by section The place is safer, and it is hidden in many men
The place is safer, and it is hidden in many men If it is not to be found [in the veins] and does not appear to the sense: then let a phlebotomy be made of some limb of his, and it will appear in the heel, and will be about the auriculare: and let it be cauteryed from the nerves, and let the blood run out in the quantity which you wish.
Then loosen the tight dressing, and place over the site of the phlebotomy the skin, and bind the place. It will soon heal.
On the subject of bleeding, and the quality of the blood.
The humors are produced from the bodies, and from the air, and from the bile
And the process of bleeding takes place in two ways One is by scarification, and the other by extraction of blood: and the other is bleeding without scarification
And this bleeding which is without scarification is done in two ways Or it is with fire.</start_of_turn> Or without fire.</start_of_turn>
And the humors which are administered with scarification and extraction of blood are fourteen in number in the body.</start_of_turn> Of these, one is the Alnocrati humor, and it is the last of the head: and the Alkehel, and it is in the middle of the neck: and the Alhagdahim humors, and there are two layers of the neck from two parts together: and the menti humor, and it is under the mandible in the lower part of the mouth: and the two spatular humors: and the Alachosos humor is over the end of the tail: and the two focilium humors, and they are in the middle of the two arms: and the two crurium humors: and the two cauillarum humors.</start_of_turn
The wind-pressure does not extract blood from the small veins scattered throughout the flesh, and because of this it does not cause a loss of blood, as is the case with phlebotomy. Neither is it necessary to apply the wind-pressure either with fire or without fire in any ailment which arises from excess, until the whole body has been evacuated.</start_of_turn>
If necessity compels one to use the wind-pressure for an ailment, or by habit, we administer it at the beginning, middle, and end of every month, and whenever it is required.</start_of_turn
For it is in men that when multiplied in blood, until they require its extraction by the wind-pressure, they find in their head their burden, and suffering.</start_of_turn
And from them [the veins] is found swelling and redness in the face, head, and neck.</start_of_turn And from them is found itching in the face, forehead, and temples, and darkness and blurriness in the eyes.</start_of_turn
And from them is found a wound at the site of the wind-pressure.</start_of_turn> And from them is found laughter multiplied.</start_of_turn And from them is found a taste of blood in the mouth: either the tongue is scorched, and blood is spit out.</start_of_turn> And from them is found sleep multiplied.</start_of_turn And from them is found vomiting blood and redness, and boils, and wounds, which are similar to these.</start_of_turn
When we see any of these things, or if it is in the middle of the month: we order that the wind-pressure be done immediately, after two or three hours have passed.</start_of_turn
The application of the Ventouse of the Neck is: because it itself contributes to gravity in the head, and what flows down to the eyes. It should remain in place after the evacuation of the whole body.
This is the place of the Cephalic Venous Cut
It is not allowed to use it on those who are of cold complexion or in whom there is catarrh For it brings on great suffering.
And because of this it must not be used on the elderly, in whom there are cold ailments in the head
But whoever uses it too frequently will generate over it aversion
And because of this it is necessary to give the Ventouse a rest, laying the hand with the instrument away from the lower parts, fearing the generation of aversion
The Ventouse or the Alkehel is the place of the Incision of the Fuscus, and of the Incision of the Basilica, and because of this it brings on asthma, constriction of the chest, and cracking of the instrument, and coughing, and swelling
And it is necessary to apply the Ventouse of the Alkehel loosely, because if it is placed below, it will cause stiffness in the chest and the stomach
The Ventouse is also useful for headaches, ophthalmia, haemorrhoids, perforation, and toothache: it is the place of the Incision of the Basilica.
And it is necessary to command the Ventouse-handler not to advance the hand too quickly with the incision: so as not to cut the artery and cause the flow of blood to be interrupted
The swelling under the chin causes the saliva to be thick in the mouth, and corruption of the gums, and similar ailments which are in the mouth: and it is in the place of phlebotomy which is usually performed on two veins.
The swelling of the tonsils causes the saliva to be thick in the mouth, which results from reflux and heat.
The swelling of the internal parts of the two cavities [pharynx] causes the vomiting of phlegm, saliva and blood, Basilica, Fuse and Cephalus: because these all draw blood from the small veins which are in the flesh, and these small veins are drawn from the other large veins until the attraction reaches the three large veins
It is necessary, with regard to the main cause of the swelling, to limit the extent of the incision: because the place is stripped of flesh, and under it are nerves and blood vessels
The swelling which is caused by the accumulation of air above the tonsils causes haemorrhoids of the anus and lower ulcers.
It is necessary, with regard to the main cause of the swelling, that there be great air, and that it should be pure air: because the place requires strong suction, and perhaps the fine veins will be torn: and a large incision should be made
The swelling of the veins of the limbs diminishes gradually: because they draw blood from the whole body, and cause old pains in the buttocks, in the groin and in the thighs: they provoke menstruation, and cause swelling, and stiffness: and they are in the place of the phlebotomy of the two saphenous veins, and the great saphenous vein.
They actually weaken the body very much, and cause fainting in many people.
The great saphenous vein is near to the two large veins of the limbs.
The quality of the position of the veins is that you should place the swollen part in the first cavity, and perform suction with a tempered degree: and do not prolong the position of the swelling, but place it quickly, and move it quickly, so that the humours may come to their place with equal speed: and do not cease doing this until the swelling has reached its place and become red, and the redness of the blood appears. Then you should scarify, and repeat the suction gradually. Then consider the disposition of the bodies.
For one who has a lean body, little hair, should make the incision once, not more: so as not to wound the place.
And command the surgeon to make the incision wide enough to facilitate the cutting, and not too deep: and to perform the suction with ease and speed, and with his own hand
If there is a thickness in the blood, then it is necessary to make the incision twice In the first instance, the opening is made under the thinness of the blood, and the evacuation of its excess: and in the second instance the accurate extraction of the thick blood is made
If the blood is black and foul, then make the incision a third time: so as to achieve the end
And finally, when we wish to extract the blood gradually or little by little, sufficeth for us one incision If we wish to extract a lot of blood, we make several incisions
If we measure that the blood is thick: then it is necessary to make a deep incision: and the equal endpoint of the incision is the depth of the skin
What should be administered from the oils concerning the position of the veins, and what should be avoided in the swollen part?
When the skin is large, hard, tough, and its pores are narrow, it is necessary to anoint with open oils, soothing, resolving: if it is in summer, such as almond oil, or olive oil, or sweet almond oil, or pumpkin seed oil.
And if it is in winter, then almond oil, or lily oil, or camomile oil, or beeswax: and such like.
If there is excessive moisture, cold: then apply pomegranate oil, or balsam oil, or beeswax, or pine oil: and such like.
If the skin is full of wind and has many pores, tough: then it is necessary to prevent the oil from being absorbed and to wash the area with rose water, or cold water, or warm water, or cucumber water, or fennel water: and such like.
As for the one who has much blood, wash the windings with vinegar, or myrtle water, and sumach: and such like.
As for the one who has thick moisture, wash the wounds with old wine, or fennel water, or gentian decoction, or chamomile: and such like.
It is necessary to cover the wound with a bath, or in a basin, and it is necessary to administer after leaving the bath for an hour, or two hours.
And let no one sleep after the treatment.
What is it that is necessary to do before the treatment, or before the wound is dressed?
And after the treatment, it is necessary to take into consideration in the first place: if the wound is choleric, and if its blood is acute and inflamed: then it is necessary to administer coolness, such as pomegranate seeds: and also fennel with vinegar and lettuce, and chicory, and ivy: and such like.
And put forth its pouls [eggs], and meats of all sorts grow fat, and feed them with barley: thus they are like them.
And if its complexion is cold, it must be given a potion of honey, or aloes, or an infusion of seeds: and give it a moderate scented wine, which is between new and old wine: and it is recommended that it should be used sparingly of food. And put forth its pouls [eggs], and meats: and birds, that is, small birds: and pouls of doves must be made white.
It is necessary that in the diet of those who are in a state of fasting and bleeding, more food should be given than meat: and food should be given in a vessel at some time during the hours of tyriaca alfaroch, or a medicine of musk, that is, muskroot, or alethroot before fasting, or after: in order to comfort the principal parts and to clarify the blood. And it must not be given in a heated drink.
Of vomiting without scarification. And those vomings which are without scarification are the ones which occur over the spleen, and the kidney, and the foot, and over the belly, the navel, and the region of the kidneys: because these parts do not suffer scarification over themself
And it is not asked for in ease, except when there is a wound from a blood vessel to a limb: as we put vomiting over the breasts in the flux of blood from the veins. And we must know that we must remove from a cold limb the coldness which has become unpleasant in the limb: as we put vomiting over the belly and the navel The limb itself does rarefy it, and heats it, and removes the pain thereby, because it resolves the swelling.
It is also placed upon the kidneys, when it happens in the urine, or stone. The urine itself may drive away its attraction, or may drive out the stone from its place.
And it does the same when placed upon the liver and spleen, to restrain the swelling in both of them
These winds are administered with only a small incision And sometimes they are administered with fire.
And sometimes they are administered with warm water in blisters: and this is, that it be applied with a large amount of warm water only, or water in which herbs have been boiled which agree with it.
The form of the wind administered with fire is as follows
Its breadth is two open fingers wide, as we have formed it: and its quantity in depth is half of a palm: and its side is in the middle of it, with a small hole in the middle, according to the quantity of the needle which is to be used: let air issue from it, or from citron, of fine margins, soft, equal, rough: so that it does not damage the limb in its position above it: and there is a transverse wire of gut or iron under the middle of it, upon which the candle is placed with fire.
And thus this swelling is made great, greater than we have narrated, and somewhat less than that, according to the ailments and the age of the one who uses it
The winds of children, and extenuators are other things than the swelling of men, and the swelling of great bodies.
The quality of placing this volatile substance with fire above the limb is that you raise the licence with fire from the centre of the flax, or cause a candle to be alight from the pitch: and place it above the middle of the veins which are in the middle of the swelling. Thus the fire will be surrounded by the lower part of the swelling, without burning the body of the patient.
Then it is placed upon the limb: and the finger rests upon the hole which I mentioned, until the swelling has subsided: while we are waiting, we remove the finger, and the vapour thereupon escapes through that hole, and the swelling is immediately resolved
Then light the licence according to its manner, and do it again, if it has not subsided.
In swelling which is administered with water in a chest wound, there is neither a vein nor a hole: and it is not administered except when it is filled with water, and is placed upon the limb only.
This is its form.
The more spacious the swelling, the better it will absorb the much water
Of the suspension of blood-sugar.
Blood-sugar is not administered in many places, except in those in which it is not possible to position the swellings, because of their multitude, such as the lip and the tongue, and things of that kind. Or on a limb denuded of flesh, such as the finger and the nose, and things of that kind
And the quality of using these things is: as you take from blood-sugar which is in sweet waters, free from putrefaction.
Then they are discharged day and night in sweet water, until the patient is satiated, and nothing remains in their belly Then the body is evacuated first with phlebotomy and with enema. Then the limb of the patient is drained until it turns red Then above it is put on something
When these things are put in, and they fall down, and it is possible to suck out the place with enema: and thus is the ultimate treatment. And if not, then take out the place with vinegar. Then with much water, and friction, and express.
If the course of the blood is prolonged after the evacuation of the blood clots, and that is because of the residue: then pour warm oil on cold water, and put it over it, until the bleeding stops
If blood is multiplied, then sprinkle over it fine sponge or lead, and things like that from styptics: until the bleeding stops.
Or put on the place middle supports of scraped bark: and let go, until the bark sticks to the place, for the blood will stop bleeding.
And it is necessary if necessary to repeat the evacuation of the blood clots, when it is possible, to change the way
But if it is forbidden to evacuate the blood clots by suspension, then drain the place with blood itself Or hold the clot in the place, until something comes out of the blood. Then put something, for when they feel something from the blood, they adhere immediately
When therefore you wish that they should fall down, sprinkle over them something from aloe ground, or salt, or ash: and they will fall down immediately
This chapter is also very necessary in the art of Medicine, and is the restoration of fractures and dislocations of the bones.
Note that many fools and unqualified people speak of this Chapter, who have never read the ancient books or learned anything from them
And because of this, this method is hidden among the sciences in our land. And I have never seen anything good in this, and I am not learned in this from any other, except through the length of reading the ancient books and studying their intellect, from which I have extracted this science from their pages
And I have adhered to experience and the length of my life.
And I have set out for you in this Chapter all that contains my science: and beyond what has passed my experience, after I had abbreviated that which I showed you, and I have abbreviated that in order to abbreviate, and I have formed in it many forms of instruments which are administered in this, as well as the addition of declination, as I did in the two preceding Chapters
Chapter II
It is necessary to say, as we said in the prologue to this Chapter, that the summaries and chapters which precede this, concern the intellect of the first artisan in relation to his station on the truth of things: that is to say, those who are skilled and prompt, know, or are able to add this noble art, and others from you.
I say, therefore, when anything happens to a person, concerning fracture, dislocation, twisting or other cause: it is necessary immediately to resort to drawing out the blood and dissolving it, or both simultaneously: if nothing hinders this, such as weakness of spirit: or is it a person who has happened something from those puer, or an old man decrepitus: or is it a time of heat or of cold to which he is subject.
Then let him be content with his food of bread, cold vegetables, and birds' flesh, and bloodless foods: and let him abstain from wine, and fatty meats, and eat from wholesome foods and every food that fills the veins with blood. Until when he is secure from the heat of the after-sweat, and does not fear the effusion of humors to the limb: then let the patient return to his ordinary regimen as soon as he is accustomed to it.
When, therefore, the fractured bone begins to restore itself, then it is necessary that the patient be nourished with nourishing food in great quantity, coarse, heavy, in which there is viscosity: such as barley bread cooked with water, and raisins, and heads, and feet, and belly-brains, and eggs, and fresh fish: and strong wine, and similar things. With this regimen the coagulation of the fracture will be faster and better.
And know that a fractured bone, when it is in the bodies of those who are in their first old age, and decrepitus, is not possible that they should continue and consolidate according to their natural course, because of the drying up of the limbs: and they consolidate and continue only as much as is in the end of lenity, as for example the bones of young children
However, nature adds upon the fractured bone from every side something like glue, which has greatness, by which it adheres and tightens it, until it is congealed together and bound together, until it comes in the end to strength and firmness, as it was in the beginning, except that nothing hinders it from these operations: and for this reason it is necessary that you give the patient nourishing food of breads, in which there is greatness, and viscosity, and greatness, as we have said
And know this, that the species of fractures are diverse, according to the diversity of limbs: for a fracture of the leg is diverse from a fracture of the head of the skull: and a fracture of the chest is diverse from a fracture of the back: and in like manner all the other limbs are diverse among themselves: and I come with a reminder of every species of fracture exposed in the Chapter which distinguishes them from one another. The species of bone fractures also differ within themselves.
For example, a fracture of the limb is curved, besides which they happen in these bones. And sometimes a fracture occurs according to the length of the bone: and there are fractures of the bone that are associated with cracks, that is, splinters, and protrusions, such as in the thumb, when it is bent with a knife. And not from a wound and disruption in the head: and it is a fracture with a small fissure
And each species has its own ingenuity, or its own instrument for restoration, according to what is recalled of it, distinguished in its places.
And from this it is known what is the fracture of the bone, is its curvature, and its prominence: and its appearance to the sense, and its sound when you compress it with your hand.
When, however, there is no apparent curvature in the place, neither is there any sound at the touch when you touch the bone with your hand, neither is there any great pain: then it is not a fracture, but it is possible that there is a curvature, or a small fissure: it is not therefore necessary to move the limb completely with the hand and compression, but rather to place above it the hands of the physicians, from whom the memory has come, after the moment that this has happened in its place: then the tension will be bound closely
And know that the place when it is bent and split into two, except for that in which they happen together in a cushion, the very thing is moved from its companion: then you must begin from your hour until its rectification, equating it before any aftergrowth comes upon it.
If, however, a callous aftergrowth comes upon it, then postpone it for a few days, until the aftergrowth has subsided. Then equalize it according to any method you can from gentleness and skillfulness.
And know that the restoration of it and its equalization is easier than in bones in which cushions happen together
Then bind it according to what your recollection will remind you of it.
If, however, in a bone there are cushions, then necessary is the expansion of this fractured limb from two parts, if the hand is, or the foot: or with the hand, if the limb is small: or with two strings, or with thread and a hand.
And let your position be such as you place the limb on an equal level, according to its natural figure, until when the parts of the fractured limb are extended: then try to make the additions return to their places with all skill, and according to any method you can in the places: and be careful according to your strength, that you do not cause excessive pain or injury through your operation, and try according to your strength that you apply one of the two bones with its companion, according to the better forms
And it is necessary in this hour that you try and touch your hand If therefore you see anything different there, correct it and equalize it according to the quantity of your virtue.
And the stretching out of the limb is made great, and the compression is strong, as many stones do. As many of them make happen by their work their swollen heel, or by constriction in the limb: as we have seen in their operations many times before
Then bind after the measurement, and loosen the operation, and tighten the limb, and rest, and quiet: and apply the remedy to the patient above all these things. And cause it to cease, that he move not in the hour of his sleep, and his waking at his revolution, and his agitation, and at his egestion, and all his movements his last care And that the position of the limb be not the position in which pain follows. For when he feels pain in the position of the limb, or in the lesion: then it is necessary to change it to another position in which he does not feel pain
And take care of this, that his position be equal, straight: so that no crookedness arise in the limb when it is restored.
And the quality of the tightening of the limb is such as I have said.
You know that broken limbs are diverse in their parts, their magnitude, and their form
Which are of little size, such as the arm, and the finger, and the heel, and things of this kind, then it is necessary to use soft packing, fine. Which are of great size, such as the thigh, and the leg, it is necessary to use broad packing, hard
For the broad ligament, connecting the great limb, and tightening it from all sides with equal force, so that it does not press against it
Then commence after your evacuation by applying a suitable liniment to the fracture, over a soft cushion placed upon the fractured part itself. Then commence by covering the fracture with three or four layers of bandage, as needed for the limb: and tighten the bandage firmly with your hand together with the bandage.
Then apply above the fracture to the upper part, and tighten less than was your previous tightening, which you made at the fracture site Then keep it bound with a covering over the fracture, and gradually soften the tightening, until you have restored to a healthy state a great part of the limb.
Then take another evacuation, and cover it again over the fracture with layers of bandage Then keep it bound with a covering under the fracture And let your operation be in the tightening of the bandage and the softening of it, as we said in the first covering above
Then put between the layers of bandage a soft cushion, or cloth, with which the swelling of the fracture may be equaled if there is swelling in it: and if there is no swelling, do not put anything in it
Then cover the whole again. Then let the outer layers of the bandages rest centered without being tense, if there is no swelling, nor a hard abscess.
If however there is swelling or an abscess in this, then put over that which lies upon the abscess, and drive out the swelling: and give it rest for a few days. Then tighten the whole again
And let the bandages be of middle width, round, and well-shaped: or they may be of wood from which cribri are made, which are made of nail, or twig, that is, palm branches, or twigs: and let the width of every bandage be according to this form and this figure
The Astella which is placed upon the tract itself must be broader and wider than the other Astellae: and its length should be according to the size and proportion of the member.
Then string over the Astellae with another, according to the first stricture which is made.</start_of_turn> Then tie above with wires in the middle, according to what we have said concerning the stricture: that the stricture be greater in the place of the fracture: and the more distant from the fracture the stricture is, the smaller it should be.</start_of_turn
And it is necessary that there be medium-sized wires in thickness and that they be of soft lead.</start_of_turn>
For if the wires are large, like oil from the operation of stolides that are put on, their own cords become twisted: this is a great mistake. For the stricture falls away with the oil outside of its due measure.</start_of_turn>
And thin wires do not suffice either: for you do not follow with the stricture what you wish.</start_of_turn>
And it is not proper that there should be less than a finger space between the Astellae and the Astella.</start_of_turn
For if the patient is bruised at the extremities of the Astellae after the stricture in healthy places: then put under the oil some soft wool, or carmine wool, until nothing is bruised from that.</start_of_turn>
When there is a fracture with a wound, and there is a rupture in the skin, I will remind you of this in the second chapter concerning the singularity.</start_of_turn>
And you know that not every fractured limb needs to be strung with Astellae from the first day.</start_of_turn If a member is large when it becomes inflamed, it is not necessary to place above it as many stars as possible, except after five days, or seven, or more, according to your security from the event of a hot abscess.
This is the mode of dressings which the ancient restorers used to place upon fractures and dislocations.</start_of_turn>
A common mode of dressing which restores fractures is suitable for many complexions, especially women and children: because it does not irritate either heat or cold.</start_of_turn>
Take from the flour-mill dust, and it is the marrow of wheat which hangs in the bowels of the mill beside the running stone: and make it as before, except that you put grease under it with alum: and put the confection not thick, neither thin.</start_of_turn Then use it as before.</start_of_turn>
Another mode of dressing which restores fractures, dislocations, and torsion.</start_of_turn A recipe of meal, and laurel, and acacia, and enula, and mugwort: and juice of all of them mixed with X myrrh, and five aloes, and twenty alethil: mix them all together, and grease them, and mix with warm water: or with alum, if the complexion of the patient is hot.</start_of_turn Then use this dressing.</start_of_turn For it is a good composition, it restores broken bones quickly, and benefits many people.</start_of_turn
Another mode of dressing which also benefits fractures and torsions.</start_of_turn A recipe of mugwort, and meal, and white alum, of all of them mixed with X myrrh, and five aloes, and six bowls of Armenian bole, and twenty parts of grease: mix them all together, and grease them, and make them with water, or with alum. Administer them.</start_of_turn
The mode of plaster for uniting joints, and bones separated from their places: but it soothes the pain of the accident, and cuts the bone, and fractures it. Let there be applied a soft wool, and be dipped in vinegar, and decocted wax: and be placed over the place.
And in this plaster there is no power of restoration, but it is good in the sedation of the after-heat: and drives away the pains themselves.
The mode of plaster which restores the fractured bone. Take leaves of fennel thick, and leaves of trefoil-sage rough: and all together, make plaster from both of them
The mode of abbreviated plaster, administered at the time of restoration of the fracture of the bone: and when you wish the resolution of the remaining after-heat. Recipe of the root of saffron, and chamomile, and the flowers of violets, and barley flour, all together make up one part: they are pounded together with wine, if there is no warmed limb.
If however there is a warmed limb, then mix this with moist grape juice, or with water, and use it thus.
Another mode of plaster which is stronger for the resolution, than the first one, when there happens a hard after-heat at the time of restoration of the limb. Recipe of the root of saffron, and flaxseed, and barley, and honey, and rue, and violets, and chamomile, all together make up one part: they are pounded together with salt water, or with sweet water, or with wine The whole of this is according to the heat of the limb, and the quiet of the heat of it.
Hippocrates has not said in his book that anything is placed upon a fractured limb during its restoration, except for a weight made of lead or stone: nothing else. He has also narrated that the size should be intermediate between the gross and subtle.
However, Galen deems it useful to place upon a fractured limb during its restoration various substances which contain the exication of heat, such as myrrh, aloes and olibanum, and the like of these things which we have mentioned.
The manner in which the plaster contributes to the healing of the wound and the reduction of pain. A recipe of mugwort, cicer, human hair clippings, or feathers of birds, alum, and salt in equal parts: they are pounded, and crushed, and formed into a plaster
The quantity, however, should be such that the ligature remains, afterwards it is to be dissolved, that is to say, as you observe, if it does not happen that the sick person experiences neither pain, nor itching, nor swelling of the fractured limb from its place: then do not dissolve it for many days If it happens to him in the place of itching or burning, or pain: then act promptly, and dissolve it in an hour, and remove the plaster from it: and take a soft cloth, or a sponge soaked in warm water, and wipe it with it, until the itching ceases, and the pain is gone.
If it happens to him in the place of itching or burning, or pain: then act promptly, and dissolve it in an hour, and remove the plaster from it: and take a soft cloth, or a sponge soaked in warm water, and wipe it with it, until the itching ceases, and the pain is gone. Then let the limb rest for an hour. Then place upon it a dry fleece, immersed in vinegar and oil, or in rose oil: and bind over it at night one, until you are secure from the heat of the after-burn, and the swelling of the limb is relieved, and the pain is gone
Then repeat it to slight tension, and a small plaster: and do not bind it too tightly at the beginning, but rather gradually with it.
If swelling, pus, redness, pain, inflation, and all other incidents have subsided, and if the swelling and stricture remain, repeat the treatment as you did at the beginning equally.
If no limb has resulted from the things we mentioned, do not treat it until after three, or four, or five, or seven days When twenty days have passed and the limb has healed as it appeared from the solution of the limb, as we mentioned, until the fracture has joined and blood clotting has approximated the meat: then add stricture more than the first stricture throughout. Add also more than the usual diet of a sick person, according as the memory of it has returned
If, however, the swelling has gone down from the fracture, and has extended more than necessary: then you know that nutrition is hindered from reaching it. Smear it therefore with warm water over all the parts which you have healed, and keep it wet for three days, and relieve the stricture gently.
By this operation the limb receives nutrition, and will recover quickly.
What they do who are making the restoration of the limb from the fracture with other things, when they have not restored it in the first place according to what is necessary, and restore it according to its crookedness, is an error of their operation, and great fear: and if it is right, the ancient men said so in their books, and they operated with me on this occasion.
I have never seen any of those things in this in my life, and it is better that it should not be done like that.
Of the treatment of an accident in the head.
The varieties of fractures are diverse, and their forms are many: their causes are distinct.
For a fracture is that which is done by impact with a weapon: and the impact drives the whole bone until it reaches the pith, which is under the bone, as does the axis in wood: and because of this it is called the Axialis fracture
Or a weapon strikes something of the bone, and strikes its face, and does not penetrate to the end of it: and this is called the Kalaan fracture, that is, complete fracture
And there are two kinds of fracture, or a great one, or a small one.
And a fracture is also a break, or a tear: and its cause is impact with a stone, or a fall from a height, or something similar.
And this kind of fracture is also penetrating, which approaches the nerve, which is under the bone: or is in the face of the bone: and this is also a wound of the two kinds of fracture, whether great or small
And there is also a fracture which is hidden in the bone in the thickness of the hair: and it is a small fracture, and because of this it is called the Capillaris fracture.
And there is also a fracture which is caused by a blow, or by the impact of a stone, or by things of a similar kind, which make the lamina of the bone break inwards, and makes a concavity: like when there is an impact of air bubbles, and some of them enter inwards
And this most often happens in the heads of soft bones, such as the heads of children.
And all these varieties of fracture are distinct from each other, and I shall remind you of all of them in their place.
We recognize all varieties of fracture through their detection above the surface, their inquiry with tension, and the excision of corrupted flesh that lies above them.
All varieties of fracture are recognized by this, for it detects them above the bone, ablates them, and binds them above the surrounding tissue: for the fracture appears black thus.
In the treatment of fracture, consider first the signs of the disease: then, if you see signs that signify their seriousness above fear, such as vomiting of bile, swelling, loss of consciousness, and loss of speech, and fainting, and acute fever, and discharge from the eyes, and redness of the skin, and similar things from many diseases in various positions, it is most likely that they will not recover: and if you do not see serious signs of the disease, and you hope for recovery: then begin the treatment of it.
If a wound comes to you at first with the wound: and that is in winter days, then it is necessary to study the excision of the bone before the fourteenth day of the month in every case
If it is in summer days, then it is necessary to take care to remove the bone before the seventh day, before it is corrupted which is under the nail, and these things happen from the wound
If a fracture of the bone has come to remain at the nail touching the brain, and it is slight, and with tension: then it is necessary to cut away the portion that is split and torn, and to draw it out, according to what I have told you
It is necessary to grasp the head of the wound: and to detect above the bone according to every possible method: and according to the form of the wound, and what lies above the patient.
If then blood flows from an exposed bone, or if a swelling becomes stiff: then oppose it with that which is proper. If then blood flows from an exposed bone, or if a swelling becomes stiff: then oppose it with that which is proper. If then blood flows from an exposed bone, or if a swelling becomes stiff: then oppose it with that which is proper. Then begin the treatment of the bone and its removal.
And this is done according to one of two methods.
One method is to cut the bone with a pointed chisel: this is its form
And the other method is to use another chisel after the first one, which is somewhat wider: this is its form
And then use another chisel which is wider still.
And the second method is to have several chisels of different sizes: some of which are wider than others, and some are narrower than others: and let the sharpest ends be at the last. Let them be of iron or steel, and use them easily on the chisel, so that it does not break and damage it.
If the bone is strong and hard: then it is necessary to drill around it before using the chisels, with needles which are called non-penetrating needles: and they are not called thus except when they do not penetrate the substance of the bone beyond that which is before them: because the needle is a rounded extremity above that which is under the acute angle, similar to the margin, and a narrow circle hinders the immersion, and the penetration of the thickness of the bone
And it is suitable for you to take many of these needles, whose number corresponds to the thickness of the bone, until the needle is present throughout the circumference: whose acute end measures in length and width the quantity of the thickness of that circumference
This is the form of the three kinds of trephines.
The quality of the perforation round about a fractured bone is thus: put a trephine upon the bone and rotate it with your fingers until you know that the bone has been pierced.</start_of_turn> Then turn the trephine to another place and put what is between every hole the quantity of the diameter of the radius, or round about that.</start_of_turn>
Then cut with the scissors which are between every hole in the bone: and do this more subtly than the thickness of the bone from its end to its middle, as we have said, until you have pierced the bone, or your hand, or anything else from which you wish to remove the bone.</start_of_turn>
And it is necessary to take care, lest you touch the trephine or the scissors with your fingers.</start_of_turn
When you have finished perforating the bone and it is separated from the surrounding tissue, if it is still connected with it, you must grasp it with another instrument like a scissors and extract it. It is necessary to ligate and equalize the extremities of it which remain in the bone with another instrument like a scissor.</start_of_turn> Indeed, it is necessary that the scissors be thin and fine like other scissors.</start_of_turn
If there remains anything of the small bones and fragments: grasp them with ease with the help of those things which are beside you among the instruments.</start_of_turn Then take care of the wound afterwards with oil and the unguents which we have mentioned.</start_of_turn
And another way of performing the operation is easy, above all far from fear: which Galenus praised highly and praised him for: and this is his saying.</start_of_turn It is necessary first of all that you begin to remove a part of the bone from the place where the fracture is most severe and evident: until you have removed that part and placed it under the extremity of the incisor which has this shape.
The blunt part of the lens does not bite into anything: and its acute part on its two sides is wide in length, like liquid: so that the blunt part of the lens lies close to the sac, with its acute part on the bone.
Then pierce through the incisor from one side with a small hammer, until you have fractured the whole bone easily, as it turns: and you will be secure from the nail, which does not occur in this case, which you feared beforehand.
And if the physician is not stupid among men, and is not ignorant of this, or is not sleeping, then if anything remains attached to the bone from the nail in some place, he will remove it from that with the extremity of the incisor which has this shape, and will free it from that easily It is freed from that without pain, and without fear.
And if the fracture of the bone does not reach the nail, and that which is broken off from the bone is its surface, and remains in the same with its roughness and slight corrugations: then it is necessary, that you should smooth that roughness, and remove those corrugations with fine files of various quantities, so that it is possible to manage it in every place more conveniently, and to make it more straight, according to that which leads you to perform the operation, and the fractured bone itself, and its shape. And you must manage with your reason that which in the beginning you ground the bone, wider of those files. Then use the finer afterwards.
And you must manage with your reason that which in the beginning you ground the bone, wider of those files. Then use the finer afterwards. Then do not cease doing that until you have completed it thoroughly, until you have reached the point of administering the finer things of all these things
In every wound whatsoever, after the large veins and arteries have been closed, take care of the smaller veins and hair-like splinters, for these must be treated with the greatest care and precision in order to restore them to their natural state.
For this is a matter which does not lie hidden from anyone who has studied this art, and it has been placed before you in the preceding sections, and we shall speak of it in great fractures.
If, however, a clot is detected when you dilate the bone: then you must take hold of the clot by means of a linen bandage, according to the size of the wound, and immerse it in warm oil, and place it over the opening of the wound Then take another bandage, either doubled or tripled, and immerse it in wine and warm oil, and place it over the first bandage: and make it as easy as possible for the patient to swallow
Then administer above it the broad ligament: and do not tighten it up, except for the amount that will suffice to hold the wound together: and remove it in one or two days, when you are sure that the wound is no longer liable to bleed. Then dress it, and afterwards administer these medicines which are appropriate for such a wound: such as the roots of lilies, and the flour of herbs, and barley flour, and violets, and asparagus: and it is necessary to make from these medicines a powder which you will sprinkle over the wound like dry things.
And in general, administer all medicines which have the property of drying out, and which will not bite And take care also according to your skill, that the limb be limp in your care: neither shall there be in it any slippery moisture, neither any pus.
And take care also according to your skill, that the limb be limp in your care: neither shall there be in it any slippery moisture, neither any pus. Neither let you permit the collection of pus in it altogether: for when pus is collected upon the brain, it corrupts it, and causes it to putrefy, and brings about great harm: and this happens especially when its care is neglected.
Therefore, if such accidents happen to the patient, as we have mentioned, you know that it is perilous to delay treatment.
And if no blackness appears, except for the medicine which is applied to it, and it is in the skill of that medicine, that it should cause blackness: then you must take from the honey a portion of one, from the rose-water three portions, and lines with it as with a bandage. Then apply it to the wound: afterwards take care of it with the species of treatment which are suitable, until it is healed.
Of the restoration of the nose when it is fractured.
You know that the nose is not fractured except for two of its upper parts simultaneously, or one of them: because these are two bones: for the lower part of it is cartilaginous and does not fracture, and does not happen to it except for attrition, and twisting, and similar things.
If one of the two parts is fractured, then you must insert your little finger into the nostril, and equalize the fracture with your index finger, and the thumb bent outwards, until the nose returns to its natural shape: and do this skillfully, with ease And take heed, let not the operation exceed the patient's pain.
If the fracture be in the upper part of the nose, and not reach to the finger: then it is necessary, that it be equalized in the extremity of the radius, where there is little swelling.
If indeed the fracture be in two parts, then do thus: and establish like that the restoration of its first day, if it be possible. And if not, then after the seventh or tenth day from the quiet of the after-ache.
Then introduce into the extremity of the nose a cloth bandage of linen, if the fracture be in one part: or introduce two bandages if the fracture be in two parts: and let there be in the bandage such a quantity of swelling as to fill the nose's hole.
And certain of the ancient restorers say, that they are to be poured into butter, and to be changed every day. This indeed does not seem to me, but rather it is necessary, that it be poured into alum or meal with pounded flour Then remove the bandage, when the bone has become firm, and let there remain cartilage.
When indeed it is introduced into the Nose in place of the bandage a feather pen: after it is covered over with a soft cushion: and it is done, that the fracture of the Nose is held more firmly, and that the patient does not be hindered by his inspiration.
This is not necessary If you will, do thus: or if you will, do bandages.
If indeed the Nose should happen again while you are working after the after-ache, plaster the nose with wax, or with fat broth boiled in rose oil, or with some salve from the aconitum plant
If, however, the swelling does not subside, then it is necessary to apply a paste of barley flour and coarse flour mixed with urine or vinegar. Then put upon it a soft bandage, and do not bind the nose to anything whatsoever.
If the bones of the nose are fractured by a small break or fracture, or if they are displaced, then it is necessary to break through above them and extract them with the instruments that are appropriate for the case. Then cut around them, and care for the wound with that which nourishes it, and consolidates it with the patches that are suitable for this, or with ointment.
If there is a wound between the nose and the lip, then it is necessary to care for it with poultices: and give her a lead pipe until she is healed.
Concerning the restoration of the lower jaw when it is fractured
When the lower jaw is fractured and its fracture is not associated with a wound: then look to see if its fracture is only lateral and not fractured into two pieces, and care for the interior; then its knowledge is easy.
It is necessary therefore, if the fracture is on the right side, to insert the index finger of the left hand into the fracture: in the same way if the fracture is on the left side, then insert the index finger of the right hand: and push with this the prominence of the fracture inwards with ease from the outside with your other hand, and with this equalize the same
If the fracture of the jaw has been completely separated into two pieces, then it is necessary to administer an extension from both parts, according to the rule of proportionality: until the equilibrium of the same is possible
If, however, displacement or rupture should occur in the teeth, either loosening or breaking them: then bind those which you hope will remain with gold thread, or silver, or silk. Then place above the fractured jaw a pad.</start_of_turn> Then place above it a doubled cloth pad, and place above the pad a large sponge shaped in the middle: or an equal piece of skin sole, as long as the jaw.</start_of_turn>
Then bind it up above, according to what is prepared of its ligation, and join its application, until it is not destroyed: and command the patient to rest quietly: and give him soft food.</start_of_turn
If, however, you think that something has changed in the figure or mode: then treat it, and heal it on the third day.</start_of_turn> Then rectify what has been altered from it, and plaster it with pounded barley, with alum or with millet flour, after you have removed the pad: and place above the plaster a soft wool.</start_of_turn
While therefore the plaster remains attached to this, and the bone position is not altered, remove it, do not dissolve it, until the fracture has healed: or bind the fracture.</start_of_turn Many times this fracture is bound in three weeks.</start_of_turn
If in the meantime a hard swelling should occur, then manage it as we have said many times in its sedation, until that swelling is removed.</start_of_turn
And if the fracture is with a wound, consider.</start_of_turn For if it is separated from the bone fragment, or from the suture: then take care of it in this way, so that you join the fragment of the suture with that which coincides with it in the ablation of these from instruments.</start_of_turn
If the opening of the wound is narrow, then enlarge it with a lancet according to the quantity of necessity.
When you have removed the foreign body and there is nothing remaining, then enlarge the opening of the wound if it is wide: and if it is not, place over it patches which are suitable for that, and pressing them down, until it is healed.</start_of_turn>
When the clamp is fractured, restore it.</start_of_turn>
It is most frequent that the clamp fractures from the front part towards the humerus, and its fracture is made in accordance with one of three modes.</start_of_turn
Or it fractures and separates into two, besides which it is accompanied by these foreign bodies: and it is easier to restore it.</start_of_turn
Or it is accompanied by bone splinters: and this is more difficult to restore.</start_of_turn
Or it is a fracture with a wound.</start_of_turn
And the operation in the case where the fracture is without a wound, is that you make two assistants present, one of whom holds the fractured clamp, and the other extends the limb above the part.</start_of_turn
Then equalise the fracture with your fingers, until it takes its natural shape, according to what is necessary: and do not leave it prominent or concave.</start_of_turn
If it does not suffice with extension alone, then it is necessary to place under the patient's chin a sphere of lint, or a lancet: and let the size of it be according to the quantity of necessity. And extend and elevate the clamp, and cover the sphere with your hand, until the fracture is equal, according to what is necessary.</start_of_turn
If the thumb cannot be drawn outwards from the wrist: because it has gone too deep: then it is necessary that the patient be placed upon his chest: and you put under the armpit of him the middle finger of his hand in size, and stretch his arm down, until the bone of the wrist which is in the depth has been elevated: and then straighten the fracture, and make equal the two bones of your fingers.
If, however, you feel pain from the wrist, and it is moving: then it is necessary that you find above that and draw it outwards with ease.</start_of_turn>
If, however, it is retained in the bone, then you will make an incision in its bone with one of the saws that you have prepared for this purpose: after you have placed under the wrist the instrument which will protect the pulp.</start_of_turn> This is its form.</start_of_turn>
It is like a spiral which has no cavity.</start_of_turn>
And its breadth is according to the size of the bone, and its thickness.</start_of_turn Its length is also according to what is possible for you in the operation.</start_of_turn
And it has two extremities, like wings: and one extremity is wide, and the other is narrow.</start_of_turn
If, however, the disruption of the wound which you cut when you drew out the pain of the bone, is wide, and you secure it with a warm dressing: then you will join together the two lips of the wound with a suture.</start_of_turn
And if the disruption is small, or sometimes there is a soft swelling: then you will close the wound with stitches, and with pieces of lint according to the quantity of the wound.</start_of_turn
If the abscess is hard, then infuse oil of roses, aceto, and wine upon it and place above it.
If the abscess is without wound, and without incision, then place above the bone a plaster made of ground flour with alum or egg white And put a soft cushion above it. Then put a sphere under its handle if it is stiff. Then take a sponge, which is that which the Saracens hold, which is long like a palm of the hand, or about that. Then place a doubled cloth over the cushion and the plaster. Then take a needle from a thin board, whose width is three fingers, and as long as that. Then pass the thread through the cloth. Then pass the oil of roses with the needle in the place where the fracture falls and the swelling lies.<start-of-turn> Then place the swelling over the fracture as if rolling it up, and pass the thread over its neck and under the healthy side and under the side that is swollen: and reduce the oil above every part, and as much as the fracture is tight, for the oil covers the fracture without uncovering the needle from the fractured bone. And because of this the swelling must be squeezed every day. Whenever the ligament is softened, and the needle is to be removed, then straighten it up and bind the ligament again.<start-of-turn>
Then place the patient to sleep on his back, and put under his chin in the night a few small cushions so that when he wakes up his attendants may lift him up from that side. The fracture of the wrist shall be elevated by elevation of the arm.
The limb shall be bound to the chest: and do not loosen the ligaments, except in the place where the wound is urgent, or from a swelling, for up to twelve days.
Then renew the dressing, if you see the face of it toward that. And keep it firm, and let it go, until it has healed and coagulated.
And the fracture of the wrist is bound and comforted according to most in eighty days: and when it has healed in any man in less time.
About the restoration of the fracture of the Spatula
Rarely does the Spatula break, and in its wide place: and they do not break from it except for the edges of it.
When therefore it breaks from that place, and breaks in the middle of it, and it is not known except by touch: then try to prepare it according to the figure of the fracture. And reduce it above the natural figure in every way of ingenuity, which is possible.
Then put upon the place powder of fine flour with alum, and a soft cushion, and put upon it a piece of cloth doubled. Then put upon it a wide bandage from a thin board according to the quantity of the whole Spatula, or make it slightly wider.
If indeed under the bandage there is a concavity in any place of the Spatula, then equal it with the cushion of soft material until the bandage descends according to equality
Then tighten the ligature above with the thumb, constriction moderate, and the thumb firm, until it does not move from its place.
Consider the ligament every day. Howsoever often the ligament is softened, tighten it again, and if it moves from its place, let the patient lie with the diseased side up.
The spatula should be restored in twenty days, or in twenty-five days.
When this time has elapsed, then remove the ligature: and you will be secure. For the bones from which the articulation is composed do not dislocate immediately, nor are they easily separated
If, however, it proceeds from a fractured bone, and projects under the skin: then split above it, and remove it.</start_of_turn> And do as we have said concerning the fracture of the collarbone from the softening of the after-boil, if anything arises from that.</start_of_turn>
(The text continues with instructions for treating a fracture of the breastbone.)
The breastbone sometimes fractures in the middle, and this is rare.</start_of_turn> The extremities of it are most often fractured, and are broken by its accidents.</start_of_turn
When it fractures in the middle, which inclines downwards, and if there is pain, difficulty in swallowing, and coughing: and perhaps vomiting of blood, and a displacement of the fractured bone which is not concealed by the sense. The restoration of it is that the patient lies on his back: and place two spatulas between his thumbs.</start_of_turn
Then first of all grasp the humerus of it, and bring the back together from two parts or from two sides with the hands: and subtilize in its equilibrium, according to every possible way and as it is convenient, until the figure of the bone returns, according to what is necessary.
Then place upon it a dressing and a pad, and place above it a small star from a board of thin cypress or acacia, and from lead or like substances in the flesh, after you have bound up the wound in cloth Then subtilize in binding up the wound above the fractured bone, so that it does not move: and keep it firm with a bandage according to the extent of the wound, and bind it tightly enough
Then consider the binding at all times, and every time it is relaxed, tighten it: and if its necessity shows itself to demand its solution at the itching, or corrosion which occurs in the place, or pain, or swelling: then rectify it, and solve the wound, and remove the dressing, and restore what has happened in the way of its treatment.
Then reduce the dressing, if you are able to do this to the face: and bind it tightly, until it is healed.
Regarding the restoration of the back when it is fractured.
You know that a fracture of the back does not happen except in large places which follow the back, and from the extremities of it from the anterior part. And it does not happen except by chance, because they are cartilaginous And its knowledge is not hidden from sense in the inquiry with the fingers
And its restoration is done in this way, that it is equal to the fracture with the fingers according to every possible way, until the figure is equal, according to what is necessary Then plaster it on, and bind the fractured bone with a staple, if necessary.
If the fracture of the ribs has descended inwards: then it happens to the patient that he feels severe pain and swelling, and puncture, just as it happens to him who has pleura: because the bone is pressing on the lung, and also happens to him difficulty in breathing, and coughing, and vomiting of blood: and this is a difficult cure.
And the old ones are ingenious in this with many devices: and some of them say that you should put on the patient nourishing substances that generate inflammation and swelling, so that the belly inflates, and expands, and drives out the fracture outwards
We indeed abhor that it should be the cause of making the scab callous, if it does not happen. But if it does happen, then add to it in this way.
And some of them say: put on over the swelling place, then bind it with force, and it is similar to the proportioning. However, they are afraid that it will draw out the swelling too much to the place, because of the disposition of the fracture.
And some of them say: it is necessary that the place should cooperate with the bandage which is already submerged in warm wax: and they put in between the ribs little pills until it is firm: so that there is an equal ligation when you wrap around it according to the circumference
Then care for the patient with the cure of the pleura from food and medicine.
That if it tightens the patient excessively causing him to swell, and the bone is pressing on the lung puncturing it with pain, and we fear over the patient: then it is necessary that we split open over the place and take out the fractured rib.</start_of_turn> Then we place above it the instrument which preserves the moisture, whose reminder precedes it: and we break the bone easily, and break it.
Then we join together two lips of the wound, if it is large with a suture: and we care for it with sponges, until it is healed.</start_of_turn>
If in the meantime a blood clot forms, then stop it, and pour in sponges into the wound, and place above it: and care for the patient with what is suitable for the clot.</start_of_turn>
Also during this time the patient rests on the side on which he sleeps, until he is healed.</start_of_turn
On the restoration of fractures of the spine and the neck.</start_of_turn
The bones of the neck sometimes suffer fracture, and rarely from attrition: and similarly the vertebrae of the back also.</start_of_turn When this happens to anyone, and you do not know whether he is healed or not: then be still.</start_of_turn For indeed if you move his hand violently, and swell it, and cause him to die: and you cannot move it easily, neither extend it nor contract it: and when you do contract it with your fingers and pull it with a hook, he does not feel any pain, neither does he feel any numbness: then you know that he is not healed, and that it is mortal.</start_of_turn
When he moves it, and feels in it a constriction with the fingers and a puncture: then you know that the bone is soundly healed, and that the patient will be healed with care.</start_of_turn
When the vertebrae of the back suffer in the same way, and you do not know whether he is healed or not: then consider his feet: then if you find that they are softened, and that this happens in both hands: then when he lies down on his back, the swelling and discharge will go away without his will: and when he lies down on his belly, the discharge will go away without his will: and when he lies down on his back and wants to move, and cannot: then you know that it is mortal.</start_of_turn He does not work in his care.
If he does not succeed in this, the matter is easier.
His care of it is that which comes from this, as you will make a poultice with dry mustard and apply it over the Spondilam with only olive oil: or with some saffron or asafoetida.
You should put some of this on every day, until the swelling has subsided: then put on one of the healing and soothing patches on the place, and tie over it with a bandage: and tell the patient to rest quietly and peacefully He should not sleep over the part which is causing him pain, until he is healed.</start_of_turn>
If anything happens at the sawing of the bone of the knee, or if anything is separated from it: then it is necessary to remove it from the skin, and to anoint it.</start_of_turn> Then join together two lips of the wound, if it is large, with a suture.</start_of_turn> Then care for it with some nourishment, from unguents, until it is healed.</start_of_turn>
If indeed the heel bone is fractured, and is at the end of the heel: then it is necessary to insert the little finger of the left hand into the hole, and to alter the broken bone, as much as possible, and to reduce it by an equal measure.</start_of_turn
Then put on a bandage, and lift it up: and care for the wound with the care which has preceded, until it is healed.</start_of_turn
Of the restoration of the ankle.</start_of_turn
Chapter 11.</start_of_turn>
Rarely do the bones of Anchari fracture. If they do break, the fracture of them is not, except for the breaking in two at the extremities: for they break along their length and bend inwards: and thereby arises the pain in the place, and the puncture: and the limb becomes stiff where it has fractured.
And the restoration of it is like extending your hand over it, until you are over the fracture in the manner of its shape
If the fracture is only at the extremities, then equal it with the fracture, according as it is prepared for you, until they are alike in shape again.
If, however, the fracture is along its length, or if it bends inwards: then make the patient lie down upon his belly, until the restoration of the fracture is prepared for him. When you have equalised it, put upon it a dressing: then put upon it a bandage of wood, or of skin: and bind tightly what you do not wish to slip from the fracture, or to remove the bandage
And equal the concavity of them with that which supports it, until it bears the bandage firmly according to the equality: and command the patient to lie upon his back, or upon his side.
If, however, there should arise to him a cold swelling: then cease from its extension, and from its restoration, until the swelling has subsided: and place upon it what has subsided, according as before, then return to the restoration of it: and bind it as you think best
If, however, there should occur in the bone a swelling, or a break, extract it.
On the restoration of fractures of the surgeons.
The aid is that which is between the armpit and the head of the spatula.
If it is fractured, then its restoration is according to one of two methods.
One of them is: take a flat piece of wood of medium thickness, according to this shape which follows
And two ligatures are bound at the two extremities
Then it is suspended from a high place: and the patient sits on a seat Then he projects his arm with the fracture over the wood, until it reaches its elbow, in which there is an attached piece of wood.
Then suspend something heavy from above, so that it extends the minister to the lower parts. Then the doctor will equal the fracture with his hands at the same time, until the fracture returns, as it should
And the other method is that the patient lies on his chest: and suspend his arm from the neck with a ligature Then command two assistants, that one of them hold that which is above the fracture with his hands: and that the other hold the lower one, and extend each of them to their part
And if desired, so that the extension is stronger, then string under the fracture with a ligature, and above with another ligature: and extend each of them to their two parts
If the fracture is close to the elbow, then it is necessary to put one ligature under the elbow and another under the fracture near the armpit
And in the same way if the fracture is close to the shoulder: then it is necessary to put a ligament above the place and above the shoulder itself
Then let the fracture be equal with ease without toil, until the fracture be equal in proportion as it should be, and applied with a good application: then tighten it up, if the after-effect does not occur with a cold compress.
If indeed a warm after-effect occurs, then loosen the tightening up until the seventh day. And put above it a soaked lambskin in vinegar and salt, until the after-effect is quiet: then tighten it up: and the manner of tightening is that you place a dressing over the fracture.
Then place a new bandage over the dressing Then join the arm to the aid, and place your hand open over your shoulder
And put on a sheet, and tighten over the arm, so that the arm rests in the place of the bones: if it does not prevent you from anything from that, neither alter anything from you anything of the fractured bone
Which if at any time anything is altered from you concerning the fractured bone, then use greater and stronger pins than the others. And place between every pin a breadth of a finger: and let the length of the pins be according to the fracture with the addition of three fingers from every side
Then tighten over the pins the tightening as I said at the beginning of the chapter.
And let your tightening be more strict in the place of the fracture And the more the fracture is prolonged, the less should the tightening be
If therefore you have placed the pins and the tightening as we have said, when you restore the limb immediately, then do so: and if at any time a warm after-effect occurs, then loosen the tightening and the pins until the seventh day, as we have said.
Consider the ligament in every three days, that it does not become inflamed in the place of itching, or swelling, or that it impede the passage of food to the limb, because of the arrangement of excessive tension. Act accordingly in this matter, as we have said before
If you are certain that nothing harmful will result from it, then do not divide the ligament except after three days, or more
Let the patient rest on his back, with his hand on his stomach: and place under his support a cushion filled equally with wool.
Consider at all times of the night or day, that the limb is not fractured, or the ligament is not loosened Act accordingly in this matter with your will
Place food for the patient according to the order we have given: let the food be soft at first, until the bone begins to mend: then it must be given that he gradually increases his food intake
In the habit of the attendants and the limb, it is necessary to bind in forty days: then it must be loosened, and a bath must be administered, and remedies must be used which restore it
If the fracture had been open and dirty: do not divide the ligament and the bones until fifty days have elapsed, and until two months have passed
On the restoration of the fracture of the arm
The arm is composed of two bones, which are named the two radii
One of them is the forearm: and that which follows the thumb And another is great, which is that which is placed under a small one from the lower part.
Perhaps therefore the larger bone breaks only, or the small: and perhaps they break together.
When therefore the small bone above breaks, then its restoration is easy, and its healing is more convenient
And when the lower bone breaks, its fracture is bad, and its healing is difficult.
And it is worse when two bones break together.
If therefore the bone which breaks is a small one above, then the doctor will agree concerning its restoration, that he put the projection of the small bone with ease, until it is equal to it.
If however the large bone is that which is broken: then it is necessary to put on a stronger bandage above all
And it is necessary to put the hand in its natural position during its restoration, and the hand's extension beyond the knuckles And let the thumb of the hand be above the others, and let the lower articulation be over all the fingers, or over the rest: and the patient should sit with his buttocks square on himself, and let the knuckles face towards him, or be in a straight line, in height, so that the patient does not suffer any labor
Then extend the arm from the lower part, or the hand itself, or with the ligament. And the other limb extends in the same way from above
Then the doctor will equal the bones, until he has reduced them to a better figure than possible
And if there are any gaps in the fracture of the bone, then attempt to reduce them in their place without movement
If indeed it appears in that place a separate swelling which pierces the skin, and there is no hope of restoring it: then find above that and remove it according to the manner which we have said before.
If however the fracture is with a wound, I make for that a separate incision, therefore take care of that from that point on.</start_of_turn>
When in the beginning of your restoration of the swelling there is a hard swelling, then draw the skin with a burnished needle with a round head, and silver, and let the middle be between the thickness and the smoothness: and tighten the skin above it tightly, until the swelling is settled: then remove the burnished needle and place a prepared dressing over it made from ground barley with albumen or oil.</start_of_turn> Then put sponges, and let the sponge which is placed over the fracture itself be wider and stronger.</start_of_turn>
And you know that the number of sponges for the arm is six in various positions: if the fracture is in one socket, or in two sockets at the same time.</start_of_turn>
Then put on your bandage the stronger and firmer place over the fracture, and somewhat more with the bandage to the upper part of the fracture, or to the lower part of it: or put on a softer bandage than the previous one, according as the memory of the fracture requires at the beginning of the head.</start_of_turn
And let there be cloths which cover the fracture, soft cloths, wet: and not hard, rough.</start_of_turn And let the thread which is used to suture be of its own kind, medium between fine and coarse, as we have said.</start_of_turn
And consider the limb and the ligament after days.</start_of_turn> If anything occurs whose rectification is necessary, such as itching that occurs in a limb: then it is necessary to bathe the limb with warm water until the itching subsides, and then remove the limb without constriction, until it has subsided, and then repeat the constriction.
If the limb has already been relaxed, and the bone has already been removed, and similar things: then rectify the whole with your might, and consider it again.
If the nourishment is hindered from reaching the limb, because of the excess of the constriction: then it is necessary to soften it somewhat, and remove it for a few days, until it has recovered, and then tighten it again
If indeed nothing else occurs of the kind which we mentioned, then it is not necessary to delay [treatment], except after eighty days or thereabouts
And then the hand of the patient is suspended at its collar And let its collar be equal, and let its might be protected from disturbing movements. And let him sleep over his back.
And know that this fracture is healed in thirty days, or in thirty-two days: and perhaps in eighty days. All this is according to the customs of the complexion and the might of the limb.
Of the restoration of fractures of the limb.
Know that fractures of the limb, and of the fingers, are rarely found. And they do not occur except for great attrition
When indeed such a fracture of the limb or attrition occurs: then it is necessary to make the patient sit upright: and let him sit with his back against something equal in height Then place his hand upon the extended limb.
Then extend the fractured bone, and bring it even with the hand of the physician, until they meet in a good junction.
Then it is necessary to place a dressing and a bandage, if the swelling does not subside naturally Then place a bandage above according to the quantity of the place: and you have covered the limb with a linen cloth
If, however, the fracture is below the middle of the limb, then make it like a sphere from the cloth: and command the patient to rest, so that it may rest upon the fractured limb: then bind it with a long cloth
And let the bandage be from skin, in which there is softness, so that the skin may be applied to the limb with the body of the limb: and bind it according to what is necessary
If, however, the fracture is outside, then it is necessary: to place a bandage above and a bandage below the limb: and let the hand be open and straight Then place a support, as it is turned back: and extend between the fingers with the ligament.
If, however, there is a fracture of any of the bones of the fingers, then if it is the thumb, make it even according to what is necessary Then bind it with the limb: and if there is swelling, place upon it a straight bandage, firm: so that the fracture will be raised up and not move
If, however, the fracture is of the remaining fingers, such as the middle, and index, or ring, and little finger, then make it even, and bind it with the healthy finger which follows it: or bind them all according to the continuation: and that is better Place above it the star that is adjacent to the thumb.
Consider also in the restoration the after-effect of the calid apostematis: and place against it what is appropriate, according to what is repeated about it.
On the restoration of a fracture of the thigh bone.</start_of_turn>
The thigh bone is fractured in many places, and it is recognized by sense: because it turns towards the inner and outer parts.</start_of_turn
And its restoration is done in this way, that it strings up the ligament above the fracture, and another ligament below the fracture.</start_of_turn And the invalid is returned over his face.</start_of_turn
Then extend all the ligaments around it towards their own part according to equality: and this is when the fracture is in the middle of the bone.</start_of_turn
If however the fracture is close to the root of the thigh bone, then let the ligament be towards the part of the hip, so that the extension may go upwards: and another ligament below the fracture.</start_of_turn
And thus in the same way if the fracture is close to the knee, then let the ligament be close to the knee, so that the extension may be towards the lower parts.</start_of_turn
Then the physician must join the bone with his two hands, until he has reduced it according to the likeness of a natural figure: and join the bone with a good junction.</start_of_turn
Then it is necessary to place a plaster and bind, if the limb is not apostematic.</start_of_turn And if it happens in this way that the limb is apostematic: then leave it for a few days, until the apostem becomes soft, then return to your treatment.</start_of_turn
The structure of that is strict. The structure of that is strict. Then bind the limb until the heel reaches the root of the nail.
Insert a long thread between thigh and limb near the knee, and draw the extremities from the upper part of both parts downwards. Then roll over the limb and thigh what remains from the other side
Then place over the thigh in the place of the fracture itself small tiles, and put upon the bone of the thigh one tile.
Then put fat between the limb and the thigh with soft cloths, so as to equalize the structure.
Then start from the middle over the place of the fracture with three or four bands And the more you lengthen with the ligament from the place of the fracture, the smaller and softer and milder will be the structure
Then secure two extremities of the thread which you inserted between the thigh and limb. Bind thus with three tiles with each of the three which are on top. Then draw up with two extremities of the thread to the bottom, until you reach the heel of the foot And when you have drawn up both strings also the extremities of the tiles from the other side: so that the ligament does not slip from its place.<start-of-turn>
Then release the bandage over that, while it remains, so that no fracture of the limb, neither swelling, nor inflation, nor anything of the like occurs. Which if anything should happen from that.<start-of-turn> Properly then, with the resolution of the matter, and rectify that which happened from the whole, according to what we have often said.
If indeed there is a projection from the bone which is causing pain: then it must be made equal, if this is at all possible. And if not, find over that [area] and remove that: and take care of it with the thing which preceded it until it is healed
And when this fracture of the thigh is stretched out, besides what is added to it, such as we have often said in the thigh and the arm
But truly in the restoration of its healing, no lameness occurs to the cripple And if only it is restored, besides what is applied to the other leg, then it is necessary that he limp on the one which is lame from the very beginning
And you know, that the thigh is stretched out in fifty days, or is somewhat added to, or somewhat diminished: all this is according to the diversity of complexion and the remaining conditions.
(The text continues with a discussion of treating a fracture of the knee.)
You know that a fracture of the knee is rarely occurs, but that it often happens that there is a great attrition on it.</start_of_turn>
If indeed it happens that there is a fracture, then it is not without fissure or hole in its parts.</start_of_turn And it is like a wound, and without a wound.</start_of_turn And it remains over that whole thing with sense.</start_of_turn
And its restoration is in this way, that it is made equal what has been disrupted from its parts with the digits, until it is brought together again, and joined according to what is possible from the equality and the facility, and the making of it.</start_of_turn
Then place a dressing of ground sesame seed or barley with albumin or oil: and place above it a round sponge, if necessary: and tighten the surrounding structure accordingly.
Consider all the positions which we have mentioned in the other fractures: thus as the blunt fracture and the similar: thus, so as to oppose every accident with what is suitable for it until it is healed.</start_of_turn>
On the restoration of a fractured limb.</start_of_turn>
You know that the shin bone is composed of two bones, of which one is thick and is called the Cruris: and the other is thin and is called the Focile.</start_of_turn
And it happens with both kinds of fracture which happen to two bones of the forearm: and because of this, its restoration is like that of the forearm, equally, and the operation is one.</start_of_turn
If two bones are fractured together, the shin bone is twisted in all directions.</start_of_turn
And if the thin bone is fractured, the shin bone is twisted towards the anterior part.</start_of_turn
And if the thick bone is fractured, it is found below: and it is from this that the bone is not seen.</start_of_turn
Then administer extension, and equalization, and ligation of the sponges according to this equally.</start_of_turn
But it is necessary to know that if the fracture of the shin bone is a severe fracture with many splinters: so that the extension is less severe, and the alleviation is gentler.</start_of_turn
And in the shin bone there is something which is done more than in the forearm: and it is that when you have equaled the sponges, and have completed all your operation, then take two strips of pine wood which are administered in the making of sandals which are placed under the boards: and they are made from the nails of the palm: and choose from those which have a small thickness, and that they are not from the smallest: and let their length be according to the length of the shin bone from the knee downwards.</start_of_turn>
Then insert two sutures on either side of the wound according to its length. Insert one part of the crutch from one side, and the other from the other side: and they should be from the knee down to the foot
Then ligate two bands in three places from two extremities and the middle When the limb is tightly bound, the knee bends to the right and left, and rests comfortably in a stable position
And indeed it is administered a cushion of wood according to the length of the limb, and it is placed on the knee, so as to support it from movement
And it is most important to do this in a fractured limb when the bone itself is fractured
Then consider the knee every day, and study it with the last from the apostemate, or swelling, or anything else If anything happens with them, then oppose it with that which is appropriate, until it is healed, if God wills it.
Of fractures of the bones of the foot and fingers
The heel does not usually fracture completely.</start_of_turn>
The bones of the foot sometimes fracture when the fracture is great, and the fingers also sometimes fracture: and it does not happen except when there is impact in many positions.</start_of_turn
If the bones of the foot fracture, and you wish to elevate them above the level of the heart, then place the patient's foot on the prepared earth, as when walking.</start_of_turn
Then stand, and place your foot on that which is being elevated from those bones: afterwards press, or support, the heel: and keep it even, until it returns to its place.</start_of_turn
Then place the plaster on, and support it from above: and place under the foot a board that has two flat heads.
Then bind the plaster securely to the foot, after you have wrapped it with bandages, and left whatever else is necessary.
When three or four days have passed, then loosen the ligament. For if the bone is equal, whether it is fractured or dislocated, you will find it to be even The operation is like that of wounds
If any of the fingers are fractured, then restore them, and make them equal as I have said in the restoration of the fingers of the hand Then place under the foot a board that is as long as the finger, and which is wider than the width of the finger: then place under the foot the board that I have mentioned above, and bind it securely
If the fracture is from bones, two, or three, or more, then place over every finger a bandage of its own quantity, which is bound up in linen: and bind the board under the foot: and let one head of the board rest outside the foot, so that it may hold the retention of the good one.
And remember, that you must consider all that I have said to you concerning the other fractures from accidents which I have mentioned: and oppose every accident with what is appropriate
About the fracture of the Vulva of a woman, and the bone of the thigh, and the swelling of a man.
When the Vulva of a woman is fractured, then make her sit in a square position. Then incline the hand towards the part of the back towards its companion, and keep it firm behind.
Then let the hand grasp the fold of the skin over the hip, until the hand grasps: and let it be like a sphere from this point on
Then press the woman, and lift the back gradually This is how the hip joint comes out, until it reaches before the opening of the Vulva like a sphere, and the fractured bone returns.
Then place a cushion over the back of it When he wishes to leave, remove the hip with ease, then mix: and reduce it according to the way in which you put it in at first: then go back to your cushion first
Make it rest for seven days, or thereabouts, and the bone will be restored
And if necessary, take hold of the testicles or the testicles themselves, and bind over the opening of the vulva a cord of reed, and introduce the testicles completely into the Vulva. Then blow air through the cord with force, until the testicles are inflated inside the Vulva, the fracture will return
Then let it rest with the hand, and keep it for a few days, as we have said, until it is healed
And when the bone of the breast of a man or woman is fractured, then manage its restoration, and make it equal to this which we have said concerning the bone of the elbow
And do not cover the rectum in its nearby fractures, which are of little consequence, especially for one who has something to learn, or for a layman
And understand my book well, for in many cases the fracture itself signifies to you in many ways the straightness of its restoration and its structure: understand therefore
When the gut is fractured in the Virga, grasp the edge of the wound and insert the instrument into it. Then place upon it an external dressing of cloth, and it shall be bound, and it shall be left for three days, or somewhat more, and it shall heal, if God wills it.
As for the restoration of fractures of bones, when there is associated with a wound.
It is fitting for him upon whom it has happened that a fracture is associated with a wound, especially if it is great, such as the femur or the tibia, or like that, immediately to perform a phlebotomy: if you testify that these conditions are present for the phlebotomy.</start_of_turn>
And if blood flows from the wound, then it is necessary to prepare for its excision, so that it is powdered over with dry earth: if there is nothing else present.</start_of_turn
Then begin to restore the fracture on that same day: and do not postpone it, if there is no aftereffect.</start_of_turn
If indeed there should arise a cold aftereffect, then defer the restoration until the ninth day, until the aftereffect has subsided.</start_of_turn And do not approach him in the third and fourth days, for you will make him suffer bad accidents.</start_of_turn>
If however the fractured bone is prominent above the skin detected: then it is necessary to prepare to reduce it, and to equalize it with your hands with ease and small extension.</start_of_turn
If indeed it is not prepared for extension of the limb, and its equalization with your hands: then reduce it with this instrument.</start_of_turn It is an instrument made of iron, its length being equal to seven fingers or eight: and its width according to the quantity of the wound. And therefore the physician must take three or four from these according to the quantity which is needed for the care of every kind of fracture.
And let it be round: and let its size be small, so that it does not double up under compression in the hour of operation: and let the edges be acute at the extremities, which have a margin at their extremities. And let the upper be from the middle down to the lower part of it
This is its shape
It must be used in the operation, so that the acute edge of its curvature be placed over the prominence of the bone: and press it with it until the bone returns and is equal to the square of the equation.
So strive to make the extremities of the fracture even with each other
If its extremities are slightly fractured and do not hold the instrument well, then it is possible to cut off the extremity of the bone so that the instrument may have power
If indeed we cannot reduce them as we have said before, then cut them off with the knife which we mentioned before: or saw them off with a saw in any possible way
Then remain on the bone only the asperities and small cortices.
When the bone is thus reduced, and when after its reduction it finds itself painful and swollen, then you know that the bone has not returned to its natural place
Do this thing. You provide great comfort to the patient, when the restoration is completed as you do the bone.
Then immerse the bandage in strong vinegar, black. And properly if it is in summer. And do not place upon the wound fat, nor anything containing oil: lest it should cause the wound to become infected and corrupted.
Then give the patient urine in an hour when the restoration of the bone is completed And discharge the wound clean: thus, you will cut through the edges of the wound according to the quantity of the wound
And take heed of all precautions, lest you tighten the wound with the fracture. Many indeed have done this with regard to their patients: and they have caused them to suffer either death, or corruption, or damage, that is, injury And be your treatment gentle, lenient, diverse in the strictures of the remaining fractures
For if the wound is bad, or if it is a large wound, and times are over these very matters which we have mentioned, and you find pain in the suspended part: then it is not proper to give urine upon it And make incisions from hard papers in the place of the sponges, and tighten it with these.
When however it is after a day or two, and the wound begins to swell, so that pus is generated: then remove from above the sponge which you placed upon it with the vinegar. Then give astringents, and unguents which are customary to us, to dry up the wound: such as the unguentum of tetrapharmacon, and the like.
And it is fitting that you should solve the ligament. And consider the wound every day in the morning and evening until it has healed and is sound.</start_of_turn>
It is necessary that the limb be prepared in such a way that the pus may drain downwards easily.</start_of_turn>
If the wound days pass by and it does not consolidate, neither does the pus separate from it: then you know that there are small bone fragments there.</start_of_turn Therefore you must inquire about the wound with a finger.</start_of_turn How many of these small bone fragments are separated from it? Remove them and extract them.</start_of_turn And whatever of these remains unseparated, and which pricks the limb, and causes it to swell, must be incised and removed in every way possible.</start_of_turn
If the wound becomes black, or swollen, that is, if there is inflammation or another corruption and decomposition: then it is necessary to oppose each of these things with something which is suitable for its cure, as has been mentioned in its chapter.</start_of_turn
And from this it is known that whenever an os breaks and projects above the limb, such as the thigh bone, and the hip bone, and similar bones of the great limbs, you must not anticipate its attraction, for much harm is done by it, rather remove it immediately, before it decomposes.</start_of_turn
Perhaps it will fall by itself after twenty or thirty days.</start_of_turn
Then, in that case, care for the wound if you see it: otherwise, remove it.</start_of_turn
On the treatment of the nodation in the groin for a fractured limb.
Many times this nodation occurs in the groin during the healing of a fracture Especially when it is close to the joints: and it is formed from that figure of the limb. And sometimes it hinders the limb from its natural operation
Therefore consider in this case, if the nodation is firm: administer in it medicines which have styptic properties, such as aloe, and olibanum, and myrrh, and sarcocolla, and acacia, and similar things.</start_of_turn>
Yes, take from these some or all of them: and mix them with a styptic wine, or with albumin, or with vinegar: and apply them over the nodation with a stopper, and bind them over with a good bandage.</start_of_turn
And loosen the bandage, and do not leave it on for many days.</start_of_turn> Then remove the bandage, and do it again until the nodation has disappeared.</start_of_turn>
Or bind over it a sheet of lead which is slightly softened.</start_of_turn> Lead has the property of removing all that is harmful from the limbs.</start_of_turn
If however the nodation is already fixed to the stone, and is stiff, and causes pain: then find above the limb from its upper part, and cut away the superflulence that is protruding: or ligate the limb with some instruments, until it is loosened: and take care of the limb until it is healed.</start_of_turn
When the limb is restored and remains under the skin afterwards, not according to its natural order.</start_of_turn
When the fracture of a bone has been restored, and the limb remains slight beneath it: in such a case it does not become firm except for multiple causes. For one of these reasons, the multitude of solutions of the ligament and its ligation is not according to what is necessary: either because of the excessive stricture of the ligaments, which hinders the nourishment of the limb; or because of the excessive amount of superfluous embrocation at an inappropriate time; or because of the scarcity of blood in the body of the patient, and its weakness.
The treatment of it is to nourish the patient and strengthen the body of him, until the blood is multiplied in it. And give him a bath. And give him joy and comfort over him.
Then put pitch over the limb: so that it attracts a great quantity of nourishment to it. And anoint it frequently with warm water, until the nourishment recover and return to its natural figure.
Â¶ On the treatment of fractures when they are restored crookedly.
When the limb has been restored after its healing is crooked, and the fracture of the bone remains, or swelling: and there is tenderness about the limb, although the limb is not prohibited from its natural operation: in such a case it is not necessary to break the limb again.
And there are many doctors and restorers of bones in our land who have done this thing.
And this operation is very dangerous, harmful, leading to death, or great fear, as it is mortal
If swelling and inflammation are recent: then it is necessary to soak the affected part in lukewarm water, in which are boiled soft herbs, such as elder leaves and their roots, and melilot, and things of that kind. And let there be applied to it a softening plaster, such as one made of dried alum and powdered acacia
Or take the mucus of elder roots, and mix it with pork fat, or with olive oil: and plaster it on with that.
Or take poppy seeds, and mix them with ground columbine, and things of that kind which are named by doctors to reduce consolidation
And when the swelling has subsided with persistent and gentle friction, as is done with wet hands. And movement of the limb should be administered to every part at all times.
If, however, stiffness has preceded it, and it has become strong, and has been reduced to stone, and the necessity for its treatment with iron has arisen: then it is necessary to cut off above it, and to dissolve the continuation of the bone, and to remove whatever remains of the swelling or bone with fine needles: and facilitate this with request and care.
Note: The provided Latin text does not include the section titled "De sermone in Dislocatione," so I am unable to translate that portion.
Dislocation is the exit of any articulation from its place. Because it hinders its movement and deforms the limb And makes the suffering of pain and the surrounding wounds more severe
When, therefore, any dislocation has happened, then it is necessary to hasten its restoration: neither should it be delayed at all
If it be delayed, the place relaxes, and perhaps with it the reduction of the dislocation.
It should not be moved or extended at the time of relaxation of the place For it causes many to suffer spasms and painful sensations.
When that happens, then it is necessary to perform a bloodletting on the patient. Then let it rest until the swelling subsides
Then it is bound with warm water and oil. And finally the dislocation is reduced with ease
And all the limb is cared for so that its remembrance returns to its place.
I command that the head of the dislocation be reduced, even as in a fracture, from the upper part of the body down to the lower part
As for the care of the dislocation of the lower jaw...
Rarely are two mandibles dislocated together
And both are displaced according to one of two methods Or they are displaced from their places by a small movement, and are softened slightly. Or they are displaced by a complete dislocation, until they are softened to the chest, until the patient's saliva flows, and cannot hold their tongue, neither can they close their own mouth, and their tongue is involved with speech
When the dislocation is slight, it returns by itself in various positions with little pain.
If the dislocation is complete, entire: then it is necessary to perform the reduction of it immediately, and do not delay: and it is necessary that the physician put his thumb of his hand on the root of the mandible in the dislocation between the bones, if the dislocation is on one side only If the dislocation is from two parts, do not introduce the two fingers simultaneously. The remaining fingers of his hand should be outside, so that they may support it.
Command the patient to loosen his jaw and bite down on all parts The physician must stabilize the jaw and urge the jaw back to its place until it returns to its original position.
If the reduction is difficult, especially if both jaws are displaced together: then apply moist heat with warm water, and oil, until the reduction of both is made easy: do not attempt to reduce both at once, as we have said before
When they have returned and are even, and the patient's jaw is closed: then place over the wound the pulp of the nails of the thumbs, with rosin which is made from beeswax: and wipe with rosewater
And it is bound with soft bands.
The patient should rest with his head resting between two cushions: and his head should not be moved to the right or left: neither should he be forced or commanded to chew anything: rather let him eat something soft, until when he moves his pain has subsided, and the jaw has returned to its normal position: then he may eat what he wants, and that is given to him with ease.
Let him not work or eat or drink anything around the time of the operation on his mouth, or on the swelling and bruising, until the jaw has settled and healed
If the reduction of both jaws is difficult, when they are displaced at some time, and they do not return to their place: then many times the cause is from high fever and excessive sweating: and perhaps the patient has vomited pure bile.
When thus aid is given: then you know that it is a loss, and many die from it within ten days.
Regarding the reduction of dislocation of the Furcula and the extremity of the humerus
The Furcula does not dislocate from the inside outwards, because of its continuation with the breastbone. It dislocates sometimes outwards: and this is declared by sensation
Its restoration is that the patient lies with his back on the ground, and extends his arms. Then cover the place with your strong palm, for it will return by itself
Then place upon it a compress, and sponges, and bind it tightly
The extremities following the elbow do not dislocate with it, except rarely If it dislocates on some day: then it is necessary that it be reduced and adjusted as we have said, and that you be prepared for this
Then place upon it a compress, and sponges, and bind it tightly And command the patient to adhere to tranquility and quiet, until he is healed.
And when the same treatment has reduced the limb of the Humerus, when it is separated from its place also
Regarding the reduction of dislocation of the Humerus
Know that the Humerus does not dislocate except in three ways.
One of them is that it dislocates to the part of the elbow downwards Secondly, it is necessary to displace the dislocation to the part of the chest. Or perhaps to the upper part of the humerus: and this is rare.
It does not displace to the back, because of the spleen. It does not displace to the front, because of nerves
Mostly it is displaced and comes out through the lower part of the chest: especially in those in whom the flesh is little For it comes out quickly in these and enters quickly
In those in whom the flesh is much, it is the opposite, that is to say, because it comes out with difficulty and enters with difficulty
And perhaps it happens to some people by a blow or a fall, and the humerus is displaced by a hot swelling, and it is thought because of this that it is displaced
It is necessary therefore to examine this until you are certain of its extent, and then you can proceed with its treatment.
It is recognized that there is a dislocation when it comes out through the lower part of the chest: and you must distinguish between a displaced humerus and a healthy humerus. For you will find among these two a clear distinction, and you will find in the head of the humerus a concavity and under the thumb towards the touch of the hand like a nail: and it is not possible for the infirm to reduce the hand to its proper place, nor to move it in any way
Similarly, if it is displaced towards the breast, or upwards: then you will find a clear mark, and it is not hidden
And in this case of dislocation, the reduction is easy when the limb is still firm, or when the patient is young.
And the reduction of this is that the hand minister should lift the limb up to the shoulder Then put your thumbs under the collar of the limb and lift the limb with force upwards to its place: and the minister should lift the limb and extend it upwards Then put on the lower part, and he himself returns quickly.
If, however, it does not return by this, and it has been since the dislocation that several days have passed: then it is necessary that the patient be bathed in warm water, and that an embrocation be administered which softens and soothes, like decocting rue, barley and melilot in water, and applying them.
Then the patient is laid on his back: and under the collar of the limb is placed a sphere and a bandage which is equal between softness and firmness.
Then the doctor puts his heel on the sphere, and lifts the upper part of the arm with force, and draws the limb downwards.
And if necessary, reduce it according to this method: and it is that you make the greater limb to be longer than the other, and that you place it beside the limb and insert the arm under the collar of the patient: and lift the collar upwards until the patient is suspended in the air And another minister pulls the limb downwards towards its belly If however the patient is limp: then it is necessary that he be suspended with something else, so that it becomes heavier: for the dislocation returns immediately.
And it is also reduced by another method: that is, as a long stick is shaped in the earth, whose head is rounded like a glove of a hanged man: neither coarse nor subtle. Then it is placed under the lower part after the upper part of the stick has been covered with soft wool: and the patient shall stand in accordance with the length of the stick
Then extend his hand downwards from the other side, and extend his body from the other side with force: for the joint returns to its place with speed.
If its reduction is difficult by all that we have said, then take hold of a stick whose length is equal to the distance of two arms, and whose width is equal to the distance of four fingers, and whose thickness is equal to the distance of two fingers: whose head is rounded, so that it may alleviate the entrance into the depth of the wound, according to this form.
Then bind over the rounded head with soft wool, so that it does not harm the injured limb.
Then place under the wound of the patient, so that the hand or arm is extended over the stick down to the lower part: and bind the stick over the support and the arm and the extremity of the hand
Then place the arm over the step of the ladder by the width, and extend the hand downwards, and let the rest of the body hang loose from the other side. The joint therefore enters immediately.
When it has therefore completed its entrance according to whatever method is possible: then it is necessary to place under the wound a sphere of equal quantity from wool. Then put on a prepared plaster made from ground poppyseed with oil and white of egg over the whole arm, as it is turned outwards
Then string under the thumb stricture decent: and the ligament shall be revolved over the covering above: and its hand shall be annexed to its column, and it shall be let go, neither shall its hand move for seven days.
And it is necessary that a nourishing diet be placed in the mouth of the patient, until the limb be comfortable: for it is quicker for its healing.
Then put on a wider dressing after seven days, or five, and take it off when there is movement. If it is firm and is not softened, then it is healed.
If the suture has become displaced many times, because of the moisture which has happened to it, or for some other cause: then it is necessary that there be administered in it a cautery with three holes, according as is stated in the chapter on cautery
If thus you have done all this, and the ligament has dissolved after seven days, and the suture has not held, and the covering and the stricture above it have been reduced, and it is not firm, and has fallen down, and cannot be raised up again: then you know that the nerves which are at the head of the humerus have been cut through, or stretched, or softened: and you know that the suture has never been fixed in its place.
As for a dislocation which happens over the breast and the nipple, or to the back, reduction is done with a push and an extension with the hands: until it returns, and the remainder of the stricture and care are administered until it is healed
If after the healing there should happen a greatness in the limb, and a slowness in its movement: then the patient is to be put into a warm bath many times, until that greatness is softened, and it returns to its first nature
On the treatment of dislocation of the cubit.
Know that cubit dislocation is difficult and returns with difficulty: and it dislocates to all parts, and especially to the front or to the back.
Its dislocation is not concealed: because it hangs under the skin and under the touch, according to whatever form it is dislocated And when you join the dislocated cubit with the sound one, it is declared that the latter is evident The join must be made, and one must not double the arm, nor touch it with the other arm
It is necessary to apply pressure, and to reduce the dislocation immediately, before swelling occurs
For if swelling occurs at that time, its reduction becomes difficult: and perhaps it will not be healed completely, especially when it is at the back For all kinds of dislocation are harmful, and especially painful: and it descends much with this disease.
And the restoration of it when possible is that you extend your hand with two hands: and the arm be expanded, and the hands of the physician are above the cubit and under it, and he pushes together the tendons of the thumbs with the palms of his hands, until it returns to its place
Or if the dislocation is at the front: then it returns in such a way that you grasp the hand with the hand, until it touches the radix of the palm of the hand which is dislocated
If it does not obey the reduction, then you must administer strong tension: and it is that two ministers extend the arm: and they keep it held by two ministers also, so that it does not move during the extension
Then the arm is returned to its entirety after it is involved over the hand, with a doubled long panus or a broad ligament.
And when the physician grasps the hand, let him moisten it with oil: so that this will be from the things that aid in the lubrication of the joint with ease. Then push the joint forward with force, until it returns
And afterwards, when the reduction has taken place, it is necessary to place upon it a plaster, in which there is styptic substance, and to dry with alum or vinegar: and tighten the bandage loosely. And suspend the arm from the collar of the patient: and keep it for a few days.
Then it is healed If, however, the joint remains fixed in its place, then solve the ligament from it, and let it go
And if you find that the joint is not properly bound, then repeat the plaster, and the ligament, and let it go for a few days, until it is bound Then it is healed.
If, however, there should be a degree of gravity after the reduction of the joint, and the position be unstable: then give lubrication in the bath, and gentle friction, and compression, until it is firm, or place upon the joint a bolster, that is, a ball of wool. Then it is bound, and let it rest on a bandage day and night. Then take away the bandage, and introduce it into the bath. When it is wet, then gently friction the joint with a tempered friction Then repeat above the same limb twice, and the third time with the water entering. Until it is softened.
And if you wish, put upon the same limb a cushion of fat, moistened and warmed with butter, and bind over it
Do it like this. The limb itself will soften, and will return to its natural position.
This is the treatment for dislocation of the Almahassem bone
The bone of the elbow is dislocated, that is, the junction between the arm and the hand.
And its reduction is easy. Contrary to the rest of the joints Indeed, it is necessary that velocity be in the reduction of the dislocation in the hour in which it is dislocated, before it is set in place: or else it will happen in this setting that the limb will become stiff.
And the reduction of the dislocation is like this: place the lower limb of the elbow on a board, and extend the hand: and the doctor places his hand on the prominence of the dislocation and urges it until it returns
Indeed, it is necessary to consider, if the palm has receded towards the inside of the limb: then the infirm person places the back of his hand on the board at the extension and reduction: and if the dislocation is proceeding towards the back of the limb, then let the position of the hand be inside the board, that is, the inner part of the hand is placed on the board, so that the doctorâs hand can be placed over the prominence of the dislocation.
If it returns immediately, that is good: and if not, then bind the limb with a bandage while it is being set: and let it go, and do not do it again
If he does not tolerate it, neither will the limb remain above its reduction, after the days have passed, for the true knot will remain according to its tension: and it does no harm to the patient, except that it softens the hand, and it is not possible to tighten anything: then you know that the nerve has been severed, or bruised.
There is no wit in that, except to tighten it with a cautery near the base of the limb. It may perhaps do no good at all.
When the AlmÃ¦ssim does not return, then place upon it a covering, as we have narrated Then tighten it, and leave it for five days: afterwards loosen it and discharge it, and exercise the hand.
If, however, its motion is hindered, and something weighty has occurred in it: then soften it with warm water and gentle friction, until it softens up
(End of excerpt
When the Digit has been dislocated from its place towards the side of the palm of the hand, or towards the dorsum of the hand, or its bone: then extend the Digit and push the dislocation outwards with your thumbs, until it returns to its place
Then support the head of the Digit, and suspend it over the part from which it was dislocated, and keep it still for two days.
Then suspend it, and extend it, until it is straight again on that day.
When night comes, bind it according to what has been narrated: and do not cease to loosen it daily: and exercise it with movement: and bind it at night
Do it for a few days until it is strung together.
Do it in like manner for a few days until it is strung together, like if a dislocation has occurred at the wrist: and bind it to its own part, and do the operation as before, until it is healed.
Do it in like manner for a few days until it is strung together, like if a dislocation has occurred at the remainder of the limb.
Concerning the cure of wrist dislocation.
When it happens to anyone that the wrist or neck is completely dislocated, or that many bones are displaced from their places: then it is not in this case that treatment is to be had, because the blood clots are appropriate for the sick person.
And the sign of it is that the sickness departs without anyone forcing it, and that he cannot hold his hand: and that many times they soften some of his limbs, or two arms, or two wrists, or one of them: or that they displace a bone from its place.
Many times they displace it, because many times they make the displacement to four parts.
That which they displace to the back is called gibbosity.
The cure for it is, indeed, that they should be joined together immediately, if the gibbosity has happened from infancy: then there is no healing from it at all
But in those which happen by chance, or by blow, or in like manner, as the ancients have said in a long-winded way Most of them do not return when proficiency is attained
I myself, however, have abbreviated this, because I have little excuse from many of these things because of my intimacy with the matter: and the way I have set out the matter and formed the instrument in a different way from that in which they have shown it, and have exposed it.
I say therefore, that which happens in the groin from the front part, is neither a faculty nor a healing.
And similarly that which happens at the two sides also
And it is not cured from these things, except that which happens in the back itself, as I have said: and that is, that the patient be extended over his face upon an even platform near the wall: and that the moisture be spread under it, so that the chest is not injured thereby.
Then one places a fixed staff in the heel of the foot in the earth, round about the head of it: and another staff round about the feet in the other heel: and the minister holds the staff, and let it not be fixed in the earth. And the other minister holds the other one.
Then pull over the head of the patient, and under his armpits the ligament is made firm: and extend the extremity of the ligament to the staff which is at the head of it: and bind it to it.
And bind another ligament above his shoulders, and above his knees and at his buttocks And bind all the ligaments together, and bind them to the other staff which is at his feet
And the whole minister extends to the part of the limb of the ligament, and do not move the two staffs from the places where they are fixed: indeed they are not fixed, as we have said
And the doctor places his palms upon the spine with strength, until he recovers: or places upon the breast a board. And he fastens upon the board his feet until he recovers
But if he does not recover by this treatment, then take a board whose length is about three arms. And the cavity in the wall from which we have spoken, which is close to the patient, is the place where the extremity of the board enters. Then place the middle of the board over the Spondilem. And let the physician put his feet on the other extremity And tighten well, until the Spondilem is firm, and return to his place
And if you wish, work with the ankle which is involved with your hand: and it is that, like the fig, two boards are placed in the earth at the foot of the patient, their length being the length of an arm: and at their head two boards at the foot of it
And the length which is between every two boards is like the palm of the hand: and it is done in every place where there is a hole through which the ankle runs: and the board is fixed firmly in the earth much, so that it does not move at all.
And insert a round board: and it is the ankle through which the ligament is rotated in two holes of the two boards.
And at its extremity is a hole in which the board is fixed, whose length is like the palm with that which is rotated: and in two other boards it is like that
And string the ligaments which you have bound in the patient's chest around the ankle which is at his head: and the ligaments which you have bound in his thighs around the ankle which is at his feet.
Then stand by every ankle of the minister who will rotate his hand with a rule, as the ankle is rotated: and the physician will equal the Spondilem, as we have said
This is the form of the ankle which follows.
Then, when Spondilis has returned and the place is evened, it is necessary that you apply a plaster of desiccated alum with egg albumen. Then, apply the plaster. And then place above the plaster a board, the width of which is three fingers, or somewhat more And its length should be as much as will cover the part of Spondilis which is still sound
And it is bound with the thread we mentioned before And the patient is fed with light food until he is healed
If anything remains of hardness in the place at the end of the healing: then it is necessary that medicines which soften and soothe be administered, with the administration of the board as we mentioned before for a long time And thus is administered in that layer of lead.
And when it happens that an eminence appears behind the last Spondilis of the back: and it is believed to be a dislocation, and that is the bone which now emines. Therefore it is necessary that conjecture be made for it with these medicines: perhaps indeed it will happen that it will cause death.
Of the treatment of a dislocated Ancha.
You know that the dislocations of the Ancha and of the humerus do not happen except in cases of dislocation only: neither do they happen except from a slight displacement and a concavity
And the dislocation of the Ancha is usually according to four parts. That is, because it is displaced forward and backward
The majority are displaced inwards: little is displaced forwards, and little backwards.
The treatment of such dislocation is inwards: for when you unite the limb of the sick with the limb of the healthy, it is longer: and the knee of the sick is more prominent than the knee of the healthy, and he cannot double up his foot at the ankle: and the place following the ankle after displacement is the hip, because the head of the femur has gone there.
The sign of which dislocation has occurred outwards is that these accidents are contrary to those of this dislocation.
The sign of which dislocation has occurred forwards is that it expands the healthy limb in its entirety: truly it does not double up without pain at the knee: and if he attempts to walk, he cannot go beyond that forwards: and he retains his urine, and his ankle is displaced, and during walking there is a swelling of his heel
The sign of which dislocation has occurred backwards is that it does not expand the knee, and he cannot double up his knee before he doubles up his ankle: and his limb is even shorter than the other: and his ankle is soft, and the head of the femur is at the level of the hip bone.
The reduction of this dislocation of this kind is by means of counter-traction, so that if the dislocation is old, which has already lasted with the owner of the limb, it will be reduced along with it Then if you have administered the reduction, and it remains as before: in that case there is no longer any treatment for it It does not suffice to suppose that it will go away of itself.
With regard to that in which the dislocation is fixed, and is one of the four kinds of dislocation: then you must take hold of it as I have said, and extend it inwards and outwards, and move it to the right and left: perhaps then it will return and no other treatment will be needed
If it does not return in this manner, it is necessary that you prepare a strong minister and extend his leg from the lower part: either with your hands or with a ligament that is bound above his knee: and another minister extends his hand above, so that he may insert his hand under his toes. Then bind with a soft ligament over the root of the thigh, and grasp the extremity of the other ligament.</start_of_turn>
And keep the extension of his limb either from the front part of the groin to the part of the pelvis, or from the back to the part of the back.</start_of_turn>
And let the extension be all at once, until the patient is lifted up with his body from the earth, and remains hanging.</start_of_turn>
And this is a common kind of extension among the four kinds.</start_of_turn>
If therefore the dislocation returns with that which we have said, it is good: and if not, then it is necessary in every case to do the thing which we have mentioned concerning the proper treatment.</start_of_turn
In reduction itself, when the dislocation is towards the interior, it is necessary that the patient be placed upon his sound side.</start_of_turn Then place the ligament over the root of the thigh, in that place which is between the head of the thigh and the groin.</start_of_turn Then extend the ligament upwards from the groin to the higher part of the body, to the part of the pelvis.</start_of_turn
Then another strong minister grasps his strong arm, and grasps the bulky part of the lower thigh, and extends it outwards with the extension of the limb.</start_of_turn And thus it returns to its place.</start_of_turn>
This kind is more easily treated than the others, as it reduces this limb.
If, however, it excuses itself above you, and does not obey your entrance with this kind of treatment: then it is necessary that two ankles be bound together with strong, soft ligature, over two heel bones, and over two knees: and let the length of each be as much as four fingers; and let the sick limb be extended more than the other by the amount of two fingers.
Then suspend the limb above the head of the limb: and let its length from the ground be as much as two arms
Then command the youth to be strong, that he may support the hip: and suspend them both together with the sick limb: and let the youth push the other, supporting the hip with strength, for the bandage will return to its place with speed.
But in its return itself, when there is displacement outwards, it is necessary that the sick limb lie upon a board, as we have said in the case of gibbosity. And bind the ligament over the knee of its own, and over the breastbone.
Then put two boards, one beside its feet, and the other beside its head. Then put a board added in the middle of the foot, fixed well: upon which are placed wet cloths, so that it does not hurt the limb: and let the board be between the thighs, so that it does not pull downwards at extension.
Then extend all the limbs towards their parts, and the physician will equal the reduction with his hand.
If therefore it obeys the reduction, it will be good.
And if not, put upon it another board, and press it down, as we said in the case of gibbosity, equally The patient must remain still, so that the sick person lies over his sound side.
When displacement is forward, then it is necessary to extend the limb of the sick person quickly: this is in accordance with the preceding statement concerning the bed: and the physician places his right palm on the patientâs knee Then he grasps the limb with the other hand and, with that coarseness, brings the limb to the lower part of the knee
And if the displacement is backwards: then it is not necessary to extend the sick person downwards, but to keep him elevated above the ground: indeed it is necessary to place him over a firm object, just as it is necessary when the displacement is wide outwards, as we said concerning his recumbent position over two cushions: and it is over his face and the ligaments are extended: as we said above.
And it is necessary to apply a compress also with a board over the place from which the joint has been extruded, when the reduction is complete as it should be.
And the sign of its return is that you extend both limbs of the sick person: and when you remove these from equality, and the sick person tightens his limb and expands it without pain: then you know that the limb has returned, as it should be: then join the two thighs together, and place a bandage, and bind with equal tension: so that it does not move to any part: and let the sick person rest quietly for three days, or four.
Then loosen the ligament and the bandage, and compare the limb with the other: then if you find them equal in position, then you know that the displacement is now fixed: absolutely therefore make the sick person walk again.
And if you find some softening: then repeat the reduction, and bandage it again, and bind it as before: and dismiss it also after three days.
Then let it be healed and make it slow its walking on either side for a few days until it is comfortable.
Then let the dislocation be healed and make it gradual in its walking on either side for a few days until it is comfortable.
Then let it be healed and make it gradual in its walking on either side for a few days until it is comfortable Then let it be healed and make it gradual in its walking on either side for a few days until it is comfortable
Then let it be healed and make it gradual in its walking on either side for a few days until it is comfortable

Then let it be healed and make it gradual in its walking on either side for a few days until it is comfortable Then let it be healed and make it gradual in its walking on either side for a few days until it is comfortable Then let it be healed and make it gradual in its walking on either side for a few days until it is comfortable
Then let it be healed and make it gradual in its walking on either side for a few days until it is comfortable
Then let it be healed and make it gradual in its walking on either side for a few days until it is comfortable Then let it be healed and make it gradual in its walking on either side for a few days until it is comfortable Then heal them.
Then heal them. And do not let the patient walk for a few days until they are healed.
If, however, the limb resists reduction, then manage extension of force with ligaments, of which the account has been given in the treatment of an abscess, until it returns.
About the treatment of dislocation of the calcaneus.</start_of_turn>
The calcaneus sometimes requires only a slight displacement, and sometimes it is dislocated according to the situation.</start_of_turn> And its dislocation can be either inward or outward.</start_of_turn
And the sign of its dislocation is that the calcaneus is swollen and displaced towards the part where it is dislocated.</start_of_turn
The treatment for its displacement is easy: to reduce it, extend it easily with the hands, and make it even, until it returns.</start_of_turn
As for the treatment of the latter when it is dislocated according to the situation, it is necessary to make the patient sit upright: and to hold the limb firmly with a strong hand from the back of the ankle, in the middle of it.</start_of_turn
Then take hold with your right hand the foot from the upper part, and with your left hand from the lower part of the foot at the ankle bone.</start_of_turn
Then pull the foot towards you with your right hand.</start_of_turn And with the left hand keep the two ankles.
Then extend with the left hand, and push forward the ankle with the right hand without straining.</start_of_turn
Do it twice, as we have told you.
Then push the heel of the foot to the knee in the groin, and you grasp the heel.
If it returns once, or twice in this way, and you equal the foot, that is good: but if not, do the operation again over it: for it will return itself
But if it is hindered that you should reduce it as we have said: then make the patient lie on his back on the earth, and fix his heel to the earth firmly with a bandage, so that it falls between his thighs: and you should grasp over it with your hand, so that it does not irritate the patient.
Then take hold of his heel: afterwards extend the limb with your hand or with your fingers, or with a ligature which is over the ankle bone Then extend all the limbs against the extension of their neighbour: and the bandage should be stable between the two thighs holding him, so that it does not pull the body downwards towards the extension.
Then the physician must equal the dislocation with his hands, and the other limb should hold the sound knee downwards. For the dislocation returns quickly.
When it returns, and it is declared to you that the limb is restored: then put on an embolus and a bandage, and bind up the limb firmly with ligaments, and bind the foot to the knee bone
And it is necessary that you beware of the nerves, which are above the heel behind, so that there is no ligament over them which may be tight and irritate them
And keep it for two days, or three days. If the ligament is softened, draw it tight: then resolve it on the third or fourth day. And restrain the patient from walking for forty days. If he attempts to walk before this space has healed, there will be no security that the dislocation will be dissolved, and it will be corrupted, and will not recover afterwards
If he has a swelling of the heel: then it is necessary that you manage in the sedation of this that in which our account proceeds elsewhere concerning the cure, and embrocation, until it is resolved
Concerning the dislocation of the toes of the foot, and its treatment
It is necessary that it be equalised that which is dislocated from its place with little extension without work: and this is not difficult, indeed it is easy.
If however the dislocation is in some knob of the ankle of the foot: then it is necessary that the patient sit with his foot resting on the ground, or on a board: and he should be in the same state as if he were walking
Then sit down, and put your foot on that which comes out of those joints Then tighten it with your foot until the foot returns, and let it rest in its place, and it will not appear to be protruding in its place.
Then put under the heel of his foot a board which can grasp the whole foot, which has two heads. Then draw it tight with a bandage for three days. Then resolve it, and keep him quiet from walking for many days, until it is bound and secured from reduction.
On the kinds of dislocations with wound or fracture.
When anything of this kind happens, and you are seeking its cure and its restoration, many things often follow: and because of this it is not proper to be proud of its cure, except for one who is prudent in the art of long-term treatment, merciful, pious, prompt, not cowardly, and not overconfident: and that he should abstain from the treatment of patients who sit only for warm packs. Except that you either think that the remedy will be lost with the gentleness of the ailment, or that there is some hope of recovery with the appearance of something promising. To attempt to reduce it immediately at the beginning of the matter, before a cold pack is applied
If the limb is thus returned, as we wish, then administer a regimen that will cause the swelling to subside: and care for the wound with the things that suit it from the desiccant unguents.</start_of_turn>
If the dislocation is with fracture, and the bones are separated in the sitting position, then attempt to break them apart, and do in it what we said in the ailments of simple fractures in those places.</start_of_turn>
And be cautious according to your ability, and protect yourself from the entrance of fear: according to what has been foretold to you.</start_of_turn>
For it is better for you before the Creator of yours, and more lasting for your glory, and more beneficial for the salvation of your body in this world.</start_of_turn
