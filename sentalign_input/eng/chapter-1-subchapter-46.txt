 CHAPTER FORTY-SIX.
On cauterization for contusion.
When pain occurs in some limb due to a fall or a blow and the pain becomes chronic and medical treatment has no effect upon it, you should cauterize it with the punctate cautery.
In each case the cauterization should be in proportion to the size of the limb, its strength or weakness, and the chronicity of the pain and contusion in it.
If it is cured at the first cauterization, good; otherwise repeat the cauterization.
For it is customary for these pains to move from one part to a neighbouring part, and you must follow them with the cautery till the patient is cured.
