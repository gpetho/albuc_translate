Chapter VIII
On the treatment of styes that occur on the eyelids.
Styes that occur on the eyelids of the eyes are sometimes wet, sometimes dry.
Then you need to hold them with forceps or pincers, and cut them with a spatula from their roots, and then place crushed herbs over the spots.
But if pain with a flow of blood comes, then you cauterize them with a fine lancet cautery.
And the best cauterization is after the incisions and sometimes returning when some root cause remains; and when they are cauterized with fire, those roots are burned and do not return.
