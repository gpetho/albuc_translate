The author of this book says: When I have completed for you, O my sons, this book, which is a part of the science of medicine in its completeness, and have reached the utmost limit in its clarity and explanation, I saw fit to complete it for you with this treatise, which is a part of the practical work.
Because practical work is completely lacking in our country and in our time, so much so that its knowledge is almost extinct and its influence has ceased. And only a few traces of it remain in the books of the ancients, which have been corrupted by hands and marred by mistakes and confusion, until its meanings have become obscure and its usefulness has been lost.
Therefore, I saw fit to revive it and to compose this treatise on it in a way that is explanatory, clear, and concise, and to provide pictures of cauterizing irons and other surgical instruments, since this is a further clarification and a great help to those who need it.
The reason why there is no skilled practitioner in our time is that the craft of medicine is long and its practitioner must beforehand be trained in the science of anatomy which Galen described. Until he understands the functions, forms, temperaments, connections, and separations of the organs, and the knowledge of the bones, nerves, and muscles, their number, origins, the arteries and veins, their pulsations, and the locations of their origins.
Therefore, Hippocrates said that physicians are many in name but few in deed, especially in the craft of surgery, and we have mentioned some of this in the introduction to this book.
For he who is not knowledgeable in what we have mentioned of anatomy will inevitably make mistakes that kill people, as I have often witnessed in those who have imagined themselves proficient in this science and claimed it without knowledge or training.
For I saw an ignorant physician who incised a porcine tumor in a woman's neck, and severed some of the neck's arteries, so the woman bled until she fell dead before him.
And I saw another physician who proceeded to remove a stone from a man who had been stabbed in the bladder; the stone was large, so he acted rashly and removed it with a piece of the bladder's substance. So the man died after about three days, and I had been called to remove it; and I saw from the size of the stone and the condition of the patient that I could have done so.
And I saw another physician who earned his living practicing medicine amongst some of the brothel keepers of our city.
Then a black boy came to him with a fracture in his leg near the heel, together with a wound.  The physician, in his ignorance, hastily bound the fracture over the wound with bandages and splints very tightly, and left no room for the wound to breathe.
Then he gave free rein to his desires, and left him for several days, ordering him not to untie the bandage until his leg and foot swelled and he was on the verge of death.
So I was called to him, and I quickly untied the bandage; then he found relief and was freed from his pains, except that the corruption had become firmly established in the limb, and I was unable to check it.
And the corruption continued to spread in the limb until he died.
And I saw another physician cauterize a cancerous tumor, which ulcerated after several days, until the suffering of its owner became great. This is because if a cancer is purely of a black humor, then it should never be treated with an iron instrument at all.
Unless it is in a limb that can be entirely excised.
Therefore, my son, you should know that manual operations are divided into two parts: an operation accompanied by safety, and an operation accompanied by harm in most cases.
And I have warned in every place in this book where such dangerous and risky procedures occur, and you should avoid and reject them.
Lest the ignorant find a way to criticize and attack, take for yourselves caution and circumspection, and for your patients gentleness and deliberation.
And use the best method leading to safety and a favorable outcome, and avoid dangerous and difficult-to-cure diseases.
And purify yourselves from that which you fear might cast doubt on your religion and your worldly life, for this is more lasting for your reputation and higher in this world and the hereafter for your status.
For Galen said in some of his precepts: Do not treat a bad disease, lest you become a bad physician.
This treatise is divided into three sections.
The first section.
Concerning cauterization with fire and cauterization with strong medicine, methodically ordered from head to foot, with images of the instruments and cautery irons and everything needed for the work by hand.
And the second section.
Concerning incision, puncture, bloodletting, cupping, wounds, and the extraction of arrows and the like, all methodically ordered with images of the instruments.
And the third section.
Concerning setting, reduction, and the treatment of dislocations and the like, methodically ordered from head to foot, with images of the instruments.
The first section.
On cauterization.
And before we mention its use, it is necessary that we mention the manner of its benefits and harms, and in what temperament it is used.
So I say that the discussion of the manner of the benefit of cauterization and its harms is a lengthy discussion and a precise science and a hidden secret, and a number of wise men have spoken about it.
And they differed in it, and I have shortened from their speech a little for fear of lengthening.
So I say that cauterization generally benefits every bad temperament that is with matter and without matter, except for two temperaments, which are the hot temperament without matter and the dry temperament without matter.
As for the dry temperament with matter, they differed in it.  Some of them said that cauterization is beneficial in it, and others said the opposite, that cauterization is not suitable in a disease that is from heat and dryness, because the nature of fire is heat and dryness.
And it is impossible to be cured from a hot dry disease with a hot dry medicine. And he who says the opposite said that cauterization with fire may benefit from a hot dry disease that occurs in the bodies of people. Because when you add the body of man and its moisture to the temperament of fire, you make the body of man cold.
And I say as he says, because experience has revealed this to me many times, except that one should not imagine that matter except one who has trained and practiced in the field of cauterization a thorough training. And he has understood the difference in the temperaments of people and the state of diseases in themselves, their causes, their symptoms, and their duration.
As for the other temperaments, there is no fear from them, especially cold and moist diseases. All physicians have agreed on them and have not differed in the benefit of cauterization in them.
And know, O my son, that one of the secrets of cauterization with fire and its superiority over cauterization with a burning drug is that fire is a simple element whose effect does not exceed the member that has been cauterized, and it does not harm another connected member except with a slight harm.
And cauterization with a burning drug may extend its effect to other members, and it may cause a disease in the member that is difficult to treat, and it may even kill. Fire, because of its nobility and the excellence of its essence, does not do that except if one overdoes it.
This has become clear to us through experience, long service, attention to the craft, and understanding the realities of the matter.
For this reason I have dispensed with lengthy discourse. Were it not unbecoming of this book of mine, I would have presented to you concerning fire a hidden secret and the manner of its action in bodies and its removal of diseases with philosophical, demonstrative discourse too subtle for your understanding.
And know, O my sons, that they have differed concerning the time suitable for cauterization, and they have considered the best time to be springtime.
And I say that cauterization is suitable at any time, because the harm caused by the time is consumed by the benefit which is brought about by cauterization. Especially if the cauterization is for strong, necessary, urgent pains which do not tolerate delay, because of the fear that what follows may be a calamity greater than the slight harm caused by the time.
And let it not occur to you, O my sons, what the common people and ignorant physicians imagine, that cauterization which cures a disease will never recur, and that you should make it a prohibition.
And the matter is not as they imagine, because cauterization is only like a medicine which changes the temperament and dries the humors which are the cause of the pains.
Except that cauterization is preferable to medicine in the speed of its success, the strength of its action, and the intensity of its power.
And it is possible that the disease may return after a time, according to the temperament of the patient, the strength of his disease, and the accumulation of humors in his body, and his negligence in acquiring them from foods and similar causes.
Except that the disease in which cauterization is used is a mild disease and in a member with few humors and moistures. Like cauterizing a tooth for pain and the like, for it is possible that that pain will not return, and that is in the least.
And as for the common people's saying also that cauterization is the last resort of medicine, it is a correct saying, not to what they go to, for they believe that no treatment is beneficial by medicine or otherwise after cauterization has taken place, and the matter is contrary to that.
And the meaning of cauterization being the last resort of medicine is only that when we use various treatments for a disease and those medicines do not work, then we use cauterization as a last resort, and it works; from here it is said that cauterization is the last resort of medicine. Not in the sense that the common people and many ignorant physicians went to.
The ancients mentioned that cauterization with gold is better than cauterization with iron, and they said that because of the moderation of gold and the nobility of its essence, and they said that it does not suppurate the place of cauterization, and that is not absolutely the case.
Because I have tried it and found that it only does that in some bodies and not others, and cauterization with it is better and more excellent than with iron, as they said, except that if you heat the cautery iron in the fire made of gold, you cannot determine when it is heated to the degree you want because of the redness of the gold.
And because it quickly gets cold, and if you increase the heat, it melts in the fire and sticks, so the craftsman is busy with that; therefore, cauterization with iron is, for us, quicker and closer to the correct practice, God willing.
I have arranged this chapter on cauterization in sections that I have organized from head to foot, to make it easier for the student to find what he wants, God willing.
Chapter One.
Cauterization of the head, one cauterization.
This cauterization benefits from the predominance of moisture and coldness in the brain, which are the cause of headache, and frequent colds from the head to the area of the eyes and ears, excessive sleep, and toothache and throat pain. And in short, for every illness that arises from coldness, such as paralysis, epilepsy, and catalepsy, and similar illnesses.
The image of this cauterization is that you first order the patient to vomit using a purgative medicine that cleanses the head for three or four nights, according to the strength of the patient, his age, and his habit.
Then you order him to shave his head with a razor, then you seat him before you cross-legged, having placed his hands on his chest.
Then you place the base of your palm on the root of his nose between his eyes; where your middle finger ends, mark that spot with ink.
Then heat the olive-shaped cautery, which is of this form.
Expose the bone to the extent of the head of a clove or the size of a carob seed; then raise your hand, or else replace your hand with the same instrument or another if it has cooled. Until you see of the bone what I have mentioned to you; then take some salt, dissolve it in water, and soak a cotton swab in it, place it on the spot, and leave it for three days.
Then apply a cotton swab soaked in butter to it and leave it there until the eschar from the cautery separates; then treat it with the four-ingredient ointment until it heals, God willing.
And they have said that the longer a wound remains open, the better and more useful it is for the pus to drain.
And some have mentioned cauterizing the skin to the bone, holding the cautery until some of the thickness of the bone is burned, then removing what has been burned from the bone, and then treating it.
And others said that it is necessary to exaggerate with the cautery until it strongly affects the bone, until it falls from the bone like a carat or a small flake, and they claimed that this vents the vapors of the head from that place and leaves the wound open for a long time.
Then treat it until it heals.  I do not see these two types of cautery at all except in some people and in a haphazard way, and leaving it alone is better for me and safer. If it is done, then the head weakens when its natural connection is broken, as we have seen in other members.
Especially if the patient's head is naturally weak. The first type of cautery is safer and better in my opinion, and I use it, so act according to it and you will be safe, God willing.
Chapter Two.
Also on cauterizing the head.
If a chronic pain occurs in the head and it persists for the patient, and poultices, collyria, snuffs, ointments, and dressings have been used, especially if a single cauterization as we described has been performed and none of that has helped him, then look. If the patient's head is naturally strong and not weak, and he feels intense cold, cauterize him again a little above the previous cauterization. Then cauterize each temple of his head until the thickness of the skin is gone and the amount of bone we described is exposed. And cauterize him in the back of his head in the place known as the hatchet, and lighten your hand in this, and do not expose the bone, for the patient will find this very painful, unlike the pain of all the other cauterizations of the head, and I will mention this cauterization in its place.
The cautery with which the temples and the back of the head are cauterized should be gentler than the cautery with which the middle of the head is cauterized.  This is its form.
Chapter Three.
On cauterizing non-chronic migraine.
If pain occurs in a fissure of the head along with headache, and the pain extends to the eye, then let the patient vomit with purgative medicines for the head, and use all the treatment that I mentioned in the classifications of diseases. If that does not work, then cauterization is done in two ways. Either cauterization with a sharp, burning medicine or with iron.
As for cauterization with a burning medicine, it is that you take one clove of garlic, peel it, and cut its ends from both sides, then incise the place of pain in the temple with a wide scalpel until there is a space under the skin that can accommodate the clove.
Then insert it under the skin until it disappears, then bind it tightly with bandages, and leave it for about fifteen hours, then unbind it, remove the garlic, and leave the wound for two or three days, then dress it.
Dress it with cotton soaked in butter until the place suppurates, then treat it with ointment until it heals, God willing. And if you wish, do this with some of the burning medicines that I gave in the eighteenth chapter on burning medicines.
As for cauterization with iron, it is in this manner: heat the cautery, whose image is this:
And it is called the nail cautery because its head is like the shape of a nail, with some perforation and a small projection in its middle.
Then you place it on the painful area and hold your hand while you rotate the iron little by little, and the amount you burn should be half the thickness of the skin. And lift your hand so that you do not burn the artery underneath and cause bleeding, then soak cotton in salt water and place it on the area and leave it for three days. Then you dress the cotton with ointment, then treat it with ointment until it heals, God willing.
And if you wish, cauterize this migraine with the knife-like end of the cautery, and this preserves from cutting the artery in this chronic migraine especially.
Chapter Four.
Cauterization of chronic migraine.
If you treat the migraine with what we have mentioned of the preceding treatment and what we mentioned in the divisions of diseases, and the treatment is not effective, and you see from the illness something that what we mentioned of the first cauterization with medicine or cauterization with fire does not overcome. Then it is necessary that you heat the knife-like cautery until it whitens after you mark the place of the pain with a line the length of half a finger or so, and you leave your hand once while you pull it until you cut the artery and reach toward the bone.
Except that it is necessary for you to be cautious of the contact of the jaw which moves upon chewing, lest you burn the muscle or the nerve that moves it, and thus cause spasm.
And be cautious and watchful of bleeding from the artery which you cut, for in its cutting there is danger. Especially for one who is ignorant of what he does and has not been a trained and experienced person; and leaving the work is better.
And the treatment of bleeding which occurs from the artery will be mentioned in its place in the book, God willing; but if you see from the illness something which this cautery does not cure,
and you see the body of the patient able to bear it, cauterize him in the middle of the head as we have described, and treat the wound until it heals, God willing.
And if you wish, use the cautery which we mentioned in the chapter on the incision of the artery with the double-bladed cautery, for it is a better and more effective cautery than this.
Chapter Five.
In cauterizing the pains of the ears.
If a pain occurs in the ear due to cold and it is treated with laxatives and all the treatments that we mentioned in the classification and the pain does not go away, then heat the cautery which is called the point, whose image is this.
Then, after heating it, apply it with dots around the whole ear, or around both if the pain is in both. And keep the cauterization a little away from the root of the ear, after marking the place with ink. The cauterization should be about ten points in each ear, or thereabouts. Then treat the places until they heal, God willing.
Chapter Six.
Cauterization of the tonsils.
The tonsils treated by cauterization are of the type caused by phlegm, as I mentioned in the classifications of diseases.
And avoid cauterizing the type that occurs from dryness and nerve spasms.
When you have treated this type of tonsil condition with applications, snuffs, and gargles, and your treatment has not been effective, then the patient should be cauterized with three cauterizations. One at the root of the ear, the second a little below the temple, and the third at the junction of the lips.
Make your cautery on the opposite side of the affected area, because relaxation occurs on the side that appears healthy.
The image of the cauterization is that you cauterize with a cautery opposite the upper tip of the ear, slightly below the horn of the head, and another in the temple, its length being the length of the thumb.
Lower your hand with the cautery until you burn about half the thickness of the skin.  This is the image of the cautery; it is a type of knife, the image of which has been presented earlier, but it is slightly gentler, as you see. The knife should be slightly thicker than necessary. Then treat the area as previously mentioned until it heals, God willing.
Chapter Seven.
Cauterization of chronic apoplexy.
If the apoplexy becomes chronic and you treat it with what we have mentioned and your treatment is ineffective, and the patient does not have a fever, cauterize in four places. One cauterization on each temple, one in the middle of the head as previously mentioned, and one at the back of the head as before.
The description of the cauterizations is as previously mentioned.  It may also be cauterized on the stomach's opening, which will be more effective, then treat as previously mentioned.
Chapter Eight.
On cauterizing forgetfulness.
If it is from phlegm, the patient should first be given strong purgatives and pills that cleanse the brain.
Then his whole head should be shaved and a mustard plaster, described in the chapter on plasters, should be applied to the back of his head repeatedly, for it is a kind of cauterization.
Do this in exactly the same order as I described there. If he is cured by this, well and good; otherwise, perform three cauterizations on the back of his head, arranged in a row from the top of the head to the bottom of the neck.
Make the distance between each cauterization the width of a finger.  Then treat the cauterization as described above. If you wish to increase [the treatment] and the patient can tolerate it, cauterize the middle again.
If you wish to increase [the treatment], cauterize the temples, then treat it until it heals. The cautery should be olive-shaped, as described previously.
Chapter Nine.
On cauterizing paralysis and general bodily relaxation.
It is necessary that you first purify the head with purgatives and as we have mentioned. Then shave the patient's head, then cauterize: one cauterization in the middle of the head, one on each temple, and one on the back of the head.
And three on the vertebrae of the neck. If, in the case of general bodily relaxation, you need more and the patient can tolerate it and the disease is strong and persistent, then cauterize four times on the vertebrae of his back. And continue cauterizing until you burn most of the skin, then lift your hand and then treat him as previously mentioned until he recovers, God willing. And let the cautery be olive-shaped.
Chapter Ten.
On cauterizing epilepsy.
Only the epileptic whose epilepsy is caused by phlegm should be cauterized.  It is necessary to first cleanse his brain with strong purgatives and with all the other treatments which we have mentioned in the classification, if the patient is an adult and able to take medicines.
But if he is a child who cannot tolerate medicines, let him use gargles and masticatories which cleanse the brain many days beforehand, along with improving his diet.
Then his head is shaved, and one cauterization is applied in the middle of the head, as described above, and another cauterization at the back of his head. And one cauterization on each temple of his head. If the patient is strong and able to tolerate it, apply the cauterizations which were mentioned for the paralytic and for those with muscle relaxation, on the vertebrae of the neck and the vertebrae of the back.  The cautery should be olive-shaped, as described above.
If the patient is a child, make the cautery gentle in this manner.
Chapter Eleven.
On cauterizing melancholia.
If the cause of melancholia is corrupt humors and thick phlegm, apply the cauterizations which we mentioned for the paralytic.
If the cause of melancholia is an excess tending towards black bile and the patient's body is moist, purge him so as to cleanse his brain, as explained previously in the classification.
Then shave the patient's head, then make a firm cake of linen like a circle, then place it in the middle of his head, the patient sitting cross-legged holding it from each side, then take one pound of old sheep fat.
Then heat it over a fire with moderate heat, as much as the finger can bear when inserted, then pour it into the middle of his head in the circle and leave it until it cools.  Do this for the patient once a week along with all other good treatment until he recovers, God willing.
And if you wish, cauterize it with many small punctures, without holding your hand to the cautery, but rather by sprinkling; for this type of cautery moistens the brain moderately.
Then apply a cotton wool compress soaked in butter or chicken fat.
Chapter Twelve.
On cauterizing a running eye.
If you ascertain the onset of a running eye by the signs mentioned in the classification, then act quickly; purge the patient, cleanse his head and protect it from all moisture, and sweat him in the bath on an empty stomach for several days.
Then shave his head and apply a cautery to the middle of the head, then two cauteries to the temples if the running is in both eyes, or to one side if it is in one eye.
Then cut with the cautery all the veins and arteries under the skin; let the cauteries be lengthwise across the temples, and guard against bleeding.
If you see any of it, cut it immediately with any treatment available to you.  We shall discuss the wisdom of cutting arteries and veins and guarding against bleeding.
And two strong cauteries may be applied to the nape of the neck below the bones.
Chapter Thirteen.
On cauterizing chronic weeping sores.
If the tears of the eye are chronic and persistent, and are from the veins and arteries on the surface of the head, outside the head, and you are certain that it is from a cold, thick, phlegmatic excess, then cauterize it with the cautery described at the beginning for the treatment of the descending water. One cautery in the middle of the head, and two cauteries on the temples, and two cauteries on the nape of the neck below the bones; and if you need more, then cauterize one on each side of the corner of the eye at the edge of the eyebrow with a small cautery iron.
Chapter Fourteen.
On cauterizing the foul smell of the nose.
If you treat it with what we mentioned in the classification and the treatment is not effective, then quickly make the patient fast on quince for three nights, then shave his head and cauterize the middle with the olive-shaped cautery iron. Then cauterize with the nail-shaped cautery iron two cauteries above the eyebrows, a little below the hair, and be careful of the artery, do not cut it.  And this is the image of the nail-shaped [cautery iron].
Chapter Fifteen.
On cauterizing the relaxation of the eyelid.
If the eyelid relaxes from illness or dampness, cauterize the eyelid with one cauterization using this crescent-shaped cautery iron.
And if you wish, cauterize a little above the eyebrows, two cauterizations on each side, and keep them distant from the temples, and let the length of each cauterization be the length of the eyebrow.
And do not exaggerate your hand with the cauterization, but only to the extent that a third of the skin is burnt, and the shape of the cautery iron is like this.
Chapter Sixteen.
On cauterizing the eyelid.
If its lids are inverted inwards so that they prick the eye, then cauterization is of two types. Either cauterization with fire or cauterization with a burning medicine. As for cauterization with fire, you should order the patient beforehand to leave his eyelids alone, if he is one who plucks them, until they grow long and become even.
If it pricks him while they are growing, then tie his eyes with a bandage so that they do not move until they grow. When they have grown and become even, place the patient's head in your lap, then mark on the eyelid with ink a sign in the shape of an upside-down letter "S".
The beginning of the mark should be near the eyelids. Then place under the eyelid cotton soaked in egg white or in the saliva of a lizard. Then heat a cautery iron, this is its shape.
Then cauterize according to the mark you made, little by little, in many times, until the surface of the skin, which is in the shape of the upside-down letter "S", is completely burnt, especially its surface. A sign that your work is correct is to see the eyelid curl and the hair rise from the flesh of the eye.
Then lift your hand and leave it for three days. Then apply cotton with butter to it until the scab falls off. Then treat it with ointment until it heals, God willing. If some of the hair returns after a time and the eyelid relaxes,
repeat the cauterization in that place as you did before. If the hair is in the lower eyelid, cauterize it until it returns to its natural position and the hair does not prick the eye. As for cauterization with a burning drug, you should order the patient to leave the eyelids until they grow long and even.
Then make from paper the shape of an upside-down letter S. Then take from the usual soap and from unslaked lime, of each one a drachm weight or so. Crush them all well together, and do this quickly lest it dry. Then spread some of it on the paper you made in the shape of the upside-down letter S, and place it on one or both eyelids. Place cotton soaked in egg white under the eye, and the patient's head in your lap.
Place your index finger over the medication and hold it down slightly, while moving it whenever the patient feels the sting of the medication, for he will feel a burning sensation. As long as he feels the burning, leave the medication and move it with your finger. When the burning subsides, remove the medication and wash the eye with water.
And observe: if you see that the eyelid has risen as it rises when cauterized with fire or by cutting, then do not repeat the medication on the area where the medication has not taken effect and not blackened until you complete your work and the eyelid is cauterized, then put cotton with butter on it until the burning subsides.
Then treat it with palm ointment or another until it heals.  It is necessary for you during the procedure to be extremely careful that nothing of the medication falls into the eye. If the eyelid relaxes after days, and something like a hair is suspected in the eye,
then reapply the medication to that relaxed part of the eyelid specifically, as you did initially, then treat it until it heals. This is the image of the upside-down letter S.
Know that people's eyes differ in size, so let your cauterization be according to that. The correct method is not hidden from one who is experienced in this craft.
Chapter Seventeen.
Concerning the cauterization of the canthus which appears at the corner of the eye.
If you treat the fistula with what we mentioned in the divisions of diseases and your treatment is not effective, then it should be cauterized in this manner.
Order the patient to place his head in your lap, and let a servant hold his head in your hands so that he does not move or shake his head.
Then place a cotton ball soaked in egg white or in the saliva of a frog on his eyes, then heat the cautery iron, whose image is this.
It should be hollow like the quill of an eagle, hollow at one end which will be used for cauterization; and if you wish, it may be perforated at the other end, or if you wish, it may be solid like an awl, but this hollow one is better for your work, God willing.
Then squeeze the fistula if it is open and remove its contents and dry it, or if it is not open, open it and remove its pus, then place the very hot cautery iron on it and hold it with your hand until it reaches the bone.
And move your hand slightly away from the eye towards the nose during cauterization, lest your hand should err or the patient should move, and the cautery iron should fall into the conjunctiva and damage it. If you reach the bone with the first cauterization, well and good; otherwise, repeat the cauterization a second time if you need to.
Leave it for three days, then apply cotton soaked in butter and treat it with drying ointment until it heals. If forty days have passed and it has not healed, apply a strong, corrosive medicine until the bone is exposed and remove it as will be mentioned in its chapter, God willing.
Another method of cauterizing a fistula, mentioned by some of the ancients:  you go to the site of the fistula, incise it, and then place a thin cone in the incision itself; this is its image.
And pour into it the weight of a dirham of molten lead, and hold your hand on the cone firmly and tightly, and the patient must not move at all, lest the molten lead flow into his eye; and you should place on the patient's eye cotton soaked in egg white or in water.
For the lead will burn the site of the fistula and heal it wonderfully. If the fistula heals with the cauterization and treatment that we have mentioned, well and good; otherwise, it is necessary to use the perforation of the nose and return the fistula to the nasal passage, as will be explained in its special place.
Chapter Eighteen.
On cauterizing a cleft lip.
A cleft often occurs in the lip, called a harelip, especially in the lips of children; for it often occurs. If you treat this cleft with what we mentioned in the section and the treatment is not effective, then heat a small, knife-like cautery of this shape.
Its cavity should be as thin as a knife. Then apply it, hot, quickly into the cleft itself, until the cautery reaches the depth of the cleft; then treat it with the kyrioti, until it heals, God willing.
Chapter Nineteen.
On cauterizing a canker sore occurring in the mouth.
If a swelling appears at the root of the gums, or in the palate, or at the roots of the molars, then it suppurates and bursts, and from the running of the pus a fistula results, and you treat it but the treatment is not effective, then you should heat a cautery to the extent that it fits into the fistula.
Then insert it, hot, into the hole of the fistula, and hold your hand until the heated iron reaches its depth and end. Do this once or twice; then treat it afterwards with what we have mentioned of treatment, until it heals, God willing.
If the material is cut off and it heals, well and good; otherwise, it is necessary to examine the place, and the decayed bone is removed according to what will come in its chapter, God willing.
Chapter Twenty.
Concerning the loosening of molars and gums.
If the gums are loosened due to moisture and the molars become mobile, and you have treated them with medication but it has not worked, then place the patient's head in your lap, then heat the cautery iron, whose image comes after this, after you have placed the tube on the tooth.
And insert the hot cautery iron quickly, and hold your hand for a short time until the patient feels the heat of the fire has reached the root of the tooth, then lift your hand, then return the cautery iron repeatedly as you wish, then the patient fills his mouth with salt water.
And he holds it for an hour and then spits it out; for the mobile tooth becomes firm, and the loosened gum becomes strong, and the corrupt moisture dries.
Chapter Twenty-One.
In cauterizing the toothache.
If the toothache is from cold, or if there are worms in it and medication has not been effective, then cauterization is done in two ways: either cauterization with butter, or cauterization with fire.
As for cauterization with butter, you take cow's butter and boil it in an iron spoon or in a shell, then you take cotton and wrap it around the end of a probe, then you dip it in the boiled butter and quickly place it on the aching tooth and hold it until it cools.
Then repeat it several times until the strength of the fire reaches the root of the tooth. And if you wish, dip wool or cotton in cold butter and place it on the aching tooth and place a heated iron on top of it until the fire reaches the bottom of the tooth.
As for cauterization with fire, you take a brass or iron tube, and it should have some thickness so that the heat of the fire does not reach the patient's mouth. Then heat the cautery iron to the appropriate temperature and place it on the tooth itself, holding your hand until the cautery iron cools. Do this repeatedly.
Then the pain will go away, either that same day or the next day. After the cauterization, the patient should fill his mouth with good butter and hold it for an hour, then spit it out. This is the image of the cautery iron.
Cauterize with whichever end you wish, as is convenient. This is the image of the tube.
Chapter Twenty-Two.
On cauterizing fistulas.
If fistulas are due to phlegm and cold humors and do not yield to ripening by medication, and you desire a quick ripening, heat a hollow cautery iron, which has this image, perforated at both ends.
Let the smoke exit at the other end during cauterization.  Place it, protected, on the fistula itself once or twice, if necessary, until you reach the depth of the fistula. If the fistula is small, make the cautery iron the size of the fistula.
Then leave it for three days and apply a cotton swab soaked in butter until what was burned by fire is gone. Then treat it with ointment and tents until it heals, God willing.
Chapter twenty-three.
On cauterization for hoarseness and shortness of breath.
If humors prevail in the trachea, especially if this is accompanied by coldness of temperament, then the patient should first be purged with purgative medicines, then cauterize with a cautery in the depression of the neck at the root of the throat in the lower location.
Beware of reaching the throat with the cautery and do not burn more than half of the skin. Then apply another cautery at the joint of the neck at the end of its last vertebra, and let the cautery be nail-shaped in the manner previously described.
Then treat him with what has been mentioned until he recovers, God willing.
Chapter twenty-four.
On cauterizing lung disease and cough.
If the cough and lung disease are due to cold humors and the patient has no fever or consumption, and the disease is chronic, apply two cauteries above the clavicles in the low, soft, empty areas, and another cautery in the middle of the chest between the breasts.
The cautery should be nail-shaped, as previously described.  If you wish, let your cautery be by puncturing with the cautery called the "point," the image of which has been shown previously in puncturing earache, and let the punctures number around thirty.
Then treat him with what has been previously mentioned until he recovers. You may also make a cautery with three branches in this form, and it hastens the cauterization, because you cauterize with it three areas at once. This is the image of the cautery.
Chapter Twenty-Five.
On cauterizing the armpit.
If the head of the humerus is dislocated because of slippery humors, or if it does not remain fixed when it is reduced from its dislocation so that this becomes a habit, then it dislocates at the slightest movement, as we have seen, then it is necessary to reduce the joint first. Then the patient lies on his back or on his sound side, and then the skin inside the armpit is raised upwards with the fingers of your left hand if the joint is dislocated inwards.
Then heat the cautery iron with two heads, of which this is the image.
Then cauterize the skin with it until it penetrates to the other side, and the shape of the cauterization will be four cauterizations.  It may be cauterized with a cautery iron with three heads, and then the shape of the cauterization will be six cauterizations, and the heads will be as fine as a rose.
And this is the image of the cautery iron with three heads.
And this number may be increased by one, so that the cauterizations are eight. Then, apply to the cauterization balls pounded with salt, then keep the patient quiet and do not move the limb for a while until it strengthens. And if the dislocation is upwards, and that is rarely the case.
Then cauterize above the shoulder one good, nail-shaped cauterization, or many cauterizations in a dotted pattern, for the joint will stiffen, and the moisture will leave, and the patient will heal.
Chapter twenty-six.
On cauterizing the stomach.
If there occurs in the stomach coldness and much moisture, until it is put out of its temperament and the catarrhs to it increase, and it is treated with various treatments, but to no avail, then the patient should lie on his back, and extend his legs and arms, then cauterize three cauterizations. One cauterization under the breastbone, the size of a finger, with a nail-shaped cautery, and two cauterizations below on the sides of the first cauterization, so that the shape of the cauterizations is triangular, and farther apart so that they do not come together if they suppurate.  The depth of the cauterization should be about two-thirds the thickness of the skin, and this should be the shape of the cauterizations.
In this manner and to this extent, no more.
And if you wish, cauterize it with one large cauterization in the middle of the stomach in this manner.
And the cautery with which you cauterize this single cauterization should be in the shape of a circle, in this manner.
And the stomach may be cauterized by puncturing for whoever is afraid of this cauterization. This is done by marking points on the stomach with ink to the desired extent, then cauterizing them with a punctate cautery, then treating it with the treatment previously described until it heals.
Chapter twenty-seven.
On the cold cauterization of the liver.
If pain arises from the liver due to coldness and dampness, or due to a slight wind, to the extent that it has excessively departed from its natural temperament, and the patient is treated with what we mentioned in the division, and that does not work, then the patient should lie on his back, and three cauterizations should be marked with ink in this shape and this exact amount on the liver, below the diaphragm where the human elbow ends.
And after each cauterization, there should be a cauterization of the thickness of a finger, and the cauterization should be straight along the body, and do not press down firmly with the cautery.
Let the thickness of the skin burned be about half, no more; and let the patient stand on his feet; if he cannot stand, let him lie down with his legs stretched out and his arms raised.  This is the image of the cautery.
And you may cauterize these cauterizations with a knife-cautery if you are gentle and skillful in the craft, and take care lest you overdo the cauterization and burn all the skin, burning the abdomen and reaching the intestines, for the skin there is thin; so know this.
Chapter Twenty-Eight.
On cauterizing a swelling of the liver.
If an abscess appears in the liver, and you wish to know if that swelling is in the liver flesh or in its peritoneum, then if it is in the liver flesh, the patient will feel heaviness and pain without sharpness.
And if it is in the peritoneum of the liver, there will be intense sharpness with the pain, and you see that physicians have been unable to treat it, then the patient should lie on his back, and then you should mark the swollen area with ink.
Then heat the cautery in the fire; it is the cautery that resembles a mill; and this is its image. And cauterize it with one cauterization until you burn all the skin and the cauterization reaches the peritoneum, until all the pus comes out; then treat it with the treatment of abscesses until it heals.
And this type of cauterization should not be used except by one whose training in the art of medicine has been long, and who has repeatedly experienced these diseases; then he may undertake such work, but leaving it is better in my opinion.
Chapter twenty-nine.
In cauterizing the fistula.
The ancients mentioned cauterization with the roots of rhubarb for a cold fistula in this manner: that you take one long, dry root of rhubarb, the longest you can find, and let it be about the thickness of a finger, then dip it in oil and heat it in the fire. Then apply one cauterization between the junction of the clavicle and the neck, and two small cauterizations a little below the jugular veins, inclined towards the side under the chin, and two large cauterizations above the breasts, between the third and fourth ribs.
And two cauterizations also between the fifth and sixth ribs, slightly inclined backwards, and another cauterization in the middle of the chest, and another above the stomach, and three cauterizations on the back: one between the shoulder blades, and two on the sides of the spine, lower than the cauterization which is between the shoulder blades.
And you should not deepen your hand with the cautery, but it should be a superficial cauterization of the skin. Some of the ancients mentioned that some people used an iron cautery like a file, which they heated and inserted between the ribs until it reached the tumor itself.
And the pus is discharged as we mentioned in liver tumors.  In this method of cauterization there is great danger; either the patient dies immediately, or a fistula forms at the site which will not heal.
Chapter Thirty.
On the cauterization of the spleen.
If you treat the disease of the spleen with what we have mentioned in the classification of treatments, and your treatment is not effective, then cauterization is done in three ways, all correct. One is to cauterize it with three or four cauterizations arranged lengthwise along the spleen.
In the shape of the liver cauterizations whose shape we have described previously, and between each cauterization and the next should be a distance equal to or slightly more than the thickness of a finger. The type of cautery should be as we described for the cauterization of the liver, and do not deepen your cautery, and the patient's position should be lying on his back.
And the other method is in the armpit, and you lift the skin opposite the spleen where the patient's left armpit ends, and you lift the skin opposite the spleen where the patient's left armpit ends, and your lifting of the skin should be across the body so that the cauterizations fall along the length of the body.
Then you insert two extremely hot cauteries until they penetrate the skin on the other side, then you remove the cautery, so that there are four cauterizations. And if you wish, you can cauterize with the other cautery with three points.
Then you treat the site of the cauterization after you leave it to suppurate for many days; this is more effective than all the treatments mentioned previously.
Chapter Thirty-One.
On cauterizing dropsy.
Cauterization is only beneficial in ascitic dropsy specifically. If you treat the dropsical patient with the various treatments we mentioned in the classification, and your treatment is not effective, then you should cauterize him with four cauterizations around the navel and one cauterization on the abdomen.
Another cauterization on the liver, one on the spleen, and two on his back between the vertebrae—one opposite his chest and another opposite his stomach. The depth of the cauterization should be approximately the thickness of the skin. Then leave the cauterization open to suppurate for a long time.
And do not neglect the patient after cauterization with what is necessary to combine the two aims, so that healing is hastened.  The shape of the cautery iron used to cauterize the back should be nail-shaped, as its shape was previously described, and that used to cauterize the abdomen should be olive-shaped.
Chapter thirty-two.
On cauterizing the feet and legs.
If they swell in dropsy and fill with yellow water, then it is necessary to cauterize on the dorsum of the foot in the depression between the little toe and the ring finger.
And place your hand with the cautery iron and do not bend it, then raise your hand and do not return it at all, for the yellow water will exude, and the cautery iron should be of this shape.
Then cauterize the legs, two cauterizations on each leg. The cauterization should be with the sharp end of the cautery iron, and the cauterizations should be along the length of the leg, one below the knee and another below that towards the middle of the leg, and on each thigh two cauterizations.
And leave the cauterization open without treatment for a long time, so that the water may exude, then treat it with what we have mentioned.
Chapter Thirty-Three.
On cauterizing diarrhea.
If the diarrhea is from cold and dampness, so that it weakens the retaining and digestive powers in the stomach and intestines, and this has been treated with various treatments and it has not healed, and you see that the patient can tolerate cauterization and is strong, then cauterize him with a large cauterization on his stomach. As has been described in cauterizing the stomach with the circular cautery and four cauterizations around the navel gently with the gentle nail cautery, and a cauterization on the cotton above the coccyx, large or two.
If you see that the dampness is abundant and the patient can tolerate it, then cauterize him on the pubis and cauterize him on each flank, and perhaps you can add two small cauterizations to the stomach near the large one, for this is a successful treatment whose benefit is not missed, God willing.
Chapter thirty-four.
On cauterizing the hemorrhoids of the anus.
If there are chronic, numerous, or single hemorrhoids in the anus, and they are from thick, cold humors or putrid dampness, and they have been treated with what we mentioned in the classification, and the treatment has not been effective, then cauterize the patient with three cauterizations on the lower part of the sacrum, a little below the coccyx, triangularly.
Cauterize below the navel by the width of two fingers.  And if you estimate that his stomach is cold and his food is not digested, and you see his face swollen, then cauterize him on the stomach with a large cauterization as previously described, and cauterize on his liver. And another on his spleen with a nail-shaped cautery iron. Leave the cauterization open for a while, then treat him until he is healed, God willing.
Chapter thirty-five.
On cauterizing warts.
After cutting it, if the wart is cut, heat the cautery iron that resembles a needle, then insert it hot into the same cut wart and persevere until the cautery iron reaches the opening of the vein from which blood flows. Do this once or twice.
If the warts are numerous, cauterize each one as we have described, then treat them with suitable ointments until they heal.  And if you cauterize it with a large cauterization on cotton, it will be more effective.
Chapter thirty-six.
On cauterizing fistulas that are in the anus and its surroundings.
If the patient does not respond to the incision and the procedure we described in its place and shrinks from it, then perhaps he will heal with cauterization. If a fistula occurs and pus and corrupt moisture flow from it for a long time, then the first thing you should do is measure it with a thin probe.
Then know the depth of its cavity with the probe, then heat the cautery iron which resembles a needle, then insert it, hot, into the fistula itself, along the straight line of the fistula's depth and the extent to which the probe entered, and repeat the cauterization until all those corrupt bodies are burned, once or twice or three times, according to your need.
And be careful not to burn a nerve, if there is one, or a large vein, and if the fistula leads to the body of the bladder or to the body of the intestine.
Guard against all these places.  You do this only if the fistula is in a fleshy place and you judge that it is not penetrating. Then treat the place until it heals. If the place closes and the materials cease and it remains so for a time, then know that it has completely healed.
And if the materials do not cease from it, then know that it is penetrating, or that in its depth there is a corrupt bone, or something similar, which will be mentioned in its place.
Chapter Thirty-Seven.
On cauterizing the kidneys.
If pain occurs in the kidneys from cold or a strong wind, and the patient's sexual function is diminished because of this, then it is necessary to cauterize it on the loins, on the kidneys themselves.  Cauterize each kidney with the nail-shaped cautery previously mentioned. And perhaps you will cauterize it a third time in the same session. Then three cauterizations will be applied in a row, and this will be more effective.
Chapter Thirty-Eight.
On cauterizing the bladder.
If weakness and relaxation occur in the bladder from cold and dampness, so that the patient cannot retain urine, then cauterize it with one cauterization below the navel, on the bladder where the pubic hair begins, and one cauterization to the right of the navel and another to its left.
The cauterization on each side should be the size of the thumb joint.  And cauterize with one cauterization in the lower back, or two if needed.  The cautery should be nail-shaped, as previously mentioned.
Chapter Thirty-Nine.
On cauterizing the uterus.
If a substance from cold and dampness occurs in the uterus, and because of that it is prevented from conception and its temperament is corrupted and its courses are impeded, or pain occurs with the onset of menstruation, then three cauterizations should be made around the navel, as we mentioned in cauterizing the bladder. One cauterization on cotton in the lower back, or two, and the cautery should be nail-shaped.
Chapter Forty.
On cauterizing a dislocated hip.
Erroneous humors may descend to the hip joint, causing it to dislocate.  The sign is that the leg is longer than the other when one compares them, and you find emptiness at the place of the dislocation. Then one should cauterize the patient on the hip joint itself with a semi-circular cauterization.
After you have drawn with ink around the joint as it rotates, so that the joint itself falls in the middle of the circle.  The cautery whose image is presented in the cauterization of the stomach should be used. If you do not have this cautery, then use three cauterizations with the large olive-shaped cautery.
Make the cauterization deep enough to reach the entire thickness of the skin, then treat him until he heals, God willing.
Chapter forty-one.
On cauterizing sciatica.
If pain occurs in the hip joint and its cause is cold and dampness, and you have treated the patient with what we mentioned in the section, and the treatment has not been effective and it has become chronic, then it is necessary to evacuate the thick humors from the patient with  stinking beans or prickly pear seeds, or something similar.
Then cauterize it, and perform the cauterization in two ways: either cauterization with burning medicines or cauterization with fire. Cauterization with fire can be done in many ways; one of them is to cauterize on the hip joint itself with three triangular cauterizations in this manner.
Make them of a suitable depth, and let the distance between each cauterization and the next be equal to the thickness of a finger.  The cautery iron should be olive-shaped.  You may also cauterize one in the middle on the head of the hip itself, making four cauterizations; or if you wish, cauterize it with the circle previously mentioned in cauterizing a dislocated hip, as a single cauterization.
So that the circle encompasses the entire hip and burns through the entire thickness of the skin. This is the manner of cauterization for sciatica if the pain is confined to the hip itself and does not extend to the thigh and leg.
If it extends to the thigh and leg, cauterize two cauterizations on the thigh at the location where the patient indicates pain, and one cauterization above the heel four fingers towards the lateral side, slightly. The cautery iron should be knife-shaped, and the depth of the cauterization should be only the thickness of the skin.
If he indicates that the pain extends towards the toes, cauterize where he indicates with a pointed cautery iron three or four times, or more if necessary. If he indicates pain below the knee towards the leg, cauterize there with one knife-shaped cauterization.
And be careful in all your cauterizations not to burn a nerve or a large artery, lest you thereby cause the patient a serious or lasting injury.
And I have seen one and another who was cauterized above the heel, and the cauterization was excessive, so that the leg became gangrenous until the gangrene reached the foot and perforated it entirely, and the whole leg became corrupted, and then diarrhea and death followed. If the pain is in both sides, cauterize them both in this same manner.
Some learned physicians have mentioned regarding cauterization of the hip a cauterization of this type:  A cup-like instrument is made of iron, its diameter being half a span, and at its mouth it should be the thickness of a date pit, or slightly less, and inside this cup is another cup, and a third cup.
And the distance between each cup should be the width of a thumb joint, and the cups should be open on both sides, and their height should be about one or two finger joints.  And a handle of iron is firmly attached to the cups, and this is its image.
Then it is heated in the fire until it glows red and throws off sparks, then it is placed on the hip joint, the patient reclining on the sound side.  Three round cauterizations are performed at once, then he is left for three days and the wound is dressed with butter, and the wound is left open for several days.
Many, then treat it with ointment until it heals. The author of this book said: We have rarely used this type of cauterization because of its ugliness and the horror of its appearance, and because of the few who are found who can endure it; however, it is one of the good cauterizations for whoever endures it and its application is appropriate to the location.
As for cauterization with burning drugs, it is to make two cup-like instruments similar to the rings through which the uvula descends, of copper or iron.
Their rims should have a height of about two finger joints or so, and the distance between them should be the thickness of a finger, and they should be open at the bottom and open at the top, and some of them should be held together in this manner.
Then lower them onto the hip joint, the patient lying on his sound side, and firmly hold your hand, then pour between the two circles some sharp water, which is warmed slightly by the fire, and hold it for the duration of an hourglass; and let the patient endure its sting and burning, for he will feel a burning like fire.
Until the burning subsides, then raise your hand with the instrument and wipe the sharp water from the whole hip with fresh water, then leave it for three days and apply butter to it until the blackness of the burn disappears, and leave it for days so that pus drains from it, for this is more effective.
Then treat it with ointments until it heals. If the pain extends to the thigh or leg, make a mold for it that holds water, in the same way as you did for the hip. This is the description of the sharp water, and I have already described it in the chapter on the preparation of medicines.
Take one part of alkali salt and one part of unslaked lime, crush them and place them in a new pot that has a single small hole in its bottom, large enough for a probe to pass through, and place another glazed pot beneath the bottom of the pot.
And pour fresh water over the alkali and lime to cover them by a finger's breadth, after having pressed them firmly with your hand, and leave the pot until the sharp water descends into the glazed pot below, then collect all that water, then pour it over more fresh lime and alkali.
Then it will be very strong and sharp, useful in many medical procedures and for cauterizing various limbs, because it acts exactly like fire.  There are also other medications that cauterize the hip, such as thapsia, linseed oil, and lime with soap, mixed together.
Galen claimed, recounting a story from an ancient man, a treatment for hip pain and sciatica, greatly emphasizing its importance and claiming that it needs no other treatment and cures in a single application.
To the point that one might enter the bath carried and leave cured.  This is done by taking green verdigris—if green is not available, take fresh dry verdigris—and finely grind it with some fat and apply it to the hip where the pain is, or on the leg, or on the thigh.
Then bind it on and leave it for three hours, or as long as the patient feels the burning subside, then take him to the bath. When his body is damp, put him in the bath; the pain will go away and he will be cured, God willing.  If he is not cured, reapply the poultice after ten days.
Then, God willing, he will be cured. Know that no one should cauterize with these medicines except after the body has been purged. Dioscorides mentioned that goat's hair, when used to cauterize sciatica, is beneficial.
Cauterization is done in this way: take wool, soak it in old oil, and place it on the deep place between the thumb of the hand and the forearm, closer to the forearm. Then take dry goat hair.
Heat it in the fire until it becomes a coal, then place it on the wool and leave it until it goes out. Then take another and continue to do this until sensation reaches from the middle of the upper arm to the hip and the pain subsides, God willing. This type of cauterization is called cauterization with goat hair.
Chapter forty-two.
On cauterizing back pain.
Pain in the back may occur from many causes, either from a fall, a blow, excessive vomiting, and the like. It may be from the effusion of a cold, moist substance. Cauterization is only done in this type alone.
That which is from the effusion of a cold substance, it is necessary after the patient vomits with hellebore and the like, that he be cauterized on his back where the pain is, three rows across the width of the table itself, after marking the place with ink. In each row, five cauterizations or more, according to what you see of the patient's endurance and strength.
And the cauterization will be with a pointed cautery; and if you wish, cauterize it with three or four cauterizations with a medium-sized nail cautery, in this manner.
Chapter forty-three.
On cauterizing the beginning of a hump.
This ailment often affects small children, and its beginning sign in the child is that shortness of breath occurs upon standing and movement, and you find at the end of the vertebrae of his back a bead that has protruded, standing out from the other beads.
If you see that and you wish to stop it, then cauterize it with a cautery that is round, in this manner. Let the cautery take hold on each side of the vertebra evenly. And if you wish, cauterize it around the vertebra with a pointed cautery, two or three rows, and let the points be close to one another. Then treat the area until it heals, as we have mentioned.
And be careful not to use cautery in a hump that is from a spasm of the nerve.
Chapter forty-four.
On cauterizing gout and joint pains.
If joint pains are due to cold humors that settle in any member of the body, and if the pain occurs in the legs, it is customary for physicians to call that specifically gout.
If the gout, which is cold in cause, is treated with the types of treatment we mentioned in the classification, and the pain does not go away, then cautery will remove it. This is done by cauterizing around the joint of the legs after evacuation with many cauterizations. The cautery iron should be olive-shaped and medium-sized, in this manner.
And if you need to punctuate on the surface of the leg, do so with a punctate cautery iron.  If the pain ascends to the knees or to the other joints—and this often happens—cauterize each knee three or four times on each side with this same olive-shaped cautery iron.
If you need more cauterization than this, cauterize, but do not deepen your hand with the cautery; rather, let it be to the thickness of the skin only. If the pain ascends to the hips or to the back, use what we mentioned of cautery in its chapter.
If the pain is only in the hands, punctuate around the forearms as if circling two rows. If the pain remains in the fingers, punctuate each knuckle with a point and the metacarpus. If the pain ascends after days to the elbows or shoulders,
cauterize them on each side. The patient should not be without good management and taking medications, for if he improves his diet and evacuates phlegm, he will be cured with this cautery, God willing.
Chapter Forty-five.
On the cauterization of fistulas.
If a hernia appears in the groin and some of the intestine and epiploon descends to the testicle, and this is recent and beginning, then you should order the patient to abstain from food that day and to use laxatives to evacuate the bowels.
Then he should lie on his back before you, and you should tell him to restrain himself until the epiploon or intestine protrudes, then you should return it with your finger, then you should mark with ink below the hernia on the pubic bone a sign resembling a semicircle, its ends towards the upper part of the body.
Then heat a cautery of this shape.
Until it becomes white and throws off sparks, then return the intestine or epiploon to the abdomen. Then a servant should place his hand on the place so that the intestine does not protrude.  You have spread the patient's legs and placed a cushion under him, and another servant ties his legs.
And another on his chest holds his hands. Then lower the cautery onto the same mark, and your hand with the cautery should be firm and straight, and hold it until it reaches the bone, or repeat it again if it does not reach the bone the first time.
And be careful to prevent the intestine from protruding while you cauterize, lest you burn it, which will cause the patient either death or a great calamity. And know that if you do not reach the bone with the cautery, your work will not succeed.  And the cautery should be gentle for children according to their size and for adults according to their size.
Then treat the cauterized area after three days with butter until the scab from the fire is gone, then treat it with other ointments until it heals. And let the patient lie on his back for forty days until the wound is sealed.
And you should make his diet during his treatment such that it softens his bowels, lest the intestine protrude during defecation. Then, if he wants to get up after forty days, use a firm bandage and keep it on for another forty days.  And he should reduce exertion, fullness from food and drink, and loud shouting.
For if this treatment is used in this way, he will be completely healed, God willing. And I will mention the treatment of hernias by incision in its chapter, God willing. As for the hernia that occurs in the rest of the abdomen and is in its beginning stages, if you wish to prevent it from increasing, cauterize a circular area around it, the size of the hernia. Let what you burn of the skin be about two-thirds of it, then treat it as we have mentioned, for it will not increase, God willing. And some of the ancients mentioned that the hernia should be cauterized with a triangular cautery in this manner.
After you mark the hernia with ink, making the horizontal line at the upper side of the hernia and the other line downwards, and you apply a single nail-shaped cautery in the middle; the first cauterization is easier and better, God willing.
Chapter forty-six.
On cauterizing the fistula.
If in some member, from a fall or blow, pain occurs and that pain lasts a long time, and treatment with medicine is not effective, then it should be cauterized with a pointed cautery; and the cauterization of each member should be according to its size and smallness, weakness and strength.
And if the pain and fistula persist, then if it heals from the first cauterization, well and good; otherwise, repeat the cauterization upon it, for it is the nature of these pains to move from the member to what is near it; therefore, you should follow them with cauterization until the patient is healed.
Chapter forty-seven.
On cauterizing leprosy.
As for lepers, they may benefit greatly from cauterization, especially the type of leprosy which comes from the corruption of phlegm and black bile.
If you wish to cauterize it, observe: if the leprosy is incipient, and you have treated it with what we mentioned in the classification, and it has not diminished nor stopped, and you fear that corruption will take over the entire temperament of the patient, then cauterize him on the head with five cauterizations. One in the middle of the head, as is customary; the second below it towards the forehead at the hairline; two on the temples; and one at the back on the nape of the neck.  And press your hand with the cautery slightly until it affects the bone a little.
And scales will be removed from it, so that the thick vapors may easily escape from it.  And cauterize it also on the same spleen, as previously. But if the leprosy has persisted in the patient and appeared clearly, it is necessary to cauterize him with these cauterizations which we have mentioned in the head. And a cauterization on the tip of the nose; two cauterizations on the cheeks; two cauterizations on the cervical vertebrae; six on the vertebrae of the back; one large one on the coccyx at the base of the spine; another above it in the same area; and two on the hips, one on each hip. And two on the knees, one on each knee; and two on the shoulders; and two on the elbows; and two on the breasts; and cauterize each joint of the fingers of his hands and feet with one cauterization; and each heel of his feet and the forearms of his hands.
And beware of the nerve which is on the back of the heels, lest you burn them. And one may cauterize with one cauterization on the pubic bone, and another on the pit of the stomach, and another on the liver. And know that the more cauterizations you perform, the more beneficial and effective it will be.
And know that the patient does not feel the pain of cauterization as the healthy person does, because his body is numb. And the cauteries should be large and small according to the organs and joints, as has been previously described concerning the characteristics of the cauteries.
Then treat the cauterization with finely ground burnt alum mixed with honey and all other treatments until he recovers, God willing.
Chapter forty-eight.
Concerning the cauterization of numbness: When a limb becomes numb and is treated with medications, ointments, and dressings, but does not heal, then cauterize the numb limb with cauterizations according to the size of the limb, whether large or small. And let your cauterization penetrate a little into the thickness of the skin.
Then treat it with ointment until it heals.  And it may be that some numbness affecting the hand and foot in the vertebrae of the back, at the exit of the nerve that moves that limb, is cauterized, and thus the numbness will disappear.
And let none undertake this except one who is knowledgeable in the anatomy of the limbs and the exits of the nerves that move the body.
Chapter forty-nine.
Concerning the cauterization of leprosy.
If leprosy is longstanding and no medical remedy has been effective, cauterize it slightly, to the depth of the thickness of the skin, until the whiteness disappears and its color changes.
Then treat it with lentil flour mixed with rose oil, lamb's tongue, and pigeon's blood or partridge's blood, one part of each. Mix everything together, apply it to a cloth, and bind it to the area until it heals.
Chapter fifty.
Concerning the cauterization of cancer.
If the cancer is incipient and you wish to arrest it, cauterize it with a circular cautery around it, as it grows. Some scholars have mentioned that a strong cauterization should be done in its middle, but I do not agree with that because I expect it to ulcerate, and I have witnessed that many times.
Therefore, the correct method is to cauterize around it in a circle as we said, or with many cauterizations.
Chapter fifty-one.
Concerning the cauterization of hemorrhoids.
If a hemorrhoid occurs and is slow to mature, either because of the strength of the agent causing it, or because of the age of the patient if he is old and anemic, or because of time, and you wish to hasten the maturation of the hemorrhoid, cauterize around it with many small cauterizations in a punctate manner.
Then leave it, for it will hasten maturation. If you wish to slow it with cauterization, then take the cautery whose image is this.
And insert it into the middle of the hemorrhoid until it penetrates the skin, and let the cauterization be from what is below, so that the flow of pus is easy, then treat it as it should be until it heals.
Chapter fifty-two.
In cauterizing the ulcer.
An ulcer is nothing but corruption that spreads in a limb, eating it as fire eats dry wood. If you see an ulcer in a place that can tolerate cauterization with fire, then take many small and large, nail-shaped cauteries according to what suits the place of the ulcer.
Then cauterize it from every side until all the corruption is eradicated and nothing remains at all. Then leave it for three days and apply to the cauterized areas powdered sulfur with oil until all the eschar and all the corruption is removed.
Then treat it with ointments that promote the growth of flesh. If after three days you see that the flesh grows healthy without corruption, then that is it; otherwise repeat the cauterization on what remains of the corrupted areas.  An ulcer may also be treated with a sharp medicine.
For it acts in place of fire, more quickly beneficial. And I have mentioned its treatment with a sharp medicine in the classification; take it from there when you need it.
Chapter Fifty-Three.
On cauterizing inverted and non-inverted nails.
This ailment frequently occurs on the soles of the feet; it is a rough thing that pains the person.  Cauterization is done in two ways: either cauterization with fire or cauterization with a sharp liquid.
As for cauterization with fire, you heat a hollow cautery iron resembling an eagle's feather, made of iron to the extent that it surrounds the nail from every side, and let it be thin-edged. Then you lower it, hot, onto the nail, and you rotate your hand with the cautery iron around the nail until the cautery iron reaches the depth of the nail.
And you leave it for three days, during which it will suppurate; then you apply a dressing of pounded wild lettuce with salt, and leave the dressing on it for a night, for it will then be extracted from its roots. Then you treat the site of the wound with a flesh-growing ointment until it heals, if the nails are not inverted.
It frequently occurs on the surface of the body, especially on the hands and feet.  You should take a tube of copper, or iron, or an eagle's feather, and place it over the nail or wart, then pour a small amount of sharp liquid into the tube.
And hold your hand as you rotate it, while gently pricking with your hand, so that the edge of the tube affects the root of the nail, and the sharp liquid finds a way to penetrate to the root of the nail. The patient should endure the stinging of the sharp liquid for a short while.
Then you leave it, for the nail will be extracted by its roots. You do this one by one until you have dealt with all of them on the body; then you treat their sites after they are extracted with ointments that promote the growth of flesh.
Chapter fifty-four.
On cauterizing the wart.
If a wart is caused by a cold in the nerve, or by a quartan fever or something else, then it should be cauterized four or five times, on the back of the neck, with a cauterization between each vertebra, and one cauterization on its chest. And a cauterization on its stomach with the olive cautery, for the wart is calmed and the cold disease is hastened to ripen.
Chapter fifty-five.
On cauterizing the pustule occurring in the body.
Ugly pustules may erupt on the body, which are from cold, thick, corrupt materials.  At their first appearance, they should be cauterized, at the head of each pustule, with a gentle cauterization using a reed whose end has been kindled with fire, or with a long root of the zarwand, or with a lenticular cautery.
And abscesses may be cauterized at their first eruption in this manner, so that it does not increase, and the active cause is dissipated, and the patient is cured from it.  However, this should be after the patient has been bled.
Chapter fifty-six.
On cauterizing the bleeding that occurs when an artery is cut.
Often bleeding occurs from an artery that has been severed in a wound that occurs externally, or in the incision of a tumor, or the cauterization of a member, and so on, which is difficult to stop.
If this happens to someone, quickly place your index finger on the mouth of the artery and press it firmly so that the blood is contained under your finger and nothing comes out. Then, place several small and large olive-shaped cauteries in the fire and heat them until they are very hot.
Then take one of them, either small or large, according to the wound and the place where the artery has opened.  Apply the cautery to the same vein after quickly removing your finger, and hold the cautery until the bleeding stops.
If, when you remove your finger from the mouth of the artery, the bleeding continues and the cautery goes out, quickly take another cautery from those prepared in the fire, and continue to do this one after another until the bleeding stops.
Be careful not to burn a nerve that is there, lest you cause the patient another affliction.  Know that if blood flows from an artery, it cannot be stopped, especially if it is a large artery, except in one of four ways: either by cauterization, as we have said; or by amputation, if it has not already been severed; for if it is severed, its ends contract and the bleeding stops; or it can be tightly bound with threads; or medications that stop bleeding can be applied to it, and it can be firmly bound with bandages.
And as for anyone who tries to stop it with a ligature or by tightening with cloths or by applying cauterizing substances and the like, it will not be stopped at all except rarely. If this happens to someone and a physician or medicine is not available, let him quickly place his index finger on the mouth of the wound itself, as we described.
And he should press it very hard until the bleeding stops and flows away from above the wound and onto the artery.  The finger should not be removed, and it should be constantly cooled with very cold water until the blood clots, thickens, and stops. In the meantime, you should consider what is needed in the way of cautery or medicine.
Chapter Two.
Concerning incisions, punctures, bloodletting, wounds, and the like.
Khalaf said: In the first chapter, we mentioned every disease for which cautery with fire and cauterizing medication is suitable, as well as its causes, reasons, instruments, the shapes of cauteries, and I made that into sections from the head to the foot.
And I follow in this chapter the same method, so that the student may easily find what he seeks.
Before I begin with that, you should know, my sons, that this chapter contains more dangers than the first chapter on cautery.
Because of that, warning should be stronger in it, because in the work of this chapter, there frequently occurs the evacuation of blood, upon which life depends, when opening a vein or making an incision on a tumor, or puncturing an abscess, or treating a wound, or extracting an arrow, or incising a stone, and the like; all of which are accompanied by danger and fear, and in most of them, death occurs.
And I advise you against falling into what is doubtful to you, for there may come to you in this craft various kinds of people with various kinds of illnesses, some of whom are weary of their illness and death is easy for them.
Because of the severity of his illness and the length of his affliction, and because of the illness, there are signs that indicate death; and there are some who give you their money and enrich you with it in hope of health, and his illness is deadly. Therefore, you should not at all help anyone who comes to you and has this characteristic.
Let your caution be stronger than your desire and eagerness, and do not proceed with anything of that except after certain knowledge is confirmed with you about what will lead to a good outcome, and use in all the treatment of your patients the precedence of knowledge and warning about what leads to safety.
For in that you have help in acquiring praise, glory, mention, and thanks. May God inspire you, my sons, with His guidance and not deprive you of correctness and success, for that is in His hand; there is no god but He.
And I have arranged this chapter in sections, as was done previously in the chapter on cauterization from the horn to the foot, so that the thing you want from it may be easier for you, God willing.
Chapter One.
In the treatment of the water which collects in the heads of children.
This ailment often affects children at birth if the midwife presses the child's head without gentleness, and it may also occur from a hidden cause which is not known.
And I have not seen this ailment in anyone except children, and all those I have seen of them have quickly approached death; therefore I have seen fit to leave treatment of it. And I have seen a child whose head was filled with water, and the head grew larger every day. Until the child could not sit up by himself because of the size of his head, and the moisture increased until he perished.
And this moisture either collects between the skin and the bone, or it collects under the bone on the peritoneum.  The treatment in this case, if the moisture is between the skin and the bone and the swelling is small, is that one should make an incision in the middle of the head, a single transverse incision, and the length of the incision should be about two fingerbreadths, so that the moisture flows out. This is a picture of the lancet.
If the moisture is greater and the swelling is larger, then make two intersecting incisions in this manner:
And if the moisture is under the bone—and its sign is that you see the sutures of the head open from every direction, and the water subsides if you press it with your hand inwards, and this is not hidden from you—then one should make three incisions in the middle of the head in this manner.
And after the incision, all the moisture comes out, then you should bind the incisions with rags and bandages, then you should pour syrup and oil over it from above until the fifth day, then you should untie the bandage and treat the wound with lint and ointments.  Do not neglect to bind the head moderately, and feed the patient with every dry food that has little moisture.
Until the member strengthens and heals. Another method of incision is to look where the bone of the swelling and the collection of water appear, because it may be in the back of the head more, or in the front, or on the right, or on the left.
Then aim with the incision where the swelling and the fullness of the water appear to you, and incise it as much as you can, and be careful not to cut an artery, lest bleeding occur and the patient die from that bleeding along with the evacuation of the moisture.
Chapter Two.
Cutting the two arteries behind the ears, known as the mastoids.
When someone experiences severe colds in the eyes or chest, and this is prolonged, and the treatment of medicines does not work, then the best treatment for this is to cut these two arteries.
Then, if you want to cut them, you should shave the patient's head with a razor, then rub the area with a rough cloth so that the artery appears. Then tie the patient's neck with a portion of his garment, and then look where the pulse beats and their locations, the two low-lying locations behind the ears, which are rarely hidden except in some people.
Then mark them with ink, and then cut them with a lancet, cutting to the bone. This should be done across the head.  And if you wish, insert the lancet under the artery and cut upwards. The length of the cut should be about two fingers' breadth.
If the artery is severed, blood will gush out in a pulsating manner, leaping forward in a continuous throbbing. If the artery is not palpable, you should measure three fingers' breadth from the ear, then mark it with ink and incise to the bone.  What should be...
...sent forth from the blood six ounces on average, and perhaps more or less; all this depends on the strength of the patient and the fullness of his arteries. Then look at the wound; if there remains anything of the peritoneum on the bone, cut it away.
Lest a hot inflammation occur. Then bind the wound with a thread of linen rags, and then treat it with ointments until it heals.
Chapter Three.
Incising the two arteries in the temples.
If a person suffers from chronic migraine or acute attacks caused by sharp humors and heat in the muscles of the temples, or severe chronic headache, and so on, and has been treated with various medical treatments without success, then we have tried in these diseases incising or cauterizing the arteries of the temples, as we have described.
The procedure for incising them is that the patient's hair in the temples should be shaved, and the artery visible in the temple should be targeted, for it is discernible by its pulsation and rarely hidden except in a few people.
Or, in severe cold, if it is hidden from you, let the patient tighten his neck with a part of his garment, then you rub the area with a cloth or compress the area with hot water until the artery appears clearly and distinctly. Then take the scalpel, whose image is this. Then you incise the skin gently with it until you reach the artery, then you insert a hook into it and pull it upwards until you bring it out of the skin and free it from the membranes beneath it on all sides; if the artery is thin, twist it with the end of the hook. Then cut a portion of it to the extent that its ends separate and contract, and do not cause bleeding, for if it is not severed and cut, the blood will not flow at all; then it is evacuated of blood from six ounces to three.
If the artery is large, then it is necessary to tie it in two places with strong doubled thread; and let the thread be either of silk or of lute strings, lest corruption quickly reach it before the wound heals and bleeding occurs.
Then cut what is between the ligatures; do this at that time or after another time; and if you wish to cauterize it with a knife-cautery to the bone until its ends are severed, this will act in the same way or better, as we said.
Except if the patient has a fever or a hot temperament, for cauterization is what helps to consume the humors and is more certain in benefit; and after removing the arteries, it is necessary to pack the place with worn cotton and apply tight bandages; and after healing, treat it with dry medicines which generate flesh, and with bandaging, until it heals, God willing.
If bleeding from the artery occurs during your work, hasten to cut it, either by cauterization or by filling the place with vitriol and tightening your hand until the blood stops; and if you do not have any of that, place your finger until the blood clots.
And wash the place with very cold water until the sharpness subsides and bind it as necessary. And what is lighter and easier than ligating the artery is to cauterize the vein with this double-bladed cautery after marking the two places with ink.
And apply it very hot until it reaches the bone and the vein is severed in two places so that its ends are separated, for it will not reunite with this cauterization at all.  And this is the image of the cautery.
The blades should be sharp, resembling small scalpels, except that they should be much less sharp than a scalpel, because if they are as sharp as a scalpel, they will cool more quickly and the flesh will not be severed quickly.  If they have some thickness, the heat of the fire will remain in them.
And it severs the flesh quickly.  This procedure is better than any other procedure, and lighter and easier.  And let the distance between the blades be the thickness of a finger.
Chapter Four.
On the treatment of the constant flow of hot tears to the eyes.
If the tears are constant and their flow is from the veins on the outside of the skull, and nothing from the medical treatment of drugs has benefited it, and you see the patient's face is reddened. And he feels in his forehead a crawling like the crawling of ants, and his eyes are sunken and moist, their lashes are eroded and his eyelids are contracted from the severity of the tears.  Therefore, the ancients in their treatment resorted to this procedure, and they call it treatment with the sword. It is that you order the patient to shave the hair from his forehead.
Then you make three parallel incisions in the forehead along the length of the forehead.  The length of each incision is about two fingers. One incision is parallel to the length of the nose in the middle of the forehead, the second is a little distance from the movement of the muscle in the temple, and the third is on the other side.
And be careful not to cut the two arteries which are on the sides, and keep your hand away from the connection of the jaws. And let the distance after each incision be about three closed fingers. And let you have prepared pieces of sponge or many dry cloths with which to wipe the blood.
Then insert the double-edged scalpel, whose image is this. From the incision next to the temple to the middle incision, and with it you dissect all the skin which is between the two incisions, along with the membrane on the bone. Then do that also from the middle incision to the third incision. Then remove this scalpel. And also insert into the first incision another instrument called a sharp, one-sided knife, smooth and not sharp on the other side. And this is its image:
And place its sharp side upwards towards the flesh attached to the skin, and its smooth side towards the bone, and push it until it reaches the middle incision, and cut with it all the vessels which descend from the head to the eyes, without the cut reaching the surface of the skin.
Then do that in the middle incision to the other incision. And after a moderate amount of blood flows, squeeze the places of the congealed blood, then put in each incision a cotton wick, and place on it a compress moistened with syrup and oil, or vinegar and oil.
Lest a hot swelling occur. And on the third day, untie the bandage and use much irrigation with lukewarm water, then treat it with basilicon ointment with rose oil and everything else with which you treat wounds, until it heals, God willing.
Chapter Five.
In the treatment of tears and discharges to the eyes from the interior of the head.
When someone experiences many, sharp, severe, persistent discharges, and you see his eyes weak, small, and his vision weakened, and his eyelids ulcerated, and the eyelashes falling out. And there is severe, painful pain in the depth of the head and consecutive sneezing, then know from these symptoms that those materials and discharges come from many deep veins. The best treatment is this: you order the patient to shave his forehead, then you make one incision in the middle of the forehead.
And there is severe, painful pain in the depth of the head and consecutive sneezing, then know from these symptoms that those materials and discharges come from many deep veins. The best treatment is this: you order the patient to shave his forehead, then you make one incision in the middle of the forehead. Or a little higher laterally, and you begin the incision from the left temple to the right temple, and the incision should be to the bone, and keep your hand away from the muscles of the temples that move when chewing, until the bone is exposed and all the blood is dried with a sponge.
Then separate the lips of the incision with worn cotton or a linen thread, then tie it from above with pledgets, and soak the pledgets with syrup and oil, lest a hot inflammation occur. And when you untie it and see that the hot inflammation has subsided, then you should scrape the bone until the growth of flesh begins in it.
Then treat it with a drying preparation which makes the flesh grow, such as taking two parts of wheat flour and four parts of colophony, and preparing an ointment from them, and using it for the growth of flesh in such wounds.
Chapter Six.
In the treatment of what falls into the ear.
Everything that falls into the ear is one of four types: either a metallic stone or a semi-stone like iron and glass; or a vegetable seed like chickpeas and kernels and the like; or a flowing thing like water and vinegar and the like.
Or an animal.  If a stone or a kind of stone falls into the ear which does not grow in the ear, then turn the ear towards the sun. If you see the stone, then instill some violet oil or ceruse into it, then try to remove it by moving the head or sneezing with a sternutatory. And close the nostrils when sneezing comes, after having placed a ring of cloth or wool around the ear and extending the ear upwards. Often it comes out with this treatment.  If it does not come out otherwise, then try to remove it with a gentle scoop, the image of which is this.
If it comes out with the scoop, otherwise try to remove it with a gentle, slightly bent, blind probe. If it does not come out with that, then make a tube of copper and insert the end of the tube into the hole of the ear gently.
And seal around the tube with pitch softened with oil, lest there be a way for the wind other than the tube, then draw it with your breath strongly. And often it comes out with that. If it does not come out with what we have described, then take a little bit of the gum of Nabataea or of the prepared gum which is taken by birds, and place it on the end of a probe.
After wrapping it tightly with cotton, then insert it into the hole of the ear gently, after having dried the ear from moisture. If it does not come out with all that we have described, then proceed to incision before hot swelling or tension occurs.
The description of the incision is that you first bleed the patient in the temple and remove blood according to his strength. Then you seat the patient before you, and turn his ear upwards, and make a small incision at the base of the ear near its lobe, in its lowest part.
And the incision should be crescent-shaped until you reach the stone, then remove it with whatever instruments you can. Then suture the incision quickly and treat it until it heals.
And if the thing that has fallen into the ear is one of the seeds that grow and swell, then try to remove it as we have mentioned. If it does not respond to being removed, then take a thin, delicate scalpel of this shape.
And try with it to cut that type of seed that has fallen into the ear. But you only do this if you are certain that the seed has become moistened by the vapor of the ear until it becomes many small pieces, then remove them with a blind probe or with a fine sponge or by suction.
As we have mentioned, then it is easy to remove it.  As for water entering the ear, the patient should first use sneezing with a handkerchief, having filled his ear with some old cotton while lying on the ear that contains the water. If it comes out by that,
otherwise, take many small, smooth, flat stones the length of the fingers, warm them slightly by the fire, and the patient inserts one into the opening of his ear. He then raises his leg on that side and strikes the stone in his ear with another stone.
He continues to do this with one stone after another until all the water comes out. The water may also come out by taking a piece of papyrus or a feather, inserting one end into the ear, and bringing the other end to the fire until most of it burns, then repeating with another feather.
Do this repeatedly until all the water comes out or draw it out with the tube as was done before with the stone. As for removing an animal that has entered, see if it is small, like a flea or similar. Treat it as was mentioned in the section, and as for…
If its body is large and perceptible to the touch, try to remove it with forceps and hooks. This is easier than anything else that lodges in the ear. As for removing worms that develop in the ear, if you treat it as mentioned in the section on instillations, and your treatment is not effective…
you should look into the ear in the sun. If you see something of the worm, remove it with forceps or fine hooks. If you see nothing, take a tube of this form.
narrow at the bottom and wide at the top, and insert the thin end into the ear as much as the patient can bear. Then suck strongly, doing this repeatedly until all the worms come out. If it does not respond to being pulled out, seal around the tube with wax as I mentioned to you with the stone.
If it does not come out by what we have mentioned, use the instillations I mentioned, which the ancients have tested in killing worms, and you will find that in the section on instillations.  The pouring of oils and medicines into the ear is done with this instrument, and this is its form:
As you see, make it from silver or copper, narrow at the bottom with a small hole, and wide at the top. And if you wish, let the nozzle inside the tube be of tightly fitting copper. And if you wish, take a reed and wrap cotton tightly around its end.
Then pour the oil or juice or whatever medicine you want into the tube while it is in the ear. Then insert the reed with the cotton from above and squeeze it gently with your hand until the oil is forced into the ear and it is felt.
by the patient, and let what you pour into the ear be warmed a little in the fire. And beware that what is dropped into it is neither very cold nor very hot, for the ear does not tolerate that.
Chapter Seven.
In the treatment of the obstruction affecting the ear.
Some children may be born with their ear canals not perforated.
Also, some people may experience an obstruction in the ear canal due to a wound or newly grown flesh. This obstruction may be deep within the ear canal, beyond the reach of sight.
It may also appear slightly outside the perforation and be visible. That which appears deep within the ear and is not visible is, in most cases, difficult to cure. That which is visible should have the patient's ear placed in the sun. And look into it; if you see the obstruction, open it with a delicate scalpel, which has this form:
Its tip should be slightly broad, and the rest of the scalpel smooth on both sides, lest it injure the ear. If the obstruction is due to flesh that has grown in the ear canal, grasp it with a delicate hook and cut it gently but firmly until all the flesh is removed.
If the obstruction is deep in the ear, take a smooth, delicate probe, warm it slightly in the fire, and insert it into the ear canal. If you feel the obstruction, and the patient feels heaviness in hearing, remove it gently.
Be careful not to injure the membrane of the ear. Then insert into the ear a wick the size of the perforation, having smeared it with Egyptian ointment. Do this for several days until you are sure the wound will not close up. Or take a wick, moisten it with water, and sprinkle powdered vitriol on it.
Use it. If you see that the ear is swollen with a hot inflammation, you should remove the wick and replace it with another wick smeared with an ointment made of quince and rose oil until the hot inflammation subsides; then treat it until it heals.
If bleeding occurs, dip a sponge or cloth in cold water and apply it to the ear.  Use the other treatments for stopping bleeding mentioned in the chapter on haemostatics.
Chapter Eight.
On the treatment of warts appearing on the eyelids.
These warts which appear on the eyelids may be moist or dry.  You should grasp them with forceps or a hook and cut them off at their roots with a scalpel, then apply powdered verdigris to the area.
If it bleeds, cauterize it with a mild lentil-shaped cautery. Cauterization is best after cutting.  They often return if anything of their roots remains; if cauterized with fire, those roots are burned and will not return.
Chapter Nine.
On the treatment of the cold affecting the eyelids.
Something resembling a cold in its intensity and hardness often appears in the eyelids.
Therefore it is called a cold, which is a gathering of thick moisture in the upper and lower eyelids. The treatment is to observe; if the cold swelling is prominent on the surface of the eyelid and moves to every direction, then the matter is easy, so make a transverse incision on it.
Then carefully peel it from every side until it is removed, then hang it with a hook and cut it off. If you are not able to cut it off except after cutting through the eyelid, that will not harm the patient. If the incision is large, then close it with sutures and treat it until it heals.
And if it is small, then there is no harm from it, for the ointment will heal and close it. If the cold swelling is inclined towards the inside of the eyelid, towards the inner surface, then turn over the eyelid and hang the swelling with a hook without needing to make an incision, and cut it from every side.
If it penetrates the eyelid with the cut, that will not harm anything. Then wash the eye after cutting the swelling with salt water and treat the area with something that heals until the patient recovers.
Chapter Ten.
In the treatment of the pterygium which appears in the eyelid.
Pterygium is a fleshy excrescence that forms in the layers of the upper eyelid.  This mostly occurs in children, weighing down their eyes and causing them to suffer from colds in the mornings, and they are unable to look at sunlight. Because the tears flow quickly to them.
Therefore, you see them always leaning on their faces and sleeping on them, and their eyelids under their eyebrows are moist, swollen, with the pterygium clearly visible. When you press the area with your fingers, you feel the pterygium between them. The procedure is to have the patient place his head in your lap.
Then you take a linen cloth, prepare a wick from it, and make a circle from that wick of a size that encircles the pterygium on all sides. Then you place it on the pterygium and press with your fingers on all sides to gather the pterygium in the center of the circle.
Then you make a transverse incision in the middle of that moisture with a lancet, and the incision should not be larger than an incision made in bloodletting. As for the depth, you should incise all the skin until you reach the pterygium.
In most cases, the pterygium protrudes from the incision like a piece of white fat. You pull it out with a cloth wrapped around your fingers, rotating your hand right and left until it is cured. Be careful not to enlarge the incision, lest the lancet reach the eye and injure it.
If the pterygium does not appear in the first incision, you should gently enlarge the incision a little until the pterygium appears. Then pull it out as we said, then dip a cloth in vinegar and water, place it on the area, and bandage it. Some people crush salt.
And they place it inside the incision to dissolve what remains of that moisture. Then treat it until it heals. If a hot swelling occurs in the area, treat it with soothing compresses until it heals.
Chapter Eleven.
On the types of pterygium of the eye.
If superfluous membranes grow on the eyelid, outside the natural course beneath the natural eyelids and eyelashes, they harm the eye and cause various diseases, such as constant tearing, eyelid relaxation, and opacity and thickening, to the point that this may cause blindness.
Pterygium of the eye is of four types:  either by cauterization with fire, or by caustic medication as previously mentioned in the chapter on cauterization; or the pterygium may be removed by excision and suturing, or by the reed, as I shall describe.
You should place the patient's head in your lap, then turn the eyelid with your left hand; if it does not turn, then insert a needle with a thread from below the eyelid and pass the needle with the thread from above, near the hair itself, and pull the thread upwards with the eyelid.
Turn it with a probe, then incise the inner eyelid, avoiding the superfluous hairs, with a sharp scalpel from the larger canthus to the smaller canthus; then remove the thread and place a small pledget of cotton or linen under the eyelid, then mark the eyelid with ink.
Like the shape of a laurel leaf, except that the shape should be according to the amount of eyelid elevation you desire, for this varies among people; some need a suitable amount of eyelid to be excised according to the degree of eyelid relaxation.
And some need less to be excised; all this is according to the relaxation of the eyelid. Then incise with the scalpel along the two lines you have marked, beginning from the larger canthus to the smaller canthus, and each incision should be near the natural hair, about the thickness of a probe.
Then insert the hook into one corner of the skin, then flay it all off; then join the edges with suture using a fine woolen needle and thread, wipe away the blood, and stick the remaining threads to the eyebrows with some adhesive substance.
If you wish to do so, otherwise it does not matter. Then leave the sutures and threads for about three or four days, then treat it. And if you wish, leave the wound without suturing and treat it with what dries and constricts, for the eyelid will rise when the wound is healed and joined; suturing is better.
This method of blepharoplasty was mentioned by the ancients, although it is burdensome for the patient; it is a good procedure and not dangerous.  Another method of blepharoplasty is to mark on the eyelid a shape like that of a laurel leaf, as we have described. Then raise the eyelid with three hooks, either separate or grouped in this manner:
Then cut off the excess eyelid with small scissors, evenly, in this manner:
If you cannot hold the hooks steady, take a needle with thread and insert it into the middle of the shape, and insert another thread near the larger canthus and a third thread near the smaller canthus, and gather the threads together with your fingers evenly, then raise it with a moderate lift.
Raise all of the marked skin as we described, then close the edges of the wound with sutures and treat it until it heals. If a hot inflammation appears when you cut or incise, treat that inflammation with kyriote and similar soothing ointments.
It may also happen that the lower eyelid inverts its edges, so you should use what we mentioned of cutting and suturing and cauterization with fire and with caustic medicine; cauterization with fire or with caustic medicine is more effective and gentler on the patient than cutting and suturing, and you should do cutting and suturing in both.
Cauterization with a reed is done in this way: you invert the eyelid and make an incision on the inside as described, then you make two thin reeds or pieces of wood, their length equal to the length of the eyelid, and their width less than the width of a scalpel.
And you cut into their ends on both sides where the threads are grasped, then you gently gather them over what remains of the eyelid and tightly pull the two reeds from both sides and leave it for several days; the stretched skin will die, turn black, and become necrotic.
Until it falls off by itself; if it is slow, cut it with scissors, then treat it until it heals.  When it heals, the eyelid will be raised and the edges of the eyelid will not be inverted. This is an image of the two reeds; make them in this shape and this size in length and width exactly:
Chapter Twelve.
On raising ingrown eyelashes from the eye with a needle.
If it is one or two hairs, the procedure is to take a thin needle and thread it with a smooth, thin silk thread, then gather its ends and tie them in a very delicate knot, and let the length of the thread be about a span.
Then attach another thin thread to the loop, shorter than the first, and tie its ends if you wish. Then have the patient place his head in your lap, and let it be near the sun so that the work may be clearly seen, for it is delicate work. Then insert the needle with the loop into the root of the ingrown hair.
And quickly pass it through the eyelid until you bring it out above the natural hair, then pull the thread upwards through the loop, and the hair or hairs, whether one, two, or three—no more—will enter the loop.
Then pull it with your hand until the hair comes out with the loop in the eyelid along with the natural hair. If you pull the loop and the hair does not come out with it, pull the loop downwards by the thread that you attached to it until the loop comes out of the upper opening.
Then return the hair into it and pull them both. Do this until it rises in the upper opening and you see it clearly. Then remove the loop and the thread and take them out, and bind the eye and leave it bound for two or three days until the hair settles in its place and flesh grows over it.
If the hair is short, either add a long hair from the natural hair to it so that it rises with it, or leave it until it grows longer after a while, and then raise it.
Chapter Thirteen.
In the treatment of the stye which occurs in the upper eyelid.
That which this stye is exposed to is called a harelip, and this stye is either natural or accidental. The accidental one is from the healing of a wound or a cut or cauterization and the like.
And the method of treatment is to incise that adhesion and separate its lips, and place a wick of linen between them and bind it until it heals.  And it is not appropriate to use things that dry and constrict in its treatment.
For if you do that, the stye will return more severely than it was.  Rather, use things that relax, such as fenugreek and lint with water in which mallow and flaxseed have been cooked, and diachylon ointment melted with some fat, and smear it with the wick and treat it with this.
And the key to its treatment is to strive by every means that it not adhere in the way it was initially. And this treatment that we have mentioned is only some improvement of the stye, not that the appearance of the place returns to exactly how it was at all.
Chapter Fourteen.
On the treatment of the stye which forms in the lower eyelid.
This stye which forms in the lower eyelid is that which is truly called a stye, and it is both natural and accidental. The accidental one is from a wound, or incision, or cauterization, and the like.
And the method of working in it is that you take a needle with a doubled thread, and you pierce it into the flesh and pass it from the left canthus to the right canthus, until the thread is at the edges of the flesh, then you stretch the flesh upwards with the needle and cut it with a wide scalpel.
If the shape of the eyelid returns to what is appropriate, otherwise you take a probe and place it on the site of the incision and turn the eyelid with it and make two incisions in the inner side of the eyelid and the ends of the incisions are from the corners of the cut which you cut until they meet and form an angle from them. Until, when they meet, its shape becomes similar to this shape:
Which is the Greek letter lambda, then you remove that flesh to the extent that its sharp edge is lower than what is next to the eyelid, then you gather the scattered parts with two stitches, sewing it with a wool thread, then you treat it with what we mentioned of emollient medicines and bandages until it heals.
And if the fistula is caused by an incision, suture, or cauterization, it is necessary to make a simple incision without the hair of the eyelids as well, as mentioned before, then separate the lips with a bandage as we mentioned.
In short, in the treatment of fistula, whether it is from above or below, you should proceed according to the appearance of the fistula, for it may vary greatly in form, and the skilled surgeon devises a solution in whatever way is possible.
Until the shape returns to its natural form or approximates it, and the disease itself indicates the appropriate procedure and instrument in most cases.
Chapter Fifteen.
On the adhesion of the eyelid to the conjunctiva or cornea.
This adhesion may occur in many people, such that the upper eyelid adheres to the white of the eye, preventing its easy movement and hindering its natural functions; therefore, you should insert the tip of a probe under the eyelid.
And raise it upwards or stretch it with a hook, then cut the adhesion with a gentle scalpel, not sharp like the cutting scalpels, but rather blunt, lest the patient be disturbed during the procedure and the scalpel slip, injuring the eye with its sharpness; and your cutting should be as if you are peeling off that adhesion.
And wait until the eyelid returns to its natural state and the adhesion is completely healed; then pour into the eye salt water to wash it, or instill into it some vitriol solution diluted with water, then separate the eyelid from the eye with a linen wick.
And place over the eye wool moistened with egg white, and after the third day use astringent eye drops until it heals.
Chapter Sixteen.
In cutting the pterygium and fleshy excrescences.
The pterygium is of two kinds: either nervous, resembling a thin, hard membrane; or non-nervous, resembling a firm white moisture which, if touched with an iron instrument or if one attempts to remove it with a hook, is torn to pieces.
And a hook does not hold firm in it. Both kinds begin from the canthus and gradually extend until they cover the pupil and obstruct the light and movement of the eye. The procedure for cutting them is that the patient should place his head in your lap.
Then he opens his eyes, and you raise the eyelid with your hand, then you grasp the pterygium with a slightly curved hook and stretch it upwards, then you take a needle and thread into it a horsehair or cow hair and a strong thread, and you bend the point of the needle slightly and pierce it into the middle of the pterygium.
Then you pass it through with the needle and tie the pterygium with the thread and stretch it upwards and dissect with the hair the side of the pterygium next to the pupil, as if you were spreading it with the hair to its end, then you cut the remainder at the root of the canthus with a fine scalpel or small scissors and leave the natural flesh of the canthus.
So that continuous flow of tears does not result from its excision.  The pterygium may be stretched with the hook alone or with the thread as we said, then the smooth-ended scalpel, whose shape is this: [presumably an image was here], is used to dissect it.
And be careful that the scalpel does not touch the cornea, lest it cause a wound and injure the pupil.  Then, after cutting, put some powdered salt or vitriol into the eye, and leave it until the next day, then treat it as appropriate until it heals.
If the pterygium is not fibrous and you cannot insert a needle into it or fix a hook in it, this type of pterygium is often treated with medication and heals as described in the classification. If you wish to cut it, open the patient's eye.
Take a fine, smooth scalpel with a weak edge, like this: [presumably an image was here]. And dissect the pterygium from above gently with it. If you see that it is loosening and fragmenting and the dissection has affected it, then instill into the eye from your [medicine] bottle vitriol or red vitriol or powdered salt, and bandage the eye until the next day.
Then repeat the procedure until it is all gone, unless a hot inflammation obstructs you in the eye; then leave it and treat the hot inflammation until it heals, then resume the dissection until it heals. As for the fleshy excrescence of the caruncle…
if the excrescence harms the eye excessively, then hook that excrescence with a hook and cut some of it, but do not overdo the cutting lest it cause a flow of tears, then instill into the canthus red or vitriol until it heals.
Chapter Seventeen.
Concerning the excision of the pterygium and what grows of excessive flesh in the eye.
In the eyes of some people, red flesh may grow, accumulating until it covers the pupil or approaches it or overflows onto the eyelids, and sometimes the eyelids turn outward and it resembles a wild rose.
And the procedure is that the patient places his head in your lap, then opens his eyes, and you pick up all that red flesh with hooks suitable for that.
Or you grasp it with forceps or a pair of tweezers, then you cut the flesh, piece by piece, until you remove it all by cutting, and you protect the eye so that you do not injure it during the procedure, and your cutting of it may be either with the scalpel that we described in cutting the pterygium or with small scissors. Like those with which one plucks hairs, as its image will follow in the chapter that follows this chapter.
Then, when your cutting is finished and all the growth is gone, fill the eye with crushed salt or instill into it  red vitriol or similar caustic medicines, and apply a cotton compress soaked in egg white to the eye externally to prevent hot inflammation.
If some of the growth remains and the bleeding overwhelms you and you fear hot inflammation, then leave the eye and treat it with what soothes the inflammation, then return to the procedure until it heals.  Do likewise with excessive flesh that appears in the eye of this type.
However, you should avoid treating any eye weak by nature or by circumstance with instruments; and do not undertake any of these procedures until you see that the organ can tolerate the procedure.
Chapter Eighteen.
On the removal of pterygia from the eye.
Pterygia are red vessels that grow over the eye, hindering its function and weakening the eye over time.  First you should look; if the eye in which the pterygia are located is strong and has no other ailment besides the pterygia,
then the removal is performed by having the patient place his head in your lap, then you hook those vessels with one or two hooks, according to your skill, and the hooks should be delicately curved in this manner:.
Or they may be two double hooks in a single body, in this manner:
Then, with fine scissors, delicately remove those vessels, wiping away the blood from time to time until you see that the vessels have been removed from the eye and the bleeding has stopped.  Be careful not to injure the eye with the tips of the scissors, and let your work be done midday, facing the sun.
And be very careful in your work, lest you cut anything other than those vessels.  Upon completion, instill into the eye green or red vitriol to cauterize any remaining pterygium. If you cannot remove it all at once, then bandage the eye with something that soothes the pain.
Leave it for several days until the pain subsides and the inflammation is resolved, then repeat the procedure in the same manner until it heals. This is an image of the appropriate scissors.
And leave it [and let the patient's head rest on the pupil's lap, while another wipes away tears and keeps the eye open at the front and back, and you] the principle of the procedure is to open the eye with a fixed or triangular speculum held by an assistant.
Sharp, and let the patient's head rest on the assistant's lap, while another wipes away tears and keeps the eye open at the front and back, and you have the choice of beginning to remove it from the top or bottom of the eye; it is preferable to cut two threads at the upper eyelid, one at its end and the other at its beginning.
And grasp it between the middle and index fingers, then hook it from below opposite them, then grasp it between the little and ring fingers;  lift your hand gently until you see that the whole pterygium has been raised, then cut it from its narrowest part, if you wish, with scissors, or if you wish, with a fine scalpel.
And insert the thread onto a needle and lift the entire pterygium until it is raised from the conjunctiva, and do not cut the threads, for tears and blood will obscure your vision.
Then cut with scissors what extends beyond the eyelid from above and below, so that nothing remains attached except to the cornea. If you can lift it from the cornea by peeling it with the thread, that is best; and it may be possible in some people.
And when you have cut it, let its site be cauterized for several days to alleviate the pain and prevent excessive inflammation, then resume working on it.
Chapter Nineteen.
In replacing the nose.
Physicians call a nasal polyp a fistula. If you treat it with cautery or with a sharp, burning medicine as previously described, and it does not heal, then there is no recourse except to incise the swelling when it is ripe and to extract all the moisture or pus within.
Until the bone is exposed.  If the bone is exposed and you see corruption or blackness in it, then scrape it with an instrument of this shape:
The rasp, which is made of Indian iron, is called the head. Its head is round like a button, finely engraved with the pattern of a file or rasp. You place it on the corrupted part of the bone, then rotate it between your fingers, while slightly pressing down with your hand, until you know that the corruption has been scraped away.
Do this repeatedly, then dress the wound with drying, astringent medicines. If the wound heals, flesh grows in it, and the discharge stops, and it remains for forty days without recurrence, suppuration, or any incident,
know that it has healed. Otherwise, there is no recourse except to return the fistula to the nasal cavity in this manner:  You again expose the bone with an instrument or with a sharp medicine. When the bone is exposed, take a probe of this shape:
The tip of the iron instrument is triangular, and its shaft is conical, tapering towards the tip, as you see. Then place it on the bone itself, near the ethmoid bone, and a little away from the eye. Then rotate your hand with the probe until it penetrates the bone and the patient feels it.
He will feel air escaping from it if he holds his hand over his nose. Then dress the wound with the astringent, drying medicines as I have taught you. If flesh grows and the place hardens, then the matter which used to flow outwards will return to the nose, which will be easier for the patient, God willing.
Chapter Twenty.
In returning a protrusion of the eye.
If the whole eye protrudes and no damage or deficiency occurs in the sight, then you should relax the patient, then bleed him in the temples, then apply a cupping glass to the nape of the neck without restriction, and gently suck.
Then apply a poultice made of acacia, aloes, frankincense, and bdellium to the eye, and then bind the eye over the poultice with many soft bandages.  The method for the bandages is that you take many soft rags, and fold each rag into four layers, making many of them.
Then place them one over the other as much as the eye needs, then bind it tightly with a firm cloth, and repeat the cupping with suction without restriction, then remove the cupping glass and leave the eye bandaged for a day and a night.
If the bandage loosens during that time, it should be tightened gently. Then remove the bandage after a day and a night, as we said. If you see that the eye has returned, otherwise, repeat the poultice, bandages, binding, and cupping until it returns.
Chapter Twenty-One.
On the excision of the uvula.
If a hernia occurs in the uvular layer, then it protrudes and becomes prominent outside the eyelids like a grape, and thus the person's appearance is disfigured, and you wish to excise it, then the procedure is as I describe.
It is that you insert a needle into the base of the uvula from below upwards, then insert another needle with doubled thread from the side of the palate and pass it through, and leave the first needle as it is.
Then you cut the place where the doubled thread bends and tie some of the uvula around the needle with it and pull it firmly, then you remove the needle and place on the eye wool moistened with egg white and leave it until the threads fall out with the uvula, then you treat the eye with what strengthens it.
Until the wound heals.  You may also pull the uvula from every direction with a circle of cloth so that the eye is pulled even more firmly, then you incise with a fine scalpel reaching to the depth of the eye, so that the white moisture flows and the eye descends and withers in place, then you pull it until it heals.
Chapter Twenty-Two.
In the treatment of canker.
This ailment which is called canker is a fluid which gathers in the eye resembling flowing water, but it is not. The method of treatment is that you seat the patient upright on a chair, then take his head in your hands from both sides.
And move it until you see the fluid go to the lower part of the eye, then it will remain there and not move, and the light will emerge and the patient will see things as he used to see them.  If it does not descend to the lower part we know that it is water. If the fluid does not descend as mentioned,
then seat the patient before you, then take a thin lancet and make a small incision with it above the cornea at the point where the conjunctiva joins the cornea in the ciliary body until the matter comes out.
When it has come out, instill in the eye warm water in which honey has been mixed, or water in which fenugreek and honey have been boiled, then treat it with other treatments until it heals.
Chapter Twenty-Three.
We have already mentioned the types of water in the classification and which of them is suitable for cupping, in a detailed and explained statement, so take that from there correctly. Then you should seat the patient before you, sitting cross-legged facing the light near the sun.
And you should bind his sound eye and bind it tightly, then lift the eyelid of his eye with your left hand if the eye in which the water is, is the left eye, or with your right hand if it is the right eye.
Then you place the tip of the cupper near the cornea, with the thickness of a probe, in the same white of the eye towards the smaller canthus, then you push the cupper forcefully while you rotate it with your hand until it penetrates the white of the eye and you feel with the cupper that it has reached something empty.
And it should be that the extent of the cupper's penetration into the depth is the distance that is from the pupil to the end of the blackness, which is the cornea of the eye, for the copper is seen by the viewer himself in the eye because of the clarity of the corneal membrane, then you move the cupper upwards to the place where the water is.
Then press it downwards time after time, and if the water descends immediately, then the patient will see what his sight has been opened to immediately, and the cupper is in his eye, then it will remain still a little, and if the water rises, then lower it again without removing the cupper.
Then if it settles and does not rise, remove the cupper gently while you twist it with your hand little by little, then dissolve in the water a little pure Andaranian salt and wash the eye with it from the inside, then place on the outside of the whole eye a compress or wet wool.
With rose oil and egg white and bind it with the healthy eye, but as for us and the people of our time, we place on it crushed cumin with egg white. And if the cupper does not enter the eye because of its hardness, because some people have very hard eyes. Then it is necessary to take the scalpel which is called al-barīd, whose image is this:
Then pierce with it only the adherent part and do not go too far in the piercing, but rather it is that you make a delicate place for the cupper, then insert the cupper as we mentioned, and when your work is complete, prepare for the patient a firm lying-down place where he sleeps on his back in a dark room.
And he abstains from all movements and from coughing, and you make his food that which softens his constitution, and he does not move his head to the right or left at all, and the bandage remains in place until the third day, then you untie it in that dark room and test his sight.
And you show him things, then return the bandage until the seventh day, and it is not proper to do that at the time of treatment or after the cupping from your hour, but rather it is necessary to avoid that before the water rises quickly with intense sight.
If a hot swelling appears, then it is necessary to untie the eye before the seventh and treat that with what calms the swelling, until when it calms, then at that time you release his sight and place on the face a kerchief that trains his sight from under it for days while he is in that dark room, then...
He leaves the house gradually and manages his affairs, and know that in cupping the learner cannot dispense with observation many times, then at that time he proceeds to the work, and it has reached me from some Iraqis that he mentioned that he makes in Iraq a penetrating cupper with which he draws out the water.
And I have not seen anyone in our country make that nor read it in a book from the books of the ancients, and it is possible that that is recent, and this is an image of types of cupping instruments for one ignorant of them to stand upon:
It is made of copper especially, and its end is with this very thinness, triangular-ended, sharp.
Chapter twenty-four.
In the treatment of the flesh growing in the nose.
There may grow in the nose different kinds of superfluous flesh, some of it resembling a scorpion with many legs, and some of it being cancerous flesh, hardened, dark-colored, and some of it being soft flesh, not dark-colored.
As for that which is soft flesh, not malignant nor cancerous, then it is necessary that you seat the patient before you facing the sun, and open his nostril and cast the snare into that flesh, then draw it outwards, then cut what you have grasped of it with a fine, sharp scalpel from one side.
Until you know that all the flesh has gone. If any of it remains that you were unable to cut, then remove it with one of the fine instruments gently, until nothing of it remains. If the bleeding overcomes you, or a hot swelling appears,
then treat it as is necessary. Or if it was from the malignant tumors, then hasten to cauterize it until the bleeding stops and all the flesh is gone, then cast into the nose after the cutting vinegar and water or a drink. If the nose opens and the moisture passes from it to the throat,
know that he is healed. If the moisture does not pass as it should, then know that inside there is flesh growing on the top of the porous bones, which the instrument did not reach with the cutting. Then it is necessary that you take a linen thread of some thickness.
and tie many knots in it, and make between each knot the space of a finger or less. Let the patient skillfully insert one end of the thread into his nose with a probe or with whatever is possible for him after making it like a button, and draw his breath until it reaches the choana.
and it comes out at his throat. Often boys in school do this kind of action, and it is a matter easy for whoever wants to do it. Then gather the two ends of the thread, the one end which came out at the mouth and the other which remained in the nose.
Then use the knots in the thread to saw the flesh, doing that until you know that the flesh has been cut by the knots of the thread. Then take out the thread, and place in the nose after wiping the blood a wick which has soaked in Egyptian ointment, doing that for three days or more.
until the ointment eats away all that remains of the flesh. Then, as the last thing, put a lead tube in the nose for some days until it heals. If it needs treatment to dry it, use that.
And this is an image of the speculum with which to instill ointments and medicines into the nose:
It is made of silver or copper, similar to a small, open candlestick, and its passageway as well.
And if you wish, make the tube closed like a reed, and the speculum's passage flat.
It has a handle at its end, as you see, to hold it when you heat the ointment or whatever you wish of juices or flowing things in it.
Chapter Twenty-five.
On warts growing on the tip of the nose.
A wart often grows on the tip of the nose, and it increases and grows larger with the days until its appearance becomes ugly.
Therefore, it should be cut in its first appearance and completely excised, then apply to the area either cautery or a burning medicine that acts in place of cautery. If you miss cutting it until it becomes large, then look: if it is hardened, solid, dark in color, and insensitive,
do not touch it with iron, for it is a cancerous tumor; and I have often seen that the cutting of this tumor resulted in great harm to its owner. But if the tumor is soft to the touch, not dark in color, and you see that it can be completely cut, then let the patient vomit and cut it without hesitation or delay, and treat the area with what dries and constricts until it heals.
Chapter Twenty-Six.
On suturing the nose, lip, and ear. If their connection is separated by a wound or something similar, know that when a separation of the connection occurs in one of these cartilages, the treatment rarely benefits except in some people.
Then, if something like that happens to someone, see if the wound is fresh with its blood. If so, bring the edges of the wound together with sutures, then treat it until it heals. And if the separation of the connection has separated its edges, and each cut is clean, then you should scrape each cut to the thickness of its outer skin until it bleeds.
Then bring the edges together with sutures, tighten them, and sprinkle on them mastic and frankincense, powdered.  Then place on top of the sutures a plaster of walnut ointment or another adhesive ointment, and leave it tied for two or three days, then untie it.
And change the medication and leave it until the threads fall out on their own, then treat it with ointment until it heals. The method of suturing is to bring together the separated connection, either with needles, as we described in suturing the abdomen, or with thread, as I explained there.
Chapter Twenty-Seven.
On removing the nodes which appear in the lips.
Many people develop small, hard tumors inside their lips; some resemble lentils, others are smaller or larger.  You should evert the lip, incise each nodule, and extract it with a hook.
Then cut it from each side, and after cutting, pack the area with powdered alum to stop the bleeding. Then rinse with vinegar and salt, and treat the area with a styptic until the wounds heal.
Chapter Twenty-Eight.
On cutting away excess gum.
Often, excess flesh grows on the gums, which the ancients called epulis. You should hook it with a hook or grasp it with forceps and cut it at its base. Allow the blood to flow, then apply powdered alum to the area.
Or one of the astringent, drying powders. If the flesh returns after treatment—for it often does—cut it again and cauterize it; it will not return after cauterization.
Chapter Twenty-Nine.
On extracting teeth with iron.
Rough, unsightly crusts may gather on the surfaces of the teeth, inside and out, and between the gums.  These may become black, yellow, or green, even causing damage to the gums and disfiguring the teeth.
You should seat the patient before you, his head in your lap, and clean the tooth or teeth showing crusts and anything resembling sand until nothing remains.  Do the same with blackness, greenness, yellowness, and anything else, until you have cleansed them.
If the material is removed during the first cleaning, good. Otherwise, repeat the cleaning on another day, and then a second and third, until you achieve your goal. Know that a tooth may require different shaped and numerous instruments, according to what suits your work.
For the instrument used to clean a tooth from the inside is not the same as that used to clean it from the outside, nor the one used to clean between the teeth, which is of yet another form.  These are several forms of instruments, all of which you should have prepared:
Chapter Thirty.
On the Extraction of Teeth.
You should treat a painful tooth by every means and delay its extraction, for there is no replacement for it once extracted, because it is a noble substance, except when its extraction is unavoidable.
If the patient is determined to have it extracted, you should make sure that you have correctly identified the painful tooth. Often the patient is deceived by the pain and thinks it is in a sound tooth, so he extracts it, but the pain does not go away until the diseased tooth is extracted. We have seen this done repeatedly by barbers.
If you have correctly identified the painful tooth, then you should incise around the tooth with a strong scalpel to loosen the gum on all sides, then move it gently with your fingers or with delicate forceps, little by little, until you loosen it.
Then firmly grasp it with the large forceps, holding the patient's head between your knees so that he does not move; then pull the tooth straight out so as not to break it. If it does not come out, then take one of those instruments and gently insert it under it from all sides, and then move it as you did before.
If the tooth is perforated or decayed, you should fill the hole with a cloth and pack it tightly with the end of a thin probe, lest it crumble when you pull on it with the forceps; and you should thoroughly incise around the gum on every side.
Take care not to break it, for if some of it remains, it will cause the patient a greater affliction than his initial pain. And beware of doing what ignorant barbers do, rushing in and extracting it without using what we have described.
For they often inflict great harm on people, the least of which is that the tooth breaks and all or part of its roots remain. Or it may be extracted with some of the jawbone, as we have witnessed many times. Then, after its extraction, let him rinse with a potion or with vinegar and salt. If bleeding occurs from the site—and this often happens—then crush some alum and plug the site with it.
Otherwise, cauterize it if the alum does not help. The image of the delicate forceps with which you first move the tooth: they should have long ends, short handles, and be thick so that they do not bend when you grasp the tooth with them.  And this is the image of the large forceps:
They should be, as you see, thick in the handles, so that when you grasp them they do not give way or bend; short in the ends; and made of Indian iron or of well-tempered steel, with polished ends, and at the end teeth that interlock, so that they grasp firmly and tightly.
And the ends may be made in the shape of a file, which will also make them strong in their grip.
Chapter Thirty-One.
On the extraction of the roots of molars and the removal of fractured jawbones.
If, when extracting a tooth, a root remains broken, you should apply a pledget of cotton soaked in butter to the area for a day or two until the area relaxes, then insert the forceps or hooks. whose ends resemble the beak of the bird called the balarjah.  And this is an image of the hooks:
They should be made like a file on the inside, or like a chisel. If you cannot extract it with these hooks, you should drill into the root and expose all the flesh with a scalpel, then insert the instrument resembling a small lever, whose image is this:
short at the tip, somewhat thick, and not too pointed, lest it break. If the root is extracted by this means, well and good; otherwise, use these other instruments, whose images are these: the first has a triangular tip and some thickness.
Another fine triangular image:
And we may also use this instrument with two branches, whose image is also this:
And other instruments and tools previously mentioned in the extraction of teeth.  We may also use this instrument resembling a large hook, whose image is this:
Triangular at the curved tip, somewhat thick so that it does not break, and not too pointed. Know that the instruments for teeth are numerous, as are all the other instruments—they are almost countless—and the skillful and experienced craftsman may invent for himself instruments according to what the work and the diseases themselves indicate.
For there are diseases for which the ancients did not mention instruments, because of their different types.  If a bone of the jaw or one of the bones of the mouth is broken or becomes infected, then search for it in its place with one of these instruments and hooks mentioned in the extraction of roots.
And we use a curette, its image is this:
It should be somewhat thick to grasp the bone so that it does not slip until the bone is removed. We treat the area with appropriate medication. If the bone has slight decay, scrape away its decay and blackness until it is clean, then treat it until it heals.
Chapter Thirty-Two.
On the extraction of molars growing on top of others.
If molars grow in a place other than their natural position, this is unsightly, especially in women and slaves.  One should examine it; if the molar has grown behind another tooth,
and its extraction or repositioning is impossible, extract it. If it is attached to another tooth, cut it with this instrument, whose image is this:
It resembles a small beak and should be made of sharp Indian iron.  The cutting should be done over many days because of the tooth's hardness, so as not to loosen other teeth.  But if it is protruding and its extraction is possible, extract it with a file from India, whose image is this.
It should be entirely of Indian steel, very finely worked, like the file used to make needles.  File the tooth little by little over many days, gently, so as not to loosen the tooth and cause it to fall out. Then smooth it further and remove it with some forceps.
If a tooth is broken and hurts the tongue when speaking, it should also be filed until the roughness of the fracture is removed, it becomes smooth, and it no longer hurts the tongue or impairs speech.
Chapter Thirty-Three
On binding loose teeth with silver or gold threads.
If the front teeth become loose and move due to a blow or fall, and the patient cannot bite on anything to eat for fear that they will fall out, and if astringent medicines have been tried without success,
the remedy is to bind them with a gold or silver thread; gold is better because silver tarnishes and decays after a few days, while gold remains unchanged forever. The thread should be of medium thickness, suitable for the space between the teeth.
The method of binding is to take the thread and insert its loop between two sound teeth, then weave the ends of the thread between the loose teeth, whether one or more, until the weaving reaches a sound tooth on the other side.
Then weave back to the side where you began, pulling gently and carefully so that the teeth do not move at all.  Tighten the thread at the roots of the teeth so that it does not come loose. Then cut off the excess ends of the thread with scissors, gather them together, twist them, and hide them between the sound tooth and the loose tooth.
So that it does not injure the tongue. Leave it tied in this way as long as it remains. If it becomes loose or breaks, tie it again with another thread.  The patient will enjoy this method for a lifetime. This is an image of the teeth, showing how the binding is done between two sound teeth and two loose teeth, as you see.
A single tooth or two, after falling out, may be returned to their place and bound as described, and will remain. This is done by a skilled dentist. He may carve a piece of ox bone, shape it like a tooth, and place it in the space where the tooth was lost. And it is tied as we have said, and remains, and the patient enjoys it.
Chapter Thirty-Four
Concerning the cutting of the ligament which appears under the tongue and prevents speech.
This ligament which appears under the tongue may be either natural, with which a person is born, or accidental, from a healed wound.
And the procedure is that you open the mouth of the patient and place his head in your lap and raise his tongue, then cut that nervous ligament transversely until the tongue is released from its restraint.  If there is some stiffness and entanglement, and this is from a healed wound, then insert a hook into it and split it transversely until the ligament is severed and the knots are loosened.
And beware that the incision is not deep in the flesh, lest you cut an artery there and bleeding results. Then let him rinse his mouth after the cutting with rosewater or with vinegar and cold water, then place under the tongue a pledget of linen which the patient holds in place each night.
Lest it unite again. If bleeding occurs, place powdered alum on the area. If the bleeding overcomes you, cauterize the place with a lentil-sized cautery suitable for this. Then treat it with the other treatments until it heals.
Chapter Thirty-Five.
On removing a frog that has formed under the tongue.
A tumor resembling a small frog may occur under the tongue, preventing the tongue from its natural function, and perhaps growing until it fills the mouth. The procedure is to open the patient's mouth toward the sun and look at the tumor.
If you see it dark-colored or black, hard, and the patient feels nothing in it, do not interfere with it, for it is cancer. But if it is whitish and moist, pierce it with a hook and incise it with a fine scalpel, freeing it on all sides.
If the bleeding is excessive during the procedure, apply powdered vitriol until the bleeding stops, then resume the procedure until you remove it completely. Then, gargle with vinegar and salt.
Then treat it with other appropriate remedies until it heals.
Chapter Thirty-Six.
In the treatment of tonsil tumors.
And what grows in the throat from other tumors;  glands may appear inside the throat, resembling those that appear externally, called tonsils. If you treat them as described in the section and they do not heal,
then look: if the tumor is hard, dark in color, and insensitive, do not use the cautery on it; and if it is red in color and its base is thick, do not use the cautery on it either, for fear of hemorrhage, but leave it until it matures, then either cauterize it or it will break open of its own accord.
And if it is white in color, round, and its base is thin, this is what should be cut.  The procedure is that you should look before operating whether its hot inflammation has completely subsided or diminished somewhat.
Then seat the patient facing the sun, his head in your lap, open his mouth, and have an assistant hold down his tongue with an instrument of this form:
It is made of silver or copper, thin like a knife. When you press the tongue down with it and the tumor is visible, take a hook and insert it into the tonsil, pulling it outward as much as possible without pulling any of the membranes with it.
Then cut it with an instrument of this form: it resembles scissors, except that its two ends are curved, each sharp and close to the other, made of Indian iron or Damascus steel:
If this instrument is not available, then cut it with a scalpel of this form:
sharp on one side and blunt on the other. After you cut one tonsil, cut the other in the same way. Then, after cutting, gargle the patient with cold water or vinegar and water.
If bleeding occurs, gargle with water in which pomegranate peels or myrtle leaves, or similar astringents, have been boiled until the bleeding stops.  Then treat it until it heals. Other tumors may grow in the throat besides the tonsils; cut them as I described for the tonsils.
I treated a woman with a tumor that had grown inside her throat, resembling a polyp, somewhat insensitive, almost obstructing the throat. The woman was breathing through a narrow passage and was prevented from eating and drinking water.
She was on the verge of death if she remained for a day or two.  Two branches extended from the tumor, reaching her nostrils. I acted quickly, inserting a hook into one of them and pulling; a suitable piece was extracted.
Then I cut it where I reached it through the nostril. I did the same with what protruded from the other nostril. Then I opened her mouth, depressed her tongue, inserted the hook into the tumor itself, and cut some of it. Only a little blood flowed.
The woman's throat opened, and she immediately began to drink water and eat.  We continued to cut away portions of the tumor repeatedly over a long time, the tumor replacing what was cut, until this went on for a long time for both of us.
Then I devised a plan and cauterized the tumor inside the throat with a cautery. It stopped growing, and she travelled away. I do not know what God did with her afterwards.
Chapter Thirty-Seven.
On cutting a uvular tumor.
That which is called a uvular tumor: if it descends to the uvula, swells, and is white and elongated, it is called a column; if it is thick below and round, it is called a uvular tumor. If it is treated as mentioned in the classification and the treatment is ineffective,
and I saw that the hot tumor had subsided from it and it was thin, then it should be cut, and whatever was of it that was gathered, round, and did not have length, and was bloody or the color of pus, or black, or insensitive, then it should be avoided cutting it.
For there is danger to the patient. Therefore, if you see it in the manner that I have described, of its whiteness and length, then seat the patient next to the sun, and compress his tongue with the instrument previously described, then pierce the uvular tumor with the hook.
And pull it downwards and cut it with one of the two instruments mentioned in cutting the tonsils.  It should not be cut except for that which exceeds the natural state without addition, for if you cut more of it, you will harm the voice and speech.
Then, after cutting, use what we described in cutting the tonsils and treat it until it heals. If the patient is afraid of cutting it, then it is necessary to use a method to cauterize it without fear or caution. The method of cauterization is with a strong medicine, and it is that you place the patient's head in your lap.
Then compress his tongue with the instrument we mentioned, then take some of the strong water which we mentioned in the chapter on cauterization, and mix it with unquenched lime, and make it neither thick nor thin, and fill the concavity of this instrument with it. This is its image:
The end in which you place the medicine has a concavity like the concavity of a spoon, and you place the instrument with the medicine on the uvula itself, and the patient lies on his side so that the saliva flows from his mouth from inside his throat, lest anything descend into his throat and harm him.
Then hold your hand with the medicine while you press it against the uvula for about half an hour until you see that it has blackened and the sting of the medicine has subsided. And if you wish, take cotton, wrap it around the end of a probe, and moisten the cotton in the medicine.
And insert the probe with the cotton into the tube from above until the cotton adheres to the uvula. Do this repeatedly until you achieve the desired cauterization of the uvula, then leave it; it will wither and fall after three or four days. If you need to reapply the medicine, reapply it.
After cauterization, wipe around the uvula with cotton soaked in butter and wipe away the medicine from around it. Then, rinse with cold water and treat externally with lotions and internally with gargles until it heals. This type of treatment is safer than cutting and less frightening.
The uvula may also be treated with something gentler than cautery and cutting; it is treated with fumigation in this manner: take futhung, zovfa, savory, sithab, wormwood, chamomile, and qisum, and similar herbs. Gather them all or some of them in a pot and submerge them in vinegar.
Boil it, the pot being coated with  philosopher's clay, and there should be a hole in the middle of the lid through which a hollow instrument is fitted, made in this manner, of silver or copper:
Insert the end with the rose-shaped head into the patient's mouth until the vapor rises to the uvula through the tube until the uvula is thoroughly moistened. Then repeat this several times until it withers. And beware of using this treatment at the very beginning of the swelling.
For it often increases the swelling. Rather, it should be done when its hot swelling subsides. If you do not have this instrument, take a reed and fit an eggshell to its end, lest the patient's mouth be burned.
Because the eggshell prevents the heat of the vapor from burning the mouth. And this is a good treatment, and safe.
Chapter thirty-eight.
On removing thorns and other things that lodge in the throat.
Often a bone or fishbone or something else lodges in the throat.  It is necessary to remove what is visible to the eye, after compressing the tongue with the instrument, towards the sun.
So that what is in the throat becomes clear to you.  And as for what does not appear to you and is hidden in the throat, it is necessary to make the patient vomit before his food is digested in his stomach.  Perhaps the lodged object will come out with the vomit, or the patient may swallow a piece of turnip or a stalk of lettuce.
Or he may swallow a piece of dry bread, or you may take a piece of soft sea sponge, tie it to a string, and then he swallows it. When it reaches the location of the thorn, pull the string quickly; do this repeatedly.
Often the thorn or bone will stick to it and come out. If it does not come out by the means mentioned, then use a lead instrument in this manner:
It should be slightly thicker than an awl, and at its tip a hook. The patient inserts it gently into his throat while raising his head upwards, and he should be careful not to touch his throat, lest it cause coughing and push the bone or thorn. Or the physician inserts it with his hand.
And it is better for the patient to insert it himself, because he knows the location of the lodged object, and he pushes it downwards or pulls it upwards with the instrument, all this as much as he can manage, until it comes out.
Chapter Thirty-Nine.
On removing leeches lodged in the throat.
If you treat the leech with what we mentioned in the section on medicinal treatment and it does not work, then look in the patient's throat in the sunlight after you have depressed his tongue with the instrument which I described to you.
If you see the leech, then pull it out with a small hook or with a soft, firm swab. If you cannot manage this, then take a hollow tube and insert it into the patient's throat near the leech, then insert a rod heated in the fire into the inside of the tube.
Do this several times, and the patient should abstain from water for the whole day. Then he should take a jug full of cold water, open his mouth into it, and rinse his mouth with it, not swallowing a drop, moving the water around from time to time with his hand.
The leech will fall out when it feels the water. If it does not come out as we described, then fumigate the throat with urine and asafoetida using the instrument described for fumigating the tonsils; do this several times, and it will fall out.
The method of fumigation is that you take a pot containing glowing embers heated by fire, the pot being covered with a lid in the middle of which is a hole.  You fit the end of the instrument into this hole, then throw in the fumigant.  The patient puts his mouth to the end of the tube and closes his mouth so that the fumigant does not escape, until he knows that the fumigant has reached his throat.
Then the leech will fall out. If it does not fall out, then repeat the fumigation several times. The patient should endure thirst and eat salt and garlic, and not drink water; it will necessarily come out with this treatment. This is an image of an instrument with which the leech is drawn from the throat when it is seen.
It resembles forceps, as you see, except that it has this curvature which enters the throat, and its tips resemble a bird's beak; they have the roughness of a file, so that if they grip something, they do not let go.
And another instrument with which the tongue is compressed; it is a wide iron ring, large enough to encompass the mouth over the tongue. It is inserted into the mouth standing on its side, so that the mouth remains open without the patient's will, and he is unable to remove it at all until it is removed.
Description of the instrument with which the mouth is opened in this very way.
Chapter Forty.
It will treat of the cauterization and incision of tumors.
Tumors are of many and varied kinds, as will be described one by one in this book. They differ in their cauterization and incision in two respects: one, from the type of tumor itself and what it contains of humors.
The second type [of difference] is because of the locations in the body where they occur, for a tumor occurring in the head is not the same as a tumor occurring in the rectum, and a tumor occurring in a fleshy location is not the same as a tumor occurring in a joint; each has its own treatment.
Some tumors should not be cauterized except after the pus in them has matured and is complete, while others should be cauterized while they are still raw and have not fully matured, such as tumors that are near the joints.
Because if a tumor occurs near a joint and its condition persists until it corrupts what is around it, it may destroy the ligaments or nerves of that joint, thus causing the dysfunction of that limb; or the tumor may be near a principal organ.
For if you delay its cauterization until it matures, you will harm that principal organ; or it may be near the rectum, so cauterize it while it is raw.  It is necessary to cauterize a tumor while it is raw and not fully mature if it is near the rectum, lest it corrupt the tissues and penetrate into the interior of the rectum and become a fistula.
And it becomes something that does not heal. You should know the time for cauterizing tumors that have fully matured, which is when the pain of the tumor subsides, the fever disappears, the redness and throbbing decrease, the head of the tumor softens, and all other signs [of maturation] appear.
And you should apply the cautery to the lowest possible part of the tumor if you can, so that the flow of pus is easier downwards, or in the thinnest and most prominent part of the tumor.  The cautery should be lengthwise if the tumors are in the hands or feet.
And the locations of muscles, tendons, nerves, and arteries, and in general, all flat places that do not bend. As for those that bend, apply the cautery according to that location. But if the tumor is in fleshy places, it is best to leave it uncauterized.
Until its maturation is complete, as we have said, for if you cauterize it before that, the flow of pus from it will be prolonged, and it will be very harmful and dirty, and perhaps its lips and base will harden. Some tumors may be cauterized across the body, if necessary, or according to what the organ requires.
And you should use a single cautery for small tumors, and for large tumors a wide cautery or many incisions, according to the size of the tumor. There may be tumors in which it is necessary to remove the skin and cut it if it has become like a rag.
And it has reached the point where it has died, as happens in many abscesses and hidden collections of pus.  Some are incised with a three-cornered incision, and some are cut in the shape of an ivy leaf, like an inguinal tumor.
And some require a circular incision, a crescent-shaped incision, and similar incisions. As for those that do not have a head, like smooth, flat tumors, they should only be cauterized simply. If the tumor is large and has collected for a long time, and you cauterize it, you should not rush to remove all the pus at that time.
Rather, remove some of it, then dress the tumor until the next day, then remove some of the pus also; do this repeatedly gradually until you remove all of it.
Especially if the patient is weak, or a pregnant woman, or a small child, or an old man, for the vital spirit often dissolves with the sudden removal of pus, so the patient may die and you do not realize it; therefore, be very cautious in this matter.
After cauterizing these tumors, you should wipe the wound and look at it. If the wound of the tumor is small, or if the incision is single and simple, then use a pledget of linen or old cotton.  If the tumor is large and the cauterization incisions are many,
then you should insert a tent into each incision until some reach each other. And if some of the skin of the tumor has been cut or thinned, then you should pack it with old cotton or linen lint without moisture and dress it until the third day.
Then remove it and treat it with the appropriate ointments until it heals. If bleeding occurs during your work, use cold water and vinegar, after having soaked a linen cloth in them, and apply it to the bleeding site repeatedly.
If the bleeding persists, you should use the management, treatment, and styptics that we have described in many places in this book and in the sections. If it is winter and the tumor site is very sensitive, you should moisten the pledgets with a warm syrup and oil.
And place them on the site. If it is summer and the sites are fleshy, you should apply pledgets soaked in water and oil or in syrup and oil, all of it cold, until the third day, as we said. Then you should remove the dressing and wipe the tumor.
And use similar treatments until it heals. This is what you need to know about the general treatment of tumors. As for the detailed method, I have mentioned how to treat each tumor, categorized and summarized.
Chapter forty-one.
On the incision of tumors that appear on the scalp.
Small tumors appear on the scalp; they are a type of boil, contained within membranes, with conditions like a chicken’s crop.  Their types are numerous; some are fatty, and some contain a moisture resembling mud.
Some contain a moisture resembling pus and broth, and so on; and some are hardened and solid.  There is no danger in incising and removing all of them, unless you encounter an artery during the incision.
The procedure for their incision is to first probe them with the instrument whose image comes after this, which is called the *muddass*, so that you know what it contains. If what it contains is moisture, then incise it lengthwise with a simple incision in this manner:
Begin the incision from point B to point J. When the moisture is emptied, remove the sac that contained that moisture and cut it all away, leaving nothing at all, for it often recurs if any of it remains.
Then dip cotton in yellow ointment, if available; otherwise, in salt water, and fill the wound with it, and leave it until the next day, for it will eat away what remains of the sac. Then apply the cotton with the yellow ointment again and again if necessary.
Until you are certain that nothing of the sac remains. Then treat the wound with ointments until it heals. If the swelling contains fatty matter, incise it in this manner:
Make a firm incision, and catch the hooks in the lips of the wound and strip it from every side.  Do your best to remove the membrane that contains it. If an artery obstructs you, do as I have described for you; similarly, act in the case of a swelling if it is hardened from the incision.
The treatment is the same as I have described.  Incision of a hardened swelling is easier because it has little blood and moisture.  Some of these swellings in the head in some people may have no moisture at all; I once incised a swelling in...
the head of an old woman, and I found the swelling like hard, rough, white stone; it could not be broken, and if anyone were to throw it, it would cut him.  And it was not like the other swellings occurring in the head, other than this, such as the swellings that appear in the heads of children.
And at the roots of the ears, incise them all with a simple incision, and make their base from their lower parts so that the flow of the matter to the bottom is easier, then treat them with what is suitable for them from the treatment.
Chapter forty-two.
Concerning the incision of the tumors which frequently appear in the neck. These tumors frequently appear in the neck, and under the armpits, and in the groins, and they may appear in the rest of the body. That which appears in the neck may be one or many, and some of them develop from others.
And each of these tumors is within a special membrane, as is the case with abscesses and the tumors of the head as we have described. And the types of these tumors are many; some are calcified, and some contain fluids, and some are malignant and do not respond to treatment.
And I have not seen one of them in good condition to the touch, and its exterior was near the color of the skin, it moved in every direction, and it was not attached to a nerve of the neck, nor to a vein, nor to an artery, nor was it sunken. Then it should be incised with a simple incision from the top to the bottom of the body, in this manner, from line J to line B.
And it should be dissected from every direction, and the edges of the skin should be stretched with a hook or with two hooks, or with many hooks if it is necessary, as we have said in the case of the tumors of the head, and it should be removed little by little, and care should be taken not to cut a vein or a nerve, and let the scalpel not be too sharp.
Lest your hand increase the cutting, or the patient be troubled, and you cut what you do not need to cut.  If you cut a vein or an artery and it hinders you from working, place in the wound powdered glass or some of the things that stop blood.
And bind the wound and leave it until the intensity of the swelling subsides and the wound relaxes and begins to fester, for the bleeding will then stop. Then return to your work until you finish, then examine with your index finger if there remain any other small tumors, then cut them and clean them.
If there is a large vein at the root of the tumor, then it should not be cut from its root, but it should be tied with a doubled tight thread and left until it falls off by itself without harm, then stuff the wound with old cotton which has been soaked in Egyptian ointment, then treat it.
And if the whole tumor is cut, then it is necessary to bring together the edges of the wound and stitch it immediately after you know that no residue remains at all. If you see that some residue of the bone of the tumor remains,
then it is necessary to aim the cutting at its root and base, and use stitching and what we mentioned.  And as for tumors containing fluids, apply a simple poultice where their maturation appears, and place the poultice on the lower side, as we said.
Then, after the poultice, use a dressing with Egyptian ointment or similar to consume what remains of the corruption, until when you see the wound has been cleansed, then treat it with ointments that generate flesh until it heals.
Chapter forty-three.
Concerning the incision of the throat for a tumor that occurs inside the throat.
The ancients mentioned this incision in the throat, but I have not seen anyone in our country perform it. This is the account of their words. As for those with angina, they should avoid an incision of the throat, for they will not benefit from it.
Because all the veins and the lung will be weak. But those with a hot tumor in the mouth, throat, or tonsils, if there is no illness in the windpipe, then it is necessary to use an incision of the throat to escape the harm that results from suffocation.
Therefore, if we want to do this, we should incise the throat below three or four rings of the windpipe, a small transverse incision between two rings, to the extent of the incision in the peritoneum, not in the cartilage. This place is suitable for the incision.
Because it is devoid of flesh and the blood vessels are far from it. If the physician is cowardly, he should stretch the skin of the throat with a hook, then incise the skin until he reaches the windpipe, avoiding the blood vessels if he sees any.
Then he incises the peritoneum that we described.  The incision of the windpipe is indicated by the phlegm that comes out of it along with whatever is lacerated, and by the cessation of the voice. The wound is left open for a time. When the time during which suffocation was feared has passed, the edges of the wound are brought together from the skin.
Its incision is alone, without the cartilage. Then use medicines that grow flesh until it heals.  The author of this book said, the explanation of all this talk that we have related is only if they see that the patient's throat is obstructed by one of these tumors which were mentioned.
And the patient was close to death, and his life was about to end, they went to incise the throat so that the patient might breathe somewhat through the wound and be saved from death. And they were ordered to leave the wound open until the crisis of the disease passes, and its duration is three days or so.
Then they ordered the wound to be sutured and treated until it heals. What I witnessed myself is that a maidservant took a knife and ran it across her throat, cutting some of the lung windpipe. I was called to treat her, and I found her expiring like a slaughtered animal.  I uncovered the wound.
I found the blood that came out of the wound to be slight, and I was certain that she had not cut a vein nor an artery.  Air was coming out of the wound. I proceeded, incised the wound, and treated it until it healed.  Nothing happened to the maidservant except hoarseness in the voice, nothing more.
And after days she returned to her best condition. Therefore, we say that incision of the throat is not dangerous.
Chapter forty-four.
Concerning the incision of the tumor that appears in the throat from the outside, and is called the throat’s elephantiasis.
This tumor, which is called the throat's elephantiasis, is a large tumor of the color of the body. It is frequent in women and is of two types.
Either it is natural or accidental. As for the natural, there is no remedy for it; as for the accidental, it is of two kinds: one resembling fatty swellings, the other resembling the tumor that results from the entanglement of an artery, and its incision is dangerous. Therefore, one should not at all use the iron on it unless it is small; if you probe and examine it with a probe and find that it resembles a fatty swelling and is not attached to anything of the veins, then incise it as you would incise fatty swellings. And remove it with whatever encloses it from the sac if it is in a sac; otherwise, remove all of it, then treat the area with whatever treatment is appropriate.
Chapter forty-five.
On the incision of various swellings.
Swellings are numerous in types, and I have mentioned all their types in the classification. It is necessary to explain here the difference between a swelling and an abscess, since it is difficult. I say that an abscess is accompanied by heat, fever, and terrifying pains until the boiling of the matter subsides. And the suppuration is completed, then the fever and intensity subside.  A swelling is not accompanied by heat, fever, or pain, and it is contained in a membranous sac, which is its special covering; it is the color of the body, and its beginning is like a lentil, and it becomes like a blister, larger or smaller.
And it is of two types: either fatty, or containing moisture. The types of moisture are numerous, as I have mentioned in the classification.  Therefore, when you come to treat a swelling, you should first probe and examine it with the instrument called the probe, the image of which comes in the chapter after this.
Assess the size of the swelling, then remove the probe and look at what comes out after it. If a fluid of any color comes out, then incise it with a simple incision, as I have mentioned in other swellings. If no fluid comes out after the probe, then know that it is fatty.
Then make a firm incision on it in this manner, as I have taught you.  Hang it with hooks and peel the skin from each side gently, and preserve the sac if you can, so that you may remove it whole with the swelling.
If the sac is perforated during the procedure and you cannot remove it whole—and this often happens—then remove it piece by piece until nothing remains. For if any part remains, however small or large, the swelling will most often return.
If it overcomes you and a small part remains, cauterize the wound with some sharp cauterizing points upon completion.  Then close the wound and apply something to calm the hot swelling, and treat it with the other treatments until it heals. If the swelling is large, stitch its edges and treat it with what unites.
If you encounter a pulsating or non-pulsating vein and bleeding occurs, immediately cauterize the area with powdered vitriol and leave it bound for two or three days until the wound becomes infected and the flow of blood stops. Then return to removing what remains of the swelling.
Chapter forty-six.
On the forms of instruments.
Those which are used in incision and cauterization:  The forms of probes, of which there are three types: large, medium, and small.
Image of a large probe.
Image of a medium probe.
Image of a small probe.
They are made of strong iron, square-ended, tightly made, to facilitate entry into tumors.  These are the images of probes, also called  "bard". There are also three types: large, medium, and small. Image of a large probe:
Image of a medium probe.
Image of a small probe.
They are suitable for exploring tumors, wounds, fistulas, and abscesses to determine what is inside them, such as bone and other things. They are made round, polished, and smooth like styluses, from Chinese copper or electrum, or from copper, iron, or silver. The best are those made of electrum.
Probes can also be made of lead. They are suitable for exploring fistulas which have curves in their depths, because their softness allows them to follow the curves.  There are also three types of these: long, medium, and short.
According to the need of each fistula's depth, and its thickness should be according to the width and narrowness of the fistula. Image of a large lead probe.
Image of a medium-sized lead probe.
Image of a small lead probe.
Images of hooks.  They are of many types: simple, meaning those with one hook—which are of three types: large, medium, and small; blind hooks—which are of three types; hooks with two hooks—which are of three types; and curved hooks with two hooks. They are of three types.  And there are hooks with three hooks—which are of three types. Each of these types is needed in its place. Image of a large simple hook. Image of a medium simple hook. Image of a small simple hook.

Image of a small scalpel.
Its blades, with which it cuts, are sharpened, and the other ends are not sharpened, but rather made thus so that one may use them in excising the sore when there is fear of cutting a vein or nerve, and so that the patient may be more comfortable and find some relief from the burning he feels when the tumor is excised.
And these are the images of the probes. They are of three types, for there are large ones, medium ones, and small ones. Image of a large probe.
It is made of copper, similar to the style used for kohl, and at one end is something like a wide spoon of two layers, which has at its head a hidden blade resembling a bird's tongue, which moves in and out as desired, as you see.
Images of the scalpels which are inserted between the fingers when cutting tumors, without the patient feeling them.  They are of three types, for there are large ones, medium ones, and small ones. Image of a large scalpel.
Images of the cupping instruments with which blood is let; they are of three types, for there are large ones, medium ones, and small ones. Image of the large cupping instrument.
They are made of copper or of china, slightly elongated as you see, and they should be thin.  It is necessary that you have these types of cupping instruments, large and small, to let blood quickly when necessary and when you do not have medicine at hand.
But they are not used to let blood in every part of the body, but rather they are used in fleshy parts such as the muscles of the leg and thigh, the muscles of the arm, the breast, the abdomen, the groin, and similar moist fleshy parts.
And other small instruments may be made from them, resembling pistachio shells, in this manner:
Blood is let with them if it flows from a place of phlebotomy or when a vein or artery is cut. And they may be made round in this manner:

On treating the breasts of men.
The breasts of some people may swell at puberty until they resemble women's breasts, remaining swollen and unsightly.  Whoever dislikes this should make a crescent-shaped incision on the breast in this manner.
From line B to line C. Then remove all the fat, then fill the wound with styptic medication, then bring the edges of the wound together with sutures and treat it until it heals. If the breast inclines downwards and becomes flaccid due to its size, as happens to women,
it is necessary to make two crescent-shaped incisions in its upper sides, each connecting to the other at their ends so that the larger line encircles the smaller one in this manner: From line B to line C, then remove the skin between the incisions and remove the fat, and use what we have mentioned of sutures and cauterization and whatever treatment is needed until it heals.
If you are unable to remove what needs to be removed because of the patient's anxiety or because of bleeding, then you should pack the wound with cotton soaked in corrosive ointment and leave it until it consumes the remaining fat, then treat it until it heals.
Chapter forty-eight.
On the excision of tumors that appear under the armpit.
These tumors that appear under the armpit are of the type of hard swellings contained in a sac, and some contain fluids.  As for those containing fluids, an incision should be made in a crescent shape like this.
From line B to line C. If all the fluid in the tumor is evacuated, pack it with old cotton and leave it until the next day, then remove the cotton.
And treat it with a suitable ointment until it heals. If the tumor is of the type of hard swellings, incise it as we mentioned in the incision on swellings. If the wound continues to suppurate, cauterize it as we mentioned previously.
Chapter forty-nine.
Incising a tumor that appears near an artery or vein, called aneurysma.
If an artery is injured and the skin above it heals, a tumor often results; similarly, a vein may also develop a swelling and tumor.
The signs by which one knows whether the tumor and swelling are from an artery or a vein are: if the tumor is from an artery, it is oblong and deep-seated in the body; and if you press the tumor with your finger, you feel as if it has a murmur.
That which is from a vein, the tumor is round on the surface of the body. Incision of these tumors is dangerous, especially those in the armpit, groin, and neck, and in many other places in the body, and if they are very large, one should avoid treating them with iron.
And those that are in the extremities or head should also be avoided.  As for those that are a swelling of the mouth of an artery, incise it in the skin lengthwise, then open the incision with hooks, then strip the artery and free it from the membranes.
Until it is exposed, then insert a needle underneath and pass it to the other side, and tie the artery with a doubled thread in two places, as I have shown you in ligating the two arteries in the temples; then incise with a scalpel the area between the ligatures until all the blood in it comes out.
Then the tumor will resolve, and you use treatment that produces pus until the ligatures fall off, then treat it with appropriate ointments until it heals.
If the tumor is from a vein incision, then you should grasp with your hand as much of the tumor and skin as you can, then insert a needle below the place you grasped with your hand, and pass it with a doubled thread until it comes out the other side. Then tie the tumor tightly with it, as I have described to you in tying the uvula from both sides with the ends of the thread. If you fear that the threads will slip, then insert another needle with another thread under the whole tumor at the intersection of the first needle.
And tighten your threads in four places, then incise the tumor in its middle until what is in it comes out. Then cut off the excess skin and leave what was tied. Then place on it a compress that you have soaked in a potion and oil. Then use treatment that involves cauterization and ointments until it heals.
Chapter Fifty.
On the tumor which results from the twisting of a nerve.
Just as a tumor occurs in an artery and vein, so a tumor occurs in a nerve if it is struck or if it results from excessive exertion or the like.  This is most common in the wrists and heels.
And in every place where the joints move, it is a hard tumor resembling in color the rest of the body. In most cases it is not painful, and if pressed hard the patient feels a kind of numbness.  The tumor is not deep within the body.
Rather, it is under the skin and moves in every direction, but not forward or backward. As for that which is in the joints, it should not be treated with iron, for it may cause harm. And as for that which is in the head or forehead...
then incise the skin with a scalpel. If the tumor is small, grasp it with forceps and cut it from its base. If it is large, hang it with a hook and flay it, then remove it and close the wound with sutures and treat it until it heals.
Chapter fifty-one.
On the excision of warts which appear on the abdomen.
Many people develop warts on their abdomens and other parts of their bodies, called fungal warts because of their resemblance to mushrooms. Their base is thin and their head thick; their lips may become inverted. Some are small, and some become very large indeed.
I once saw a man who had two warts on his abdomen; they were very like mushrooms, white and thin at the base, their lips inverted and cracked, with moisture constantly flowing from them. I excised them; one weighed about eighteen ounces, the other about six.
In excising them, observe that if the patient is moist and the wart is white, moist, and thin at the base, excise it with a broad scalpel; keep cautery irons ready in the fire, for often a great deal of blood flows when they are cut.
If the bleeding is excessive, cauterize it immediately. If you find the patient cowardly and afraid of being cut with iron, take a strong lead thread and tie it tightly around the wart of this type, leaving it for two days; then tighten the lead further, continuing to tighten it.
Keep tightening until the wart is affected, so that it separates and falls off by itself without trouble. If the wart has a thick base, there is some danger and uncertainty in excising it, especially if it is in the abdomen; however, it is sometimes possible to excise half of it or a part of it.
Then cauterize it to prevent recurrence, and treat it until the wound heals. Beware of excising a wart that is dark-colored, insensitive, and foul-looking, for it is a cancerous tumor; we shall speak of cancer later.
Chapter fifty-two.
On the treatment of umbilical hernias.
Umbilical hernias result from many causes: either from a rupture of the peritoneum of the abdomen, from which the omentum or intestine protrudes, as occurs in other hernias; or from blood emanating from a vein or artery, as previously mentioned; or from wind collecting there.
If it is due to a rupture of the peritoneum and protrusion of the omentum, then the color of the swelling will resemble that of the body, it will be soft without pain, and will appear in various positions. If it is due to the protrusion of the intestine, its position will be, as we have described, more variable. If you press it with your fingers, it disappears then returns, and there may be gurgling. It increases greatly with entering the bath and with severe exertion. If it is due to moisture, then it will be soft.
It does not disappear when pressed with your hand, nor does it increase or decrease. If it is due to blood, then along with these signs the swelling appears dark. If it is due to newly formed flesh, then the swelling will be hard, firm, and remain at a constant size.
If it is due to wind, it will be soft to the touch. The procedure in this case is to observe. If the umbilical hernia is due to blood from an artery or vein, or to wind, then you should refrain from treating it, for there is danger and uncertainty in that, as I have informed you in the chapter where I mentioned swellings arising from arteries and veins.
If the umbilical hernia is due to the intestine or omentum, then you should instruct the patient to restrain himself and stand erect and extended, then you should apply a bandage around the entire umbilicus. Then you should instruct him to lie on his back between your hands, then you should incise with a wide scalpel around the umbilicus at the place marked with ink, then you should draw the middle of the swelling upwards with a large forceps, then you should tie the incised area with strong thread or silk sinew, tightly.
The knot of the ligature should be a slip-knot. Then you open the middle of the pulled-tight swelling above the ligature and insert your index finger, and seek the intestine. If you find that the ligature has grasped it, loosen the slip-knot and push the intestine into the abdomen. If you find omentum, draw it out with forceps.
And cut off its excess. If an artery or vein obstructs you, ligate it carefully and return to your work. Take two needles and thread them with strong threads, and insert the two needles into the incision that you made around the swelling, crossing them, having passed them through. Then tighten the swelling in four places on the needles.
And if you wish, remove the needles and leave the area until the constricted flesh becomes putrid and falls off by itself, or cut it if it becomes soft and putrid. Then treat it with appropriate ointments until it heals. If the umbilical hernia is from flesh that has grown there,
or from moisture, then it is necessary to constrict the swelling as we said, and to remove the blood or moisture that you find in it, then treat it with what will close the area.
Chapter Fifty-Three.
On the treatment of cancer.
We have mentioned in the classification the types of cancer and how to treat it with medication, and warned against treating it with iron lest it ulcerate, and we mentioned cancer that develops in the uterus and warned against treating it.
And the ancients mentioned that when the cancer is in a place where it can all be excised, like the cancer that is in the breast or in the thigh and similar easily removed organs, especially if it is small and beginning, but if it is old and large, then it should not be touched.
For I have not been able to cure anyone of it, nor have I seen anyone before me achieve that, and the procedure, if it is possible as we said, is to first purge the patient of black bile several times, then to bleed him if there is obvious fullness in the veins.
Then you position the patient in a position that allows you to work, then you apply hooks suitable for it to the cancer, then you scrape it from every side with the skin completely, until nothing of its roots remains, and let the blood flow and do not stop it quickly.
Rather, squeeze the areas and drain all the thick blood with your hand or with whatever instruments you can, and if you encounter during the procedure great bleeding from a severed artery or vein, then cauterize until the bleeding stops, then treat it with the rest of the treatment until it heals.
Chapter fifty-four.
On the treatment of cancer.
We have already described in the classification the types of dropsy, how the accumulation of water occurs, and the signs of each type and its treatment with medication. That which is treated with iron is only the ascitic type; the tympanitic type and the fleshy type are absolutely not approached with iron.
For that is deadly, if you have treated this type of ascitic cancer with medications and your treatment has not been effective, then look: if the patient is extremely weak or has another illness besides the cancer, such as…
a cough or diarrhea or the like, then beware of treating him with iron, for it is dangerous. If you see that the patient is strong, has no illness other than the cancer alone, and is neither a child nor an old man, then the procedure is to make the patient stand before you. and an attendant behind him squeezes his belly with his hands and pushes the water downwards towards the pubis, then you take a pointed scalpel of this shape:
pointed on both sides, long, with a sharp point like a scalpel, except that it has a slight bluntness so that you do not go through to the intestine during the procedure and injure it. Then look: if the cancer has arisen from the side of the intestines…
then it is necessary to make the incision three fingers' breadth below the navel, directly above the pubis; if the cancer has arisen from a liver disease, let your incision be three fingers' breadth to the left of the navel; if it has arisen from a spleen disease, let the incision be on the right side, three fingers' breadth.
Nor should the incision be on the side on which the patient wishes to lie down, lest the discharge flow to that weak place.  Then pierce the whole skin with the instrument, and then insert the instrument into that incision and raise your hand.
with the scalpel between the skin and the peritoneum, as if you are flaying it, and the amount you flay should be the size of a fingernail or thereabouts. Then pierce the peritoneum until the scalpel reaches the empty space, which is the place of the water, then withdraw it and insert into the hole the instrument whose shape is like this.
It is like a small tube made of thin cane, silver, copper, or smooth, polished lead. It has a small hole at its lower end and three holes in its sides, two on one side and one on the other, as you see.
And it may have its sharpened end shaped like a pen nib, in this manner:
At its upper end is a ring. For when the instrument reaches the water, it will immediately flow down the instrument, and a moderate amount of water will be evacuated at once. For if you evacuate more than is necessary at once, the patient may die from the dissolution of his vital spirit.
Or he may suffer a fainting fit close to death. But evacuate according to his strength and what the patient's condition indicates to you of the strength of his pulse and the good color of his complexion. Then remove the instrument and the water will be retained, for it will be retained immediately.
Because of the skin which holds the hole in the peritoneum, which I told you to suture in that manner. Then return the instrument another day, if you see the patient able to bear it.
And you will also evacuate a little water, doing this for several days while you are watchful and cautious to avoid error, until only a little water remains.  If you fear for the patient and leave a large amount of water, then treat him by burial in hot sand.
And excessive sweating in the bath and sun, and accustoming him to thirst, and treating him with drying medicines until he recovers.  And cauterize the stomach, liver, and spleen after evacuating the water as I described above.
Chapter fifty-five.
In the treatment of children who are born with their urinary passages imperforate, or with a narrow opening, or in the wrong place.
Some boys may be born with their rectum imperforate;  it is necessary to perforate it immediately upon birth.
With a very fine scalpel in this manner:
Then place a thin lead nail in the opening and bind it and keep it there for three or four days. When he wants to urinate, remove it and then replace it. If you do not use lead, it is possible that the urine passing through the place will not allow it to close.
As for the one whose opening is narrow, it is treated with lead as we have said for many days until it widens.  And those whose opening is in the wrong place—some are born with the opening at the end of the rectum, and they are unable to urinate forward.
until he raises the urethra upwards with his hand, and it is not born before because the semen is unable to reach the uterus straight, and this is a very bad condition. The method of treatment is that the patient lies on his back.
Then stretch his rectum with your left hand with a strong pull and incise the tip of the urethra with a sharp blade or scalpel, the size of a pen, or as if you are carving something so that its middle is prominent, similar to a penis, and the opening is located in the middle as it should be.
And be careful during your work not to cause bleeding, for this often happens; therefore, stop the bleeding with something that cuts it off, and treat the wound until it heals.
Chapter Fifty-Six.
On the ulcer that appears in the foreskin and penis, and the blackness, corruption, and adhesion of the foreskin to the penis.
This ulcer often appears in the urethra; it is a fleshy, hard growth, and there is a malignant and a non-malignant type.  The non-malignant type should be tied off with a fine ligature.
And cut it until you have completely removed it, then apply a pledget of cotton soaked in Egyptian ointment, then treat it afterwards with palm ointment until it heals. But if the ulcer is malignant and dark in color, then you should cauterize it after cutting and removing it.
If the ulcer is in the foreskin of an uncircumcised man, and part of the ulcer is inside the foreskin and part outside, then you should remove the ulcer from the inside first, until it heals; then treat it from the outside.
Because if you treat both at the same time, you risk perforating the foreskin.  It may also appear in the labia and in the foreskin, blackness and corruption; then you should excise everything that has blackened and threatens to become corrupt, or that has already become corrupt.
Then apply honey mixed with crushed and sifted pomegranate peel and comfrey, then treat it with other treatments until it heals. If bleeding occurs, use cauterization with a crescent-shaped cautery iron, in this manner:
For cauterization is beneficial for both conditions, I mean, bleeding and the wound if it becomes corrupt. If the ulcer is consumed and disappears entirely at some point, then you should insert a lead tube into the urethra so that the patient can urinate through it.  As for the adhesion of the foreskin to the ulcer…
This adhesion only occurs in those whose foreskin is intact and who have not been circumcised.  It may also occur due to a wound or swelling. Then you should separate it with a blunt scalpel until the constriction is loosened and the ulcer is freed from all sides.
If it is difficult to distinguish them upon close examination, then you should separate some of the ulcer and some of the foreskin.  Because the foreskin is thin, it may quickly perforate due to its thinness. Then separate the foreskin from the ulcer with a thin linen cloth soaked in cold water so that it does not adhere again.
Then treat it with an astringent drink until it heals.
Chapter fifty-seven.
On the cleansing of boys and the treatment of what may befall them of ailments.
Circumcision is nothing other than the separation of a connection like other wounds, except that since it is done by our will and is used especially in boys, it is necessary to describe the best procedure in it.
And the easiest way leading to safety.  I say that the ancients did not mention circumcision in any of their books because it was not used in their laws, but rather it is something we have acquired.
by experience.  And that is because I have found the majority of surgeons and barbers using cleansing with the scalpel and with scissors, and they use the curette and ligature with thread and cutting with the fingernail. I have tried all these methods.
I did not find better than cleansing with scissors and ligature with thread, because cleansing with the scalpel often adheres to the skin, because the skin of the prepuce is two layers, so perhaps the upper skin is cut and the lower layer remains.
so one is forced to make another cut and renewed pain, and cleansing with the curette does not prevent cutting the end of the urethra, because it may enter its hole. As for cleansing with the fingernail, the skin may slip and your work will be spoiled, or the boy's skin may be naturally short.
Therefore, many are born like that and do not need cleansing, and I have seen that. As for cleansing with scissors and ligature with thread, experience has revealed to me its excellence, because the cut of the scissors is proportionate, because the blade that is above is like the blade that is below.
So when you squeeze your hand with the proportion of the two blades, you cut to one measure and in one time, so the thread becomes like a wall for the skin of the urethra from all sides, and there is no mistake at all. The method of operation, firstly, is to reassure the boy.
Especially if he is one who understands a little that you are only tying the thread in his urethra and leaving him until another day, then rejoice him and please him in every way you can and that he accepts with his mind, then stand him up erect before you.
And do not let him sit, and hide the scissors in your sleeve or under your foot, so that the boy's eye does not fall upon it at all or upon any of the instruments, then you insert your hand into his urethra and inflate the skin and lift it up until the head of the urethra comes out.
Then cleanse it from whatever filth gathers there, then tie the marked place with a doubled thread, then tie a second ligature a little below it, then grasp with your thumb and forefinger the lower ligature firmly and cut between the two ligatures. Then quickly raise the skin upwards and bring out the head of the urethra, then let the blood flow a little, for it is better and causes less swelling of the urethra, then wipe it with a damp cloth, then sprinkle on it some of the burnt ashes of dried gourd, for it is the best thing I have tried, or fine barley flour, for it is also excellent.
Then quickly raise the skin upwards and bring out the head of the urethra, then let the blood flow a little, for it is better and causes less swelling of the urethra, then wipe it with a damp cloth, then sprinkle on it some of the burnt ashes of dried gourd, for it is the best thing I have tried, or fine barley flour, for it is also excellent. Then apply on top a pledget of white cooked egg in rose water, mixed with fresh fragrant rose oil, and leave it on until the next day, then treat it with the rest of the treatment until it heals.
And this is the image of the scissors which are suitable for circumcision:
It should be sharp-edged, cutting, not crooked, with a well-fitting rivet; and the length of the two blades should be equal to the length of the handles. As for the mistake that occurs in circumcision, it may be that the whole or part of the inner skin is inverted during the cutting; so you should extend it immediately with your fingernail before the place swells.
And cut it evenly; if you cannot grasp it with your fingernail, then pull it with a hook and cut it. If three days have passed and what is under the head of the urethra remains swollen and inflamed, then leave it until the acute inflammation subsides and then remove it gently.
And cut it as you see fit, and be careful of the glans penis; for if something of the glans penis is cut, it does not harm, so treat it with what closes the wound from the pledgets which we described in the chapter on pledgets.
And if more of the skin than necessary is cut and it retracts upwards, this also does not do much harm; so treat it as we mentioned until it heals.
Chapter fifty-eight.
On the treatment of urine retention in the bladder.
Urine retention in the bladder is due to its obstruction by a stone, or clotted blood, or pus, or a growth, and the like.  If you treat that with what we mentioned of the types of treatment described in the classification.
And if the urine does not flow, and you see that its retention is because of a stone that has lodged in the neck of the bladder, then it is necessary that the patient sit on his knees, then someone should sit on his back, and stretch his belly towards his back, and the patient should hold himself as much as he can.
Then the neck of the bladder will be forced to push the stone backward, and the urine will flow. If it does not flow by what we mentioned, and the matter becomes severe for the patient, then it is necessary to use its removal with the instrument called a catheter, whose image is this:
It is made of silver, and it is thin, smooth, hollow like a bird's feather in thinness, about a span and a half long, with a fine funnel at its head. The way to draw the urine with it is to take a doubled thread, and tie to its end wool or cotton firmly.
And insert the end of the thread into the bottom of the catheter, and cut with scissors if there is any excess of the wool, so that it enters the tube and closes it like a button. Then lubricate the catheter with oil or butter or egg white, and have the patient sit on a chair.
And clean his bladder and urethra with moist ointments or oil and lukewarm water. Then gently insert the catheter into the urethra until it reaches the root of the urethra, then bend the urethra upwards towards the navel, then push the catheter inside.
Until the urethra is fully bent, then push the catheter inside until it reaches near the rectum, incline the penis downwards with the catheter inside, then push it until it reaches the bladder, and the patient feels that it has reached something hollow.
This is done in this manner because the passage through which the urine passes is tortuous. Then gently pull the thread with the wool; the urine will follow the wool. Then remove it, and the urine will flow out, and replace the catheter.
Continue doing this until the bladder is emptied and the patient feels relief.
Chapter Fifty-Nine.
How to inject the bladder with a syringe.
And the instruments suitable for this are made of silver or hollow ivory, having a long tube as fine as pus.  And if you wish to instill waters and medicines into it, that is done with an instrument called a syringe, and this is its image:
It is made of silver or hollow ivory, having a long tube as fine as a hair, entirely hollow except for the tip, which is solid and has three holes, two on one side and one on the other, as you see.
And the hollow part in which the piston is, should be just the size to fill it without excess, so that when you draw up some moisture with it, it is drawn up, and when you push it, it is pushed further, like the syringe with which oil is thrown in sea battles.
Then, if you wish to introduce moisture into the bladder, you insert the tip of the syringe into the moisture and draw the piston upwards, whereupon the moisture is drawn into the body of the syringe. Then you insert its tip into the urethra, as we described in the catheters, and then push the moisture with the piston.
Then that moisture reaches the bladder immediately, so that the patient feels it. And this is the image of a delicate clyster also used to inject the bladder:
It is made of silver or lead, its upper end resembling a small funnel, and below it a groove in which the ligature is placed. Then you take a camel's bladder and put in it the moisture which you wish to inject into the bladder; then you tie it tightly between the two parts with a doubled thread.
And you warm that moisture slightly over the fire, then insert the tip of the clyster into the urethra, then press your hand firmly on the bladder with the moisture until the patient feels that the moisture has reached the bladder.
If you do not have a bladder, take a piece of parchment and make a circle from it, and pierce it all around. Then insert a strong thread into those holes as it goes round, then gather the circle as you gather a tablecloth after you have put in it what you want of moisture, ointments, and water.
Then tie it to the instrument and do with it as you did with the bladder, pressing your hand until the moisture reaches the bladder.
Chapter Sixty.
On the Extraction of a Stone.
We have mentioned in the classification the types of stones and their treatment with medicines, and mentioned the difference between stones generated in the kidneys and stones generated in the bladder, and the signs of all that, and mentioned the stones in which the hand and incision are used.
And this is the stone generated especially in the bladder, and that which becomes fixed in the urethra, and I am describing that with clear explanation and brevity.
So I say that the stone generated in the bladder most often affects boys, and among its signs is that urine exits from the bladder similar to water in its thinness.
And sand appears in it, and his penis itches and he plays with it, and it often hangs down then spreads, and the anus protrudes with it in many of them, and it is easy to remove from boys until they reach fourteen years, and it is difficult in old men, and as for young men, it is intermediate between that.
And the one whose stone is larger, his treatment is easier, and the small one is the opposite.  So if we proceed to treatment, it is necessary first that the patient be injected with an enema which removes all the feces in his intestines, for it may prevent the presence of the stone upon examination.
Then the patient is taken by his feet and shaken and jolted downwards so that the stone descends to the neck of the bladder, or he jumps from a high place repeatedly, then you seat him between your hands, erect, and his hands under his thighs so that the whole bladder becomes inclined downwards, then you examine him.
And palpate him from the outside. If you feel the stone in the space, then immediately begin to incise it.  If it does not fall under your touch at all, then you should lubricate the index finger with oil from the left hand if the patient is a boy, or the middle finger.
If he is a fully grown boy, then you insert it into his rectum and search for the stone, until when it falls under your finger, you move it little by little to the neck of the bladder, then you press on it with your finger and push it outwards towards the place you wish to incise.
And you order a servant to press the bladder with his hand, and you order another servant to extend with his right hand the labia upwards, and with his other hand he extends the skin under the labia away from the place where the incision will be. Then you take the sharp scalpel, whose image is this:
And you incise between the rectum and the labia, not in the middle, but to the left of the anus. The incision should be on the stone itself, and your finger in the rectum, as you press it outwards obliquely so that the incision is wide on the outside and narrow on the inside, to the extent that the stone can exit from it.
Not larger, for perhaps the finger in the rectum will press the stone during the incision, and it will come out without difficulty. And know that there may be stones that have angles and edges, making their removal difficult because of that.
And some are smooth, resembling an acorn and round, so their removal is easy. But those that have angles and edges, enlarge the incision a little. If it does not come out like this, then you should devise a way, either by grasping it with a tight forceps whose end is like a file.
To secure the stone so that it does not escape from it, or to insert underneath it a delicate instrument with a hooked end. If you cannot manage it, enlarge the incision a little. If you are overcome by any blood, stop it with alum.
If there is more than one, push the largest one first towards the opening of the bladder, then incise over it, then push the smaller one afterwards. Do likewise if there are more than two. If it is very large, it is foolish to make a large incision over it, because it exposes the patient to one of two things.
Either he will die or he will have a constant trickle of urine because the place will not heal at all. But try to push it out, or devise a way to break it with forceps until you remove it in pieces.
When you have finished your work, cauterize the wound with myrrh, aloes, and acacia, and dress it, and place over it a cloth moistened with oil and syrup or rose oil and cold water to calm the hot swelling. Then let the patient lie on his back, and do not loosen the bandage until the third day.
When it is loosened, wash the place with plenty of water and oil, then treat it with emollient ointment and basilicon ointment until it heals. If a hot, excessive swelling and gangrene or something similar occurs in the wound, such as blood clotting in the bladder and preventing the passage of urine, this is known from the passage of blood with the urine.
Insert your finger into the wound and remove that blood, for if it remains it will lead to corruption and putrefaction of the bladder. Then wash the wound with vinegar, water, and salt, and treat each type with a similar treatment until it heals.
Throughout the treatment, it is necessary to bind and bring together the thighs to secure the medicines placed on the area. If the stone is small and is in the urethra, and is stuck there, and the urine is prevented from coming out, treat it with what I have described before it necessitates incision.
Often I have dispensed with incision by this treatment, which I have tested. It is to take a probe of steel, which is of this form:
The tip is triangular, sharp, and fixed in a stick. Then take a thread and tie the penis below the stone so that it does not return to the bladder, then gently insert the probe into the urethra until the probe reaches the stone itself.
And turn the probe in the stone itself little by little, intending to pierce it until you pass through it to the other side. Then the urine will flow immediately. Then squeeze what remains of the stone from outside the penis, for it will crumble and come out with the urine, and the patient will recover.
If this treatment is not feasible for you due to some impediment, tie a thread below the stone and another thread above the stone, then incise upon the stone in the penis itself between the two threads, and then remove it.
Then untie the ligature and cleanse the clotted blood which has formed in the wound.  The reason for tying the thread below the stone is to prevent it from returning to the bladder, and the other above so that when the thread is untied after the stone has been removed, the skin will return to its place and cover the wound.
Therefore, when you tie the upper thread, you should raise the skin upwards so that it will return and cover the wound when you are finished, as we said.
Chapter sixty-one.
On the removal of stones in women.
Stones are rarely generated in women; but if one should appear in a woman, its treatment is difficult and impossible for many reasons. One is that the woman may be a virgin; another, that you will not find a woman who permits herself to a physician.
If she is chaste or one of his relatives, and thirdly, that you will not find a woman who is skilled in this craft, especially in working with the hands; and fourthly, that the place of incision for stones in women is far from the location of the stone, so it requires a deep incision.
And in that there is danger. If necessity demands it, then a skilled female physician should be sought; but they are rarely found.  If you cannot find one, seek a chaste and gentle male physician, or procure a skilled midwife experienced in women's matters, or a woman who has some knowledge of this craft.
Then prepare her and instruct her to do everything you order her to do, first examining for the stone.  That is, she should see if the woman is a virgin.  If so, she should insert a finger into her rectum and search for the stone; if she finds it and presses it beneath her finger,
then you should order the incision. If she is not a virgin but a widow, then order the midwife to insert her finger into the patient's vagina and search for the stone, after placing her left hand on the bladder and pressing it firmly.
If she finds it, she should move it from the opening of the bladder downwards as far as she can reach, until she reaches the groin, then incise at the midpoint of the vulva at the groin, whichever side is most accessible and where she feels the stone.
And her finger should not leave the stone, pressing beneath it. Let the incision be small at first, then insert the dilator into that small incision. If she feels the stone, enlarge the incision as much as she thinks necessary for the stone to come out. Know that there are many kinds of stones.
Some are small and some are large, some smooth and some rough, some long and some round, some with branches.  Know their types so that you may know what to do. If the bleeding overcomes you, sprinkle powdered verdigris on the area and hold it for an hour until the bleeding stops, then return to your work.
Until the stone comes out.  And be sure to have with you the instruments that I mentioned for removing stones from men, to assist you in your work. If bleeding overcomes you and you know from the pulse of the blood that it is from a severed artery, then apply the styptic.
And bind it tightly with bandages, and leave it and do not touch it again, and leave the stone and do not remove it, for the patient might die. Then treat the wound.  When the severity of the bleeding has subsided after some days and the area has become infected, return to your work until you remove the stone.
Chapter Sixty-two.
On the incision on the water bladder.
The water bladder is merely an accumulation of moisture in the white peritoneum which is under the skin of the scrotum surrounding the testicle, which is called the scrotum.  It may be in a special membrane prepared for it by nature in a part of the testicle.
So that one thinks it is another testicle. And it is between the skin of the scrotum and the white peritoneum that we mentioned, but this occurs only rarely. This bladder is generated from weakness that affects the testicles so that this material settles there, and it may result from a blow to the testicles.
And this moisture is of many colors; it may be yellowish, or bloody red, or blackish, or whitish—and this is most common.  And the signs by which it is known…
Where the water gathers, if it is in the white peritoneum that we mentioned, then the swelling is round, slightly elongated, like the shape of an egg, and the testicle does not appear because the moisture surrounds it from all sides.
And if the moisture is in a special membrane for it, then the swelling is round on one side of the testicle.
Therefore, a person imagines that it is another testicle. And if the moisture is between the skin of the scrotum and the white peritoneum, then it is palpable. But if you wish to know the color of the moisture, probe the swelling with the square probe whose image we have shown previously; then whatever comes out in the wake of the probe, you judge it according to what is within.
Then if we proceed to treatment with cautery, it is necessary that you order the patient to be bled if he is able and you see his body is full.  Then he should lie on his back on something slightly raised, and you should place many cloths beneath him, then you sit on his left.
And you order a servant to sit on his right, stretching his penis to one side of the scrotum's skin and toward the region of the groin. Then you take a broad scalpel and incise the skin of the scrotum in the middle lengthwise to near the pubis.
And make the incision straight, parallel to the line that divides the scrotum's skin in two, until you reach the white peritoneum containing it.  Then peel it back and be careful not to cut it; your peeling should be from the side attached to the testicle more, and complete the peeling as much as you can.
Then widely flatten the peritoneum filled with water and remove all the water. Then separate the edges of the incision with hooks and stretch the peritoneum upwards, and do not touch the containing scrotum skin, and cut the peritoneum however you can cut it, either entirely or piece by piece.
Especially its thin side, for if you do not completely cut it, you will not be safe from the water returning. If the testicle protrudes outside its skin during your work, then when you have finished cutting the peritoneum, return it, then close the edges of the scrotum skin with sutures.
Then treat it like other wounds until it heals. If the testicle is affected by another disease, then you should tie the vessels in the spermatic cord for fear of bleeding, then cut the testicle from the spermatic cord and remove the testicle, then treat it as we have mentioned.
If the collected water is in both sides, then know that they are two hydroceles.  Incise the other side as you did the first, and if it is easier for you to do the work in one go, then do so. Then wipe away the blood.
And insert into the incisions wool that you have soaked in oil or rose ointment, and outside place more wool that you have soaked in a potion and oil, and spread it over the testicles and the flanks of the abdomen, and place folded cloths on top, which are the compresses. And tie them from above with a bandage which has six ends, in this manner:
Then two cloths are taken, sewn together, and stuffed with fluffy wool in this manner.  Make the ties with which it is fastened from cotton or wet wool, and gather them tightly in the waistband of the trousers; one end is taken to the buttocks and back.
The second is taken towards the pubis, and the two ends to the thighs below, and the remaining two ends to the groins. Gather all the tightening in the waistband of the trousers. This hydrocele may also be treated by cauterization with a hot iron instead of incision.
And it is that you take a fine, knife-like cautery and with it incise the skin of the scrotum while it is hot, as we described, until the white peritoneum containing the water is exposed; then take another cautery of this shape:
It resembles the Greek eye. Then cauterize that peritoneum with it while it is hot until all the moisture comes out. Then stretch the peritoneum with hooks and flay the containing layer with the cautery and cut it as much as you can until you excise it all, and take care that the testicle is not touched by the fire.
Know that this procedure is safer and less prone to bleeding, and better than the incision method. If during the incision or cauterization you encounter a hot swelling, bleeding, or something else, you should treat whatever arises with the appropriate treatment, as previously described.
If the patient is cowardly and cannot endure this procedure because of its unpleasantness, then use cauterization as I describe, if it seems appropriate to you in light of what we have presented.
If the hydrocele is watery, then the patient should sit on a high chair, then cauterize the lower part of the swelling with a wide scalpel.  Make the cauterization along the length of the body and make the opening wide so that all the water flows out. Then apply cotton to the area and bind it.
Leave it to drain the remaining water, then treat it until the wound heals. If the water does not come out during cauterization, it is because the tunica albuginea is obstructing the opening of the wound, preventing the water from coming out.
Then you should insert a goose feather into the wound, or the instrument used to extract the water from hydroceles, the image of which has been shown previously, or slightly enlarge the opening of the wound.
Know that the water may return and accumulate after six months or so. If it does, cauterize it in the same manner, and the patient should abstain from sexual activity for some days.
Chapter Sixty-Three.
Concerning the incision on the fleshy scrotum and its treatment.
Know that an incision on this scrotum is one of the most dangerous things, leading to death in most cases.  Therefore, we consider leaving it alone and avoiding it to be safer. However, I will mention the procedure and the types of tumor.
I say that many tumors may occur in the bodies which comprise the female genitalia, and this is due to many causes, either from a sharp, acrid humor descending to the genitalia or from a blow. The tumor is the same color as the body, and it does not contain water.
The tumor may be soft, and perhaps the tumor may be hardened, its color dark and without sensation. It may be from the twisting and swelling of the arteries, as previously mentioned, or from the swelling of the veins.  That which is from the swelling of the arteries is known by the dispersal of the tumor.
If you press it with your fingers, it does not disperse. It should absolutely not be incised.  As for that which is from the swelling of the veins, nothing disperses from it when pressed with the fingers. This type may possibly be incised, as well as other fleshy parts.
And it is that you incise the skin of the testicle, then draw the testicle upward and bring it out of the white peritoneum, and free the spermatic cord from the vessels, and tie the vessels, and cut the spermatic cord after freeing it from every part of the testicle.  If the testicle has adhered to the growing flesh…
then you should remove and cut the testicle. And if the adhesion is between some of the peritoneum or among the vessels, then you should free all that adhesion and cut it with a circular incision.
If the growth of flesh is in the place of adhesion which is behind, then you should cut all of it and remove the testicle as we said. When your work is completed, dress the wound with wool soaked in rose oil and syrup, then treat it with other treatments until it heals.
Chapter Sixty-four.
In the treatment of the hydrocele that is with a hernia.
A hernia is a twisted tumor, somewhat twisted, similar to a bunch of grapes, with relaxation of the intestines, and it makes movement, exercise, and walking difficult for the patient.  The treatment of this condition is similar to what was mentioned before, and is fraught with danger.
However, we should mention the procedure as the ancients did. I say that you should make the patient sit on a high chair, then push the intestinal contents downwards, then grasp the skin of the scrotum with your fingers along with the vessels which are close to the penis.
And let an assistant hold it and stretch it tightly, then you incise with a wide, sharp scalpel, making an oblique incision along the vessels until the vessels are exposed.  Then dissect from each side as I described to you in the dissection of the arteries in the armpits, then insert a needle with a doubled thread.
And tie it at the first place where the hernia appeared and tie it also at its end, then incise it in the middle with a vertical incision along its length and remove what has collected within it of foul, putrid fluids.
Then treat the wound with the treatment of other wounds which you want to heal over time, so that the vessels which nourish one of the intestines fall away; this is not a problem. But if the hernia involves all the vessels, then it is necessary to remove one of the intestines along with the vessels, lest the testicle lack nourishment. Before cutting the vessels, they wither and become unusable.
Chapter Sixty-five.
On the treatment of intestinal hernia.
This hernia occurs from a tear which appears in the peritoneum extending over the abdomen near the groins, from the flanks of the abdomen, and the intestine descends from that rupture into one of the testicles.
And this rupture is either from a tear in the peritoneum or from its extension.  These two types occur from many causes, either a blow, a jump, a shout, or lifting something heavy, and so on.  Its sign, if it is from an extension of the peritoneum, is that it occurs little by little over a long time.
It does not occur suddenly, and the swelling is even towards the depth because the peritoneum constricts the intestine.  Its sign, if it is from a tear in the peritoneum, is that from its beginning there is great pain suddenly, and the swelling is different, appearing under the skin nearby.
That is by the exit of the intestine and its passage outside of the peritoneum.  And with the intestine, the epiploon may exit; this hernia is called intestinal and epiploic.  It may be with gas. And the faeces may pass into the intestine and be retained there, and with that the patient perishes.
Because it causes severe pain and gurgling, especially if it is constricted.  Treatment of this type of ailment with an iron instrument is dangerous, so it should be avoided. The method of treatment is to order the patient to return the intestine with his hand into his abdomen if it is possible to return it.
Then he lies on his back in your hands and raises his legs. Then you stretch the skin next to the groin upwards and incise all the skin of the scrotum lengthwise. Then you insert hooks into the edges of the incision to the extent needed to open the incision with them.
And the incision should be such that the testicle can come out of it. Then you peel away the membranes under the skin of the scrotum until the white, hard peritoneum is exposed on every side. Then insert your index finger next to the testicle.
Between the white peritoneum under the skin of the testicle and the second peritoneum, and you loosen the adhesion behind the testicle.  Then you draw it inwards with your right hand into the scrotum’s skin, and with this you stretch the white peritoneum upwards with your left hand and raise the testicle with the peritoneum towards the incision.
And you order the assistant to pull the testicle upwards, and you yourself completely loosen the adhesion from behind. And you search with your finger lest there be something of the twisted intestine in the hard white peritoneum. If you find something, push it down into the abdomen.
Then take a needle with thick thread, twisted from ten threads, and insert it at the end of the peritoneum under the scrotum's skin next to the incision. Then cut the ends of the doubled thread so that there are four threads. Then place some on top of others firmly, and tie the peritoneum, which we said is under the scrotum’s skin, tightly from two sides with it. Then also twist the ends of the threads and tie them tightly so that nothing from the vessels that nourish it can reach it. Lest a hot swelling result from that. And also make a second ligature outside the first ligature, distant from it less than two fingers. And after these two ligatures leave as much of the peritoneum under the scrotum's skin as the width of a finger.
Lest a hot swelling result from that. And also make a second ligature outside the first ligature, distant from it less than two fingers. And after these two ligatures leave as much of the peritoneum under the scrotum's skin as the width of a finger. And cut all the rest in a circle and remove the testicle with it. Then incise the lower part of the scrotum's skin, an incision from which blood and pus flow, as we described previously. Then use wool soaked in oil and place it in the wound and use the ligature which we described.
And one may cauterize the white peritoneum which we mentioned after cutting it, to guard against bleeding, for that often occurs.  And leave the ligature until it falls off by itself. If it is slow to fall off, then loosen it with warm water and apply something that makes it sweat until it falls off.
Then treat the wound with the other treatments for wounds until it heals.
Chapter Sixty-Six.
Concerning the windy hernia.  I have not seen anyone dare to treat this windy hernia with iron. The ancients mentioned that it should be done as we described in the hernia with a sac, that is, that the vessels should be gently tied below after incising them.
Then incise in the middle and treat the swelling with what opens it until the vessels fall away, and treat the wound as we mentioned until it heals.
Chapter Sixty-Seven.
Concerning the hernia which is in the groin.
A hernia may appear in the groin, as we said, so that the place swells but nothing of the intestine descends into the scrotum; and if it descends, it is slight and returns at all times.
But if time passes, the fissure in the peritoneum increases until the intestine and fat descend into the scrotum; and this occurs from the extension of the peritoneum which is in the groin, as we said. That is because the peritoneum extends, then relaxes and the place swells and protrudes, and its treatment is by cauterization, as I have previously described.
It may also be treated with the iron in this manner: the patient lies on his back between your hands, then you incise the swollen, protruding hernia horizontally to the extent of three fingers, then you separate the peritoneum which is under the skin.
Until the white peritoneum which follows is uncovered, then you take a roll and place it on the protruding part of the peritoneum and press it into the depth of the abdomen; then you sew the two protruding parts of the peritoneum to the edge of the roll and join one to the other with the suture.
Then you remove the roll, and do not cut the peritoneum at all, nor touch the testicle or anything else, as I have taught you in the treatment of intestinal hernia; then you treat it with the treatment of wounds.
If the threads are cut, I clean them and dress the wound until it heals, for the peritoneum contracts and the hernia protrusion does not increase.
Cauterization is better in this location because it is closer to safety.
Chapter sixty-eight.
On the relaxation of the skin of the testicle.
Often the skin of the testicle relaxes in some people without the flesh inside relaxing, and its appearance is unsightly.  He who wishes to treat it should place the patient on his back.
And he cuts all the relaxed skin on the thick skin, then brings the two lips together. And if you wish, first sew the excess relaxed skin with three or four stitches, and make sure of the stitching, then cut between the stitches.
Then treat it with the treatment of other wounds until it heals and the stitches fall out.
Chapter sixty-nine.
On castration.
Castration is forbidden in our religion.
Therefore, I should not have mentioned it in this book.  But I have mentioned it for two reasons: one, so that it may be in the knowledge of the physician if he is asked about it, and he may know the treatment of one who suffers from it; and the other, that we often need to castrate some animals for our benefit.
Such as lambs, goats, cats, and the like of animals.  So I say that castration is of two kinds: either by crushing or by incision and cutting.  That which is by crushing, its method is that we seat the animal in hot water until its testicles relax and soften and hang down.
Then crush them with your hand until they dissolve and are not perceptible to the touch. As for castration by incision and cutting, you should hold the animal and squeeze the skin of its testicles with your left hand, then tie the suspensory ligaments and make one incision on each testicle.
Until the testicles appear, then cut them off after you have skinned them, and do not leave on them any of the membranes except the thin membrane which is on the vessels.  This kind of castration is better than that which is by crushing.
Because crushing may leave something of the testicles, so the animal may desire coition. Then treat the wound until it heals.
Chapter Seventy.
On the treatment of the hermaphrodite.
The hermaphrodite in men is of two types. One is that which appears in the area following the scrotum or in the skin of the scrotum between the testicles, a shape like a woman's vulva with hair, and urine may flow from that which is in the skin of the scrotum.
As for women, there is one type, and it is above the vulva on the pubis like small male genitals protruding outward, one of them like a man's penis and the two like testicles.  And the treatment of the three types.
The two types in men and the one type in women: it is necessary to cut away that excess flesh until its trace is gone, then treat it with the treatment of other wounds until it heals. As for the second type in men, from which urine flows from that which is in the scrotum's skin, there is no action in it nor is there any benefit from it at all.
Chapter seventy-one.
On the excision of the clitoris and the protruding flesh from the vulvas of women.
The clitoris may exceed the natural amount, until it becomes large and its appearance ugly, and it may enlarge in some women until it spreads like that of men and becomes suitable for intercourse.
It is necessary that you grasp the excess of the clitoris with your hand or with a hook and cut it, and do not exaggerate in the cutting, especially in the depth of the root, lest bleeding occur.
Then treat it with the treatment of wounds until it heals. As for the growing flesh, it is flesh that grows in the mouth of the womb until it fills it.
And sometimes it protrudes outwards like a tail. Therefore, some of the ancients call it the "tail" disease. It should be cut like the clitoris, and treated until it heals.
Chapter Seventy-Two.
In the treatment of prolapse.
Prolapse is when a woman's vulva is not perforated, or the perforation is small. This may be congenital or acquired. The acquired type is due to a pre-existing condition, which may be an excessive growth of flesh.
or a thin or thick membrane.  This may be located deep within the uterus, or on its sides, or above or below it. It prevents intercourse, conception, and childbirth, and may also prevent menstruation.  This is determined by the midwife's examination.
If the obstruction is visible and close, then if it is not visible, she should examine it with her fingers or a probe. If the obstruction is a thin membrane and is close to the labia, then proceed to pierce it.  This is done by placing something like pledgets on the labia, then placing both thumbs together.
The woman lies on her back with her legs spread. Then, the labia are strongly stretched until the thin membrane is pierced and the obstruction opens. Then, she takes wool, soaks it in oil, and places it on the area. The woman should have intercourse every day, so that the area does not close up again.
If the membrane is thick and dense, it should be incised with a wide scalpel, resembling an aspen leaf. If the obstruction is from an excessive growth of flesh, then it should be hooked with hooks and cut. You should have styptic medications that do not sting, such as acacia, shih-shian, and frankincense, mixed with egg white.
Then, use a wide lead tube so that the wound does not close quickly. Keep it in place for several days and use a wick of dry linen, then treat it with other treatments for healing until it is healed.  Another growth of flesh may occur in the uterus; this should be cut in the same manner.
Unless it is a cancerous tumor; a cancerous tumor that is in the uterus should never be treated with iron.
Chapter Seventy-Three.
On the treatment of hemorrhoids, warts, and red sores that appear in the vulva of women.
As for hemorrhoids, it is a swelling of the openings of the veins, so that much blood constantly flows from them. If hemorrhoids persist, they become warts.  I have mentioned their types and signs in the classification, and we will mention them here.
What accepts treatment from them and what does not accept treatment. I say that hemorrhoids and warts, if they are deep within the uterus and do not appear to the touch, are not treatable with iron; those that are at the mouth of the uterus, which can be felt, are those that are treated.
Then the woman should enter a cool room, and then stretch the warts with a scraper or a rough cloth and cut them from their roots.  Then apply to them, when bleeding from one of the sharp instruments that stops the blood without causing laceration.
Such as acacia,  [a type of] cautery, and frankincense and the like. Then she should raise her legs to the wall for a while, then lower them into cold water. If the bleeding persists, seat her in a decoction of sumac, pomegranate peels, gallnuts, and the like. Then take barley flour, knead it with honey and vinegar.
And apply it as a compress to her back. If the bleeding stops, otherwise, apply cupping to the loins and breasts without restriction. Then take wool, dip it in the juice of  celandine, or the juice of Verbascum, or the juice of the branches of  Spartium, with a decoction of gallnuts, and apply it to the place.
If the swelling subsides, then treat the area with ointment until it heals. As for the red pustule, it resembles the heads of  [a type of] grass, rough in appearance. It should be cut as much as appears, in the same way as I mentioned for warts, and treated until it heals.
Chapter Seventy-Four.
Concerning the suppuration which occurs in the uterus.
Many types of tumors may occur in the uterus, such as cancer, the hardened tumor, ulcers, fistulas, phagedena,  fissures, hemorrhoids, warts, and hot tumors.  I have described all of these diseases, their types, and their signs in the classification.
It is necessary to mention in this section the hot tumor which occurs in the uterus, if it is among the tumors which gather for a period of time, how its suppuration is done with an instrument. It is necessary to observe; if the pain of the tumor in its beginning is acute with throbbing, inflammation, and fever,
and you see it red when you touch it, do not hasten to its suppuration, and treat it with what helps in ripening, until when these symptoms subside, then it is necessary that the woman sit on a chair which has two seats and leans on its back.
and brings her legs together towards the lower abdomen and her thighs are spread apart, and her arms are placed under her knees, and they are bound with a suitable bandage.
Then the midwife sits on the right side and uses the instrument with which the mouth of the uterus is opened, whose image comes later.  And it is necessary, if you want to use this instrument, to estimate with a probe the depth of the woman's uterus, lest what enters from the instrument be more than the depth of the uterus.
then it harms the patient. If the instrument is longer than the depth, then it is necessary to place pledgets on the lip of the cervix to prevent the entire instrument from entering the depth of the uterus, and it is necessary that the spiral which runs in the instrument be from the upper side.
And you hold the instrument and the assistant turns the spiral until the cervix is opened.  Then if the abscess appears and is touched by the hand and is soft and thin, then it is necessary to incise it at its head with a wide scalpel. Then when all the pus is evacuated,
it is necessary that a soft pledget soaked in rose oil or green oil containing some astringent be placed in the wound, and the pledget should be outside the incision in the cervix, and clean wool soaked in water in which alum has been boiled should be placed externally on the uterus and on the pubis.
Then treat it after two days with the ointment which is suitable for that until it heals.
And the uterus and wound may be washed by irrigation with water and honey, then with water in which licorice root or long zedoary has been boiled, then return to the ointment. If the abscess is hidden inside the uterus,
then it is necessary to refrain from treating it with iron, but it should be treated with what we mentioned in the classification.
Chapter Seventy-five.
In instructing midwives how to treat living fetuses if they emerge in an unnatural manner.
The midwife should first know the form of natural childbirth; and of its signs, if you see the woman straining downwards and desiring to inhale air, and what she suffers from childbirth becomes easier for her.
And the emergence of the fetus is hastened; so know that this birth is in the natural manner, and its emergence is head first with the afterbirth together with it or hanging from its navel.  If you see these signs, then it is necessary to press her abdomen so that the fetus emerges quickly.
For if it descends headfirst, the afterbirth descends with it and cleanses itself of those impurities well. And besides this birth, it is unnatural and blameworthy, because the fetus may emerge on its feet and its hands may emerge before its head and feet.
And one hand or one foot, or its head and hand may emerge, or it may emerge folded, and perhaps it may turn over on its back and similar blameworthy forms.  It is necessary for the midwife to be skillful and gentle with all these things and to beware of slips and mistakes.
And I am explaining each form and how to manage it so that you may be guided by that and understand it. If the fetus emerges headfirst, the natural emergence, and that is severe for the woman and the labor is difficult for her, and you see that her strength has weakened, then seat her on a chair and order women to hold her.
And compress her womb with cooked fenugreek and with moist ointments, then the midwife inserts a small scalpel between her fingers and cuts the afterbirth with it, or cuts it with her fingernail, until the moisture within it flows out, and she presses the woman's abdomen until the fetus descends.
If it does not descend, then it is necessary to inject the woman with fenugreek saliva mixed with shirāj ointment, then after the injection, order her to cough and make her sneeze with hellebore, and hold her mouth and nose, then the fetus will emerge immediately. If the hands of the fetus emerge first, then it is necessary to return them gently little by little.
If it does not readily enter, place the woman on a stool and raise her legs upward, then shake the stool on the ground while the woman holds on so that she does not fall during the shaking. If the hands do not enter and the fetus dies, then cut them off and pull out the rest of the fetus.
Or tie his hands with a cloth and pull them moderately, then he will come out.  The emergence of the fetus on its feet: If the fetus emerges on its feet, then it is necessary to push them upward, then turn the fetus little by little until you straighten it, then take one of its feet and extend it little by little.
If they come out to the thighs, then order her to cough and make her sneeze with hellebore, then it will come out. If it does not come out as we described, otherwise return the fetus little by little until you put it in the natural position, then it will come out easily. If it is prevented by all that we described.
Then take the saliva of the khutmī and the saliva of fenugreek and shirāj ointment and dissolved gum, and pound everything well in a mortar, then apply it to the woman's vulva and lower abdomen, then seat her in lukewarm water until it reaches the sharasif.
If you see that her lower part has become soft, then make a pessary for her from myrrh and let her endure it. If the pessary stays for an hour, then seat her on a chair, then make her sneeze, and plug her mouth and nose, and gently squeeze her lower abdomen; then the fetus will come out immediately. The emergence of the fetus on its knees and hands.
If it comes out in this manner, then gradually insert its hands, then the woman lies on her back and lets her hips hang down while lying on a bed, and she clasps her hands, then gently press above her abdomen. Then remove the pillows from under her legs so that her lower part is raised. If the fetus does not come out, then take both her legs and move them vigorously, then gently squeeze above the sharasif until the fetus ascends upwards, then the midwife inserts her hand and adjusts the fetus little by little.
And instruct the woman to strain until the fetus comes out. The fetus comes out sideways, hanging by one of its hands. Gradually return its hand; if you are unable to return it, then raise the woman and make her walk; if she is unable to walk, then she lies down.
on her bed and shake her legs vigorously, then use the poultice that I described from the saliva; if labor begins, then seat her on a chair, then work on returning the hand and adjusting the fetus to its natural form, and make the woman sneeze and instruct her to strain until it comes out.
The fetus comes out on its back, extending its hands, and its face is towards its mother's back. The midwife should grasp the hand of the fetus, then gradually turn it and gently adjust it.  When it is straight, apply to its front what we described of oil and poultices.
Then tell her to move little by little; if she does that, then seat her on the chair and tell her to lean to the right side, then tell her to strain and make her sneeze with the [instrument/tool] kands, then it will come out.  The exit of the fetus upright on its side.
If it descends to the mouth of the womb in this manner with the placenta, then split the placenta with your fingernail until it is emptied of moisture. If it adheres to the face and neck of the fetus, then cut it from the umbilical cord lest it suffocate and die, then push the fetus inwards until it is as it should be.
And tell the woman to strain repeatedly, then it will come out easily. The exit of twins or many fetuses. Know that twins are often born, and three or four may be born and live, although that is rare. As for five, it is something outside of nature, they do not live at all.
And a single placenta surrounds them, even if they are many, and they are separated by a membrane barrier between them, attached to the umbilical cord of each one. And they may come out as a single fetus comes out, naturally and easily, and they may come out badly as we described.
If some of them are difficult at birth and become as we have said, in unnatural forms, then treat them as we have described. And let the midwife be gentle, and let her do what she does with gentleness and slowness, and let her contrive for every form with whatever means is available to her leading to safety.
Mentioning what is conceived in the womb of fetuses that are aborted. One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, and more than ten may be conceived in the womb. It has been confirmed to me that a woman aborted seven, and another fifteen, all of them conceived.
By the estimation of the All-Knowing, All-Powerful.  All of this should be in the knowledge of the midwife, for perhaps such a thing will happen to her one day, so that she may meet it as is appropriate.
Chapter Seventy-Six.
On the removal of a dead fetus.
If you treat the dead fetus with what I mentioned in the section on treatment, and it does not come out, and you are compelled to work with your hand, then you should look. If the woman is strong and healthy and has none of the symptoms which cause fear of death for her, then the woman should lie on her back on a bed.
And her head should be tilted downwards and her legs raised, and a servant should hold her from both sides, or she should be tied to the bed, lest her body be pulled when the fetus is drawn out.
Then moisten her vulva with moist ointments along with mallow juice, fenugreek, and flaxseed. Then the midwife should lubricate her hand with these ointments and juices, then gently insert it into the womb, then search with it for a place to insert the hooks into the fetus, and the appropriate places for that.
Look, if the fetus is positioned to come down head first, then insert the hooks into its eyes, or into the nape of its neck, or into its mouth, or into its palate, or under its chin, or its shoulder, or into the places near the ribs, or under the clavicles.
But if it descends feet first, then [insert the hooks] into the pubis and the middle ribs.  It is necessary to hold the hook with the right hand and to place its bend between the fingers of the left hand and to gently insert the hand and insert a hook into some of those places we mentioned.
Until you reach something firm, then insert another hook opposite it, or a third if needed, so that the traction is even and does not lean to one side. Then pull with a steady pull, and the pull should not be straight only, but moved in every direction.
So that its exit is facilitated, as is done with a tooth when it is extracted.  It is necessary during this to relax the traction. If it is obstructed from one side, then the midwife should lubricate some of her fingers with ointment and insert them from that side to move what is obstructed. If part of the fetus emerges, then move the hooks to other places.
She should do this until the entire fetus emerges. If a hand emerges before anything else and cannot be returned because of its compression, then it is necessary to wrap a cloth around it and then pull it until, when it is completely out, you cut it.
Either at the wrist joint or at the elbow. Thus she should do with the other hand and with the feet. If the head of the fetus is large and encounters difficulty in exiting, or if there is collected water in its head, then it is necessary to insert a lancet between the fingers.
And make an incision in the head with it so that the water exits, or pierce it with the instrument called the *mishdakh*, the image of which comes with the images of the other instruments in the chapter after this.
She should do likewise if the fetus is naturally large-headed. Then it is necessary to perforate the cranium or crush it with the *mishdakh*, as we said, then remove the bones with hooks. If the head emerges and is compressed at the clavicle, then let an incision be made until the moisture in the chest flows out.
Then the chest will contract. If the chest does not contract and exit is not possible, then cut as much as you can. If the lower abdomen is swollen or contains a tumor, then it is necessary to incise it so that the moisture flows out.
If the fetus is in a feet-first presentation, then pulling it is easy and straightening it towards the mouth of the womb is simple. If it is compressed at the abdomen or chest, then it is necessary to pull it with a cloth wrapped around your hand and incise the abdomen or chest until what is within them flows out.
If all the members have been extracted and the head remains and is obstructed, let the midwife insert her left hand. If the mouth of the womb is open, let her insert her hand into the neck of the womb and search for the head with it, and pull it with her fingers towards the mouth of the womb, then insert one or two hooks into it and pull it with them.
If the mouth of the womb has contracted because of a hot swelling affecting it, then it is not necessary to use force on it, but then it is necessary to use the pouring of greasy moist substances and apply compresses, and sit in waters that relax and moisten.
And if the fetus is on its side, if it is possible to straighten it, then use what we mentioned for the living fetus. If that is not possible, then cut and extract it.  It is necessary that nothing of the afterbirth remain inside at all. When you have finished your treatment, use what we mentioned for the treatment of hot swellings which occur in the wombs.
If bleeding occurs, then let her descend into astringent waters and use all other treatments. I have indeed witnessed a woman who had conceived, and the fetus died in her womb, then she conceived again upon it.
Then the other fetus also died, and after a long time a swelling appeared in her womb and it swelled until it opened and began to discharge pus.  I was called to treat her, and I treated her for a long time, but the wound did not close, so I applied to it some strong, attractive ointments.
Then a bone came out from the place, and then after some days another bone came out. I was amazed by that, since the abdomen is a place where there are no bones. I judged that they were from the bones of the dead fetus, so I examined the wound and extracted from it many bones from the bones of the head of the fetus.
I continued doing this until I extracted many bones from her, and the woman was in the best of health. And she lived for a time after that, discharging a little pus from the place.  And it is for this reason that I have brought this rare case here.
Because in it there is knowledge and aid for what the skillful physician attempts with his hand in treatment.
Chapter seventy-seven.
In it are images of the instruments which are needed in extracting the fetus.
An image of a screw to open the mouth of the womb.
This is the binder with which books are bound, having two screws at the ends of the two pieces of wood, except that this screw should be finer than the binder and should be either of ebony or of boxwood, and the width of each piece of wood should be the thickness of two fingers.
And their width about a finger, and their length a span and a half, and in the middle of the two pieces of wood are two guides of the same material as the wood itself, which are fastened in them, their length being half a span or a little more, and their width about two fingers or a little more, and these two guides.
are those which enter the mouth of the womb to open it by turning the screws. An image of another instrument for the same purpose, finer and lighter:
It is made of ebony or boxwood in the shape of hooks, except that it has two guides at its end, as you see. The length of each guide is about a span, and their width is two fingers.  If you wish to open the womb with it,
then seat the woman on a bed with her legs spread apart between her thighs, then insert these two guides together into the mouth of the womb, while you hold the end of the instrument below between her thighs, then open your hand with the instrument as you do with the hooks, according to how much you want to open the womb. until the midwife does what she wants.  An image of another screw mentioned by the ancients:
Image of the instrument which pushes the fetus.
Image of the forceps with which the head of the fetus is extracted.
It resembles scissors, it has teeth at the end as you see, and it may be made rectangular like hooks, in this image as you see, it has teeth like the teeth of a saw, you cut and tear with it.
Image of a pusher also.
Image of a hook.
This hook should be somewhat thick so that it does not break when pulling the fetus with it. Image of a hook with two prongs.
Image of two wide scalpels for cutting the fetus.
All these instruments, the more numerous their types and the better prepared by the craftsman, the faster his work and the higher his standing among people. Therefore, do not disdain any instrument to have prepared, for there will certainly be need for it.
Chapter seventy-eight.
In the removal of the placenta.
If the placenta is retained after childbirth, you should instruct the patient to hold herself, then cause her to sneeze with a sternutatory, and press your hand on her mouth and nostrils. If it comes out this way, well and good; otherwise, take a measure.
And pierce a hole in the lid, and place in it herbs that open the mouth of the womb, such as fumitory, rue, dill, chamomile, wormwood, betony, and centaury; all of these drugs, or some of them. Immerse them in water, and place them on the fire, then place a silver tube on the hole in the lid of the pot, and the other end in the mouth of the womb.
And hold it until the vapor reaches the bottom of the womb, then cause her to sneeze as we said. Then the placenta will come out quickly. If it remains after this treatment and does not come out, instruct the midwife to dip her left hand in  oil of shergesh or mallow sap.
Then she inserts it into the vagina and searches for the placenta. If she finds it, she grasps it and pulls it out little by little. If it is attached deep in the womb, insert the hand as we described, until you find the placenta, then pull it out little by little, gently.
Lest the womb fall out with strong pulling, but it should be moved gently to the sides, right and left, then increase the amount of pulling; then it will yield and be freed from the adhesion. If the mouth of the womb is constricted, we have described the treatment with sneezing and the treatment with the pot and herbs.
If it does not come out with all that we have described, then avoid violence upon it in pulling again. But it is necessary to tie what has come out of it to the mouth of the womb to the thigh of the woman, then inject her with the four-ingredient ointment, for it will cause it to rot after days.
And it will dissolve and come out.  However, if it becomes putrid, a bad odor will rise from it to the stomach and head, and this will harm the patient. Therefore, suitable fumigation should be used.
Therefore, some of the ancients have tried the fumigation of rue and dried figs.  The image of the instrument with which the woman is fumigated when menstruation and the placenta are retained, and so on:
It is made of lead, resembling a funnel, or it is made of copper. The thin end is placed in the vagina and the wide end over the fire, and the incense is placed on the embers.  She holds it until that incense is gone and replaces it with more.
Chapter Seventy-Nine.
In the treatment of the non-perforated fistula.
Many boys are born with their anus imperforate; a thin membrane may have closed it.  It is necessary for the midwife to perforate that membrane with her finger, otherwise she should puncture it with a sharp scalpel and be careful not to touch the muscle.
Then she should place wool soaked in syrup and oil on it, then treat it with ointments until it heals. If she fears that it will close up, she should place a lead tube in the opening for many days and remove it whenever the child wants to defecate.
The anus may also become obstructed by the healing of a wound or a tumor; this adhesion should be incised, and then treated as previously described, with the addition of the lead tube.
Chapter Eighty.
On the treatment of fistulas which occur in the lower parts.
Fistulas which occur in the lower parts are a complication and thickening which occurs near the anus, externally or internally, from one side or another.  The fistula may be single or multiple.
If this complication becomes chronic, it opens and a watery, white fluid or thin pus discharges from it. Some of these fistulas may penetrate to the rectum and intestine; others may not. Those which penetrate may be recognized by the passage of feces and flatus when the patient defecates.
Worms may also emerge from them.  There may be fistulas, if they are internal, penetrating to the bladder and the urethra; and there may be some penetrating to the hip joint and to the sacrum.  A fistula penetrating to the rectum may also be distinguished from one which does not.
You should insert your index finger into the rectum and insert a thin probe into the fistula, made of copper or iron, if the fistula is not tortuous. If it is tortuous, insert a thin lead probe or a horsehair.
Until you feel the probe or hair with your finger. If you do not feel it at all, and nothing of feces, flatus, or worms emerges from the opening, as we have said, know that it is not penetrating, and proceed to treatment.
If the fistula penetrates to the bladder or urethra, the sign is the passage of urine from it and the failure of the area to heal with medication.  If it penetrates to the hip joint or sacrum, the sign is the probe reaching there.
If there is no tortuosity to the bone, and pain exists in that direction, and pus constantly emerges from it, and treatment is ineffective and it does not heal with ointment—all these penetrating fistulas are incurable.
And their treatment is a vain effort for those ignorant physicians who attempt them. As for those which are not penetrating and not chronic, recovery is hoped for with cautery, as I describe and as I have experienced.  This is to have the patient lie on his back between your hands.
And raise his legs upwards and tilt his thighs towards his abdomen. Then insert a copper or lead probe, if there is tortuosity in the fistula, until you know where the probe ends. If the patient feels it towards the anus, you should insert your index finger into the anus.
If you feel with your finger that the probe has penetrated by itself, uncovered, without feeling any membrane or flesh between your finger and it, then know for certain that it is penetrating, so do not tire yourself with it, for it is incurable, as we said.
And they have said that it heals in some people rarely. And of the treatments which hope for benefit is that you heat a thin cautery according to the width of the fistula, as preceded, and insert it, hot, into the fistula until it reaches towards the anus, then repeat it two or three times.
Until you know that all those superfluous, matted tissues resembling the tube of a bird's feather have been burned. Then treat it with lint soaked in butter until the burned flesh comes out. Then treat it with cicatrizing ointments, and if it heals.
Otherwise, it will never heal with any other treatment. But if you insert the probe and it does not penetrate to your finger which is in the anus, and there was between it and the probe a thick partition of flesh or membrane, and you see the fistula near the surface of the skin, then incise the skin from the beginning of the fistula. And you pass with the incision along with the probe while it is in the fistula until you reach with the incision where the tip of the probe ended, and the probe is released and falls out. Then cleanse those matted tissues that resemble a bird's feather tube, and leave nothing of it.
Then treat it with cicatrizing ointments until it heals. If blood overwhelms you and prevents you from cutting those tissues, the best and quickest remedy is cauterization with fire or a caustic medicine, for cauterization with fire combines two good things: burning those superfluous tissues.
And cutting the blood and drying the moisture. Then treat it with lint soaked in butter or sulfur powdered with oil until the area suppurates and those burned tissues come out in the pus. Then treat the wound with cicatrizing ointments that grow firm flesh.
These are medicines which constrict and dry, for if it is closed, then it is healed and you do not fear recurrence. If the fistula has reached the depth of the anus and is distant from the surface of the body, then insert your finger into the anus and explore with it.
If you feel the probe and between you and it a membrane of peritoneum or flesh, and it was near to penetration, then the action in it is only by way of hope, that is, to use one of three methods: either to cauterize it as we said.
Or to incise it until you reach its bottom so that you are able to insert the lint and treat from near, and do not exceed in the incision lest you cut the muscle surrounding the anus and cause the patient involuntary defecation. Then treat it as we mentioned, for perhaps it will heal as we said.
Or to penetrate that membrane and perforate it after you incise it near the anus as we said, either with a probe or with another sharp-pointed instrument. Then cleanse all those matted tissues which are in the incision to wherever you are able to completely.
Then suture the whole wound together with the incision and the upper opening until it is closed and the fistula remains open inside the anus, which will be easier for the patient.  And the fistula may be perforated in this manner.
And if you insert the probe into the fistula and it is on one side of the anus towards the surface of the body with the skin and the sphincter of the anus, then take then a probe with a perforated tip like a shoemaker's needle in this manner:.
And insert into it a twisted thread of five threads or so, then insert the probe with the thread into the fistula until it reaches its bottom. If it is penetrating in the margin of the anus from the inside near.
Then bring out the thread from that hole by inserting your finger into the anus and bringing out the end of the thread and bring both ends together and tighten them and leave it for a day or two. Every time the thread cuts into the flesh, tighten it well until those tissues between the ends of the threads are severed and fall out. Then treat the wound until it heals and is cured.
If the opening of the fistula is not penetrating, penetrate it however you can, except that it should not be too deep, for you should not do that because of the muscle lest you cut it. Then do with it as we mentioned until it heals.
The image of the hooked scalpel with which fistulas are incised, its curve is very sharp and the other side is not sharp lest you cut what is not needed, as you see.
Chapter Eighty-One.
Concerning the opening of hemorrhoids from which blood flows, their excision, and the treatment of fissures.
Hemorrhoids are of two types: either they are inside the rectum, resembling red swellings or like grapes, and there are small and large ones, and blood constantly flows from them.
And they are single or numerous, and they are outside the rectum and at its edges, except that those which are outside the rectum are in most cases less moist, with a constant flow of yellow water or a little blood, and they are the color of the body.
The treatment for those inside the rectum is that you order the patient to strain and bear down until the rectum protrudes and the hemorrhoids appear to you.  Then you quickly hook them with hooks or grasp them with your fingernail and cut them at their base. If the hooks do not hold them because of their moisture and laxity,
then rub them with a rough cloth or a piece of goatskin, or pull them with your fingers, then cut them. Then, after cutting, sprinkle on them some sharp powders to act in place of cautery, or cauterize them as previously explained in the chapter on cautery.
Then treat it with the rest of the treatment until it heals. If the rectum does not come out, then inject the patient with an enema containing a little irritant to wash what is in the rectum and facilitate its quick protrusion when the patient strains. As for the hemorrhoids outside the rectum, their treatment is easy and simple.
That is, you take it with your fingernail or hook it with a hook and cut it, then treat it as we mentioned until it heals. And whoever dislikes cutting with iron should use a ligature in this manner: take a twisted thread and insert it into a needle.
Then pull the hemorrhoid upwards and pass the needle through its base from the other side, and wrap the ends of the thread below the needle while it is crosswise, and pull the hemorrhoid tightly. Then tie the thread and remove the needle. Do this with all the hemorrhoids, leaving one unligated.
so that the excess blood flows out. Then place on the rectum a cloth soaked in rose oil or cyperus oil, and place it on the rectum, and tell the patient to be still, then leave him until they fall off. When the hemorrhoids fall off, treat them with ointments and other treatments until they heal.
As for the treatment of fissures, they often occur from dryness of the stool and retention of the temperament. If it becomes chronic and medicine does not work, then you should scrape it with the blade of a scalpel or with your fingernail until it becomes moist and the upper crust which prevents its healing is removed.
Then treat it until it heals properly. If it does not heal, repeat the scraping more severely than before until it bleeds well and sloughs, then treat it, for it will heal.
Chapter eighty-two.
On the treatment of ingrown and non-ingrown nails, dry warts, and the ant.
A nail is a round nodule, the color of the body, resembling the head of a nail; it occurs on the whole body, but especially on the soles of the feet and the fingers, and causes pain when walking.
It should be incised around the nail and removed from its root with a hook or a snare, then treated; and if you wish, cauterize it as described in its chapter. As for dry warts, each one is a small, rough, clustered outgrowth, round on the surface of the body.
They often appear on the hands of children.  Its treatment is to stretch the wart and cut it off, or to pierce it with a silk thread or a hair until it falls off; and if you wish, cauterize it as previously described, with fire or a caustic medicine.
Ingrown and non-ingrown warts may be removed with the instrument I have described in the treatment of the ant. As for the ant [wart], it is also a small, clustered, thick outgrowth on the surface of the body, going very deep; and if it is exposed to cold, one feels in it something like the sting of ants.
It occurs on the whole body, and most often on the hands.  Its treatment is to take a tube of strong goose or vulture feather, and place this tube over the ant [wart] so that the circumference of the tube surrounds it on all sides, then rotate the tube with your hand until you have incised around the ant [wart].
Then push it into the depth of the flesh, and the ant [wart] will be removed from its root. And if you wish, do this with a copper or iron tube in this manner:
The top of the tube should be solid and twisted to make it easier for the fingers to grip and twist it. And if you wish, cauterize the ant [wart] as previously described in the cauterization of warts in the chapter on cauterization.
Chapter Eighty-Three.
Concerning the shapes of instruments used for injections in cases of rectal problems, diarrhea, and colic.
The syringe may be made of silver, china, or cast or beaten copper.  These instruments may be made small or large according to the users. Those used in treating small children will be small, and those for patients with narrow or painful rectums will be very gentle. Image of a large syringe:
Its upper funnel, where the bladder is tied, is wide in this manner; it has a partition where the bladder is tied, as you see.  Its lower end, which is inserted into the rectum, is solid, very smooth, and delicate; on one side are two holes, and on the other side one hole.
The size of the hole should be the thickness of a probe, or slightly thicker. The bladder, in which the medication is placed, is made from an animal's bladder or sheepskin, shaped like a small bag, its diameter being a span.
Many holes are pierced in a circular pattern, the distance between each hole being the thickness of a finger. Then a strong thread of twisted yarn, of ten threads or so, is inserted into these holes and the bladder is gathered like a purse. When the medication is placed inside, the top of the syringe is tightly tied between two stones, then it is injected.  This is an image of the circular bladder and the holes:
The method of injection is to fill the skin or bladder with warmed medication, to a degree tolerable to the patient. Beware of it being too hot or too cold. Then the patient lies on his back with his legs raised.
A cloth or sheet is placed beneath him. Then the tip of the syringe is lubricated with oil, egg white, fenugreek saliva, or the like. Then it is gently inserted into the rectum.  An assistant then takes the bladder in both hands and squeezes it strongly until everything in the syringe is emptied into the intestines.
Then the syringe is removed, and the patient raises his legs to the wall. If the medication stimulates evacuation, let him hold it as much as possible. If he sleeps all night with it, it will be more beneficial. If he is injected for diarrhea and evacuation is hurried, repeat the injection until he is cured.
If there are painful hemorrhoids or tumors in the rectum, the syringe should be very gentle and smooth, smoother than those used to inject children. This is an image of a gentle syringe with skin stretched over it:
Chapter Eighty-Four
On the Treatment of Wounds
I have mentioned in the classification the treatment of what resembles cauterization, and I will here discuss its treatment by hand and by medication completely. I say that wounds differ according to the thing that causes the wound and according to the location where the wound occurs.
The things that cause wounds are numerous, such as the blow of a stone, or the cut of a sword or knife, or a stab wound from a spear or stick or arrow, and so on from many things.
As for wounds according to the locations of the body, there is the wound that occurs on the head, or the neck, or the chest, or the abdomen, or the liver, and similar organs.
And I am describing the treatment of some wounds to make them a measure and rule for all wounds, and I begin with simple wounds of the head, especially because the compound ones will be mentioned in the beginning of the third chapter of this book.
So I say that when a simple wound occurs in the head and there is no fracture of the bone, I look; and if it is from a blow of a stone or the like, and the skin has only been lacerated, and the wound is large, and I fear for the patient the occurrence of hot inflammation, then act quickly and incise it (the wound) appropriately. And do not delay that, and let blood be drawn from him according to his strength, if nothing prevents bloodletting, especially if the blood coming from the wound is little, and let the bloodletting be from the opposite side of the injured area.
And warn the patient against fullness and strong drinks and foods; and if anything prevents his bloodletting, then let him lessen the food and not approach meats or drinks. And apply to the wound, if hot inflammation occurs in it, a cotton wool soaked in rose oil alone or with a drink that has astringency.
And if you are safe from hot inflammation, then apply to the wound, if it is fresh and the air has not altered it, the  powder which I describe to you shortly; but if the air has altered it, then apply to it some ointments.
Until pus forms, then treat it until it heals. And if the wound is large and is from a cut of a sword or the like and its edges do not come together by themselves, then unite it by stitching, as I describe in the stitching of abdominal wounds.
If the skin exposes the bone and hangs down, and its attachment is only by a small piece, then cut it off, then treat the wound with medicines which produce firm flesh instead of the skin. And order the patient to nourish himself with foods that have firmness, such as heads and entrails and the like.
If there occurs putrefaction in the skin and it does not adhere to the bone, then cut away all the putrefied part and throw it away, then treat it.  If in these wounds there is an artery or vein bleeding blood, and the bleeding does not stop with medicines, then search for the artery.
If you find it and it is not severed, then sever it with the scalpel and tie it. And if necessity demands, if what we have mentioned does not work, cauterize it until the bleeding stops. If these wounds are small and superficial, then their treatment is easy and simple; it suffices to treat them by sprinkling this powder on them while they are still bleeding.
Before the air changes them. The preparation of the powder is that one part of frankincense, two parts of gum arabic, and three parts of slaked or unslaked lime are taken; all are crushed, sifted, and the wound is filled with it and bound tightly until it adheres well.
It will coagulate with the blood, then bandage it from above with compresses and leave it; do not untie it as long as it does not swell, for the medicine will not separate from it until it heals.  And the lime alone may do this if you do not have frankincense and gum arabic.
This action may also be done with cobwebs in many large wounds if its application and binding are expertly done, and the wounds are fresh with blood, before the air changes them. But if the air has changed them somewhat, especially in summer.
Then there is no point in applying this powder; treat it with what we have mentioned, by applying some ripening ointments or a poultice of barley flour made with water and honey until pus is produced, then treat it with other treatments until it heals.
But if a fracture in the bone occurs with the wound, and it is slight, then pull it with a forceps. I have already mentioned the treatment of head fractures in what follows, in the surgery of the neck. If the wound occurs in the neck, there is no difference in treatment between it and a head wound if it is simple.
But if a nerve or artery in the neck has been severed, if it is a nerve, there is no remedy except to avoid treating it with things that cause strong constriction, such as verdigris and vitriol and the like, because they harm the nerve and cause spasms.
And nothing cold at all should be placed on the wound, because the essence of the nerve is cold and its connection is to the brain, which is the noblest of organs.  What you treat it with should be soft medicines, such as natron washed many times with fresh water, moistened with oil or rose ointment and tutty.
If it is also washed with fresh water and other minerals in this manner, and moist ointments, but if the wound is large, use suturing or bind its edges with pledgets, then treat it until it heals.
If the wound has a depth and a cavity forms at its bottom where pus collects, lance it in its lowest part. If an artery is severed in the wound and you see its blood flowing, ligate it or cauterize it, or if necessary, amputate it.
If the wound has severed some or all of the cartilages of the larynx and the vessels are unharmed, join the edges of the skin by suturing over the windpipe, but do not touch the windpipe; rather, smooth and restore it to its natural shape, then bind it tightly and leave it for some days.
Then treat it with ointments that have astringent and drying properties until it heals. If the wound has affected the bone, explore it; if there are bone splinters, extract them all, or as many as possible; what you cannot reach, leave until the wound suppurates and heals, making their removal easier.
If the wound is fresh, sprinkle on it the powder we have described. If a bone becomes necrotic in the wound and it becomes fistulous, treat it as described in its chapter, in the surgery of the chest and between the shoulders.
If it is a wound from a spear or knife and you see a depth to it, observe: if air escapes from it when the patient breathes, know that it is a mortal wound. If it has no depth and is fresh with its blood, do not initially apply powder to it nor bind it, lest the blood be retained in its depth.
It will then spread to the heart and kill the patient.  However, apply an absorbent ointment and dress it twice a day. If you do not have ointment, place a used piece of cotton in the mouth of the wound to absorb the moisture that comes from it, and have the patient sleep on the wound.
So that what gathers there may flow out. And if three days or more have passed since the infliction of the wound, and the patient has not experienced convulsions, or a bad palpitation, or shortness of breath, and you see all his other conditions to be good, then know that the wound is safe, and treat it with cautery and other treatments until it heals.
If it is difficult to see it and the pus flows constantly, know that it has become fistulous, and treat it according to its chapter.  The patient should lie on the wound so that what gathers there may flow out.  If the wound is in the chest or back, treat it with the stitching mentioned before.
If it is large, cauterize it; if small, use powder. If it has affected the bone and broken off fragments, explore the wound and hasten to remove those fragments if they are loose. If they are not loose, leave them until...
the wound becomes suppurated, for then it will be easy to remove them. As for other wounds occurring in other members, their treatment is governed by what we have mentioned.
Chapter eighty-five.
Concerning wounds of the abdomen, the protrusion of the intestines, and their suturing.
The wound which occurs in the abdomen may be large, or it may be small or medium.  A large wound may allow the protrusion of one or several intestines; their replacement and suturing will then be more difficult and arduous.
A small wound may also be difficult in another way, so that replacing the intestine becomes more difficult. If the intestine is not immediately returned to its place, it swells and thickens, making its replacement more difficult. For this reason, a medium-sized wound is preferable, since returning the intestine is not as difficult with it as with the other two types.
Know that the suturing of the abdomen is of four kinds. Two sutures are general, suitable for suturing the abdomen and for suturing all other wounds of the body. The other two sutures are special, applicable to all wounds, but they are especially suitable for suturing the abdomen.
And I will describe them to you one by one with explanation and clarification. I say that if the wound is small and some of the intestine protrudes and its replacement is difficult, this is due to one of two reasons: either because of the smallness of the wound, as we said, or because the intestine has been inflated by the cold air.
If this is the case, then it should be warmed by dipping a sponge or a wet cloth in lukewarm water alone, or in water in which anise, rue, and wheat have been boiled, and applying it to the intestine until the inflation subsides.
A styptic drink may also do this, and it is better than water alone in resolving the inflation.  If you see that the inflation has subsided, then wet the intestine with water in which  plantain or mallow has been boiled, for this makes its entry easier.
If its return is still difficult after this treatment, then incise the wound slightly with the instrument with which you incise fistulas. The first treatment, if successful, is better than incision.  One resorts to incision only out of necessity and after other methods have failed. This is the image of the instrument:
One side of it is curved and pointed, the other side is not pointed. The thin end is not as thin as a lancet, but is a little blunter. It is an instrument resembling a small forceps, as you see. If the wound has widened and the intestine has entered, then it should be replaced in its natural form.
And its proper place, if you can manage it, is best. But if the wound is wide and is in the lower abdomen, then the patient should lie on his back with his legs raised higher than his head; if it is in the upper abdomen, then his head and chest should be raised higher than his lower body.
Similarly, if the wound is on one side of the abdomen, always make the side with the surgery higher than the other side.  This should also be done in major and moderate surgeries.
As for minor wounds, position it as best you can. Then have a gentle assistant at hand to hold the entire wound with both hands, bringing its edges together, then revealing it to the person performing the stitching, little by little.
This is the description of a single general stitch: Take one needle, or several needles, according to the size of the wound. Then leave a space from the edge of the wound equal to the thickness of the little finger, and insert a needle without thread into the edges of the skin. together with the edges of the peritoneum which is under the skin from the inside, until you pass it through from that side.  You have now brought together the edges of the skin and the edges of the peritoneum, making four layers. Then, you tighten a doubled thread around the needle several times from both sides until the edges of the wound are tightly joined.
Then leave a space equal to the thickness of a finger, and insert another needle, then fasten it with the thread as you did with the first needle. Continue doing this with as many needles as needed until you complete the entire circumference of the wound. Let the needles be of moderate thickness.
For very fine needles quickly cut the flesh, and thick needles are also difficult to insert into the skin. Therefore, they should be of moderate thickness.  And the needle should not be inserted into the edge of the skin too close to the wound.
Lest the flesh quickly break and the wound open before it heals, and do not also space the stitches too far apart, lest the wound fails to close.  Then cut off the ends of the needles, lest they injure the patient while he sleeps. And make him pads of linen cloth on each side to hold the ends of the needles.
And leave them until you know that the wound has healed. This type of stitching with needles is best suited for small wounds, because it may suffice to stitch them with one or two needles, or so.
As for the method of suturing for a general wound, it is that you gather with the suture the four edges—that is, the edges of the skin and the edges of the peritoneum—at once with a needle having a twisted thread, moderate in thinness and thickness. Then when you have passed the needle through these four edges, return the needle from the side where you began.
So that the thread falls interwoven from the top of the wound, so that the stitching is according to the stitching of a pouch with which goods are tied. And make between each stitch a space of the width of the little finger. And this stitching is known to all people.
With this stitching, a wound was stitched for a man in his abdomen. He had been wounded with a knife, and the wound was more than a span long, and about two spans of the small intestine had protruded, and the wound was in the middle of the abdomen.
I returned it after his intestine had remained outside the wound for twenty-four hours.  The wound healed in about fifteen days, and I treated him until he was cured. He then lived many years, managing all his affairs, while the physicians had judged that he would never recover.
And it is remarkable that I did not treat him with an ointment, because I was in a place where there were no medicines.  I used to put on the wound worn cotton twice a day and attend to washing it with honey-water until it healed.
As for one of the two kinds of special stitching, I mention it according to the words of Galen. It is that you begin the stitching from the skin, and insert the needle from outside to inside.  When the needle has pierced the skin and the muscle going straight along the whole length of the abdomen...
...I left the edge of the peritoneum on the side into which I inserted the needle, and I passed the needle through its other edge from inside to outside, into the other edge of the peritoneum. When I had passed it through, I passed it again in this same edge of the peritoneum from outside to inside.
And leave the edge of the peritoneum on this side, and pass the needle through its other edge from inside to outside, and as you pass it through, pass it also through the edge of the peritoneum on its side, until you pass it completely through.
Then begin again from this same side, and stitch it together with the edge of the peritoneum on the other side, and bring the needle out from the skin near it. Then return it into that skin and stitch the edge of the peritoneum on the other side together with this edge of the peritoneum.
And bring it out from the skin on its side, and do that again and again, until you stitch the whole wound in that way. In short, the description of this stitch is that you stitch like the stitching of furriers for fur.
That you stitch the peritoneum once from one side with the edge of the skin, and leave it once from the other side until you finish. As for the second type of special stitching that Galen also mentioned, this is his wording exactly.
Which is that you stitch it in the way that some healers stitch it, by bringing each part to its counterpart that is naturally similar to it, so that they join the edge of the peritoneum to its other edge, and the edge of the peritoneum to its other edge. This is as I describe to you.
It is necessary that you insert the needle into the edge of the peritoneum near you from the outside and pass it to the inside in it alone, and leave the edges of the peritoneum. Then return the needle and pass it from the outside to the inside in both edges of the peritoneum, then return it again.
And pass it from the inside to the outside in the edge of the other peritoneum which is on the opposite side. This type of stitching is better than the easy common stitching, which is the stitching previously mentioned. This is Galen's exact words.  And some have said that the stitching of the abdomen may be straightened with two needles. That is, that you insert one thread into them, and begin by inserting the needle from your side and pass it to the other side, and insert the other needle from the opposite side and pass it from your side, according to the stitching of the basket-makers, exactly.
And know that if the wound is in the middle of the abdomen, then its stitching is more difficult than in other places of the abdomen. As for the treatment of the wound, its rule in its treatment is the rule of all other wounds. That is, if you find the wound fresh with its blood before the air changes it, and you return the intestine and stitch it and secure it, then apply to it the medicated lint.
If the wound has been changed by the air, then apply to it some of the ointments which you prepare until it suppurates and the threads fall out and the peritoneum and the omentum unite, then treat it as you treat all other wounds until it heals.
If you do not have medicines, then apply to it, from when it begins to suppurate, old cotton and change it twice a day as I have taught you until it heals. For you do not need another treatment in most cases if the wounds are simple. If you fear that the wound might involve the principal organs in the pain,
then it is necessary that you dip soft wool in moderately warm oil or in rose oil and place it around the areas between the groins and the armpits. If he feels pain or putrefaction in his intestines – and that often occurs – then inject into him a lukewarm astringent black drink.
Especially if the putrefaction has reached the intestine and become a wound penetrating to his interior. And know that what is thick of the intestines is easier to heal, and what is thin of them is more difficult to heal.
And as for the intestine known as the jejunum, it does not accept healing from a wound inflicted upon it at all. This is because of the multitude of its veins and their size, and the thinness of its substance and its proximity to the nature of a nerve.  But if what protruded from the wound was the omentum and you found it moist, then return it in the same way as you would return the intestine.
If a period of time has passed and it has turned green or black, then it is necessary that you tie it with a thread above the place which has blackened, lest bleeding occur, for in the omentum are veins and arteries; then cut below that ligature.
And leave the ends of the thread hanging from below the wound, outside of it, so that it is easy for you to pull it and remove it when the omentum sloughs and the wound suppurates.  [He mentioned] the wound which occurs in the intestine; but if a rupture occurs in the intestine and it is small…
it may be possible for it to heal in some people, for I saw a man who had been wounded in his abdomen by a lance thrust, and the wound was to the right of the stomach.  The wound became chronic and became a fistula from which feces and flatus emerged. So I treated it, although I did not hope for its healing. So I continued to treat him gently until it healed and the place united. When I saw the place had united, I feared for the patient that some bad incident might occur in his abdomen, but no bad incident at all occurred to him, and he remained in the best of conditions. He eats and drinks properly, copulates, enters the bath, and works at his service. Some experienced people have mentioned that whenever a wound occurs in the intestine and it is small, then it should be sutured in this manner.
And it is that large-headed ants are taken, then the lips of the wound are brought together, then one of them is placed, with its mouth open, on the lips of the wound. When it bites and tightens its mouth, its head is cut off, for it adheres and does not come undone.  Then another ant is placed near the first.
And you continue to do that with several ants according to the size of the wound, then you cover it and suture the wound, for those heads remain adhering in the intestine until the intestine heals and recovers, and no harm at all happens to the patient.  Also, it may be possible to suture the intestine with fine thread.
That which is drawn out from the intestine of the animal adhering to it after it is entered into a needle; it is that the end of this thread is taken from the intestine, then it is drawn gently, and then a fine twisted linen thread is tied to its end, then that thread is entered into the needle. And in it is the intestinal thread, and with it the intestine is sutured, then it is returned to the abdomen.  This type of suturing with ants and intestine is only by way of hope and expectation.
But if the rupture is large and wide, especially if it is in one of the thin intestines, then there is no remedy in it and no healing at all.
Chapter eighty-six.
In the treatment of the cold and fistula.
Know that every wound or swelling, if it becomes chronic and prolonged and becomes an ulcer and does not heal, and continuously discharges pus that does not stop, is generally called, in whatever organ it may be, a fistula; and we call it a cold, and a fistula.
It is in reality a compacted, solidified, white mass with no pain, having a cavity like the cavity of a bird's feather.
Therefore, some have called it a feather; and it is sometimes moist, continuously discharging pus, and sometimes the moisture may cease; and this moisture may be abundant or scant, thick or thin.
And I have stated in the classification, when mentioning wounds, that every ulcer that does not heal and in which flesh does not grow, is so because of one of nine reasons: one of them is either due to a deficiency of blood in the body, or to its poor quality, or because there is hard flesh inside it and on its edges which prevents the growth of good flesh. Or because it is abundant in harm and filth; or because the ulcer itself is putrid and the matter it discharges is poor in quality; or because the medication is unsuitable for its treatment; or because of a corruption that has occurred in the region, of the nature of an epidemic; or because of a particular characteristic of the region.
Or because it is abundant in harm and filth; or because the ulcer itself is putrid and the matter it discharges is poor in quality; or because the medication is unsuitable for its treatment; or because of a corruption that has occurred in the region, of the nature of an epidemic; or because of a particular characteristic of the region. As was evident in the city of Saragossa, where the maturation of diseases is difficult and the healing of tumors is naturally slow; or because it contains a single bone or several bones. I have explained all these causes, their signs, and their treatments with medications in the classification.
It is necessary here that I inform you of the treatment of fistulas and abscesses which is done by hand. Know that fistulas may occur in all parts of the body; some of them extend to large veins and arteries, or to a nerve.
Or to the peritoneum, or to the intestine, or to the bladder, or to a rib, or to a vertebra of the spine, or to a joint of the compound joints, such as the hand and foot; and some lead to the vicinity of a principal organ, and so on.
Now, those fistulas which are of this nature are among the diseases difficult to cure, which do not accept treatment, and to work on them is troublesome and ignorant.  If, however, there are some fistulas which have not reached these places which I have mentioned, and hope and expectation remain for their treatment,
and you wish to arrive at knowledge of that, take a probe of copper or iron; if the fistula runs straight, examine it with this. If there is a winding in the fistula, examine it with a probe of thin lead, because lead is soft in body.
It will slip in easily and bend towards the winding. If the fistula has many openings, and you cannot discover them with the probe, inject one of its openings; for the moisture which you inject will pass towards the other openings and flow out.
Then thoroughly investigate in whatever way you can to know if there is bone or nerve, or if the bottom of the fistula is far or near, or if it is a single fistula with many openings.  Establish all this to the extent of your ability by questioning the patient and by observing his pain when you touch the place.
And similarly with other signs and causes leading to the swelling. If you have established all this truly, then proceed to treatment with confidence. That is to say, consider if it is...
the fistula is outwardly near, or in a safe place far from a joint, nerve, artery, vein, or one of the places I mentioned to you, then incise the fistula as I described previously and remove what is within it of clots, putrid flesh, and excess flesh.
And whatever grows in its opening of flesh or wart and the like, treat it until it heals. If the fistula is deep-seated and straight, then you should incise it deeply as much as you can, and then cleanse it of all its putrid flesh.
Then use a twisted thread coated in strong medication and insert it to the bottom of the fistula which you can reach with an instrument. Do this repeatedly until that strong medicine consumes all that remains of corruption in the bottom of the fistula.
Then bind it with ointments that produce healthy flesh until it heals. If it does not heal by this, cauterize it as previously described. If the cause of the fistula is bone, and you are certain of this, then investigate it and incise it as I have told you, if nothing prevents you from doing so.
a nerve, tendon or principal member, as we said. If the bone is exposed to you and there is some corruption and blackness in it, then scrape it until its corruption is gone, then treat it with what will heal it until it heals. If it does not heal and the pus continues as it was doing,
know that you have not reached the complete removal of the corruption.  Expose everything on it again and thoroughly scrape and cleanse it with the greatest effort, then bind it. If it heals, otherwise know that that corruption is in a deep recess. Expose everything on it again.
and thoroughly scrape and cleanse it with the greatest effort. If the corrupted bone is small and you can pull it out, then pull it out with fine forceps suitable for that.
If there are many bones, thoroughly extract them all and do not leave any of them, to the best of your ability. If something of the ligaments obstructs you and there is no danger in cutting them, then cut those ligaments and the flesh, if it is there, and free the bones.
If you are not able to extract the bones at once, then apply to the wound something that will cause it to fester, and leave it for days until it festers what is around those bones of flesh and ligaments.  Keep the wound from healing the incision that you made during your work.
Rather, if you fear that, place on it cotton soaked in powdered sulfur with oil, or cotton soaked in Egyptian ointment or one of the green ointments. For when those ligaments have festered and the bones have become loosened, it will be easy to extract and pull them out.
If it is one large bone, such as a bone of the leg or a bone of the thigh, and so on, and only its surface is corrupted, then scrape it thoroughly until that blackness and corruption is gone, then dress the wound. If a large part of it is corrupted and the corruption has reached the marrow of the bone, then it is necessary to excise it.
And cut it all away to where the corruption ends. Then treat it until it heals. And I will tell you of a case of gangrene that occurred in a man's leg, to make it an example and aid in your treatment. This man was young.
About thirty years old, he experienced pain in his leg due to a cause moving within his body until the materials reached the leg and swelled into a large swelling. There was no external cause. Then time passed with the mistakes of the physicians until the swelling opened.
And much material flowed from it, and he was poorly treated until the leg became gangrenous and many openings appeared in it, all of them emitting pus and the body's humors. A number of physicians treated him for about two years, and among them there was no one skilled in the craft of surgery.
Until they sought me out. I saw his leg and the material flowing from those openings in great quantity, and the man's body was emaciated and his color yellow.  So I inserted a probe into one of those openings, and the probe reached the bone. Then I examined all the openings.
Then I found that some of them led to others from all sides of the leg. So I began by incising one of those openings until I exposed some of the bone. I found it corrupted, eaten away, black, putrid, and perforated until the perforation reached the marrow. Then I excised what was revealed to me.
And I removed the corrupted bone. I believe that there was no corruption in the bone other than what I cut and excised, and that I had completely removed it. Then I proceeded to dress the wound with cauterizing medications for a longer period, but it did not heal. Then I returned and uncovered the bone again, beyond the first uncovering.
Then I found the corruption connected to the bone.  So I excised what was also revealed to me of that corruption. Then I attempted to dress it, but it did not heal nor unite. Then I uncovered it again, and I continued to cut the bone piece by piece and attempt to dress it, but it would not heal until I had cut about a span of bone.
And I removed it with its marrow. Then I dressed it with medications, and it healed quickly and recovered.  This repetition in the operation and incision was necessary because of the patient's weakness, his low tolerance, and my fear for his death, because he frequently experienced severe fainting from excessive vomiting.  He recovered completely.
And in the place of the bone, firm flesh grew, and his condition in his body improved, and his strength returned, and he managed his affairs, and in walking he was not afflicted by any harm whatsoever. If a prominent bone in any part of the body is fractured,
it should be excised in this manner: you take a bandage and tie it around the end of the prominent bone, and instruct someone to pull it upwards. Then make another bandage of thicker wool than the first bandage.
Then tie it to the flesh beneath the bone and pull its end so that the flesh is drawn downwards, while you expose the flesh from the area you wish to excise, so that the saw does not injure the flesh.  Place a firm piece of wood or board beneath the bone from below.
Because if you do this, the saw will not be prevented from cutting the decayed bone. The sawing should be done slightly above the area of decay, so that there is no decay in the cavity of the bone which is not apparent to the touch, necessitating another sawing.
If the bone is decayed and not prominent, but its parts are connected and the decay is in its middle or in part of it, then expose the flesh from all its sides. Then place the wood underneath, and saw it from the first side where the decay is.
When you have finished sawing from one side, saw it from the other side, and let the sawing be a little distance from the decay, as we said. If the decay is in a joint, cut the decayed joint itself and saw the bone where it connects from the other side.
If the decay is in the articulation of two joints, there is no remedy other than excision. If the decay is in the metacarpus of the hand or foot, its treatment is very difficult; however, you should peel away the decay however it appears, excise it, and clean it in whatever way you can.
And by whatever method it straightens itself for you, provided that a vein or nerve does not impede you. And know that the instruments and saws for cutting these bones are numerous, according to the position, setting, thickness, thinness, size, smallness, hardness, and porosity of the bones. Therefore, it is necessary to prepare for each type of work an instrument similar to that work.
And know that the operations themselves may indicate to you the type of instrument you need, if you have long experience and knowledge of the arts of this craft, because mastery of the craft shows various kinds of diseases. He may therefore devise for himself instruments similar to those for each disease, and I have illustrated for you at the end of this chapter several instruments.
Making them examples to be imitated and a measure by which to measure others, God willing. Image of a saw:

In the amputation of limbs and the sawing of bones.
Limbs may become putrid, either from an external cause or from an internal cause. If you treat this corruption with medicinal treatment and the treatment is not effective, and you see the corruption spreading in the limb, nothing preventing it,
then it is necessary to amputate that limb to where the corruption has reached, so that the patient may be saved thereby from death or from a great calamity which is greater than the loss of the limb.  A sign of this occurring is that the limb turns black until you think that fire has burned it.
Or it may become putrid after turning black, until that putrefaction spreads to what is next to that limb and affects the whole body; therefore, hasten to amputate it.  Likewise, if the cause of the corruption is from the sting of some venomous creatures, like a sea scorpion, a snake, a spider, or the like.
If the corruption or sting is in the tip of a finger, amputate the finger and do not delay so that the corruption spreads to the hand.  Likewise, if it has affected the hand, amputate it from the base of the forearm, and do not delay so that the corruption spreads until it affects the bones of the forearm.
Likewise, if it has affected the arm, amputate the arm at the elbow in the joint itself. If the corruption spreads and you see it has reached toward the shoulder, do not amputate the shoulder at all, for in that is the death of the patient. Use other treatments as much as possible.
And likewise you do with the leg: if the corruption affects the toe, amputate the toe at one of the joints; and if it affects the metatarsus, amputate the whole foot. If it ascends to the knee, amputate the leg at the knee joint.
And if the corruption has reached above the knee, there is no remedy except to abandon it and leave the patient to death. The method of amputating or cutting off a limb is to tie a ligature below the place you wish to cut off and tie another ligature above the place.
And one assistant pulls the lower ligature downwards, and another assistant pulls the upper ligature upwards, and you yourself dissect the flesh between the ligatures with a wide scalpel until all the flesh is exposed, then it is cut or incised. It is necessary to place linen cloths on all sides.
Lest the saw touch the healthy part, which would cause the patient additional pain and hot inflammation. If bleeding occurs during your work, staunch the place quickly, or apply some styptic powder, then return to your treatment until you finish.
Then bind the injured limb with a suitable bandage and treat it until it heals. And I will tell you about an example of a man who had this very condition in his leg, namely that blackness with burning heat like fire occurred in his leg.
And that corruption first occurred in his toe until it took the whole leg.  So the man, on his own initiative, when he saw the corruption spreading in the limb, along with the intense pain and burning, cut it off at the joint and recovered.
Then, after a long time, that same corruption appeared in the index finger of his hand.  He came to me, and I attempted to check its progress with the medications I applied to the hand after cleaning his body. But the corruption did not abate and continued to spread to the other finger.
Until the corruption took hold of the hand. He asked me to amputate his hand, but I refused, hoping to stop the corruption's progress, and also fearing death for him if I amputated his hand, for the man's strength was failing.  When he despaired of me, he went back to his town.
Then word reached me that he had, on his own initiative, amputated his entire hand and recovered.  I have recounted this story to be helpful in cases of this type of disease and to serve as a guide to be followed and acted upon.
Chapter Eighty-Eight.
On the treatment of fistulas and how to inject them with medication.
If a swelling occurs in one of the fleshy parts and the duration of the swelling is prolonged, until it gathers matter, then bursts or is incised, and all the matter within it comes out, leaving the place empty like a vessel.
And the skin over it is like a thin rag, not severely damaged to the point of affecting bone, nerve, or ligament.  Therefore, it deserves to be called a fistula, and not a sinus, unless its duration is prolonged to the point that the damage affects any of these parts.
Then it is called a sinus or a fistula, and its treatment is to cut away all that skin completely, especially if it has become thin and like a rag, and you are certain that it will not adhere to the place due to its damage.
If you hope that the skin will adhere and the damage has not reached that extent, and there is a thickness of flesh in the skin, then treat it with injection. This is done by looking at the fistula; if it is large and the pus that flows from it is foul-smelling, inject it with the Egyptian medicine.
which is vinegar, oil, honey, and verdigris in equal parts, mixed in a vessel and cooked over a fire until the medicine thickens to the consistency of honey. Then take what you need and dilute it with water and honey, and inject it into the fistula.  Tie its opening and leave the medicine inside for about two hours.
Then remove it by pressing. Do this for several days until the fistula is cleansed and the foul smell is gone.  You may inject it with ash water if this medicine is not available. This is made by taking the ash of grapevine wood or oak wood and pouring water over it.
Then filter it and inject it until you are certain that the fistula has been washed. If the patient cannot tolerate the Egyptian medicine or the ash water, then inject it with water and honey in which some powdered verdigris has been mixed.
Or inject it with honey and syrup mixed together, for honey cleanses and washes, and syrup closes the fistula, especially if the syrup is astringent and drying. When you have done this several times and are sure that the fistula is healed, inject it with something that will cause flesh to grow in it.
Such as taking palm ointment and diluting it with rose oil and an astringent syrup, or inject it with some of the other medicines and ointments whose properties we have described in the chapter on ointments. If the opening of the fistula is narrow and does not allow the injection tube to enter,
widen it slightly with an iron instrument, or place in it a wick soaked in Egyptian ointment or theriac ointment until it widens.  Similarly, if the opening is too wide, bring its edges together with sutures, leaving only enough space for the injection tube to enter.
Similarly, if the opening from which the pus flows is high up, incise it in the lowest part so that the pus flows downwards, for if the pus collects in the depth of the fistula, it prevents the growth of flesh.
If you cannot incise the fistula downwards as desired, then position the member so that the pus flows out easily, in whatever way is convenient, so that no pus at all is retained.
As for the cataplasms which are applied externally to the fistula, and the manner of their application: take one of the suitable cataplasms, spread it on a linen cloth, the cloth being large enough to cover the entire fistula. Then, with scissors, cut a hole opposite the opening of the fistula, slightly larger than the opening itself.  Then spread some soft ointment on another cloth, to fit the hole, and place it there, some distance from the opening of the fistula, so that the pus may easily escape; do not remove the larger cloth until afterwards.
several days; but that on the opening of the fistula you remove at all times, so that whatever pus collects there may come out, and you may know whether what flows from it is much or little, mature or immature.
Moreover, examine the fistula itself; does the patient feel pain in it, or not? Is there swelling, or not? If your treatment continues thus, and you see the matter which comes out is slight at the opening of the fistula…
know that the fistula has adhered, or is near to adhering. Then, resolve it on the morrow, or on the third day. And when you open the wound, change the cloths and renew the ointment. If, after a long time, thin pus issues from the fistula, do not despair of its healing.
Its healing is near, for some people are slow in the growth of flesh in their wounds, and others the opposite. If, after many days, immature pus comes from the fistula, know that the fistula has not healed. If the healing of the fistula is slow…
and its condition prolonged, increase the drying medicines, and let them be medicines which are moist in their consistency, and dry in their power, such as palm ointment if there has been added to it an excess of litharge. Among the most efficacious things with which it is treated is palm ointment…
and it is resolved with rose oil, and sprinkle on it old wine of moderate consistency, then knead it with this and use it. He may do this if palm ointment is not available: honey, if you cook it until it thickens, and use it; or you may take myrrh, aloes, and costus, crush them all together, and sprinkle them over honey while it is over the fire. Then spread it on a cloth and bind it on the fistula; or it may be spread with honey which you have cooked until it thickens, and sprinkle on it the drugs, and place on it the cloth and bind it.
Long rhubarb, the root of asphodel, the dust of  costmary, and centaury may be used in such a case, singly or together. Crush and sift them, and sprinkle them on the honey described above, and use it. If the fistula's condition is prolonged and it does not heal with this treatment, know that there is corruption in its depth.
And if it has affected the bones, or other hard nerves, or ligaments, treat it as a fistula, as described above.
Chapter eighty-nine.
On the treatment of the felon, the bruised nail, the excision of the superfluous finger, and the separation of adherent fingers.
A felon is an excessive growth of flesh under the nail of the thumb of the hand or foot, and it may grow in other fingers. If its condition is prolonged and its treatment neglected, it swells with a hot swelling.
Or it becomes putrid and foul until it eats the root of the nail, and perhaps destroys it entirely; and perhaps the corruption reaches the bone until it has a foul smell, and the end of the finger becomes broad, and its color becomes livid.  If you treat it with what we mentioned in the division, and your treatment is not effective,
then you should cut away with an iron instrument all the superfluous growth which grows from the nail, then cauterize the wound afterwards; for cauterization is very beneficial in this.  But if the bone is sound and the nail is also sound,
and the angle containing the nail has drawn the flesh inwards and caused it to be pinched and injured, then you should place a thin probe under the angle of the nail which pinches the flesh, and raise it upwards, and cut that flesh gently.
And you should apply to what remains of the flesh of the cauterizing escharotics until it is all gone, then treat it with ointments until it heals. But if the corruption has affected the bone, then you should cut away that bone and remove it, for it will not heal at all as long as there is corrupt bone in it.
If you see the erosion and corruption spreading in the finger, cut it off at one of the phalanges as mentioned before, then treat it until it heals. If the nail receives a blow or injury and severe pain occurs in it, then you should bleed the patient first.
Then you incise the nail with a sharp scalpel, an oblique incision from above downwards, and be careful not to reach with the incision to the flesh under the nail, for by doing so you cause the patient severe pain and it will be a cause of the growth of superfluous flesh in the place, then treat the place with that which alleviates pain.
As for the superfluous finger which grows in some people's hands, it may be wholly fleshy, and it may have bones in it, and it may have a nail in it, and the growth of some of them is at the root of the joint of some of the fingers.
Or its growth may be in some of the phalanges of the finger. Those that grow in some of the phalanges of the finger do not move, and those that grow at the joint of the finger may move.  As for that which is fleshy only, its cutting is easy, and that is to cut it at its origin with a broad scalpel.
As for that whose growth is at the root of the joint, its treatment is difficult, so avoid cutting it. As for that which grows in the finger at one of the phalanges, it should first have its flesh cut away in a circular cut down to the bone, then spread the bone with one of those saws suitable for that.
Then treat it until it heals. As for the adhesion which occurs to the fingers, some to others, this often happens, and it is from that with which a man is born, and it is at the healing of a wound or a burn of fire and the like.  Then it should be incised, that adhesion.
Until the fingers return to their natural form, then place between them a pledget or a piece of lint soaked in rose oil, lest it adhere quickly, and separate them, or place between them a thin lead plate until the place heals as it should.
And likewise, if adhesion occurs to some of the fingers with the palm, incise that adhesion according to what is appropriate and improves the shape of the member.
Chapter Ninety.
On the excision of haemorrhoids.
Haemorrhoids are twisted, thick veins, filled with black, superfluous matter, occurring in most parts of the body, and most frequently in the legs, especially in the legs of those who carry burdens and those who work in the fields and vineyards.  First, the body should be purged with black hellebore, repeatedly and strongly.
Then bleed the patient in the basilica vein. As for treating them with iron, there are two ways: one is to incise and remove the black blood; the other is to extract the vein entirely.  As for incision, the leg should first be bathed in warm water.
until the thick, turbid blood becomes fluid. Then the patient's leg is bound from above the thigh to below the knee with a bandage, and then the vein is incised in one, two, or three places with a wide incision.
Then you remove the black blood with your hand, from below the leg upwards and from above downwards, until you remove the amount of blood that you consider sufficient, or what the patient's strength can bear.  Then you bind it and instruct him to avoid foods which produce black bile; and purging and bloodletting are repeated.
When the veins are full and this harms the patient. As for extraction, it is done in this way: the patient's leg is shaved if it has much hair; then he is put in a bath and his leg is bathed in warm water until it reddens and sweats, or he performs strenuous exercise.
If a bath is not available, until the limb is warmed; then you incise the skin opposite the vein lengthwise, either at its end near the knee, or at its lower end near the heel. Then you open the skin with hooks and strip the vein from every side until it is palpable.
And when it appears, you see it is dark red; and when it is freed from the skin, you see it also like a tendon. Then you insert a probe beneath it until, when it is raised and emerges from the skin, you hang it with a smooth, blunt hook; then make another incision near that incision, about three fingers wide.
Then strip the skin from over the vein until it appears; then raise it with the probe as you did before and hang it with another hook as you did before. Then make another incision, or many incisions if you need to.
Then extract it and cut it at the end of the incision near the heel; then pull it and extract it until it emerges from the second incision; then pull it to the incision above it, and do this until you pull it from the third incision, above all the incisions, until when it has all emerged, you cut it.
If it does not yield to pulling and extraction, then insert a needle with strong doubled thread, and tie it and pull it; and insert the probe beneath it and twist it with your hand to every side until it emerges, and be careful that it does not break; for if it breaks, then its extraction will be very difficult for you.
And harm comes to the patient from it.  When you have extracted it all, place wool soaked in a syrup and rose oil or olive oil on the site of the incisions, and treat it until it heals.  If the varix is constricted with twists and turns in various directions,
and is not straight as we said, then it is necessary that you make an incision on it at each of its twists and places of turning, then hang it with hooks until you extract it completely. And be careful when incising it that you do not cut or injure the vein, for that will make its extraction difficult for you; therefore, exert yourself carefully.
Image of the incision by which the varix is incised.
Image of the blind hook.
It should not be hooked like other hooks, nor should it be sharp-pointed, lest it injure the vein; rather it should be thick, smooth and bending, for if it is thin it will cut the vein by its thinness; rather it should have a greater thickness, as we said.
Chapter ninety-one.
On the removal of the varicose vein.
This vein is generated in the legs in hot countries like the Hijaz and the lands of the Arabs, and in hot, arid countries with little fertility; and it may be generated in other places in the body besides the legs, and its generation is due to a corruption that occurs under the skin.
Just as living creatures and worms occur inside the bodies, and the gourd-worm and the worm generated between the skin and the flesh, and a sign of the beginning of the generation of this vein is that a severe inflammation occurs in the leg, then the place swells, then the vein begins to come out from the place of that swelling.
As if it were the root of a plant or an animal, and when its end appears, it should be wrapped with a small piece of lead weighing from one dirham to two dirhams, and tied, and the lead is left hanging from the leg.
Then, whenever anything comes out of it to the outside, wrap it in lead and tie it. If it is very long, cut some of it and wrap the remainder; and do not cut it from its root before it all comes out, for if you cut it, it will contract and enter the flesh, causing swelling and corruption in the place, and a bad ulcer.
Therefore, it should be treated carefully and pulled out little by little until it comes out completely and nothing of it remains in the body. And from this vein, in some people, there may come out something that is five or ten cubits in length.
And it has reached me that it came out from a man twenty cubits long.  If it breaks off while you are treating it, then insert a probe into its hole, and cauterize it with a long cautery alongside the body until all its matter is emptied, and try to purify the place with medicines for some days.
Then treat it with the treatment of tumors. This vein may have many branches, especially if it appears in a joint of the leg or in the leg itself, producing many openings, and from each opening a branch comes out. Treat it as we mentioned in the classification and what preceded.
Chapter ninety-two.
Concerning the incision for the worm that is generated under the armpit and is called the cow's disease.
This disease is called in some of our countries the cow's disease, because it frequently affects cows. It is a small, single worm that is generated between the skin and the flesh and moves throughout the body, ascending and descending.
It is perceived by touch as it moves from one member to another until it breaks through wherever it breaks through the skin and comes out.  Its formation is from the corruption of some humors, as happens with worms, snakes, and gourd-like growths in the abdomen.
Its harm is expected to be that if it moves in the body and rises to the head and reaches the eye, it may open it and come out, thus destroying the eye. This happens frequently. If you want to treat it and remove it, that is done when it moves and becomes perceptible to the touch.
It is necessary to firmly tie above and below it with a good binding, then incise and remove it. If it has sunk into the flesh and you do not find it, apply cautery with fire to the area until you burn it. The greatest harm to be expected from it is damage to the eye, as we said.
If you see that it has reached the head near the eye, tie firmly below it on the forehead, then incise and remove it. The patient should be treated with purgative medicines to cleanse the body of bad, corrupt humors and should abstain from foods that produce putrefaction.
Chapter Ninety-Three.
Concerning the incision for the disease known as the *nafir*.
This disease, which in our country is called *nafir*, is a pain that appears in some members and then moves from one member to another. I have seen it as I describe to you.
I was called to a sick woman in the countryside. She bared her arm and showed me a slight swelling in a vein of the forearm. After a short time, I saw that swelling moving with the ulna, like a worm, ascending to her shoulder as quickly as possible, like mercury.
When it passed from one place to another, the pain disappeared from that place and settled in the shoulder. Then, after a while, it spread throughout the body until it reached the other arm. Then she told me that it circulated through her whole body, as I witnessed.
I was amazed at the speed of its passage from one member to another. I had never before seen this disease with my own eyes in this way, although I had seen several people whose pain moved from one member to another. I had not, however, seen it with my own eyes as I saw it in this woman.
I could only account for this by the fact that the woman was from the countryside, with a dry body and visible veins; therefore, that moving wind appeared to the senses.  It should not appear in this way in people of comfort, with moist bodies and hidden veins.
If you wish to treat it and the patient feels pain, and if it appears to you visibly as we have mentioned, then bind above and below it tightly with a bandage and incise it until that confined wind emerges, and cauterize the place.
If you do not see it with your eyes, then treat it by means of things that dispel the body's humors and disperse the winds, such as the seeds of the squirting cucumber and the seeds of the spikenard, and similar medicines.
Chapter ninety-four.
On extracting arrows.
Arrows differ according to their types and according to the places in the body where they lodge. As for their differences according to their types, there are large ones and small ones, hollow glass ones and solid glass ones, and some have three points and some have four points.
Some have barbs and some have splinters. As for those according to the organs in which they lodge, they are of two kinds: either the organs are hollow principal organs, such as the brain, heart, liver, lung, kidneys, intestines, bladder, and the like; so if an arrow lodges in one of these organs and you see the signs of death which I shall describe to you later, then you should avoid extracting that arrow from it, for death will overtake its owner in most cases. But if these bad signs do not appear and the arrow is not hidden deep within the organ, then extract it and treat the wound. And of the signs [of injury to] the brain, if an arrow strikes it and penetrates the bone and wounds the membrane which is upon the brain, then there results from that a severe headache, stupor, and dizziness.
But if these bad signs do not appear and the arrow is not hidden deep within the organ, then extract it and treat the wound. And of the signs [of injury to] the brain, if an arrow strikes it and penetrates the bone and wounds the membrane which is upon the brain, then there results from that a severe headache, stupor, and dizziness. and redness in the eyes and redness of the tongue, convulsions, delirium, vomiting, and perhaps blood comes from the nostrils or ears, and perhaps speech is lost and the voice is gone, and a white moisture resembling gruel comes from the place of the wound, and from it flows something like the water of flesh.
If these signs appear to you, then refrain from treating the patient and from extracting the arrow if it has not been extracted. As for the signs [of an arrow] striking the heart, if it is near the left breast and you feel it as if it had been driven into something solid and not into something hollow,
and perhaps the arrow has a movement resembling the pulse, and black blood flows from the wound, and this is followed by coldness of the extremities, cold sweat, and fainting; then know that death is inevitably approaching. And a sign of the arrow wounding the lung is the discharge of frothy blood from the wound.
And the vessels which are near the neck swell, and the color of the patient changes, and he breathes heavily and desires to inhale cold air. If the arrow strikes the diaphragm which is in the chest, then it will be near the lower ribs, and the breathing will be labored with severe pain.
And he sighs and all the members of the shoulders move. If the arrow strikes the liver, severe pain follows, and blood resembling the liver in its redness comes from the wound. If the arrow strikes the stomach, perhaps something undigested from the food comes from the wound.
And its condition is apparent. If the arrow strikes the abdomen and lodges in it, and something of the stool, or fat, or intestine which has been perforated comes out of the wound, then there is no hope of treating it or of extracting the arrow. If the arrow strikes the bladder and urine comes out,
and something protrudes from it to the outside and the pain becomes severe for the patient, then know that he is perishing. As for the other members, like the face, eye, throat, shoulder, arm, vertebrae of the back, collarbone, thigh, leg, and similar members, they are mostly safe.
When the arrow does not encounter a vein or nerve, and the arrow is not poisoned. And I inform you of some of what I have witnessed concerning these arrows so that you may deduce from that your treatment. And that is that an arrow once struck a man in the corner of his eye at the root of the nose.
Then I extracted it for him from the other side, under the lobe of the ear, and he recovered, and no harm occurred to his eye. And I extracted another arrow for a Jew which had struck him in the lobe of his eye under the lower eyelid, and the arrow had become hidden, and I only reached the small end which is attached to the wood.
And it was a large arrow from the composite bows, square-headed, smooth, without barbs.  And the Jew recovered, and no ill event occurred to his eye. And I extracted another arrow from the throat of a Christian, and the arrow was Arabic.
And it is the one with two barbs. So I made an incision upon him between the two muscles of the neck, and it had sunk into his throat. So I gently worked at it until I extracted it, and the Christian was safe and recovered. And I extracted another arrow for a man which had struck him in the abdomen, and we estimated that he would die from it.
Then when thirty days or so had passed, and nothing in his condition had changed, I made an incision upon the arrow and manipulated it and extracted it, and he recovered and no ill event occurred to him. And I saw a man struck by an arrow in his back, and the wound had closed over it.
Then when seven years had passed, the arrow emerged at the root of his thigh. And I saw a woman who had been struck in her abdomen by an arrow, and the wound had closed, and the arrow remained, and nothing in her condition changed, nor did she experience any harm from it in any of her natural functions.
And I saw another man struck by an arrow in his face, and the wound closed and he felt little pain from it.  And there are many similar cases. And I extracted an arrow for a man, one of the Sultan's guards, which had struck him in the middle of his nose, inclining slightly to the right side.
And the entire arrow was hidden. I was called to treat him three days after the arrow had struck. I found the arrow wound very narrow, so I probed it with a thin probe, but I did not feel it. And he felt a stinging and pain under his ear on the right side.
I hoped that this stinging was from the point of the arrow, so I applied a dressing to the area with drawing and ripening power, hoping that the area would swell and the sign of the arrow would appear, so that I could incise it. But nothing happened in the area to indicate that the arrow had reached that place.
So I continued the dressing for many days, but nothing happened. Then, during that time, the wound closed, and the patient remained hopeless about its removal, until one day he felt the arrow inside his nose. He informed me of this, and I applied a strong caustic medicine to the wound for many days.
Until it opened, and I probed it, and I felt the thin tip of the arrow which adheres to the wood. Then I increased the opening of the wound with that strong medicine until the tip of the arrow appeared clearly to us.  And I spent about four months with it.
Then, when the wound widened and I was able to insert forceps into it, I pulled and moved it, but it did not respond to being removed.  So I continued to gently manipulate it and devise ways with various instruments until one day I grasped it with firm forceps, as its image appears at the end of the chapter.
And the physicians judged that the cartilage of his nose would not heal, but I healed it, and the wound united, and the patient recovered completely without any further harm.  And I tell you about the method of removing some arrows so that you may use this as a measure and guide for what I have not mentioned.
Because the parts of this craft and its details cannot be grasped by description, nor encompassed by a book.  Rather, the skillful craftsman measures the much by the little, and the present by the absent, and devises a new work and a new instrument for strange emergencies.
If we descend from this craft, then I say that arrows are removed from the members in which they are embedded in two ways: either by pulling from the place where they entered, or from the opposite side, and those that are removed from where they entered.
Either the arrow is protruding in a fleshy place, and it is pulled out. If it does not yield to being pulled out at the time it is encountered, then you should leave it for some days until the flesh around it putrifies, so that it is easy to pull and remove it.  Likewise, if it is embedded in bone.
And if it does not yield to being pulled out, then leave it also for some days and try pulling and moving it every day, for it will come out. If it does not yield to being pulled out after days, then you should pierce around the arrow in the bone itself from every side with a fine borer, until you widen the space for the arrow, then pull it out.
If the arrow embedded in the bone of the head has penetrated deeply into one of the ventricles of the brain, and some of those symptoms which I have mentioned to you appear in the patient, then refrain from pulling the arrow and leave it until its condition improves after some days.
then proceed to pull out the arrow. If it is deeply embedded and does not yield to pulling, then use the borers around the arrow as I have described to you, then treat the area until it heals. But if the arrow has disappeared in a part of the body, and is hidden from sensation, then search for it with a probe. If you feel it, then pull it out with some instrument suitable for pulling it out. If you are not able to reach it because of the narrowness of the wound and the depth of the arrow, and there is neither bone, nor nerve, nor vein,
then incise it until the wound widens and you can reach the arrow so that you may pull it out. If it has barbs, grasp them, and free the flesh caught in them from every side by every means you can. If you cannot free the flesh, break off the barbs and twist them until you are free.
And when you attempt to remove the arrow, wherever it may be, use the pressure of your hand with forceps in all directions until you free it. Exercise the utmost gentleness, lest the arrow break and it becomes difficult for you to pull it out. If you cannot remove it at the time,
leave it for some days until the flesh around it becomes putrid, then try again; for it will then be easier. If bleeding hinders you, use what we have mentioned in its chapter. Guard carefully against cutting a vein, or nerve, or tendon, and use skill.
In every way you can free the arrow, and let this be done gently and carefully and firmly as I have described to you.  It is necessary that when you pull out the arrow you should place the patient in the same position he was in when the arrow struck him; this is more suitable.
If you cannot do that, use whatever positions you can. As for an arrow that emerges from the opposite side, either something of it will have protruded outwards, or you will find the point of the arrow by touch just beneath the skin nearby and see it projecting.
Then make an incision upon it; let the incision be of a size sufficient for the forceps. Then pull it out, for it will be easy to remove. If it is stuck in a bone, rotate your hand until the arrow affects the bone and makes room for itself, then pull it out.
Otherwise, leave it for several days, then try again until it comes out. If the arrow shaft is still in place, push it with that. If the shaft has fallen off and you want to use pushing, then insert the hollow instrument so that its cavity enters the tail of the arrow, then push it with that.
If the arrow is hollow, push it with an instrument that enters that cavity, for the arrow will then easily come out. If the arrow is poisoned, it is necessary that you cut away all the flesh into which the poison has penetrated, if you can do so, then treat it with what is suitable for that.
If the arrow lodged in the chest, or in the abdomen, or in the bladder, or in the flank, and it is near what can be felt with a probe, and you can make an incision upon it, make an incision and be careful not to cut a vein or nerve, and take it out.
Then suture the wound if it needs suturing, then treat it until it heals.  Image of the forceps with which arrows are extracted:
Their ends are like the beak of a bird; they are made like a file, so that when they grasp an arrow or something, they do not let go.  And various sizes—large, small, and medium—are made, all according to the size of the arrow, the size of the wound, and its narrowness.
Image of the hollow pusher:
Image of the solid pusher:
This has a solid end like a punch, to make it easier to enter the hollow arrow and push it.
Chapter ninety-five.
In the incision of veins.
The veins which it is customary to incise in the body are thirty veins; of these, sixteen are in the head: the two pulsating veins behind the ears, known as the “sensitive” ones; and the two arteries in the temples, which are apparent; and the two veins in the corners of the eyes, known as the “visual” ones.
And the vein rising in the middle of the forehead, and the vein which is at the tip of the nose, and the two jugulars which are in the neck, and the two veins which are in the upper lip of the mouth, and the two veins which are in the lower lip—these veins are known as the “jaw” veins—and the two veins which are under the tongue.
As for the veins which are incised in the arm and hand, they are five veins: one of them is the cephalic, which is on the outer side, and the common people call it the “head” vein; and the median, which is the middle vein, and it is composed of a branch of the basilic and a branch of the cephalic, and the common people call it the “body” vein.
And the basilic, which is situated on the inner side, and it is also called the axillary; and the common people call it the “belly” vein; and the vein of the forearm, which is situated on the ulna, and to which it adheres, and which appears very clearly above the thumb; and the azygos.
And this is the vein which is between the little finger and the ring finger; it has two branches. And in the leg and foot there are three veins: one of them is that which is below the hollow of the knee on the outer side; and the second is the saphenous, and its place is at the heel on the inner side; and the vein of the women, and its place is at the heel on the outer side.
And in the other leg there are three veins like them. As for the two veins which are behind the ears, the benefit of their incision is for chronic colds, migraine, ringworm, and chronic bad sores of the head, and their method of incision is as I describe.
And that is to shave the head of the patient and rub his head well in the place of the two veins with a rough cloth, then the patient's neck is constricted with a turban until the two veins and their position appear behind the ears in the two low places of the head, then you feel them with your finger, and where you feel their pulsation under your finger, there you mark with ink.
Then you take a lancet, which is known as the *nashal*, then you insert it under the vein in the skin until the lancet reaches the bone, then you raise your hand with the vein and skin upwards and cut the vein with the skin a cut, and the length of the cut is the amount of two joined fingers.
Or something similar, and you let out the amount of blood that you want, then you bind them with bandages and leave them until they heal.  And I have already mentioned in the beginning of the book their cutting and cauterization. As for the two arteries which are in the temples, the benefit of their incision is for chronic migraine, severe headache, persistent ophthalmia, and the flow of sharp humors directed towards the eyes.
And their method of incision is as I describe to you: the patient constricts his neck with a turban until the veins appear clearly to the touch and their pulsation is evident under your finger; then you mark with ink. Then you raise the skin from above the vein upwards with your index finger.
And you insert the lancet, the *nashal*, from below and raise the vein upwards and cut it as you did with the other two veins, and you let out blood according to your need, then you untie the patient's constriction and place your finger on the vein for a while.
Then you place cotton and a bandage on it and bind it tightly from above and leave it until it heals. And I have already mentioned them, their cutting, and their opening, in the beginning of the book. As for the incision of the vein of the forehead, its benefit, after the incision of the cephalic vein, is for chronic facial ailments such as ringworm, ulcers, and persistent redness.
And the method of its incision, as I describe to you: the patient constricts his neck with a turban until the vein appears; then you take the instrument which is called the axe, and this is its image:
You place the projecting spike which is in the head of the axe on the vein itself and strike from above with a comb or something similar to it, and you let the blood flow to the amount you desire; then you untie the patient's constriction and bind him until he heals.
And it may be opened with a wide lancet, except that it should not be sharp-pointed like other lancets, but rather slightly wide-ended, and you incise it obliquely, because the bone is near, and the lancet might break in it if it is thin.
As for the two veins which are at the temples, their benefit is for ailments of the eye, such as ringworm, redness, and cataracts, and diseases of the face. As for the method of their incision, it is that the patient constricts his neck with a turban, then you incise them while you are standing over his head, and let the incision be slightly oblique and lengthwise with a small, slightly wide lancet.
For the place has no flesh in it; if the lancet is thin-pointed, it might break. Then you draw off the amount of blood you need, and you place cotton on them and bind them for one night, then you unbind them.  As for the incision of the vein of the nose, it is beneficial for acute fevers.
And severe headache and diseases of the face such as erysipelas which appears in the nose, especially if it is chronic.  The method of its incision is that the patient constricts his neck, then you hold his nose with your left hand and take a thin, long lancet.
And you pierce it in the middle of the nasal septum itself, between the nasal partition, straightly, because the vein does not appear to the touch there; then the blood will flow immediately. And you should move your hand with the lancet a little and draw off the amount of blood you need, then bind it for a night, for it clots quickly.
As for the jugular veins, the benefit of their incision is for shortness of breath, the beginning of leprosy, and melancholic diseases which appear on the surface of the skin, such as black vitiligo, impetigo, bad ulcers, and cankers.  The method of their incision is that the patient constricts beneath them in his neck with a ligature, and the surgeon stands at the head of the patient.
And the patient sits on a chair, then you incise the vein lengthwise with a slightly wide incision, then you draw off a moderate amount of blood, or according to what you see as necessary. Then you do likewise with the other vein, then you untie the ligature.
And you tie the two veins with a moderate tightness, lest the patient be choked, and you leave him until the next day, for the wound will heal. As for the veins of the temples, the benefit of their incision is, after the incision of the cephalic veins, that it benefits from canker sores in the mouth, corruption of the gums, bad ulcers, cracking of the lips, and bad ulcers.
which are in the nose and around it.  The method of their incision is that you seat the patient before you and tie his neck with a turban, then you move his lips and look at the two veins, one of which you see to the right of the lip and the other to the left of it, and you recognize them by their blackness.
And that is also because around them are small, black veins, so cut them with a cutting incision. If it is difficult for you and you do not know what they are, then aim to cut the largest and most obvious of them.  Likewise, do in the two veins which are in the lower lip.
As for the two veins which are under the tongue, the benefit of their incision is, after the incision of the cephalic veins, for the angina which are in the throat from a disease of the uvula and diseases of the mouth.  The method of their incision is that you seat the patient between your hands towards the sun, and raise his tongue, and look under the tongue, on one side a vein and on the other side a vein, and their color is towards blackness.
Then you incise them and be careful not to go too far in cutting them, for beneath them are arteries, so perhaps bleeding from those arteries might occur. As for the three veins which are incised in the elbow, they are those which custom has established for incision in all people, and their incision is in two ways.
Either by piercing with a wide, blunt-ended or olive-shaped lancet to the depth of the flesh, or by cutting with a scalpel-like lancet, which is the *nashal* [and this is its image], the image of the wide, blunt-ended lancet:
It is wide as you see, so that it is suitable for opening hollow, full, prominent, apparent, thick veins which contain thick, turbid blood. And this is the image of the olive-shaped lancet:
And this lancet is less wide and thinner at the tip; it is suitable for the incision of thin veins which contain thin, yellowish blood. And this is the image of the *nashal* lancet:
This is the *nashal*, which is suitable for cutting, and there are types of it, wide and narrow, according to the width and narrowness of the veins also. And by this one may infer other things, and it is well-known among artisans.
As for the basilic vein, which is one of these three veins, the benefit of its incision is that it draws blood from the illnesses which are under the throat and neck, from what is next to the chest and abdomen.  It is necessary for the phlebotomist, when incising it, to be cautious and to be at a distance from it, for beneath it is an artery. If he makes a mistake and goes too deep with the lancet, he will cut that artery.
Then a hemorrhage of blood occurs. Therefore it is necessary that its incision should not be with the lancet for puncture, but its incision should be a cut with the *nashal*. If the basilic vein does not appear clearly, then it is necessary to avoid it and turn to another, or to look for one of its branches.
Or incise in its place the vein of the arm, for it is clear, and incise it with the *nashal* lancet as we said. If you wish to incise it itself, then before tightening the arm it is necessary to feel the place until you identify the location of the pulse, then mark it with ink.
Then you tie the arm and incise the vein with an oblique incision with the *nashal* lancet, as we said, and take care that the blow falls far from the location of the artery. And whenever you see, when tightening the ligature, a swelling in the place which you marked with ink, then that swelling is the swelling of the artery, so avoid it.
If you see the blood, at the time of incision, spurt like the urine of a boy, and the blood is thin and red, then know that it is from the artery. Then immediately place your finger on it for a long time, then remove your finger. If the blood stops, and it often does stop, then tighten the arm.
And leave it. And warn the patient against neglecting it, and let him be on a diet and not move it for some days until it heals. If the blood does not stop and it overcomes you, and you do not have medicine at hand, then amputate the artery if it appears to you, for its ends will contract and the blood will stop.
Or take a walnut shell and split it, and take one half and bind it tightly to the vein with a ligature and bandages until the next day. If the blood stops, well and good; otherwise treat it with what was previously mentioned of placing styptics, and stopping its blood is not difficult in most cases.
Because of the smallness of the wound and the tightness of the ligature in the arm, inform him of it.  As for the cephalic vein, the benefit of its incision is that it draws blood from the top of the head and the lower body, because it is composed of a branch of the basilic and a branch of the cephalic, as we said.
And it is necessary for the one who is bleeding him to be on a diet from his bleeding, for there is a nerve under it. If he exceeds in the insertion of the lancet and hits the nerve, numbness occurs in it, which is difficult to cure, and perhaps it will not heal at all.  And this nerve is often perceptible to the touch.
If it is hidden in some people and is thin and not apparent, then you should make your incision of it a longitudinal incision and avoid the nerve as much as possible. If the vein is between two nerves, then split the vein lengthwise. As for the cephalic vein, the benefit of its incision is that it draws blood from the head.
And it benefits from diseases of the eyes, and it is necessary in this vein in particular, if you wish to bleed it, to insert the olive-shaped lancet or the wide, basil-shaped lancet, because it is the safest of all veins, because there is no artery or nerve under it.
Except that it is necessary for you during bleeding to avoid only the head of the muscle with the lancet and seek the soft place.  And it does not harm him if he is not hit with the first strike to be bled again several times, except that it might swell in some people if it is not bled in the first strike.
But that swelling does not harm him at all. As for the method of bleeding and its complications and what should be done beforehand in its treatment, the first of that is that you should know that bleeding is either used only to maintain health.
And it is either used in diseases.  And that which is used to maintain health and its duration and to guard against the occurrence of diseases is that bleeding should be in one of the three veins in the elbow, I mean the cephalic, the median basilic, and the basilic, and that bleeding should be at the beginning of spring if signs of fullness appear.
And the bleeding should be on Sunday or Tuesday after three hours of the day have passed. As for the bleeding that is used in diseases, it does not have a limited time, but whenever necessity and need dictate it, by night or day.
And in every hour and at every time.  And children should not be bled until fourteen years have passed over them, nor should the elderly who have passed sixty years be bled.  If someone intends to bleed for any reason whatsoever,
he should cleanse his bowels before bleeding with a gentle enema if there is much retained fecal matter in them, lest putrid matter be drawn into the veins from the bowels during bleeding, harming the principal organs. And do not bleed the consumptive, nor the drunkard, nor the intoxicated until that passes from them.
And let him also beware of bleeding after dysentery, vomiting, diarrhea, excessive coitus, exertion, exercise, wakefulness, fasting, and everything that weakens the strength, whether physical or mental.  Then look to the thinning of the humors beforehand if the blood is thick.
with foods, drinks, and medicines if he can, then he should enter the bath if nothing prevents him, or perform some exercise so that the blood may be thinned, and let his bleeding be in the middle of the day, as we have said, and let him intend to clear his breast that day of all bad psychological conditions.
like worries, anger, and fear, and from all physical conditions like excessive exertion and fatigue, coitus, and the like. And let there be present in his session those things which people customarily use, such as various perfumes, scents, entertainments, and the like, each person according to what he can manage.
Then the phlebotomist sits on a cushion higher than the cushion on which the person to be bled sits. Then he extends his arm, and the phlebotomist rubs it with his hand two or three times, then he tightens the ligature with the bandage and twists it two or three times; let the tightening be moderate.
For if the tightening is not moderate, either by excessive tightness, it prevents the flow of blood, or if it is toward relaxation, it also prevents the flow of blood. Then, after the tightening, it is necessary that the person to be bled rub both his hands together.
until the veins swell and become perceptible to the touch. Then the phlebotomist wipes the lancet with a little old oil, especially, then places the index finger of his left hand on the same vein a little below the place which he wants to bleed, lest the vein evade and avoid the incision. For some veins you find are like a tendon; they evade when bled, and some are full of wind; when the lancet is placed on them, they sink below the lancet and deceive the phlebotomist, and the lancet does not open the vein, or if it opens it, it is only a narrow opening.
Therefore, the phlebotomist should be certain and deliberate in all these matters, then he lowers the lancet. If the vein opens at that time, well and good; otherwise, he repeats it again a little below or above that place quickly, if the place is not swollen.
If the patient swells or is frightened, leave him for a day or two and do not tighten the ligature, for it might cause a hot swelling, and do not enter the bath. Then he may repeat the bloodletting if he wishes.  If the lancet penetrates and the opening is small and the flow of blood is thin,
and you fear that the amount of blood you desire will not come out, then return the lancet to the same hole gently and straight, and increase the opening a little, and do this quickly before the place swells, for in many people the place may swell with a small opening.
But if you see that it has swollen, do not repeat it at all, for it will not help you. Place something of oil dregs on it, for it facilitates the flow of blood, and it is better in this case than the oil itself and other ointments as well.
Therefore use oil dregs in all your phlebotomies when the flow of blood is difficult.  The theriac and the  shakhzanāj may also do this if one of them is placed on the site;  the blood will thin and dissolve if it is thick.
If a large swelling occurs at the site of the bloodletting—and this often happens, especially to someone who has only been bled once or whose vein opening was small—then act quickly and place a sponge soaked in slightly warmed salt water on the swelling and bind it for an hour, for it will resolve.
And it is necessary that you do this after the blood has completely come out from the vein itself or from another vein. If something black or green remains in the place after a few days, it does not harm.  If you wish, apply some dissolved aloes and bitter drug to it.
Or something of the juice of the *fudanj* and the like. Often a swelling and a lump occur when bleeding the basilica vein. Place your hand on it; if you find it fluctuates when you tap it, then that is a bad lump, so beware of putting anything of what we have mentioned on it.
For perhaps arterial blood will bleed from it, but bandage it with something constricting to solidify the area, then treat it with the rest of the treatment until it heals. It is necessary that you remove blood from each person according to his strength and what appears of the color predominant in the blood.
For if the blood is black, let it come out until it reddens; and likewise if you see it thick, send it forth until it thins; and likewise if it is sharp, until its sharpness goes away.  It is necessary that someone who is full-bodied and strong and needs to have blood removed at once...
...should widen the vein incision and the lancet should be wide. And for someone who is weak, the opposite is true. It is necessary that you remove it in stages and that the hole be narrow.  And the best thing to use in bloodletting is something sharp, lancet-shaped, incised, not pierced.
And this type of bloodletting is safe from bleeding and from cutting a nerve; it is better and safer than bloodletting across or lengthwise. And if someone is accustomed to fainting during bloodletting, it is necessary that you feed him before bloodletting something of bread soaked in pomegranate water or oxymel.
If he is feverish and blood is removed from him in three or four times, then if he is cold-natured, let him take before bloodletting bread soaked in hydromel or in honeyed drink flavored with mint or in a sweet-smelling basil drink.
If fainting occurs during bloodletting and its cause is the removal of much blood, it is necessary that he be given meat broth and thin basil drink, and he should be perfumed with ambergris, and his chest should be rubbed with it, and he should use all that we mentioned in the section on fainting.
which results from vomiting. And as for someone who wants to relieve his arm and to let his blood flow again, it is necessary for someone whose bloodletting was for copious evacuation and whose strength is weak that the blood be let little by little according to his strength on consecutive days.
And as for someone who wants to relieve his arm and to let his blood flow again and whose body is strong, let him do that after seven or nine hours from his first bloodletting. And as for someone who wants to draw the blood from his body to the opposite side to which it inclined, it is necessary that he be relieved on the second or third day.
And as for someone whose blood is abundant, who has become feverish and sharp, and has developed a fever, it is necessary that blood be removed from him at one time and that a large amount be removed, and the incision should be widened until fainting occurs, after you have observed all the conditions of bloodletting. And that you place your hand on his pulse when the blood flows, lest death occur instead of fainting, for that often occurs if the phlebotomist is ignorant and negligence occurs. And it is not necessary, if you want to open the arm and let the blood flow again.
And if the mouth of the vein has closed and the exit of the blood is difficult, do not prick it forcefully or twist it strongly, for that is very bad. Rather, either leave it until you bleed it again, or remove with the blade of the lancet what has congealed of the blood in the mouth of the vein.
Or apply something of salt dissolved in water, or apply something of theriac or  shakhzaniya, and prick it gently until the blood comes out.  If the vein has swollen, leave it.
And do not touch it until the swelling subsides. If the necessity to let blood again arises, then either bleed him above that place, or bleed him in the other arm or in another vein.
As for phlebotomy of the brachial vein, it is bled instead of the basilic and cephalic veins if they are not found or are hidden, because it is composed of them.  Its method of bleeding is that the patient puts his hand in hot water until the forearm reddens and the vein appears clearly, then it is tied above it with a ligature, a little moderately tight.
Then bleed the vein slightly obliquely, neither across nor lengthwise, and let the opening be wide, and your bleeding of it should be a little above the wrist joint. If the exit of blood is difficult, return the hand to the vessel of hot water and let the blood flow into the water.
Until it reaches your need. If you are in the summer days, you may dispense with returning the hand to the hot water.  The practice of letting the blood flow into hot water is mostly done in winter.  And bleeding this vein is safest of all veins. Because there is no major vein or nerve beneath it. As for bleeding the cephalic vein of the right hand, it is beneficial for liver ailments.  Its method of bleeding is that you tie the wrist with a ligature or with your hand after putting it in hot water until the vein swells.
Because there is no major vein or nerve beneath it. As for bleeding the cephalic vein of the right hand, it is beneficial for liver ailments.  Its method of bleeding is that you tie the wrist with a ligature or with your hand after putting it in hot water until the vein swells. And it becomes very perceptible to the touch. Then bleed it slightly obliquely; and even if you sever it entirely, it will not harm him at all. Be careful not to thrust your hand deeply with the lancet, for beneath it are the nerves of the fingers, and the place is bare of flesh. Then return the hand to the hot water.
And let the blood flow in it; for if you do not return it to the hot water, the blood will congeal in the mouth of the vein and prevent its flow. When you have removed the amount of blood needed, apply fat and salt to the vein lest it close quickly.
And similarly you should do with every narrow branch. As for the benefit of bleeding from the left hand, it is beneficial for ailments of the spleen; and you do the same in bleeding it as you did in the second, equally. As for bleeding the saphenous vein, its benefit is for diseases in the lower part of the body, such as uterine ailments.
and suppression of menstruation, and kidney diseases, and chronic ulcers of the thighs and legs, and similar diseases. Its method of bleeding is that he puts his leg in hot water and rubs it until the veins swell, then you tie above the ankle joint with a bandage; and the vein is located at the heel, on the surface toward the great toe.
And many branches extend from it on the front of the leg. Therefore, bleed it in the widest branch of it, or at the heel where it converges; this is best and safest.  If you bleed it on the front of the leg, then beware of the nerves beneath it on the front of the leg.
And make your incision as if you were intending to amputate it, and let the lancet be sharp. If the blood does not come out, then let him return his leg to hot water, and let the blood flow in it until it is emptied. If the phlebotomist misses the vein on the first attempt,
let him try again, bleeding a little higher; for the place is safe, nothing is to be feared from it if you beware of the nerve, as we said. And do the same with the saphenous vein of the other leg, equally. As for the sciatic vein, its place, as we said, is at the heel, on the outer side.
And the benefit of bleeding it is for hip pain, if that is from hot blood.  And its method of bleeding is that you put the patient in the bath and hurry, and you bind his leg from the hip up to above the heel by four fingers’ breadth with a thin, long bandage, for it does not appear except by that.
Then, when it appears, bleed it in any way you can; either by making an incision, which is best, or by amputating it, or by incising it; for its place is safe, and it is very hidden in most people. If you do not find it,
and it does not appear at all to the touch, then bleed some of its branches, which are those which appear on the back of the foot towards the little finger and the ring finger; and beware of the nerves, and let out the amount of blood you want.
Then loosen the binding, and put cotton on the place of bleeding, and bind the place; for it quickly heals.
Chapter ninety-six.
Concerning cupping and its method of use.
Cupping instruments may be made of horn, wood, brass, or glass, and cupping is of two kinds: one is cupping with scarification and the removal of blood, and the other is cupping without scarification.
And this cupping without scarification is of two kinds.
And the cupping of the mastoid processes, which are the sides of the neck on both sides, and the cupping of the chin, which is under the lower jaw from the mouth, and the cupping of the shoulders, and the cupping of the coccyx at the base of the spine, and the cupping of the forearms, which are the middles of the arms, and the cupping of the legs, and the cupping of the heels.
Cupping draws blood from the small veins scattered in the flesh, and for that reason it does not weaken the body as bloodletting does, and cupping, whether with fire or without fire, should not be used in any disease that is due to plethora until the whole body is purged.
If cupping is needed because of illness or custom, we use it at any time, at the beginning of the month, at the end of it, in the middle of it, and at any time whatsoever.
That is because some people, when their blood increases to the point that they need to have it removed by cupping, feel heaviness and headache in their heads; and some feel fullness and redness in their face, head, and neck; and some feel itching in their face and sides, and darkness and pain in their eyes; and some itch in the place of their cupping.
And some laugh a lot, and some find the taste of blood in their mouths, and their gums swell, and they spit blood, and some sleep a lot, and some see blood, redness, wounds, and injuries in their sleep, and things like that.  So when we see any of that...
Especially if it is in the middle third of the month, we then order cupping after two or three hours of the day have passed. As for the benefit of cupping the temples, it benefits from heaviness in the head and water that pours into the eyes.
But it should be after evacuating the whole body. And this cupping may be a substitute for phlebotomy of the cephalic vein.  It is cautioned that it not be used by someone who is cold-brained or has a cold, for it will harm him greatly.
Therefore, the elderly and those with cold diseases in their heads should not use it, and those who use it habitually will develop forgetfulness.
Therefore, you should instruct the barber-surgeon to lower his hand with the cupping glass a little lower, for fear of generating forgetfulness. As for cupping the nape of the neck, it is a substitute for phlebotomy of the basilic and cephalic veins.
Therefore, it benefits from asthma, shortness of breath, rupture of the respiratory apparatus, cough, and fullness.  The cupping of the nape of the neck should be raised a little, for if it is lowered, it will cause weakness in the heart and stomach.
As for cupping the temples, it benefits from pains occurring in the head, ophthalmia, migraine, angina, and toothache. It is a substitute for phlebotomy of the basilic vein. You should instruct the barber-surgeon not to deepen his hand with the scarificator, lest he cut an artery and cause hemorrhage.
As for cupping under the chin, it benefits from canker sores in the mouth, corruption of the gums, and similar diseases in the mouth. It may take the place of phlebotomy of the labial veins. As for cupping the shoulders, it benefits from palpitations that result from fullness and heat.
As for cupping the insides of the forearms, it benefits from what benefits phlebotomy of the three veins—the basilic, cephalic, and median—because it attracts blood from all those small veins in the flesh, and it attracts those small veins from other thicker veins, until the attraction reaches the three large veins.
You should instruct the barber-surgeon not to be excessive in scarification, because the area is sparsely fleshed, and underneath are nerves and arteries. As for the single cupping performed on the coccyx, it benefits from hemorrhoids and lower ulcers.
You should instruct the barber-surgeon that the cupping glass should be large and made of copper, because the area needs strong suction, and a glass cupping glass may break and require much scarification. As for cupping the legs, it visibly reduces fullness.
Because it attracts blood from the whole body, it benefits from chronic pains in the kidneys, uterus, and bladder; it promotes menstruation; it benefits from boils and abscesses; and it takes the place of phlebotomy of the saphenous veins and the veins of the ankles, except that it greatly weakens the body and causes fainting in most people.  The benefits of cupping the ankles are similar to the benefits of cupping the legs.
The method of applying cupping glasses is that the cupping glass is first placed empty and moderate suction is applied. Do not prolong the placement of the cupping glasses, but place them quickly and remove them quickly so that the humors are drawn to the area evenly. Continue to repeat this until you see that the area has reddened and opened.
When the redness of blood appears, then scarify and gently resume suction. Then observe the condition of the bodies. If a person has thin flesh with porous skin, then you should scarify only once, lest the area ulcerate.
Instruct the barber-surgeon to widen the incision and deepen it slightly, and to regulate the suction gently and with a delicate movement. If the blood is thick, then it should be scarified twice: the first time to open a path for the thin, watery blood, and the second time to completely extract the thick blood.
If the blood is very thick, repeat the scarification a third time to achieve the goal. In general, if we want to remove a small amount of blood, we are satisfied with one scarification; if we want to remove a large amount of blood, we make more scarifications, especially if we judge that the blood is thick.
It is necessary to make a deep scarification, and the moderate limit in scarification is the depth of the skin only. What ointments should be used when applying cupping glasses, and what waters, and what the cupped person should avoid. As for someone whose skin is thick, hard, dry, and whose pores are tight,
it is necessary to anoint the places of the cupping glasses with opening, softening, and resolving ointments. If it is summertime, then such as rose ointment, violet ointment, sweet almond oil, or pumpkin seed oil.
And if it is in winter, then such as daffodil ointment, iris ointment, chamomile ointment, or lily ointment and the like. If the waste matter is thick and cold, then let the ointment be marjoram ointment, or wormwood ointment, or mastic ointment, or rue ointment and the like.
If the cupped person has wide pores and soft flesh, then the ointment should be avoided.  These people should wash their cupping sites after cupping with rose water, or cold water, or fox grape water, or gourd water, or chickweed water, and the like. As for someone whose blood is very moist,
he should wash his cupping sites with vinegar, or with water of myrrh and sumac and the like. As for someone whose waste matter is thick, he should wash his cupping sites with old wine, or with marjoram water, or a decoction of rue, or chamomile and the like. Cupping should be avoided in the bathhouse and immediately after the bathhouse.
Rather, it should be done after leaving the bathhouse by an hour or two.  No one should sleep after cupping. What the cupped and bled person should manage before and after cupping.
First, it must be observed whether the cupped or bled person is choleric, and if sharpness and inflammation predominate in his blood, then he should take cooling things like pomegranate and dandelion with vinegar, lettuce, oxymel, and sherbet and the like.  And he should make his foods from the intestines and the flesh of sheep, stews and sour things and the like.
And if his temperament is cold, then he should be given honeyed drinks and quince drinks or seed oxymel, and he should take moderately fragrant wine, that which is between old and new. He should be ordered to eat little, and he should make his food from intestines and intestines and birds, and young pigeons, stews. And the drink on the day of cupping and bleeding should be more than the food.
And it may be necessary to give some people at certain times some of the  Faruq antidote, or musk medicine, or the silthā, before cupping and before bleeding, or after it, to strengthen the principal organs and thin the blood. And it should not be given to those with fever.
As for cuppings which are without a condition, they are the cuppings which are placed on the liver, spleen, breasts, on the abdomen and navel, and the place of the kidneys and hip joint, for these organs do not tolerate a condition upon them, but rather it is desired by them either to draw blood from one organ to another.
Such as placing the cupping glass on the breasts in the case of epistaxis, or we use it to remove a cold humor which has accumulated in an organ, such as placing the cupping glass on the abdomen and navel, for it loosens the organ and warms it and removes the pain by resolving that humor.
And it may be placed on the kidneys if an obstruction or stone appears in them, for by the strength of its drawing it may open the obstruction or remove the stone from its place.  And likewise it acts if it is placed on the liver and spleen when a humor troubles them. And these cuppings may be used empty, by suction only.
And it may be used with fire, and it may be used filled with lukewarm water in cases of phlegm; that is to say, fill the cupping glass, and let it be large, with hot water alone, or with water in which some herbs suitable for this have been cooked.
Then it is placed full on the place and held and removed and repeated several times according to need. And this is the image of the cupping glass which is used with fire:
Its opening should be the width of two open fingers, as we have pictured, and its depth about half a span, and in its side, about halfway up, there should be a small hole about the size that a needle will enter. It is made of Chinese copper or yellow copper, with a thick rim.
Smooth, level, and polished, lest it injure the member when placed upon it; and in its middle there should be a crossbar of copper or iron where the lighted candle is placed. And this cupping glass may be made larger than we have described, or smaller, according to the diseases.
And let the user be skilled, for the cupping glasses of boys and thin people are not the cupping glasses of men and those with full bodies. As for the method of placing this cupping glass with fire on the member, it is to bring a burning wick of tightly woven linen or a small candle of pitch and place it on the middle of the solid rod which is in the middle of the cupping glass.
So that the fire will rise upwards towards the bottom of the cupping glass, lest the body of the patient be burned. Then it is placed on the member, and the finger on the hole which we mentioned, so that when we have held the cupping glass as long as we need, the finger is removed.
And the vapor will come out through that hole, and the cupping glass will adhere to the place. Then bring the wick in the manner described, and repeat it if you need to. As for the cupping glass which is used in the treatment of sciatica with water, it has no solid rod nor hole.
Rather it is used by filling it with water and placing it on the member only. And this is its form:
And this cupping glass, the larger it is to hold much water, the better it is.
Chapter ninety-seven.
On the suspension of the leech.
Leeches are used mostly in those members where cupping glasses cannot be applied, either because of their smallness, like the lip and gum and so on, or because the member is devoid of flesh, like the finger and nose and so on.
And the method of using them is that you should choose leeches which are in fresh, pure water, free from impurities; then leave them for a day and a night in fresh water until they are hungry and nothing remains in their bellies. Then the body is first purged by phlebotomy or cupping, then the affected member is wiped.
Until it reddens, then it is placed upon it; and when it is full, it falls off. And if it is possible to suck the place with a cupping glass, it is more effective; otherwise, wash the place with vinegar, then with much water, and rub and squeeze it.  If the bleeding continues after the leech falls off, and this is a trickle, then let a linen cloth be dipped in cold water.
And place it on top until the trickle stops. If the bleeding is profuse, sprinkle on it powdered vitriol or alum or the like of astringents until the bleeding stops, or apply halved peeled lupins to the place.
And leave it until the lupin adheres to the place, for then the blood will stop.  And it is necessary, if it is needed to reapply leeches, that those leeches not be used if others are available. And if the leeches refuse to attach, let the place be wiped with fresh blood.
Or pierce a needle into the place until some blood comes out, then apply it; for when it senses some blood, it will attach itself.  And if you want it to fall off, sprinkle on it some aloes or salt or ashes, for then it will fall off.
Chapter Three.
On setting (bones).
This chapter also treats of what is needed in the art of medicine, namely, the setting of fractures and dislocations occurring in bones.
Know, my sons, that this chapter is claimed by the ignorant among physicians and the common people, and by those who have never studied the books of the ancients in this field, nor read a single word of them.
For this reason, this art of science has become nonexistent in our country, and I have never encountered anyone at all who was skilled in it. And I have only derived what I have derived from my long reading of the books of the ancients and my diligence in understanding them, until I extracted knowledge of it from them; then I devoted myself to experience and practice throughout my life.
And I have depicted for you in this chapter all that my knowledge encompasses. And my experience has followed it after I have presented it to you, and freed it from the branches of prolixity, and shortened it to the utmost, and clarified it to the utmost, and depicted for you in it many images of the instruments which are used in it.
For it is from the increase of explanation, as I did in the preceding two chapters. And there is no strength except in God, the Most High, the Most Great.
Chapter One.
In it are summaries and compendia concerning the matter of fractured bones, which it is necessary to present. And before we begin to mention the fractured and dislocated members one by one, it is necessary that we mention at the beginning of this chapter a summary of the discourse and sections. It necessitates you first to understand them and to stand upon their reality, you and whoever else is eager to learn this noble craft.
So I say that when a fracture or dislocation or wound or fall occurs to someone, it is necessary first to quickly bleed him or purge him, or both. Unless something prevents it, such as weakness of strength, or the one to whom this has happened is a child or an old, aged man, or the time is extremely hot or extremely cold.
Then restrict his food to cold vegetables and the meat of birds and gazelles, and forbid him drink and thick meats and overfilling with food, and every food that fills the veins with blood, until the swelling is safe and the effusion of material to the location is not expected.
Then let the patient return to his first regimen, according to his custom.  When the broken bone begins to knit, then the patient should eat foods which provide abundant, thick, strong nourishment with viscosity, such as porridges, rice, heads, necks, and tripes of oxen. And eggs and soft fish and thick drinks and the like, for by this regimen the consolidation of the fracture will be quicker and better. And know that broken bones, if they are in strong men and old men, cannot ever unite and heal to their first nature.
Because of the dryness and hardness of their bones.  And it may unite and heal in bones that were extremely soft, like the bones of small children. But nature grows on the broken bone from all its sides something resembling glue, thick and viscous, which adheres to it and tightens it until it binds one part to another.
And it binds one part to another until it comes to the utmost strength and firmness, as it was at first, so that nothing hinders its actions.
For this reason it is necessary to give the patient foods which have solidity, viscosity, and thickness, as we have said. And know that fractures differ in their types according to the difference of the members, for a fracture of the bone of the leg is different from a fracture of the bone of the head, and a fracture of the bone of the chest is different from a fracture of the bone of the back.
And so also all the other members, each differing from the other. And we shall come to the mention of each kind of fracture, explained in its chapter and detailed from the others.  And the kind of fracture of the bone may also differ in itself.
For its fracture may be a splintering without any fragments being produced, or its fracture may be along the length of the bone, and its fracture may have fragments and excrescences, detached or not detached; and the fracture may be with a wound and rupture in the skin; and the fracture may be a slight crack.
And for each kind there is a special method in its setting, as will be mentioned in detail in its place. And among the things by which a fracture of the bone is recognized are its crookedness and swelling and its being perceptible to the touch, and its roughness when you touch it with your hand.
Therefore, when there is no apparent crookedness in the place, nor roughness, nor do you feel any disturbance in the bone upon touching it, nor does the patient feel much pain, then there is no fracture, but it may be a sprain or a slight fracture or a slight crack; therefore you should not move it at all by pulling and probing.
Rather, apply to it from the medicines whose mention will come after a while, what suits the place, then bind it gently. And know that if the bone is broken and split into two without any fragments being produced, yet each part has departed from its fellow.
Then you should hasten at once to straighten and set it before a hot swelling occurs to it.  If a hot swelling occurs to it, then leave it for some days until the hot swelling subsides, then set it in whatever way you are able with gentleness and skill.
And know that its setting and straightening is easier than a bone in which fragments have occurred. Then it is bound as will be mentioned. If the bone has fragments, then it is necessary to pull the broken limb from both sides, whether hand or foot.
Either with your hands if the limb is small, or with two ropes, or with a rope and hand. Let the placement of the limb be on a level surface in its natural shape, so that when the broken parts of the bone are extended, then return those fragments to their places in whatever way you are able with skill and gentleness.
And strive with all your might that you do not cause the patient pain or suffering by your action, and strive with all your might to join one of the bones to its fellow in the best manner. At that time it is necessary to touch and feel them with your hand; if you see something amiss, correct and straighten it to the best of your ability.
And beware of strong pulling and forceful probing, as many ignorant people do; and they often cause by their action a hot swelling or inflammation in the limb, as I have witnessed many times from their actions.
Then, after the setting, perfecting, and binding, keep that limb still and quiet, and warn the patient not to move it during his waking hours and sleep, and when he turns and is restless, and when he has a bowel movement, and in all his movements as much as he is able; and let him strive to maintain the position of the limb in a position where he feels safe from pain.
And that is because if, while the limb is in that position, he feels pain or ache, he should move it to another position where he does not feel pain, and he should strive to make that position level and straight.
Lest crookedness occur in the limb when it is set. As for the method of binding the broken limb, it is as I describe to you. Know that broken limbs differ in their smallness and largeness and forms; those that are small, such as the arm, finger, forearm and the like.
Then it is necessary that the bandages be soft and gentle; and those that are thick, like the thigh, back, and chest, then it is necessary that the bandages be broad and firm, because a broad bandage is needed for a large limb and binds it from every side with equal pressure, so that no defect intervenes.
Then, after you have finished the setting, you begin to apply the appropriate plaster. With a soft pad on the place of the fracture, then begin to wrap the bandage on the fracture itself three or four times, according to what the limb requires, and pull the bandage slightly with your hand, then take it to the upper side of the fracture.
With less tightening than you did to the broken place, then you spread the bandage a little from the place of the fracture, and loosen the tightening little by little until you take from the correct position something suitable, then you take another bandage and wrap it also on the broken place.
Then take the bandage to the lower side of the fracture, and let your action in tightening and loosening the bandage be as we mentioned in the first upper wrap, then place between the bandages from the soft padding or rags what evens out the crookedness of the fracture.
If there is a crookedness, otherwise do not put anything in it, then wrap another bandage around it, then straighten the tight splints on these bandages immediately if there is no swelling or hot inflammation in the limb.
If there is swelling or hot inflammation, then apply something that calms that inflammation and removes the swelling, and leave it for days, then tighten the splints on it then; and let the splints be from wide, carved, skillfully prepared halves of reeds, or let the splints be from sieve wood.
which are made from pine or date-palm stalks or  boxwood or similar materials, whatever is available, and let the width of each splint be in this same way and form.
Except that the splint which is placed on the fracture itself should be slightly thicker and wider than the other splints, and as for the length of the splint, it is made according to what suits the broken limb in its size, Image of the splint:
Then tighten the splints with another bandage in the same way as your first tightening, then tie from above with firm threads according to what we mentioned of the tightening, which is that your tightening should be greater at the place of the fracture. And the further it is from the fracture, the less the tightening.
And the threads should be medium in thickness and fineness, and let them be of wet linen especially, for if the threads are thick, as I have seen done by the ignorant, who make their threads from twisted linen strips, it is a great mistake.
Because the tightening with them becomes excessive, and thin threads are also unsuitable because you do not achieve with them the tightening you want, and there should not be less than a finger between splint and splint.
If the patient is harmed by the ends of the splints after tightening in the healthy places, place soft tow or fluffy wool beneath them so that nothing harms him from that, and as for if the fracture is with a wound and a rupture in the skin occurs, we will mention that separately.
Know that not every broken limb should be tightened with splints from the first day, and that if the limb is large, splints should not be applied to it except after five or seven days or more, depending on your assurance that hot swelling will not occur.
And this is a description of the bandages with which the ancients used to bind fractures, dislocations, and sprains; a description of a general, concise bandage which binds fractures and is suitable for most temperaments, especially children and women, because it is something that is not dominated by heat or cold.
And it is that you take from the dust of the mill, which is the best part of the flour that adheres to the walls of the mill during the movement of the millstone, and knead it as it is without sifting it with egg white, and make its kneading neither thick nor thin, then you apply it.
A description of another bandage which binds fractures, dislocations, and sprains:  Take of mastic, leadwort, acacia, orris root, gum tragacanth, and sugar, ten drachms of each; and of myrrh and aloes, five drachms of each; and of the lote tree, twenty drachms; and of Armenian or Roman clay, twenty drachms. Pound all together and mix with the water of the lote tree, or with egg white if the temperament of the patient is hot, then use this bandage, for it is well-composed, quickly mends broken bones, and is suitable for most people because of its moderation.
A description of another bandage which is also useful for fractures and sprains: Take gum tragacanth, mastic, and white lead, ten drachms of each; myrrh and aloes, five drachms of each; acacia, six drachms; Armenian clay, twenty drachms. Pound all together finely, sift, and knead with water or egg white and use.
A description of a bandage for joints and bones that have left their places, and it soothes the pain affecting them, and for bone splinters and fractures: Take purified wool and dip it in vinegar and cooked oil and place it on the affected area. This bandage does not have the power to set [bones].
But it is excellent in soothing hot swelling and relieving pain especially. A description of another bandage which sets a broken bone: Take the leaves of the black fig and the leaves of wild poppy and pound them together and bandage with them while moist. A description of another brief bandage used when a bone fracture is uniting.
And you want to resolve the rest of the swelling, take of the root of white lead, chamomile, violet flowers, and crushed acorns, one part of each; pound all together and knead it with egg white if the member is not inflamed; if it is inflamed, then knead it with coriander water or with water, and use it.
A description of another bandage stronger in resolving [swelling] than the first, used when a hard swelling occurs when the bone is uniting: Take of the root of white lead, flaxseed, fenugreek, rosemary, marjoram, violet flowers, and chamomile, one part of each.
Pound all together and knead with vinegar water or with fresh water or with egg white, all according to the heat of the member and the stillness of its fever. As for Hippocrates, he did not mention in his book that it should be placed on the broken member when it is set.
Except for the cerate made from wax and oil only, and he described it as being of medium thickness. As for Galen, he saw that things which contain gums with some heat, such as myrrh, aloes, and frankincense, and the like that we have mentioned, should be placed on the broken member when it is set.
A description of a bandage that is useful for weakness and pain: Take of  myrrh,  alum, human hair that is cut or bird feathers, white lead, and salt, equal parts; pound, sift, knead, and bandage with it.  As for the amount that the bandage should remain...
Then it is to be undone: you should observe; if neither pain nor itching occurs in the diseased part, nor does the broken bone move from its place, do not undo it for many days.  If, however, severe itching or troublesome pain or swelling occurs in the place.
Then hasten to undo it at once and do not delay that at all, and remove the bandage from it. Then take a soft rag or a wet sea sponge, dip it in lukewarm water, and wash the place with it until the itching and pain subside, then leave the member to rest for an hour.
Then apply wool moistened in vinegar and oil or rose oil and bind it on for a night, until you are safe from hot swelling and the swelling of the member subsides and its pain goes away. Then return it to gentle tightening and a light bandage, and do not tighten it as tightly as the first time.
And treat it gently until it heals. If you see that the swelling, redness, pain, and puffiness, and all the symptoms have completely disappeared, and you need a bandage and tightening, then prepare it as you did initially, equally. If nothing of what we have mentioned occurs in the member...
...then do not undo it except after three, four, five, or seven days; and it may be left for twenty days; all this depends on what appears to you of the condition of the member, as we said, until the fracture is set and the flesh is about to consolidate upon it.
Then also increase the tightening more than your first tightening, and also increase the thickness of the patient's diet to what was previously mentioned. If you see that the place of the fracture has dried out and become thinner than it should be, then know that nourishment is prevented from reaching it.
Then bathe it with lukewarm water each time you unbind it, and let that be every three days, and loosen the tightening a little. For by this action, nourishment flows to the member and it heals quickly. As for what ignorant bone-setters do, breaking the member again...
...if it is not set properly the first time, and is set crookedly, that is an error in their actions and a great deception. And if it were correct, the early scholars would have mentioned it in their books and acted upon it; and I have not seen any trace of it from any of them at all. And the correct thing is not to do it.
Chapter Two.
Concerning a fracture occurring in the head.
The types of fracture occurring in the head are numerous, its forms varied, and its causes diverse.  Some fractures are caused by a sword blow, and it may either sever the bone completely until it reaches the membrane beneath the bone. Just as the wedge does in wood.
Therefore, this type of fracture is called a wedge fracture.  Alternatively, the sword may cut some of the bone and sever only its surface, without the cut penetrating to the end. This type of fracture is called an absolute extraction, and the wound of these two fractures may be either large or small.
And there are fractures which are comminuted or contused, caused by a blow with a stone, or a fall onto a stone or something similar. This fracture may be penetrating, nearly reaching the membrane beneath the bone, or it may be on the surface of the bone.
The wound of these two fractures is also either large or small. And there are fractures which are hidden in the bone, fine as a hair, a slight crack.
Therefore, this type of fracture is called hairline.  There is also a fracture caused by a fall or blow from a stone or the like, which drives a part of the bone inwards, causing a depression in the area, like what happens to a copper pot when struck, causing part of it to cave in.
This most often occurs in the soft bones of the head, such as the heads of children. All these types of fractures may have loose and non-loose fragments. We will describe the treatment of all of these in their proper place, and we will identify all these types of fractures by examining them.
And examining them with probes and removing the corrupted flesh from them. As for the hairline type, it is identified by examining the bone, wiping it and applying ink to it; the fracture will appear black. As for the treatment of fractures, first look to the patient's symptoms.
If you see symptoms that clearly indicate danger, such as vomiting bile, distension, loss of consciousness, loss of voice, fainting, high fever, sunken and reddened eyes, and similar symptoms, do not approach the patient or treat him, for death is inevitable with these symptoms in most cases.
If you see symptoms that do not alarm you and you hope for his recovery, then proceed with his treatment.  If the injured person comes to you immediately after the injury, and this is during the winter.
Then you should strive to remove the bone before the fourteenth day in any case.  And if it is in the summer, then you should hasten to remove the bone before the seventh day, before the membrane under the bone is corrupted and those symptoms we described appear.
If the fracture of the bone has reached the membrane covering the brain and there is crushing and bruising, then you should cut away the crushed and bruised part as I describe to you, which is that you shave the head of the injured patient.
And uncover the bone in whichever way is possible for you and according to the shape of the wound and what is easiest for the patient. If, when you uncover the bone, you find bleeding or a hot swelling, then treat it accordingly.
This is to pack the area with cloths soaked in a potion and rose oil, and clean the wound until the swelling subsides and the bleeding stops. Then begin to drill out and extract the bone, which can be done in one of two ways.
As for the first way, it is to cut the bone with a fine saw with a narrow blade.  This is its image:
Then use another saw after this one, slightly wider. This is its image:
Then also use another saw, wider still than the second.  It is necessary that you have several saws of different sizes, some wider than others, and some shorter than others. They should be extremely sharp and made of Indian steel or good quality tempered steel.
Use gentleness in applying the saw, lest you shake the head and injure it. If the bone is strong and hard, it is necessary to drill around it before using the saws, with the drills called non-penetrating drills.  They are called non-penetrating drills.
Because they do not go beyond the bone of the skull to what is beyond it, for the drill has a round edge below its sharp head, similar to a small ring or circle, preventing it from penetrating and going beyond the thickness of the bone.
You should have many of these drills, each suitable for the thickness of the bone, so that for every skull you have a drill whose sharp end is appropriate in length and shortness to the thickness of that skull. This is an image of three types. of drills: large, medium, and small.
As for the method of drilling around the fractured bone, you place the drill on the bone and rotate it with your fingers until you know that the bone has been penetrated. Then you move the drill to another place, making the distance between each hole about the thickness of a gimlet or similar.
Then cut between each two holes with the saw, doing so with the utmost gentleness as we have said, until you remove the bone, either with your hand or with some other instrument that you have prepared for this.
such as forceps and fine hooks. You should be very careful that the drill or saw does not touch any of the peritoneum. If the bone is removed and freed from the peritoneum, if it was attached to it, and you remove it, then it should be cleansed.
And smooth the roughness of what remains of the bone with another instrument similar to the saw, except that it should be thinner and finer than the other saws. If any small bones or fragments remain, remove them gently with the instruments at hand.
Then treat the wound afterwards with sutures and ointments, which will be mentioned. As for the other method of treatment, it is a very easy method, far from risk, which Galen mentioned and highly praised.  This is what he said: First, you should begin by exposing the part of the bone where the fracture is most severe and obvious, until, when you have exposed that part, you place under it the tip of this lenticular saw, and this is its image:
Its lenticular part should be smooth so that it does not cut anything, and its sharp part should be on its long sides, as you see, so that the lenticular part rests on the peritoneum and the face of the sharp saw on the bone. Then saw on one side only.
With a small hammer, until you cut through all the bone gently, as it turns, and you are safe from the membrane, so that nothing frightening happens to it at all, even if the surgeon is the most ignorant and cowardly of people, yes, even if he were asleep.
If any part of the membrane remains attached to the bone in some places, scrape it off with the tip of the lenticular saw itself and carefully free it, for it will be freed without injury or fear.
But if the bone fracture has not penetrated to the membrane, and what has been broken is the surface of the bone, and roughness and small fragments remain in it, then you should remove that roughness and extract those fragments with fine forceps, of which various sizes have been made, so that you can use in each place the most suitable and best ones, according to what the work leads you to.
And the fractured bone itself and its shape, and you should first use the widest of those forceps to scrape the bone, then use a finer one after that, and continue to do so successively until you come to use the finest and thinnest of them all.
As for the other small, hair-like cracks and slight fractures, you should use for each one a treatment according to what leads to its healing; this is something which is not hidden from anyone who has the slightest skill in this craft and has understood what we have written and explained about large fractures.
If the membrane remains exposed when you extract the bone, you should take a linen cloth the size of the wound and dip it in rose oil and place it over the opening of the wound, then take another folded or triangular cloth. And dip it in a syrup and rose oil and place it on the first cloth, and do this as gently as you can so as not to weigh down the peritoneum, then use a wide bandage on top, and do not tighten it except to the extent that it only holds the wound.
And leave it with this treatment for a day or two until you are certain the acute inflammation has subsided, then unwrap it and after that use medicines with drying properties, such as iris roots, crushed costus, crushed spikenard, zedoary, and the like; you should make powders from these medicines.
And sprinkle them dry on the wound; in general, use a medicine that cleanses and does not sting, and strive during your treatment of the wound to keep it clean, free from grease or dirt, and do not allow pus to collect in it at all.
Because if pus collects on the membrane of the brain, it spoils and putrefies it, causing great harm to the patient; and this may occur in the peritoneum of the head when the bone is exposed, especially if its treatment is neglected.
If blackness appears on its surface, and the patient exhibits the symptoms we have mentioned, know that he will inevitably die; but if the blackness resulted from a medicine applied to it, and it was in the nature of that medicine to cause that blackness.
Then you should take one part honey and three parts rose oil, mix them well, and apply them to a cloth, then place it on the peritoneum and treat it with the appropriate types of treatment until it heals.
Chapter Three.
On the setting of a broken nose.
Know that only the upper two parts of the nose, or one of them, can be broken, because they are bone; as for the lower part, it is cartilaginous and does not break, but rather it is subject to bruising, crookedness, and flattening.
If one of its parts is broken, you should insert your little finger into the nostril and set the fracture from the inside with your index and thumb from the outside, until you restore the nose to its natural shape.  Let this be done gently, being careful not to cause the patient pain.
If the fracture is at the top of the nose and your finger cannot reach it, it should be set with the end of a slightly thick probe. If the fracture is on both sides, do the same.  And let him be treated on the first day of the fracture.
If possible, otherwise after seven or ten days, when the hot swelling has subsided. Then insert a tent of linen cloth into the nostril if the fracture is on one side, or two tents if the fracture is on both sides.
Let the tents be thick enough to fill the nostril. Some early bone-setters mentioned moistening the tents with fat and changing them daily, but I do not see this as necessary; rather, the tents should be moistened with egg white mixed with mill dust.
Then leave the tents until the bone sets and the cartilage hardens.  Goose quills, wrapped in soft cloth, may be inserted into the nose at the site of the tents; this will hold the nasal fracture more firmly and prevent the patient from being unable to breathe.
This is not necessary; you may do it if you wish, or you may make tents instead. If hot swelling appears in the nose during your work, apply a compress of linen or cotton soaked in vinegar and rose oil, or some diachylon ointment.
If no hot swelling appears, you should dress it externally with fine semolina and finely ground myrrh, mixed with egg white, then place a soft bandage over it. Do not bind the nose at all if the nasal bones are only slightly fractured.
Or if they are shattered, you should make an incision over them and remove the fragments with the appropriate instrument, then suture the incision and treat it with suitable ointments that promote healing. If a wound occurs inside the nose, you should treat it with tents and use lead tubes. until it heals.
Chapter Four.
On the setting of lower jaw fractures.
If the lower jaw is fractured and the fracture is not accompanied by a wound, then if the fracture is only external and has not broken into two pieces and is not depressed inwards, its detection is easy.
If the fracture is in the right ramus, you should insert the index finger of the left hand into the patient's mouth; and similarly, if the fracture is in the left ramus, insert the index finger of the right hand and gently elevate the fractured fragment from the inside to the outside.
With your other hand on the outside of the bone, you control and manipulate its alignment. If the jaw fracture is broken into two pieces, then traction should be applied from both sides to achieve alignment until you are able to set it. If it has affected the teeth, they will loosen.
Or they become separated, then tie those you expect to remain with a gold, silver, or silk thread. Then, apply a compress to the fractured jaw, then place a folded cloth over the compress, and over the cloth apply a tight, large splint or a piece of leather the length of the jaw. Then tie it from above as you see fit to bind it and support the setting so that it does not become dislodged. Instruct the patient to remain quiet and still, and give him soft liquids as food. If you suspect that anything has changed in terms of alignment, proceed to untie it on the third day.
Then tie it from above as you see fit to bind it and support the setting so that it does not become dislodged. Instruct the patient to remain quiet and still, and give him soft liquids as food. If you suspect that anything has changed in terms of alignment, proceed to untie it on the third day. Then repair the dressing with mill dust mixed with egg white or semolina flour after removing the compress.  Place a soft poultice over the dressing. As long as the dressing adheres and the bone's condition does not change, leave it.
Do not remove it until it heals and the fracture is consolidated. This fracture often consolidates in three weeks. If a hot inflammation occurs during that time, use what we have repeatedly mentioned to alleviate it until the swelling subsides.
But if the fracture is accompanied by a wound, observe whether a bone splinter or splinters have become separated from the bone.  Gently remove these splinters with whatever instrument is suitable for their removal. If the wound opening is narrow, widen it with a scalpel as needed.
Then, when you have removed the splinters and none remain, suture the wound if it is wide; otherwise, apply one of the ointments suitable for this purpose. And stitch the wound until it heals.
Chapter Five.
On the treatment of a fractured clavicle.
The clavicle is most often fractured anteriorly at the acromial end, and the fracture may be one of three types: it may be fractured into two pieces without splintering, which is the easiest to treat.
Or the fracture may be comminuted, which is more difficult to treat; or the fracture may be accompanied by a wound.  If the fracture is without a wound, the procedure is as follows: have two assistants, one to hold the arm adjacent to the fractured clavicle, and the other to extend the neck to the opposite side.
Then set the fracture with your fingers until it is properly aligned, without any prominence or angulation. If further extension is needed, a ball of rags or wool should be placed under the patient's armpit.
The size of the ball should suit your needs. Extend and elevate the clavicle, and press the ball with your hand until the fracture is properly aligned. If you cannot pull the end of the clavicle outwards because it has been driven inwards, the patient should lie on his back.
A moderately sized pillow is placed under his shoulder, and the assistant presses his shoulder downwards until the inwardly displaced clavicle is elevated. Then set and align the fracture with your fingers.
If you feel that a fragment of the clavicle is broken and mobile, you should incise over it and gently remove the fragment. If the fragment is embedded in the bone, try to cut it with one of the instruments prepared for this purpose. After placing under the clavicle the instrument that protects the pleura, which is made of wood or iron, and this is its image:
It resembles a spoon without a bowl.  Its width should correspond to the size of the bone, large or small, and its length should also be according to what is convenient for the operation. Let it have two ends, as you see, one wider and the other narrower.
If the wound made when removing the bone fragment is wide and you are sure there is no hot inflammation, then close the edges of the wound with sutures. If the wound is small, or you fear hot inflammation, treat the wound with lint and bandages appropriate to the size of the incision.
If hot inflammation occurs, wet the lint in rose oil and vinegar or wine and apply it. As for setting a bone without a wound or incision, apply a plaster made of mill dust and egg white. Place a soft pad over it, then place a ball under the armpit if necessary. Then take a bandage that is very long, about a cubit wide, then apply a folded compress over the pad and plaster, then take a splint of thin wood. Let its width be three fingers, and its length likewise. Then insert it into a cloth, then insert that cloth with the splint into the part of the bandage that lies over the fracture, then tighten the bandage over the fracture as you go around. And pass it over the neck and under the sound armpit and under the affected armpit, and pass it repeatedly on each side, however you see that the tightening firmly fixes the fracture, which is not hidden from you.
The whole point is that the splint does not move from the broken bone. Therefore, you should check on the patient every day; whenever the bandage loosens and you see that the splint has moved, correct that and tighten the bandage. Then have the patient sleep on his back, and place a small pillow under his armpit when he sleeps at night.
So that his arm will be raised from his side, and the clavicle fracture will be raised with the elevation of the shoulder, or tie his arm to his neck, and do not untie the bandage unless something happens in the area, such as itching or swelling, until twelve days.
Then renew the dressing if you see a reason for it. Return to the binding and leave it until the clavicle fracture heals and consolidates, and it becomes stronger and firmer; this happens in about twenty-eight days. And in some people, it may be in less than that.
Chapter Six.
On the treatment of a fractured humerus.  The humerus rarely fractures in its wide part; rather, it fractures at its extremities.  When a part of it is fractured, or it is fractured in its middle, this is known by touch.  Therefore, the treatment varies depending on the nature of the fracture.
Set it and restore it to its natural shape in every way possible, then apply to the area mill dust with egg white and soft lint. Place over it a pad of folded cloth, and then apply a wide splint of wood.
A splint as wide as the entire shoulder or slightly wider. If, under the splint, there is a bump in any part of the shoulder, smooth that bump with soft lint until the splint lies evenly, then bind it tightly from above with a long bandage.
Bind it firmly and make sure the splint does not move from its place. Check the bandage every day; whenever the bandage loosens, tighten it and reposition the splint if it has moved. Let the patient lie on his healthy side, and the shoulder will heal in twenty [days].
days or twenty-five days.  When this time is complete, remove the bandage, for you are safe. For it is among the bones which one does not fear will be shattered or dislocated. If a fragment of bone protrudes and is irritating under the skin, incise over it and remove it. And do what was mentioned in the fracture of the clavicle to soothe the hot swelling, if anything of that should occur.
Chapter Seven.
On the setting of a fracture of the chest.
The chest may be fractured in its middle, and this rarely happens; but its extremities are more frequently fractured and shattered. Among its symptoms, if its middle is fractured, is that it inclines downwards, and there occurs severe pain, difficulty in breathing, and coughing.
And sometimes blood is expelled, and the depression in the fractured bone becomes apparent and is not hidden from the touch.  Its treatment is that the patient lies on his back, and a pillow is placed between his shoulders; then his shoulders are compressed, and the ribs are brought together by the hands from both sides, and gentleness is employed in straightening it in every way possible.
And continue until the shape of the bone is restored as it should be; then apply a bandage and a splint, and place over it a splint of a thin, light board of willow or elm, or similar, after wrapping it in a cloth. Then gently bind it to the fractured bone lest it move; and pass the bandage around to the back several times, and tighten it firmly; then examine the bandage frequently, and whenever it loosens, tighten it.
And if necessity demands its removal because of suppuration occurring at the site, or pain, or swelling, then hasten to remove it, take off the bandage, and treat what has occurred by its appropriate treatment; then reapply the bandage if you see fit to do so. And treat it in this way and keep it firmly bound until it heals.
Chapter Eight.
On the setting of ribs if they are fractured. Know that fractures of the ribs occur in the thick parts which are next to the back, and their extremities in front are subject to contusion because they are cartilaginous; and the knowledge of this is not hidden from the sense when examined with the fingers.
And its treatment is that you set the fracture with your fingers in the accessible manner until the shape is even as it should be; then you bandage and bind the fractured bone with a splint if it needs that.  If the fracture of the ribs is oblique inwards, then intense pain occurs to the patient.
And it pierces like the piercing which occurs to someone with a wound of the pleura, because the bone pierces the diaphragm, and also shortness of breath, coughing and the ejection of much blood occur to him. This is difficult to treat, and the ancients devised many methods for it.
And some of them said it is necessary to give the patient foods which produce flatulence and wind, so that the abdomen becomes distended and expands and the fracture is pushed outwards. And we dislike this lest it should confirm the occurrence of hot inflammation if it has not occurred; and if it has occurred then it increases and confirms it.
And some of them said a cupping glass should be placed on the place, then sucked strongly; and this is more like the correct method, except that it is feared that the cupping glass will draw impurities to the place in its weak state. And some of them said it is necessary to cover the place with wool which has been dipped in hot oil.
And make a bandage between the ribs until it is full, so that the binding is even when you wrap it round, then treat the patient with the treatment of a wound, with regard to food and medicine, if a severe matter which he cannot bear overwhelms the patient. And the bone pierced the diaphragm a harmful piercing, and we feared for the patient, so it is necessary that we make an incision at the place and uncover the broken rib, then we place under it the instrument which protects the peritoneum, which has been described previously, and we cut the bone gently and remove it.
Then we bring together the edges of the wound if it is large with stitching, and we treat it with ointments until it heals. If a hot inflammation appears during this, then act quickly, moisten bandages in rose oil, and place on the place, and treat the patient with that which calms the inflammation internally also.
And he lies on the side on which sleep is easier for him until he recovers.
Chapter Nine.
On setting the vertebrae of the back and neck.
As for the bones of the neck, if a fracture affects them—and this rarely happens to them, and what most often happens to them is a bruise, and likewise the vertebrae of the back also—if this happens to someone and you want to know whether he will recover or not. Then look; and if you see that his hands have become relaxed, numb, and dead, and he is not able to move them, nor extend them, nor contract them, and if you pinch them or prick them with a needle, he does not feel it, nor does he find any pain in them, then know that he will not recover in most cases; he is dying.
And if he moves them and feels the pinching and pricking in them, then know that the marrow of the bone is safe and that the patient will recover with treatment. If the vertebrae of the back are similarly affected and you want to know whether he will recover or not,
look at his legs; and if you see that they have become relaxed and what happened in the hands has happened in them, then if he lies on his back, wind and feces come out involuntarily, and if he lies on his stomach, urine comes out involuntarily. And if he lies on his back and wants to urinate, he is unable to do so, then know that he is dying; do not trouble yourself with his treatment. If nothing of that happens to him, the matter is less serious.  The treatment for what has happened is that you seek to alleviate the hot swelling.
By placing on the injured vertebra rose oil alone, or with roasted egg yolks, applying it three times a day, until the hot swelling subsides; then apply to the place one of the strengthening, drying compresses, and bind it tightly, and instruct him to remain still and quiet.
And he should not sleep except on the side where he feels no pain, until he recovers. If, at the time of the injury to the bone, a splinter or something has broken off from it, then it is necessary to incise the skin and remove that bone. Then bring together the edges of the wound if it is large, with sutures, then treat it with healing ointments until it heals. If the last bone of the coccyx, which is the tailbone, is broken, then you should insert the thumb of the left hand into the rectum.
And set the broken bone with the other hand, as much as you can manage and the setting allows, then apply the compress and splint if you need to, then bind it.
If you feel a broken splinter in it, then incise it and remove it, and treat the wound with the previously mentioned treatment until it heals.
Chapter Ten.
On the setting of a fractured hip.
Hip bones rarely fracture; but if they do fracture, it is in such a way that their ends are shattered, they split lengthwise, and they incline inwards. The patient experiences pain in the affected area, and numbness and weakness in the leg on the side of the fracture.
Its treatment is that you pass your hand over it until you ascertain the nature of the fracture. If the fracture is only at the ends, then set that fracture as well as you can, so that it resembles its natural form.
If the fracture is lengthwise, or if it has inclined inwards, lay the patient on his stomach so that you can set the fracture. When you have set it, apply a bandage, then apply a splint of wood or leather and bind it tightly.
Do not fear that the fracture will shift or that the splint will come loose. Fill the hollows of the hips with padding so that the binding is even. Instruct the patient to lie on his back or on his healthy side. If hot swelling occurs,
desist from setting and binding it until the hot swelling subsides. Apply what will alleviate it, as previously described, then return to setting and binding it properly. If there are fragments or shattered pieces of bone at its ends, they should not be removed.
They should not be touched, but smoothed from the outside as we have said, and the binding should be left in place until it heals.
Chapter Eleven.
On the setting of a fracture of the humerus.
The humerus is that which is between the elbow and the head of the shoulder. If it is fractured, it is set in one of two ways. One is to take a smooth, curved stick of medium thickness, in this manner:
And you tie two bandages to its ends, then it is hung from a high place and the patient sits on a chair, then his broken arm is placed on the stick until his armpit is stuck in the middle of the curve of the stick, then something heavy is hung from above it.
Or a servant stretches it downwards, then the physician sets the fracture with his hands together until he returns the fracture to what is appropriate. The other way is that the patient lies on his back and his hand is hung from his neck with a bandage.
Then you order two servants, one to hold above the fracture with his hands and the other to hold below it, and each stretches to his side. And if you want the stretching to be stronger, then tie below the fracture with a bandage and above it with a bandage, and each of the servants stretches them to his side.
If the fracture is close to the end of the shoulder, then the middle of the bandage should be under the armpit and the other under the fracture towards the elbow.  Likewise, if the fracture is close to the elbow, then the bandage should be in that place and on the elbow itself.
Then you set the fracture gently without violence until the fracture is set as it should be and unites well. Then you bandage it if no hot swelling appears. If hot swelling appears, then leave bandaging until the seventh day and place on it a moistened soft cloth soaked in vinegar and rose oil.
Until the swelling subsides, then bandage it. The method of bandaging is to place the dressing on the fracture, then place a bandage of new cloth on the dressing, then bind the arm to the humerus itself and place his hand open on his shoulder.
And you apply the cloth and bandage to the humerus and forearm so that the forearm acts as splints if nothing prevents you and nothing changes in the broken bone. If you fear that something will change, then use splints.
And that is to place on the fracture itself a splint that is wider and stronger than the other splints, and let there be the width of a finger between each splint. And let the length of the splints be according to the fracture with an increase of three fingers on each side.
Then you bind the splints with the binding that I mentioned at the beginning of the chapter.
And that your binding on the place of the fracture should be tighter.
And the further from the fracture, the less tight the binding. If you see the placement of the splints and the binding as we said when you set the limb at the time, then do so.
And if you fear a hot swelling, leave off the binding and splints until the seventh day, as we said. Then examine the bandage every three days, lest there be itching or swelling in the place, or the nourishment be prevented from reaching the limb because of excessive tightness; then correct all that as we have mentioned.
But if you are confident that none of that will happen, then do not loosen the bandage except after many days. And let the patient lie on his back, his hand on his stomach, and a cushion filled with wool should be placed under the armpit, moderately.
And examine at all times, night or day, lest the shape of the broken limb be disturbed or the bandage loosened; then correct all this with your effort. And make the patient's food according to the order we presented, that it be mild at first, until the bone begins to strengthen.
Then it is necessary to increase his food. For it is the nature of the arm and leg to strengthen in forty days; then it is necessary to loosen [the bandage], and he should use the bath and be treated with ointments suitable for this.  If the fracture is severe and comminuted,
then do not loosen the bandage from him until fifty days or two months.
Chapter Twelve.
On the setting of a fracture of the arm.
The arm is composed of two bones, called the ulna; one is small, which is that next to the thumb, and the other is large, which is situated below the small one from below.  So perhaps the larger ulna is fractured alone, or the smaller one alone, and perhaps they are fractured together.
And when the smaller upper ulna is fractured, then its setting is easy and its healing is quicker. And when the lower ulna is fractured, then its fracture is bad and its healing difficult. And the worst is if the two bones are fractured together.  If the bone which is fractured is the smaller upper ulna,
then it is necessary for the physician, when setting it, to make its extension easy gently until he straightens it. If the large ulna is fractured, then it is necessary to make its extension stronger. And if both ulnae are fractured, then it is necessary to make the extension much stronger.
And it is necessary that the shape of the hand, when it is set and extended, be extended on a cushion, and the thumb of the hand should be above, higher than all the fingers, and the little finger should be lower than the rest of the fingers, and the patient should sit squarely on himself.
And let the cushion be opposite him in height, lest the patient should suffer difficulty.
Then a servant extends the arm from below, either with his hand or with a bandage, and another servant extends from above likewise. Then the physician straightens the bone until he restores it to the best shape he can. If there are fragments in the fracture of the bone, then they are removed.
Restore each fragment to its place to the best of your ability. If a fragment appears detached and it pierces the skin, and there is no hope of setting it, then incise upon it and remove it in the manner which we have mentioned previously. If the fracture is accompanied by a wound, then it has been given a separate chapter.
Then take its treatment from there. If a hot swelling appears at the beginning of your setting, then apply a cloth with kypros prepared with rose oil and white wax, and let it be moderate between thickness and thinness, and bind the cloth upon it gently until the swelling subsides.
Then remove the kypros and apply the prepared bandage of mill dust with egg white. Then apply the splints; and let the splint which is placed upon the fracture itself be somewhat wider and stronger. And know that the number of splints for the arm is six in most instances.
Whether the fracture was in one forearm bone or in both forearm bones together, then make your binding at the location of the fracture stronger and tighter. And whenever you turn the binding upwards or downwards, make the binding somewhat looser, as previously mentioned at the beginning of the chapter.
And let the cloths which are wrapped around the fracture be soft and moist, and not very hard. And let the thread with which it is bound be of special linen, moderate between thinness and thickness, as we have described. And examine the limb and the binding after a few days.
If something happens that needs to be corrected, such as an itching that appears in the limb, then the limb should be bathed with warm water until that itching subsides.  And the limb should be left unbound for a night so that it may rest, then the binding should be resumed.
If the binding has loosened and the bone has shifted or something like that, then repair all of that with your best effort. And also look, if nourishment is prevented from reaching the limb because of excessive binding, then it should be loosened a little and left for some days until nourishment flows to it, then bind it.
If nothing of what we have mentioned occurs to the patient, then it should not be unbound except after twenty days or so.  Then suspend the patient's hand to his neck, and let his arm be straight. He should carefully avoid agitated movements and sleep on his back.
And know that this fracture of the arm heals in thirty days or in thirty-two, and perhaps it heals in twenty-eight days; all that according to the conditions of temperaments and conditions of strength.
Chapter Thirteen.
On the setting of a fracture of the hand and fingers.
Fractures rarely occur in the metacarpus and phalanges of the fingers; rather, contusions frequently occur.  Therefore, when a fracture or contusion occurs in the hand…
The patient should sit cross-legged with a chair directly in front, level with him.
Then he should place his hand upon it, extended. Then the bonesmith should extend the broken bones and the physician should set them, until they are well-set. Then a bandage and a splint should be applied, unless a hot inflammation occurs. Then a further splint should be applied on top, according to the location.
And it has been inserted into a soft cloth.  If the fracture is towards the lower part, towards the palm of the hand, then make a kind of ball from a cloth and instruct the patient to grasp it with his broken hand, then bind it tightly with a long cloth.
Let the splint be of soft leather, so that it conforms to the skin with the flexion of the whole hand, and bind it as necessary. If the fracture is towards the outside, then the splint should be placed above and another below in the hand, so that the hand is open and straight.
Then the binding should be applied as the hand turns, and the fingers should be interwoven with the bandage. If the fracture affects one of the finger joints, if it is the thumb, then it should be set properly and then bound with the hand.  And if you wish, you can make a small, upright splint to support the fracture.
And it should not move. If the fracture is to the other fingers, such as the middle, index, little, or ring finger, then they should be set and bound with the healthy adjacent finger, or all bound together, which is better, or a small upright splint should be placed on them.
As we said for the thumb, and examine during and after your setting for hot inflammation, and treat it appropriately whenever anything of that occurs, as has been repeatedly described.
Chapter Fourteen.
On the setting of a fractured thigh.
The thigh bone is frequently fractured and is easily apparent to the touch, because it moves forwards and backwards.  Its setting is by tightening a bandage above the fracture and another bandage below the fracture, the patient lying on his stomach.
Then each bandage is extended to its side moderately. This is if the fracture is in the middle of the bone; but if it is near the head of the thigh, then it is necessary to tie a soft bandage, either of wool or the like.
At the head of the thigh towards the groin, so that the extension is upwards, and the other bandage below the fracture.  Similarly, if the fracture is near the knee, let the bandage be near the knee, so that the extension is downwards. Then the physician straightens the bone with both his hands until he restores it to its natural form.
And the bone unites well. Then it is necessary to apply the bandage and tightening, if no hot inflammation occurs in the limb. But if inflammation occurs, leave it for several days until the hot inflammation subsides, then return to its treatment.
As for its tightening, it is necessary to wrap a firm, wide bandage twice or three times around the fracture, and what remains is left. Then the leg is twisted until the heel is at the head of the thigh, and a long thread is passed between the thigh and the leg near the knee from below, and the ends of the thread are brought up from both sides.
Then you wrap around the leg and thigh what remains of the bandage. Then you place splints on the thigh at the site of the fracture itself, and you place one splint on the bone of the leg. Then you fill the gap between the thigh and leg with soft rags so that the tightening is even.
Then begin with strong tightening from the middle at the site of the fracture, three or four turns.  And the further the bandage is from the site of the fracture, the less, softer, and looser your tightening should be.
Then take the ends of the thread that you inserted between the thigh and leg, and tie with it the splints that are above. Then pass the ends of the thread downwards until you reach the heel of the foot, and with them also tighten the ends of the splints on the other side.
So that the bandage does not move from its place. Then leave the tightening as it is as long as no pain, swelling, or puffiness, etc., occurs in the limb. If any of that happens, quickly untie it and correct whatever occurred, as we have repeatedly mentioned.
If there is a sharp fragment of bone, it should be straightened if possible. Otherwise, incise over it and remove it, and treat the wound as previously mentioned until it heals.  This fracture of the thigh may be tightened without the leg being added to it with splints.
As we mentioned in the humerus and forearm, except that its treatment in this way does not result in lameness for the patient. But if it is treated alone without the leg being added to it, the patient will necessarily always be lame.
Know that the thigh heals in fifty days, or a little more or less, all that according to the differences in temperaments and other conditions.
Chapter Fifteen.
On the fracture of the kneecap.
Fracture of the kneecap rarely occurs, but it is often bruised. If a fracture does occur, it is either a crack or a shattering into pieces; and this occurs with or without a wound.
You will ascertain all this by touch, and you will set it by aligning the separated parts with your fingers until they are joined and united, as far as careful and gentle manipulation allows. Then apply a bandage and a circular splint if necessary.
Then tighten the appropriate bandage above, and treat all the conditions we described in other fractures, such as hot swelling and so on, by counteracting each symptom with what is suitable for it, until it heals.
Chapter Sixteen.
On the treatment of fractures of the leg.
The leg has two bones; one thick, called the tibia, and the other thin, called the fibula.  They are subject to the same types of fracture as the bones of the arm. Therefore, its treatment is the same as that of the arm, and the procedure is identical. If both bones are fractured, the leg is displaced in all directions; if the thinner bone is fractured, the leg is displaced forward; and if the thicker bone is fractured, and this happens lower down, this is something that will not escape your notice.
So use extension, reduction, and splinting accordingly; however, if the leg fracture is severe with many fragments, the extension should be gentler and lighter, and you should take great care in its treatment.
In treating the leg, there is something additional to what is done for the arm: when you have set the bones and completed the procedure, take two splints of pine wood, such as are used for smoothing rooms, placed between the cracks in the boards, or made from palm leaves or similar material.
Choose those of moderate thickness, not too thin, and let their length be that of the leg from the knee downwards. Then wrap each one twice with a cloth lengthwise, and place one on each side of the leg.
Let them extend from the knee to the bottom of the foot, and then bind the splints in three places: at both ends and in the middle.  With this support the leg is prevented from tilting to either side, and is held firmly in place. A wooden gutter, the length of the leg, may also be used.
It is placed in this to keep it from moving, and this is especially necessary in fractures complicated by a wound. Then examine the leg daily and give it the utmost care in case of swelling, inflammation or other complications. If any of these occur, treat them appropriately until healing is complete.  A leg fracture heals in about thirty days.
Chapter Seventeen.
On fractures of the bones of the leg and toes.
As for the heel, it is never fractured; as for the bones of the leg, they may be fractured; and the toes are also seldom fractured, but are usually bruised.
If a leg bone is fractured and you see that some bones overlap, have the patient stand with their foot straight on the ground, then place your foot on the elevated portion of the bone and press down to realign it.
Until they return to their places, then apply a bandage and splint from above, placing a small board with two flat ends under the sole of the foot; then bind the foot firmly after wrapping it with cloths and whatever else is needed.
If three or four days pass, untie the bandage, and you will find the bones straight, whether they were broken or dislocated.  The procedure is as you see.  If any of the toes are broken, set and align them according to what I described for setting the fingers of the hand.
Then make a splint for the broken toe, the length of the toe and slightly wider, then place the board I described under the foot and bind it firmly. If two, three or more bones are broken,
make a splint for each toe of the appropriate size, layered in soft cloth, and bind the board to the bottom of the foot, with each end of the board extending beyond the sole of the foot for a good hold.
And you should not forget to treat all that we mentioned to you in other fractures with the symptoms we mentioned, and treat each symptom appropriately.
Chapter Eighteen.
On the fracture of the woman's pubic bone and the man's penis.
When a woman's vulva is fractured, seat her cross-legged, then gently bend her backward.  Let her be held from behind, then let the midwife pack her vulva with cotton until it is full and forms a ball inside her vulva.
Then the woman is shaken and her buttocks raised little by little.  The cotton will then emerge until it is like a ball at the entrance of the vulva and the fractured bone will return to its place. Then place a pad on her back; when she wants to urinate, remove the cotton gently so that she may urinate.
And return it in the manner in which it was first inserted, then she returns to her original position. Do this for seven days or so, for it will heal.  And if you wish, take a sheep's bladder, tie a tube to its mouth, and insert the whole bladder into her vulva.
Then blow forcefully into the tube until the bladder inflates inside the vulva; the fracture will then return to its place. Then pack it with cotton and leave it as described until it heals. As for when the pubic bone of a man or woman is fractured, use this method for its treatment.
And treat it as described for the hip bone. The correct treatment for these unusual fractures, which rarely occur, especially for someone with some experience and who understands this book well, will not be hidden from you, because the fracture itself will guide you in most cases.
Understand the correct way to set and bind it. As for the penis, if it is fractured, take a goose's windpipe and insert the penis into it, then apply a bandage of cloth, bind it, and leave it for three days or so until it heals.
Chapter Nineteen.
On the treatment of bone fractures when accompanied by a wound.
Whoever suffers a fracture with a wound, especially if the bone is large, such as the femur or humerus or similar, should immediately be bled if the conditions for bloodletting, as we have previously mentioned, are met.
If the wound is bleeding, you should immediately stop it by applying powdered alum if nothing else is available, then proceed to set the fracture that same day and do not delay.
If no hot swelling occurs, then if hot swelling does occur, postpone setting it until the ninth day until the hot swelling subsides, and do not approach it at all on the third and fourth days, for it exposes it to bad consequences.
If the fractured bone is protruding through the skin and exposed, you should gently try to reduce and realign it with your hands with slight extension; and if you cannot reduce and realign it with your hands, reduce it with this instrument, which is an instrument made of iron, seven or eight fingers long. And its width is according to the wound.
Therefore, the physician should have three or four of them, according to his need for treatment in each type of fracture, and let them be round, with a little thickness so that they do not bend when pressed during use.
And let the end be sharp, with a curve at its end, and let the upper part be thicker, and from its middle to the lower part much thinner.  And this is its image:
And it is called in Greek *peron*, meaning a small lever.  Its sharp, curved end should be placed on the end of the protruding bone, and push it gently until, when the bone returns and is somewhat aligned, you finish aligning the ends of the fracture with each other.
If the broken end is thin and the instrument does not grasp it well, then the end of that bone should be cut until the instrument can grasp it. If you are not able to reset the bone as we described at all, then cut it with a similar cut to those we mentioned.
Or saw it with one of the saws, however you can, then remove any roughness and thin scales remaining on the bone. If, after resetting it, the patient feels severe, harmful pain, then know that the bone has not returned to its natural position.
If you are able to return it to its natural position, then do so, for you will greatly benefit the patient. When you have finished setting the bone, dip a cloth in a black astringent drink, especially if it is summer, and do not apply any ointment or anything containing fat to the wound.
Lest putrefaction and corruption occur in it. Then, apply the splints when you have finished setting the bone, and leave the wound uncovered by cutting a hole in the bandages with scissors, to the size of the wound.
And beware, with all caution, of tightening the wound with the fracture, for many ignorant physicians have done this, causing their patients either death, or gangrene, or tetanus.  Let your tightening be gentle, loose, unlike the tightening of other fractures.
If the wound is bad, or a large wound, and you fear some of the bad symptoms we have described, and he feels disturbing pain in the place, then you should not apply splints. Make him bandages from strong cloths in the place of the splints and bind it with them.
If after a day or two you see that pus is beginning to form in the wound, remove the cloth that you placed on it with the drink, then use the lint and ointments with which we are accustomed to treat wounds, such as the four-ingredient ointment and the like.  You should loosen the bandage.
And examine the wound every day, evening and morning, until it heals and mends. You should position the limb so that the pus flows down easily. If many days pass and the wound does not heal, nor the pus cease, then know that there are small bone splinters.
Then you should probe the wound; whatever of those splinters is loose, extract and remove it. Whatever is not loose, and is piercing the limb and causing pain, then work at cutting and extracting it in every way you can.
If the wound shows signs of inflammation, gangrene, or another type of corruption and putrefaction, then you should counteract each symptom with the appropriate treatment previously described in its chapter.
And what you should pay attention to and keep in mind is that if a large bone is broken and protrudes from a limb, such as the thigh bone, the humerus, and similar large members, do not attempt to pull it or remove it. For death often results from such an attempt. Rather, leave it until it putrefies; perhaps it will fall out on its own after twenty or thirty days.
Then treat the wound if you see a place for treatment; otherwise, leave it.
Chapter Twenty.
In the treatment of the complication which occurs after some fractures.
This complication often occurs after the healing of a fracture, especially those near the joints; it makes the limb unsightly and may prevent it from performing its natural function.
Observe; if the complication is fresh, use astringent drugs such as aloes, frankincense, myrrh, gum mastic, acacia, and the like. Take some or all of these and mix them with an astringent syrup, or with egg white, or with vinegar.
Apply it to the complication with a bandage and bind it tightly. Leave the bandage undisturbed for many days, then unbind it and reapply another, until the complication disappears, God willing. Or, bind a tight lead plate to it.
For lead has the property of removing all that is superfluous in the limbs. If the complication has become hardened and severe, and removal is necessary, incise it from above and cut away the protruding excess, or shave it off with some instrument until it is gone.  Then treat the wound until it heals.
Chapter Twenty-One.
On the treatment of a fracture if it has healed, but the limb remains thin and not as it was originally.
If a bone fracture has healed, and the limb remains thin and weak, this is due to many causes. One reason is excessive loosening and tightening of the bandages, or excessive tightening of the bandages such that nourishment is prevented from reaching the limb, or excessive and repeated manipulation, or excessive movement at the wrong time, or a deficiency of blood and weakness in the patient's body.
The treatment for this is to nourish the patient and enrich his body so that his blood increases; use of baths and inducing joy and happiness in him and the like; then applying pitch to the limb so that the pitch draws much nourishment to it, or repeatedly massaging it with lukewarm water. until nourishment flows to it and it returns to its natural form.
Chapter Twenty-Two.
In the treatment of fractured bones which have been set crookedly and prevented from functioning properly.
If, after a limb has healed, a crookedness or a protrusion of the fractured bone, or a complication appears, and the appearance of the limb is thereby disfigured, unless the limb is prevented from its natural function, then one should not accept the opinion of those who claim that the limb should be broken from the head, even though many ignorant physicians and bone-setters in our country used to do so.
And this action is utterly reprehensible, leading to great harm, the least of which is disability; but if the crookedness and complication are recent, then it should be softened with water in which emollient herbs have been cooked, such as mallow leaves and roots, vervain, and the like.
And it should be bandaged with emollient bandages, such as well-made diachylon, or the sap of mallow root should be taken and beaten with chicken fat and lard and bandaged with it, or ripe figs should be taken and pounded with pigeon droppings and similar things, among the medicines called resolvents.
And sometimes the complication will resolve with constant gentle rubbing by hand, and the movement of the limb in every direction at all times should be used; but if the crookedness has become established and hardened, and treatment with iron is required,
then it should be incised above and the connection of the bone released, and whatever remains of the complication or bone should be cut with fine cuts, and gentleness should be used with effort and care, then the wound should be treated as previously mentioned until it heals.
Chapter Twenty-Three.
A dislocation is the displacement of a joint from its place; it impedes movement, disfigures the limb, and causes the patient severe pains and aches.  If a dislocation occurs, one should immediately attempt to reduce it.
One should not delay at all, for if he delays, the place will swell and become inflamed, making it difficult to reduce the dislocation. Therefore, one should not delay, nor move, nor stretch it while it is swollen, because this often causes the patient spasms and harmful pain.
But if this occurs, one should immediately bleed the patient, then wait until the swelling subsides somewhat. Then bathe the limb with warm water and oil, and gently reduce it, treating each limb as described in its place.
The chapters on dislocations are also arranged, as with fractures, from the top of the body to the bottom.
Chapter Twenty-Four.
On the treatment of dislocation of the lower jaw.
Dislocation of both jaws rarely occurs.  Their dislocation happens in one of two ways: either they are slightly displaced, relaxing a little, or they are completely dislocated, relaxing fully. towards the chest, so that the saliva of the patient flows and he cannot retain it, nor can he close his jaw, and his tongue stumbles in speech.  But if the dislocation is slight, in most cases it returns of its own accord very easily.
But if the dislocation is complete, then it is necessary to hasten its reduction quickly and not delay it at all. This is done by having an attendant hold the head of the patient, and the physician inserts the thumb of one hand into the base of the jaw inside his mouth, if the jaw is dislocated on one side.
or he inserts both thumbs if the jaw is dislocated on both sides, and the rest of his fingers from the outside, leveling them, and he orders the patient to relax his jaw and release it to go to every side, while the physician levels the jaw and pushes it until it returns to its place.
If its reduction is difficult, especially if both jaws are involved, then use fomentations with hot water and oil until their reduction is facilitated, and do not delay their reduction at all, as we said.  Then, when they have returned and are aligned, and the mouth of the patient is closed and they are not relaxed, then apply to them pledgets of cloths with a paste made from wax, oil, and rose water.
Then bind it gently with a loose bandage, and let the patient sleep on his back with his head elevated between two pillows, lest he move it to the right or left, and let him not strain to chew anything, but let his food be soft gruel.
Until the pain subsides and the jaw is set, then let him eat whatever he wishes, and let him use it gently and not force the opening of his mouth when eating, drinking, or yawning until the jaw is set and healed.
If the reduction of the jaws is difficult, if they become dislocated at some time and do not return to their places, then fevers and persistent headaches often result from this, and perhaps the patient's abdomen will become distended, and perhaps he will vomit pure bile. If you see this, then know that it is corrupted.
And many die from what has befallen them in ten days.
Chapter Twenty-Five.
In the reduction of the clavicle and the tip of the shoulder.
As for the clavicle, it does not dislocate from the inner side because of its connection to the chest.  It may dislocate to the outside, and this is evident to the touch. Its treatment is that the patient lies on his back and extends his arms.
Then press the place with your hand strongly, so that it returns. Then apply a bandage and padding and bind it. As for its end which is towards the shoulder and connected to it, it rarely dislocates. If it should dislocate sometime, it should be reduced and set as we have mentioned and as may be possible for you.
Then apply a bandage, padding, and binding, and instruct the patient to maintain rest and stillness until it heals. With this same treatment, the tip of the shoulder is reduced if it also leaves its place.
Chapter Twenty-Six.
In the reduction of the shoulder joint.
Know that the shoulder dislocates in three ways: one, that it dislocates towards the armpit downwards; the second, that it dislocates towards the chest; and it may dislocate above the shoulder, but this happens rarely.
It does not dislocate to the rear because of the shoulder blade, nor does it dislocate to the front because of the nerve; it most often dislocates and protrudes downwards towards the armpit, especially in those whose flesh is thin, for in them it quickly goes out and quickly goes in.
But as for those whose flesh is abundant, it is the opposite, I mean that it goes out with difficulty and goes in with difficulty.  Sometimes a blow or a fall may happen to some people, and the shoulder swells with a hot swelling, so they think that it has dislocated.  It is necessary to examine that until you ascertain its truth.
Then you proceed to its treatment. The dislocation is recognized if it is downwards towards the armpit; if you compare between the dislocated shoulder and the sound shoulder, you will find a clear difference between them, and you will find the head of the humerus distorted and under the armpit, on palpation, the head of the humerus like an egg.
And the patient is not able to raise his hand to his ear, nor to move it in all movements.  Similarly, if it dislocates towards the chest or upwards, you will find that clearly apparent to the touch, it is not hidden.
And this dislocation is easily reduced if it is recent or if the patient is a child. Its reduction is that a servant raises his hand upwards, then you place the thumbs of your hands under his armpit and raise the joint forcefully upwards to its place, and the servant raises his hand and extends it upwards.
Then he lowers it downwards, and it returns quickly. If it does not return by what we have mentioned, and the dislocation has been for many days, then the patient should bathe in hot water and use things that relax and soften, such as cooking marshmallow root, fenugreek, and rue in water, and use them.
Then the patient lies on his back, and you place under his armpit a ball of wool which is moderate between softness and firmness, then the physician places his heel on the ball and holds the patient's hand with his hand and extends it downwards.
And he pushes the ball with his foot, then it returns to its place. And if you wish to reduce it in this way, it is that you bring a taller man than the patient and stand him on the side, and he puts his shoulder under the patient's armpit and raises his armpit upwards until the patient is suspended in the air. And another servant pulls the patient's hand downwards towards his stomach. If the patient is light, then something else should be hung on him to weigh him down, then the jaw returns immediately. And it may also be reduced in another way.
And that is to fix in the ground a long piece of wood, the head of which is round in shape like the pestle of a mortar, neither thick nor thin, then it is placed under the patient's armpit after placing a soft cloth on the head of the wood, and the patient standing along the length of the wood.
Then you extend his hand downwards from the other side, and he also extends his body from the other side with force, then the joint returns to its place quickly. If it is difficult to reduce it by all that we have mentioned, then use this treatment: that you take a piece of wood about two cubits long. And its width is about four fingers and its thickness about two fingers, it has a round head to facilitate its entry into the depth of the armpit in this manner:
Then a soft cloth is tied to the round head lest the wood hurt the patient, then it is placed under the armpit, and the whole hand and arm are extended on the wood downwards, and the wood is tied to the upper arm, forearm, and hand.
Then the arm is placed on a crossbeam.  The crossbeam is placed horizontally, and the hand is extended downwards, and the rest of the body is left hanging from the other side, then the joint enters immediately. If it enters in any way possible, then a moderately sized ball of wool should be placed under the armpit.
Then the prepared bandage of mill dust, frankincense, and egg white is applied to the whole shoulder as it circles from above, then the ball is tightly bound under the armpit, and the bandage is wound over the bandage from above, and his hand is hung to his neck.
He is left without moving his hand for seven days, and the patient's food should be light so that the limb may strengthen, for this is quicker for its healing. Then, after seven or five days, it is unbound and exercised; if it is firm and does not relax, then it is healed.
If the joint dislocates repeatedly due to dampness or some other reason, then cauterization with three cautery irons should be used, as described in the chapter on cauterization. If all this has been done and the bandage is removed after seven days and the joint is not stable,
the bandage and binding have been repeated many times and it has not become stable, and it has fallen and relaxed and you cannot raise it upwards, then know that the nerve in the head of the humerus has been severed, or stretched, or relaxed, then know that the joint will never remain in place.
As for the dislocation which is towards the chest and breast and to the rear, its reduction is by pushing and pulling with the hands until it returns, and all the binding and treatment is used until it heals. If, after healing, there is stiffness in the limb and slowness in movement,
let the patient use the bath many times until that stiffness softens and returns to its former nature.
Chapter Twenty-Seven.
In the treatment of dislocation of the elbow.
The elbow joint is difficult to dislocate and also difficult to reduce; it is dislocated in all directions, especially forwards or backwards.  Its dislocation is not hidden from you, because it is under sight and touch, whichever way it is dislocated.
And if you compare the dislocated elbow with the sound one, that will be clearly apparent to you by the deformity of the joint; and he cannot bend the arm nor touch his shoulder with it. And you should hasten to reduce the dislocation immediately, before a hot inflammation occurs.
For if a hot inflammation occurs, reduction is difficult, and perhaps it will never heal completely; especially if the dislocation is backward, for that is the worst of all types of dislocation and the most painful, and frequently death follows.
And its reduction, if it is of a kind that can be reduced, is that an attendant extends his hand with both hands and his arm extended, and the physician's hands above and below the elbow, and he pushes the joint with the thumbs of both his hands, or with the base of his palms, until it returns to its place.
But if the dislocation is forward, it may be reduced by bending the hand sharply until the base of the hand strikes the corresponding shoulder; and if the dislocation does not return, use strong traction, that is to say that two attendants extend the arm.
And two attendants also hold the patient, lest he move during traction; then the arm is rotated to every side, after wrapping a folded cloth or wide bandage around his hand. And when the physician touches the joint with his hands, he should anoint them with oil, so that it helps in moving the joint easily.
Then he pushes the joint strongly until it returns; and after its return, a bandage containing compression and desiccation, with egg white, should be applied tightly, and the arm is suspended from the patient's neck, and it is left for several days.
Then it is untied; and if the joint is firm in its place, untie the bandage from it and leave it. And if you see that the joint is not strengthened sufficiently, then reapply the bandage and leave it also for several days until it is strengthened, then untie it.  And if swelling occurs after the return of the joint and its unbinding,
and there is difficulty in movement, then use moistening in the bath and gentle massage and rubbing until it softens; or place on the joint a ram's testicle, then bind it and leave it on for a day and a night, then remove it and put him in the bath; and when he sweats, massage the joint moderately.
Then reapply the testicle once, twice, and three times, with the bath, until it softens. And if you wish to apply moist, light cow dung with fat and bind it on, do that several times, for it softens and returns to its former state.
Chapter Twenty-Eight.
On the treatment of a dislocated wrist.
The wrist often dislocates, and its reduction is easier than that of other joints; however, one should hasten to reduce it at the time it dislocates, before the place becomes swollen or hot swelling appears.
To reduce it, place the patient's wrist on a board, and let an assistant extend the arm.  The physician should place his hand on the prominence of the joint and push until it returns; however, he should observe whether the dislocation has shifted towards the palm of the hand.
Let the patient place the back of his hand on the board during extension and reduction. If the dislocation is prominent towards the back of the hand, let him place the palm of his hand on the board so that the physician's hand falls on the same prominence of the joint. If it returns immediately, well and good; otherwise, bind it with a bandage which soothes the swelling.
Leave it and do not manipulate it again, for it will not tolerate it, and you will not be able to reduce it after several days have passed, except that the joint will remain crooked, and this will not harm the patient except insofar as the hand will become weak and unable to grasp anything.
Then you will know that the nerve has been severed or bruised, and there is no remedy for it except cauterization, which may or may not be effective. When the wrist has been reduced, apply the bandage we have described, and then bind it tightly and leave it for five days.
Then unbind it and exercise the hand. If its movement is difficult or there is any stiffness, soften it with warm water and massage repeatedly until it becomes supple.
Chapter Twenty-Nine
On the treatment of dislocated fingers.
Fingers may be dislocated in any direction. If a finger is dislocated towards the back or palm of the hand, extend the finger and push the dislocation with your thumb until it returns to place. Then bind the end of the finger and suspend it towards the direction in which it was dislocated.
Leave it for two days, then release it and extend it until it is straight that day. If it is night, bind it in the same manner; continue to unbind it during the day and exercise it with movement, and bind it at night. Do this for several days until it strengthens.
Do the same if it is dislocated towards the palm of the hand; bind it towards that same direction and do as you did before until it heals.  Do likewise if it is dislocated in any other direction.
Chapter Thirty.
On the treatment of the dislocation of the vertebrae of the back.
If a vertebra of the vertebrae of the back or neck is dislocated, a complete dislocation, or many vertebrae are displaced from their positions, there is no treatment for it, for death quickly comes to the patient.
The sign of this is that the patient's stool is passed involuntarily, he cannot restrain it, and often some of his limbs become relaxed, either his legs or his arms, or one of them. But if only one vertebra is displaced from its place, it often returns on its own.
And its displacement is in four directions; that which is displaced backwards is called a hump. As for its treatment, you should look: if the hump has occurred since childhood, there is no treatment for it and no cure at all.  But that which has occurred from a fall or a blow, and the like...
For the ancients mentioned it with various treatments in lengthy descriptions, most of which are of no benefit. I have summarized from that what suffices, a little for much of what they presented, by drawing closer to the meaning and explaining it, and I have depicted the instrument differently from what they explained and described.
I say that the hump which occurs in the front of the chest has no remedy and no cure, and so also that which is to the two sides. Only that which occurs in the back is treated, specifically with what I describe, which is to stretch the patient on his face.
on a level bench near a wall, and spread a wet mat beneath him so that his chest is not hurt, then place an upright wooden post fixed in a hole in the ground at the end of the bench towards his head, and another wooden post towards his feet at the other end of the bench.
And a servant holds the wooden post, and let it not be fixed in the hole, and another servant holds the other in that manner. Then wrap around the chest of the patient and under his armpits with a soft, tight bandage, and extend the end of the bandage to the wooden post at his head and tie it there.
Then tighten with another bandage above his hips and above his knees and at his ankles, then gather all the bandages and tie them to the other wooden post at his feet. Then each servant pulls his wooden post with the bandage, and the two wooden posts do not move from their fixed positions.
Except that they are not fixed, as we said. And the physician places his hands on the hump with force until it returns, or he places a board on it, then he leans on the board with his feet until it returns. If it does not return with this treatment, then take a board whose length is about three cubits.
And dig in the wall, which we said should be near the patient, a place into which the end of the board is inserted, then place the middle of the board on the hump, and the physician places his feet on the other end and pulls strongly until he presses the hump.
And it returns to its place. And if you wish to make it with a screw that is twisted by hand, it is that you plant in the ground at the head of the patient at the end of the shop two wooden posts, their length being a cubit, and at his feet at the end of the shop also two wooden posts.
Let the distance between each post be a span. And a hole is made in each post through which the screw passes. And all the wood is firmly fixed in the ground so that it does not move at all. And insert a round rod, which is the screw in which the bandage is twisted, into the holes of the two posts.
And at its end is a hole in which a rod a span long is fixed by twisting. And in the other two posts the same. Then tighten the bandage which you tightened on the chest of the patient in the screw which is at his head, and the bandages which you tightened on his legs in the screw which is at his feet.
Then a servant stands at each screw twisting his hand with the handle with which the screw is twisted, and the physician straightens the hump as we have explained. And this is a picture of the screw, the shop, and the patient:
Then, after the vertebra returns and the place is straightened, it is necessary to apply a drying compress with egg white, then lint, then place on top of the compress a splint of wood whose width is three fingers or thereabouts, and whose length is as much as the length of the hump.
And on some sound beads, then it is bound with the appropriate bandage, and the patient uses light food until he recovers. If some protrusion remains in the place at the end of healing, then it is necessary to use medicines that relax and soften, along with the use of the splint which we described for a long time.
And a lead plate may be used for that. And a protrusion may appear at the end of the vertebrae of the back, and it may be thought to be a dislocation, and it may be an extra bone that has protruded.  Do not treat it with this treatment, for perhaps death may result.
Chapter Thirty-One.
In the treatment of the dislocated hip.
Know that the hip joint and the shoulder joint are only subject to dislocation, and are not subject to what happens to the other joints of slight displacement and depression, and the hip joint dislocates in four ways.
That is because it dislocates inwards, outwards, forwards, and backwards, and it most often dislocates inwards, and rarely forwards or backwards.  And the sign of its dislocation inwards is that if you compare the sound leg of the patient with the affected one, the sound leg will be longer.
And the knee will be more flexed than the sound one, and the patient is not able to bend his leg at the groin, and the area near the groin will be clearly swollen because the head of the femur has gone there.
And the sign of that which is dislocated outwards is that its symptoms are the opposite of these symptoms. And the sign of that which is dislocated forwards is that he extends his leg completely, except that he cannot bend it without pain in the knee, and if he wants to walk he cannot do so forwards.
And he retains his urine, and his groin swells, and when walking he puts his weight on his heel. And the sign of that which is dislocated backwards is that he cannot extend the knee, nor can he bend it before bending the groin, and his leg is also shorter than the other.
And the groin is relaxed, and the head of the femur is clearly at the position of the loin. As for the reduction of the types of this dislocation, you should look; if the dislocation is old, has lasted a long time with its owner, and no one has attempted to reduce it, and it has remained in its state, then there is absolutely no treatment for it.
Then it should not be treated. As for that which is recently dislocated, and whatever its type may be of the four types of dislocation, then hasten to twist the joint and extend it inwards and outwards, and move it to the right and left, perhaps...
it returned and did not need any other treatment. If it does not return in this way, then you should prepare a strong, capable assistant who extends his leg from below, either with his hands or with a bandage tied around his leg above the knee, and another assistant who extends him from above.
so that he puts his hands under his armpits, then he tightens with a soft bandage on the root of the thigh, and another third assistant holds the end of the bandage, and the extension is either from the front, from the side of the groin to the side of the clavicle, or from behind to the side of the back.
And their extension is all at once until the patient is raised with his body from the ground and remains suspended.  For this type of extension is a common type for the four types. If the dislocation returns as we said, otherwise, each type needs what I mention of special treatment.
As for its specific reduction, if the dislocation is inwards, then the patient should lie on his sound side, then a bandage is applied to the root of the thigh between the head of the thigh and the place under the groin.
Then the bandage is extended upwards from the groin to the upper body towards the clavicle, then another strong, capable assistant takes it with his arms and embraces the thick part of the affected thigh and extends it outwards with a strong pull, then it returns to its place.
And this type is easier than the other types of treatment by which this member is reduced. If it is difficult for you and it does not respond to this type of treatment at all, then you should bind the patient's legs together with a strong, soft bandage on the heels and on the knees.
And the distance between each one and its partner is four fingers, and the affected leg is extended more than the other by two fingers. Then the patient is suspended by the head from a wooden beam in the house, and its distance from the ground is two cubits.
Then you order a strong boy to embrace the head of the thigh, and another boy hangs onto the patient, and the other boy embracing the thigh pushes strongly, then the joint returns to its place quickly. As for its specific reduction if the dislocation is outwards.
Then the patient should lie on the bench as we described for the hunchback, and the bandage is tightened on his affected leg in particular and on his chest. Then two pieces of wood are placed, one at his feet and the other at his head, then an extra piece of wood is placed in the middle of the bench, very firmly secured.
A wet cloth is wrapped around it so that it does not harm the patient, so that the wood is between his thighs so that he does not be pulled downwards when stretched. Then each servant pulls towards his side and the physician adjusts the hip with his hands; if it responds to reduction.
Otherwise, place the board on him and press it down as we mentioned in the case of the hunchback, except that the patient should lie on his sound side. And if the dislocation is forward, then the patient's leg should be extended once while he is in this same position on the bench.
The physician places the palm of his right hand on the affected groin, then presses it with the other hand, and with that he makes the pressure extended downwards towards the knee. And if the dislocation is backwards, then the patient should not be extended downwards.
And it is raised from the ground, but rather it should be placed on something firm, as it should also be from the dislocation of his hip outwards, according to what we mentioned of his lying on the bench and he is on his face and the bandages are tight.
As we said before, and the pressing with the board should also be used on the place to which the joint has gone out.  Then, if the hip joint is completely reduced as it should be—and the sign of its reduction will not be hidden from you—which is that you extend the patient's legs.
Then if you see them even and the patient bends and extends the leg without difficulty, know that the member has returned as it should.  Then, join the thighs and apply the bandage, and bind it with a turban tightly so that the hip does not move in any direction.
And the patient must remain still for three or four days. Then untie the bandage, and compare the leg with the other. If you see them equal in size, know that the fracture has healed, so release the patient to walk. And if you see in it some relaxation…
then return and bandage it and tighten it according to your first tightening, and also leave it for three days, then untie it, and he should walk slowly on it for days until it strengthens, God willing.
Chapter Thirty-Two.
In the treatment of a fracture of the knee.
The knee dislocates in three ways: inwards, outwards, and downwards – that is, backwards; it does not dislocate forwards at all.  And the sign of its dislocation is that you order the patient to bring his leg to his thigh.
If it does not adhere to the thigh, then know that the knee is dislocated. And the treatment for all types of its dislocation is that you seat the patient sitting with his legs extended if he is strong enough for that, and a servant sits behind him to hold his waist and twist him slightly backwards, then you sit on his thighs.
And you place your back against his face and place his leg between your legs, then you grasp his knee with your hands and interlock them with your fingers on his knee, then you press with your hands on the sides of his knee forcefully, and another servant extends his leg until the knee returns to its place.
And the sign of its return is that the leg adheres to the thigh softly and without force. Then bandage it and fasten the leg to the thigh, then bind them both together with a bandage for three or four days, then release them. And he should only do a little walking for some days until it strengthens.
If it is difficult for you to return it by what we described, then use strong traction with the bandages that I previously described in the treatment of the hip until it returns.
Chapter Thirty-Three.
In the treatment of a dislocated heel.
The heel may be slightly dislocated, or it may be completely dislocated.  Its dislocation is either inward or outward.  The sign of its dislocation is that you see the heel swollen and prominent in the direction in which it was dislocated.
As for the treatment of its slight displacement, it is easy to reduce it.  This is done by gently extending it with the hands and straightening it until it returns.  As for its treatment if it is completely dislocated, then it is necessary that you seat the patient sitting, and a strong servant holds him from behind his back at his waist.
Then you grasp his foot with your right hand from above, and with your left hand from below the foot at the place of the heel bone. Then pull the foot towards you with your right hand, then with the left twice, then extend it with the left and push the front of the foot with the right towards the leg without violence.
Do this twice as we described, then push the front of the foot to the leg on the third time while you pull on the heel. If it returns in one or two times in this manner and you see the foot straight, otherwise repeat the process, for it will return.
If it refuses to return by what we described, then lay the patient on his back on the ground, and plant a firmly fixed stake in the ground so that it falls between his thighs, having wrapped a cloth around it lest it harm the patient, then a servant should hold his thigh.
Then another servant extends the leg, either with his hands or with a rope that he ties around the neck of the leg. Then each servant extends in opposition to the pull of his companion, and the stake stands between the patient's thighs holding it so that his body does not slip downwards during extension, then the physician sets the joint with his hands.
And another servant holds the healthy leg below, for the joint returns quickly.  When the joint returns and you see that its return is correct, apply the bandage and splint and fasten it with tight bandages and bind the foot with a bandage below.  It is necessary to protect the nerve which is above the heel from behind.
Lest the bandage be too tight and harm him. Then leave it for two or three days. If the bandage loosens, tighten it, then release it on the third or fourth day.  The patient must abstain from walking for forty days.
If he attempts to walk before this time, you cannot be sure that the joint will not dislocate again and be ruined, and will not then accept treatment. If a hot swelling appears, then you should use what we previously described in another place for treatment and soothing until it disappears.
Chapter Thirty-Four.
In the treatment of the dislocation of the toes of the foot.
You should set what has dislocated with a gentle pull without force; this is not difficult, but easy. If the dislocation is in some of the joints of the instep, then the patient should place his foot on a level surface of the ground.
Or on a board while he is standing as if walking; then you place your foot on what is dislocated from those joints and then press down on it with your foot strongly until it returns and you see that it is straight and no prominence appears in the place.
Then place under the sole of his foot a board which takes the whole foot and has two ends, then bind it tightly and firmly for three days, then unbind it and keep him from walking for many days until it strengthens and you are safe from recurrence, God willing.
Chapter thirty-five.
On the types of dislocation which occurs with a wound or with a fracture or with both together.
When something of that happens and you attempt its treatment and setting, it often results in death.
Therefore, no one should undertake the treatment of such a thing except one who is skillful in the art, long experienced, delicate, gentle, careful, not rash nor impetuous, and that he should use in the beginning only those medicines which calm hot swellings and leave the patient alone.
As for the rest, O Lord, except what you hoped for its safety from harm, with the mildness of the disease and some hope appeared to you in it, then return it from its place at the first, before the hot swelling occurs.
If the limb returns to what you intended, then use the treatment which calms hot swellings and treat the wound with whatever is suitable for it from drying ointments; if the dislocation is with a fracture and there are separated splinters in the bone, then remove them. And follow in that what we mentioned in the simple diseases, what preceded in their places.
And strive your best and refrain from entering the path of danger, as I advised you before; that is more lasting for your reputation and safer for your honor, God willing.
