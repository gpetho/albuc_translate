The first chapter on cauterizing the head with one cauterization.
This cauterization is beneficial for excess moisture and coldness on the brain, which are the cause of headaches, frequent catarrh from the head towards the eyes and ears, excessive sleep, toothache, throat aches, and in general, for every disease that arises from coldness, such as paralysis, epilepsy, muteness, and similar ailments.
The method of this cauterization is that you first order the patient to vomit using a purgative medicine that cleanses the head for three or four nights, depending on the patient's strength, age, and habit. Then you order him to shave his head with a razor, then sit him cross-legged between your hands, having placed his hands on his chest. Then you place the base of your palm on the base of his nose between his eyes. Where your middle finger ends, mark that place with ink. Then heat the olive-shaped cautery, which is like this:
Expose from the bone the size of a toothpick head or the size of a cherry pit, then lift your hand. Otherwise, repeat with the same iron or another one if it has cooled down, until you see the bone as I mentioned to you. Then take some salt, dissolve it in water, soak cotton in it, place it on the spot, and leave it for three days. Then apply cotton soaked in ghee and leave it on until the burn from the fire disappears. Then treat it with the quadruple ointment until he recovers, God willing.
They have said that the longer the wound remains open and suppurates, the better and more beneficial it is.
Some have mentioned that the skin should be cauterized to the bone, and the cautery should be held until some of the thickness of the bone is burned. Then the burned part of the bone is scraped, and then treated.
Others have said that the cauterization should be exaggerated until it has a strong effect on the bone, so that something like a carat or a small disk falls off the bone. They claimed that it vents the vapors of the head from that place, and the wound is left open for a long time, then treated until it heals.
I do not see these two types of cautery at all except in some people, and by way of risk, and leaving it is better in my opinion. And safety, if it exists, is because the head weakens when its natural connection is severed, as we have seen in other organs, especially when the patient's head is naturally weak. The first type of cautery is safer and better in my opinion, and I use it, so work with it, and you will be safe, God willing.
