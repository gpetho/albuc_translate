On the method of cauterizing for dropsy.	On the cauterization of dropsy.	0.7720779
Cautery is only applied in cases of ascitic dropsy specifically.	The cautery is particularly effective in ascites.	0.66013694
When treating a dropsical patient with the previously described treatments and they prove ineffective, you should then cauterize with four cauteries around the navel, one cautery on the stomach, another over the liver, one on the spleen, two on the back between the vertebrae, one opposite the chest, and another opposite the stomach. The depth of the cautery should be close to the thickness of the skin.	When you have, without effect, treated a dropsical person with the various measures mentioned in the section on diseases, you should sear with four cauterizations around the umbilicus, and one over the stomach, another over the liver, and another over the spleen, and two behind his back between the vertebrae, one at the level of the breast and one at the level of the stomach; and let the burn be almost skin-deep.	0.856181
Then leave the cautery site open so it may discharge pus over a long period.	Then keep the burn open so that it suppurates for a long while.	0.7969558
And do not abandon treatment for the patient after the cautery; it is necessary to combine two aims, and healing will hasten with Godâ€™s help.	Do not let the patient, after cauterization, be without the necessary treatment, so that you combine both methods for him, and a cure will speedily come to him.	0.6711233
The shape of the cautery used for the abdomen should be nail-like, as previously described, and the one used for the back should be olive-shaped, as previously specified.	The cautery with which his belly is cauterized should be claviform like the figure previously given; while the one with which his back is cauterized should be olivary.	0.7994898
