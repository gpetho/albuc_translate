On the extraction of a vein from the leg.
This vein is found in the legs in hot regions such as Ategi in the land of the Arabs and in the hot and dry lands of India, where little soft tissue exists and no grass or trees grow.
It is also easily found in other parts of the body besides the legs.
Its formation is due to putrefaction under the skin, just as snakes, worms, and scarabs form within the body between the skin and the flesh.
A sign of its presence is a severe inflammation in the leg, followed by blistering at the site, and then the vein begins to emerge from the blistered area like a root from a plant.
When the tip appears, wrap a piece of lead weighing one or two drachms around it, and let the lead hang from the leg.
Each time a part emerges, wrap it with lead and tie it off.
If it is very long, make an incision in part of it and wrap the rest. Do not cut it close to the root until it is fully out, as cutting it too early will cause it to retract into the flesh, leading to abscess, rot, and a bad ulcer.
Thus, it should be treated gently and extracted little by little until it is completely out, leaving nothing behind in the body.
In some men, this vein has reached a length of five, ten, or even twenty palms.
If it is incised during treatment, insert the rod into the wound and puncture it along the length of the body until all the material is evacuated. Treat the area for a few days with medicines that counter putrefaction, then heal it as you would an abscess.
Sometimes this vein has many branches, especially when it appears at the joint of the foot or in the foot itself, where it emerges through many openings, with each opening giving rise to a branch.
Treat it as described above, following the steps mentioned.
