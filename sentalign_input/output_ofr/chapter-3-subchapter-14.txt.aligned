The thigh bone is often broken, and it is easily seen when it turns forward and back; and the treatment is to tie one bandage above the fracture, and another below. And the patient lies on his face, then each assistant extends his bandage on his side equally; and this is when the break is in the middle of the bone.	The femur is often broken, and this is readily discernible, for it will rotate forwards or backwards. It is set by binding a bandage above the fracture and another below, while the patient lies flat on his face. Then each assistant should make an even extension in his own direction, by the bandage. This is when the fracture is in the middle of the bone.	0.90660614
And if the break is close to the hip joint, then one of the bandages should be towards the groin, and the other bandage below the fracture.	But if the fracture is close to the root of the thigh, you should tie on a soft bandage of wool or something similar, at the root of the thigh toward the groin, so that extension may be applied above, and another bandage below the fracture.	0.70375407
And similarly if it is close to the knee, then the bandage should be near the knee, and the extension downwards; then the physician sets the bone straight with his two hands, until it is in its natural form, and then applies the plaster, and bandages it, unless a hot abscess develops there.	Likewise if the fracture is near the knee the bandage should be near the knee, so that extension may be made downwards. Then the doctor should straighten it out with both hands until he has reduced it to the pattern of the natural form and the bone unites neatly.	0.8470811
And if there is a hot abscess, let it subside then return to your work and your treatment; the bandaging is done in this manner.	Then you will have to apply the plaster and bandage if there is no effusion in the limb, but if there is an effusion leave it for a few days until the swelling has gone down, then resume your treatment.	0.549277
And if it does occur, untie it, and address what develops, as we have said many times; and if there are pieces of bone sticking out, they should be removed, if possible; and if not, then the area must be incised, and they must be pulled out; and treat it as we have described, until it is healed.	Then let the bandaging remain on as long as no pruritus or abscess or effusion or anything of that sort happens to the limb; but if any of these occur loosen it quickly and put right whatever has taken place, in the manner we have often mentioned. If there be a penetrating fragment of the bone, you must reposition it if you can; but if not then cut down upon it and remove it and treat the wound in the sort of way mentioned previously, until it heals.	0.76521206
And sometimes the thigh is broken in such a way that splints are applied, as in the shoulder and the arm; however, with the restoration done in this manner, the patient does not become lame.	This fracture of the thigh is sometimes bandaged without bringing the leg alongside with splints, in the way we spoke of for the humerus and the forearm. But setting after the former manner does not cause the patient any lameness; whereas if the femur is set alone without binding the leg to it the patient will inevitably be lame for always.	0.7251246
And know that the thigh is restored in fifty days, or a little less or a little more, depending on the differences in complexions.	You must know that the femur knits in fifty days or a little more or less, according to the different constitutions and other circumstances.	0.73527336
