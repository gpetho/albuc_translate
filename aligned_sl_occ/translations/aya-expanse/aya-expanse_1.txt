Oh, my sons, having completed this book, the last of medical science, through its logical sequence it has reached its end, and considering its exposition, its explanations, and its declarations, I believe you have accomplished for yourselves this treatise, which is a part of the greatest operation, surgery.
For surgery, being the most complex and delicate of medical practices, it has been largely abandoned in our region and time, as its science is deemed dangerous and its methods outdated; only a few brief descriptions can be found in the books of the Ancients, which have led to errors and misconceptions regarding the understanding and application of its principles and art.
And I have found it necessary to revive the order of this treatise through its second method of exposition and declaration and abridgment; and so that the forms of cautery tools and other surgical instruments be added to the declarations, and for the preparation of the patient, which is essential.
But the cause why our skillful physician does not always achieve good results in this our time is because the art of medicine is very complex, and requires that he be well-versed in the science of anatomy to understand the growth of the members and their forms, as well as their conjunction and separation; he must have knowledge of bones, nerves, and ligaments, know their names and how they are expressed; and of the pulsating and inactive veins, and the places where they emerge.
And for that reason, Hippocrates says that the name is appropriate, because in practice it is simple but more so in the art of healing.
We have already spoken of this in the introduction to this book; for whoever is not acquainted with what we have said about anatomy, will be apt to fall into errors that may cause men's deaths, as you have seen many such cases where persons, though trained in this science, nonetheless fall into ignorance and misapprehension through lack of experience.
For you see a foolhardy doctor who has incurred a scrofulous abscess in the thigh of a woman, and incised some of her thigh's arteries so that great pus flowed until the woman died from it among her pains.
And you see another doctor who prescribed a stone from a man who had been suffering in his state, and the stone was large, he came to him and extracted that stone with part of his bladder, so that man died on the third day.
And you have already called for haste to extract it, and you see that because of the size of the stone and the disposition of the illness, he will die.
And you see another doctor who was paid by a duke of our land to perform surgery, and he operated on a black crust that had a deep fracture in the thigh; because of the doctor's ignorance, he removed the fracture over the wound, with swabs and bandages with strong tension, and did not allow the wound to breathe.
And then, according to their desires, release the tension, rest, and after some days, command that we loosen the bandage; and thus it is also for the foot, which if not treated properly will lead to harm.
And you will have called upon him, and he will loosen the bandage, and achieved is peace, and thus also the alleviation of their pains.
Yet if the corruption is already confirmed in the member, so that it cannot be restrained, and it does not cease to spread corruption throughout the member until the danger of the illness increases.
And he saw another doctor who perforates a cancerous abscess, and it becomes an ulcer after some days, until the evil of it grows great under his lordship.
Which causes is because the sharp pain is purely from melancholic humor; then it does not cover that it will come to him through all, but rather it should be in the member which suffers that it entirely overcomes.
And therefore, sons, it is necessary for you that the operation on the body be divided into two parts: one is the operation associated with health, and the other is the work which is perilous in the most important dispositions.
And you have already encountered this in every place in this book where there are operations that contain error and fear; therefore, it is necessary for you to keep this and lay down that, so that the people do not take another path to speak and dishonor you.
And therefore, take up your weapons with diligence and the protection of God, and your patients with facility and firmness.
And use the best way for the grace of God, leading to salvation and glorious success, set aside the terrible illnesses that are difficult to heal, and abandon your weapons of fear, so that your faith and your name are not abandoned: for greater is what remains to your glory, both now and in eternity, behind you and after your sanctity.
They already cut open some of their own organs: Do not treat bad ailments poorly, so that bad doctors do not become notorious.
And you have already divided this book into three chapters.
Begin the division of the book, starting with the first part of the first chapter. The first chapter is ordered on the feet, in the forms of instruments and in the tools of cauterization, and about what is necessary for the operation.
The division of the second part. The second chapter deals with incision and perforation, and also with suckers, plaies, the extraction of arrows and similar objects, all chapters and ordered according to the forms of instruments.
The third chapter, on restoration and relocation, and on the treatment of twists and similar conditions; a chapter ordered on the head within the foot, and on the forms of instruments.
Understand what I have said about the quality of the heat from that cautery and the documents of it, and in what circumstances cautery is prohibited.
Therefore, it is said that the discourse on the quality of cautery heat and the documents of it is a long and prolix topic, subtle for knowledge, and secrets hidden; and already many savants have spoken of it, and there are disagreements among them, and to me, a small part of their discourse suffices, lest it become too prolonged.
And therefore it is said that cauterization will benefit the entire universal connection, whether of material or its matter, except for two connections, which are connections with their own matter.
In the connection that is dry and devoid of matter, it is said that cauterization is beneficial, while others claim the opposite, asserting that cauterization is not appropriate for illness caused by dryness and quality, since the nature of fire is quality and dryness, and it would be counterproductive to treat a dry and secluded condition with a hot and dry remedy.
And those who say the opposite claim that cauterization is beneficial for all dry and secluded illnesses in the bodies of men, since when you compare the body of man with its humidity to the connection of fire, you find the body of man dry.
And they say through the discourse of that person, that they have already experienced this several times before in their discoveries.
However, it is not appropriate for someone who has already been trained and practiced in the art of cautery on various parts of the body to come upon this suddenly. He should be familiar with the diversity of the structure of human bodies, the disposition of their maladies, the causes of those maladies, the circumstances surrounding them, and the passage of time regarding those conditions.
In other circumstances, there is no cause for fear, especially in the case of painful and moist maladies, as all doctors are in agreement regarding these, and they do not disagree on the treatment with cautery in such cases.
And know, my children, that the secret of healing by cautery with fire and the goodness of it lie in cautery as a medicinal practice, for fire is simple; its action affects only the member being cauterized, without inflicting pain on other members nearby, but rather requires a slight pressure.
The action of the medicinal fire reaches those members from which it is withdrawn, and it strongly affects a member afflicted with a difficult-to-heal malady, aiding its recovery.
Kindle the fire, for its subtlety and the goodness of its substance, does not cause harm but rather serves. It has long been known through experience and the longevity of studying the art based on the truth of causes; therefore, I excuse you from the length of my speech. If it were not that this secret fire is not read at my leisure in this brief pause, I would conceal nothing from you regarding its nature, its operation in the body, and its expulsion of maladies, demonstrated through philosophical discourse, which would be sharpened in your minds.
And know, my sons, that the best time to perform cauterization and make bandages is in the spring season.
And you say that cauterization is convenient at all times, so that the harm caused by time's accident is overcome by the healing power of cauterization, and most especially when cauterization is for pain or necessary pains, severe and acute, which do not suffer delay, lest those that come later be harmed, as it is better to avoid harm entering through time.
And so do not sit on your feet, my sons, for it is only the vulgar people and foolish doctors who believe that this illness, which is treated with cautery, does not fully heal, leaving a residual effect.
And the cause is not thus as they believe, for cautery is but a place of medicine that alters the composition and dries up the humors which are the cause of the pains.
Yet, one may use cautery superfluously over medicine due to the desire for its power, virtue, and greatness attributed to its lord.
And it is possible that their illness returns at some point in time, depending on the nature of the illness and its location, and the power it holds within them, and what is prepared within their bodies from the addition of excesses and humors, and what has been acquired by them through food and similar causes; for the illness which receives cautery, if it is a subtle illness in a few excesses and humors, just as dental pain is treated with cautery, then it is possible that the same pain may not return to them, but this is done in small doses.
And it is often said in popular speech that cautery is the last remedy of medicine, and it is a very right saying, not to those who understand it, for they believe that it is not a cure that brings profit either by medicine or by any other cause with cautery.
But the reason is to the contrary; and the understanding that cautery is the last remedy of medicine is only when one applies the methods of healing in certain illnesses, and those medicines do not help, and then at the end of the cause, one administers cautery and profites from it. From which it follows that cautery is the last remedy of medicine, not according to the understanding of the common people and too many foolish physicians.
And they said that cautery with gold is better than cautery with iron, and they did not say this except for the equality of gold and the subtlety of its substance.
And they say that the place of cautery does not cause pain, which is not entirely true, for you have already seen and experienced that it does not do so unless in certain bodies; cauterization with fire from gold is good and better than what they said; nevertheless, when you make a cautery with fire, it is not clearly known, because the quantity of gold you use depends on the urgency of the situation, and if you apply it over the flame, the gold melts into the fire, and sometimes certain sheets fall into the fire for the craftsman to recover.
And for this, cauterization with iron should be performed more gently and precisely to ensure the correctness of the operation.
You have already organized this chapter on cauterization according to other chapters, and you have ordered those within the feet first, so that later I am asking him what he wants from it.
The first chapter.
This cauterization confers dryness and coldness upon the affected part, which is one cause of sudden and multiple rheumatic flux, called rigor, from the head to the extremities of the limbs and ears, numerous times during sleep, as well as pain in teeth and the throat, and generally for any illness that arises from cold, also causing paralysis, stiffness, and apoplexy, and similar conditions in those illnesses.
The method of this cauterization involves first commanding the malady to be evacuated using a laxative medicine for three or four nights, depending on the severity of the illness, the age of the patient, and their usual condition.
And then command them to shave their head and place that scissors between your legs on a heated bench, and place their hands on their feet.
And then place your palm's edge near the root of the nose between their heels. However, if the pain in the middle of the foot has been overcome, mark that place with a try, and then heat the olive-shaped cautery from which this is the form:
And then place that over the healthy area marked with a try, in a descending manner, so that the patient's hand is gradually constrained, and you remove that.
And then slowly lift your hand and examine the area; if you notice any bone uncovered, along with some amount of erysipelas (redness or swelling), raise your hand again, and if it doesn't return to that spot with the instrument (or another), as long as it is cold, until you can see the bone mentioned earlier.
And then take a little salt, dissolve it over the area, and leave it for three days.
And then place your hand over the area soaked in border, leaving that one inside to destroy the wall of fire. And then treat the area with a four-ingredient remedy until it is healed.
And it is said that when the Roman plague opens, the better the limb gets, so it is better and more rejuvenated.
And they said that some should have their joints cauterized within the bone, and hold the cautery until some part of the specific nature of the bone is dried up.
And then remove what is attached to the bone, and then cure it.
And others said that with the cautery one can reach the rear, strengthening the bone completely until it hardens, and this is the way to achieve perfect healing: And they believe that from that place, vapours from the head escape.
And if the wound remains open for a long time, it should be treated until it is healed and consolidated.
I do not have the expertise to view these two types of cauterization instruments in all their variations, but according to certain sources, it is better for health when used appropriately; for when the head is exposed due to the solution of continuity within it, as we have witnessed in other members, and especially when the nature of the pain's head is fierce.
And the specific type of cauterization, which is primarily safer and better for me, should be used from this point onwards for these treatments to benefit health.
Second chapter.
On the head cautery.
When chronic and prolonged pain occurs in the entire head and this prolongs the illness, and various remedies such as swords, spikes, scalpels, ointments, guaiac, dogwood, goat's hair, and similar things are used, and especially if a cautery has already been applied that does not address the root cause of the malady, one must consider whether the nature of the head disease is robust; and if there is no great contusion or significant injury, then apply another cautery instead of this one. And then cauterize that area on the side of the patient's head where the bone is fractured using an internal cautery. Cut the bone and expose the amount we have found and cauterize it with a cautery at the rear part of the head in the area known as the 'vas'—and that is the location where the vacuum is stopped. And apply your hand to it, do not expose the bones, for this malady causes great and diverse pain compared to all other head cauterizations.
And you should perform this cauterization in its proper place, because you know that the cauterization with which the horns of the head and the occiput are cauterized is a more subtle cauterization than the one performed on the middle part of the head; and this is its form.
Capital chapters.
On the treatment of old migraines.
When a severe pain in the head or a sharp pain within the skull occurs, it is treated with medicinal capings, and other cures as I have mentioned regarding various ailments; if this does not provide relief, then cauterization on the affected area is performed in two ways: either with an acute medicinal fire or with iron.
You may use cauterizing medicines or burning therapies, take a hot compress, cut open the affected area, and amputate its ends from both sides. And then you should incise the site of pain in the temple with a sharp lance, until it is felt to be in the right place, leaving the thread untouched.
And then you should bind it tightly with a compress for a descent contraction, leaving it for three hours; afterwards, remove the compress and place the affected area in cold water or ice for two to three days, and then apply a warm compress until the pain subsides.
And then you should treat it with a poultice until it is healed.
And if you prefer, follow these burning medicines as described in the two treatises on burning medicines that I have written.
Apply the cauterization with iron according to this manner: ignite the cautery, whose shape is thus:
It is called a claw clamp because its head has the shape of a claw with some curvature, and there is a small prominence in the middle part of it.
Then apply pressure to the painful area, hold your hand—to prevent the wound from becoming infected—and slowly turn the iron at a gentle pace.
And if the amount of blood stuck due to the specific nature of the wound is such that it equals or exceeds the capacity of the artery, raise your hand so that the artery is not compressed, preventing the flow of pus.
Then apply a compress with salt water over the area and leave it for three days; also apply a lot of moist heat until it heals.
And if you see, burn the tip of the knife with a cautery, and be careful not to cut an artery in this recent wound.
Capital quarter.
Of the cauterization of ancient wounds.
When you treat a wound as we have discussed in the previous section on cure and division of illnesses, but the treatment does not take effect, and the illness worsens, requiring a different approach than that of the initial cauterization with medicine or fire, then ignite the cuticular cautery until it becomes blanched. Place your hand over the area once more and press gently as you slice through the artery, aiming for the source of the pain.
However, it is essential for you to prevent the jaw from moving excessively, as this impairs chewing. Ensure that the wound is not too deep and that the nerves or vessels are not damaged, and avoid any spasms.
And if it concerns the prevention and care of the flow of blood from an artery that is damaged, as damage to it is a cause for concern, especially for those who do not understand what it does and are not diligent or patient; then delay the operation on it until the beginning.
And now we come to the remembrance of the regulation of the flow of accidental blood from the artery according to their (doctors') manner, in their place within this book.
And if you see that this illness does not allow for the application of a cautery and the body of the patient can tolerate it, then cauterize in the middle part of the head as we have mentioned above, and cure the wound until it is healed.
And if you find that the cautery which we have mentioned in the chapter about the stretching of arteries with two edges is administered, this is a better and more effective cauterization.
Chapter Five.
On the treatment of earache.
When there is pain in the ear caused by cold and it is treated with lacrimal and other remedies as mentioned in the previous section, and the pain does not subside, apply heat with cautery. This is known as 'puncta', and this is its form:
Then apply the cautery close to the fire, and it should be moved around the entire ear as if it were turning, or in any way that the pain is felt. Move the cautery along the edge of the ear slowly, until the area is numbed by the application.
And if the cautery with pointed points is done all over the ear, and how it feels, then treat the areas within until they are healed.
Chapter .vi.
On the cauterization of tortuous (varicose) veins.
The tortuous veins that are cured and treated by cauterization are nothing but the species that come from flux, as we have said in the divisions of ailments.
Avoid cauterization of the species that should be treated by drying or spasm of the nerve.
When you treat that species of tortuous vein with pulling and snipping and sucking, and do not confirm your cure, then know that you cauterize the ailment in three places: first, you burn the auricle, second, a small part of its temple, and third, the connection of two lips.
And place your cautery over the opposite side of the affected area, for mollification comes only from the part that appears to be healed.
And the method of cauterization is to apply the cautery to the base of the auricle, slightly above the corner of the forehead, and on the temple, its length corresponding to the length of the finger, and hold your hand over the cautery until the quantity of the substance of the skin is burnt.
This is the form of the cautery, and it is specially made from a knife, the shape of which is placed on the table. However, it may be even more subtle, as you will see with your own eyes; and take care to avoid excessive roughness on its surface.
And take care of the area that is exposed during the procedure until it heals.
Chapter VII.
On the cauterization of ancient apoplexy.
When apoplexy is ancient and its cure does not respond to what has been said, and the patient does not have fever, then cauterize it with four cauteries: above all the corners of their head; also cauterize the middle part of the head as we have said; and cauterize the nape. And the manner of the cautery is done as it has been said above.
And it is cauterized over the mouth of the stomach; and it is most derider; and then it is carefully cured with what you have processed.
Chapter VIII.
About the cauterization of oblivion made by heat.
You should give the patient hot drinks and pills in the beginning, the servant will then wash them.
Then shave the whole head of the patient and place the poultice on their chest as described in the treatment tractate.
And repeat this several times, as this is the method of cauterization. And do this according to the order of the steps I have already mentioned.
And thus, if these remedies do not help him, then make three cauterizations to him in the last part of his head, descending from the highest part of the head down to the lower part of the neck. And between each cautery, hold the pressure of the finger, and then carefully tend to the cautery as the procedure continues.
If you have additional assistance and the patient can tolerate it, perform the cautery on the middle part; but if you need greater assistance, cauterize that on both corners.
Cauterize carefully the area that needs healing; and make the cautery marks as per the shape as given above.
Chapter IX.
On the procedure of dispelling parasites and softening throughout the body.
Understand that you must proceed in the softening of the head with jerks and according to what we have said; then carefully shave the patient's head, and cauterize that in the middle part of the head with a cautery, and cauterize on all corners of the head, and cauterize on the rear part of it, and make three cauterizations on the spinal bones of the neck.
And if it is necessary in the case of hardening of the body from too much heat and the illness tolerates it and the illness is severe, then cauterize with four cauteries on the spine of the back, and later apply a cautery until the burning pain of it is eliminated, and raise your hand. Then carefully tend to it until it is healed, and this cautery should be olive oil.
Chapter X.
On the cauterization of epilepsy.
Epilepsy is not cauterized, but only that epilepsy caused by phlegm.
And therefore, it is important to purify the brain of the patient at the beginning when you have used fire and other treatments as described in our discussion when the illness is severe and resistant to medical treatment.
And if it is a child who does not endure medicines, then administer liquids and soft foods to them, for several days, to improve their digestion.
Then shave the patient's head, and apply a cautery to that area with a hot iron in the middle of the head, as previously described, and apply another cautery at the back of their head, and over each of the shaved areas of their head, they should be cauterized. If the patient's condition is severe and they are tolerant, then apply cautery as described, with a view to having a paralyzing and relaxing effect on the body, over the spinal columns of the neck and back.
And apply the olive cautery as previously described.
If the patient is a child, then apply subtle cautery according to this method.
Chapter .xi.
On the cauterization of melancholy.
When the causes of melancholy are corrupted humors and excessive moisture, then cauterize it with the cauteries we have mentioned in case of paralysis.
And if the cause of melancholy is an excess of fluid leading to melancholy, and the patient's body is humid, then he should drink water that purifies the mind according to what has preceded in the division.
Then shave the head of the patient, and make a slight cut on the scalp above the affected area, and then pause to let it heal in the middle part of the head.
And the patient should feel relaxed, and be held from all sides.
And then apply the ointment; it is now more suitable for grazing before sheep. And heat that above the fire with a temperature measured by degrees, which causes him to suffer when it is most in him. Then take that in the middle part of his head in a circle and release it until it is cooled.
And do this to the patient every day for a week, or according to his diet, until he is cured; or, if you want, make small punctures with a pointed cautery, as best suited to him, but always keep your hand on it: this is a type of cautery that moistens the brain equally.
Then apply that ointment soaked in the border or in the grey of a goose.
Chapter .xii.
On the incision of water descending in the kidney.
When it is declared that water descends in the kidney through the signs that I have mentioned in the previous section, then it begins and causes the patient to drink something that purifies the head of the kidney, and attend to all humidity.
And do that soaking in a bath with some herbs for several days.
Then command the patient to shave their head, and cauterize that place with a hot iron; and cauterize two places with two irons if it is the beginning of water descent in two kidneys, or one side if it is the beginning of water in one kidney.
Cut with a cautery all the veins and arteries that are left in the leg; and the cauterization should be on that long in the width of the thighs.
And beware of blood flow when cauterizing; and if you see blood flow from it, stop any further treatment, which is within your power.
And come to the knowledge that is derived from arteries, amputation of those and care to prevent blood flow.
Sometimes, the neck is cauterized between two bones using two cauterization tools, producing healing.
Chapter XIII
On the cauterization of ancient tears.
When the tears of the eyes are ancient and frequent, and through veins and arteries manifest in the external part of the head, it is determined that this is due to excessive fluidity of the connective tissues, then cauterize with a cautery as we have described in the chapter on starting hot water in the eyes, and make cauterizations in the middle part of the head and two cauterizations below each temple, and two cauterizations below each bone. And if there is additional need, then cauterize across the entire width of the eye's coat on the edge of the upper eyelid with a small cautery.
**Chapter XIII**
**On the Cauterization of Nose Putrefaction**
When you treat a patient with the method we have described in the previous section and your treatment does not benefit them, then prepare and give to the patient the following herbs to drink for three nights; then shave their head, and cauterize with a middle-sized olive cautery. And then apply the cautery, using a claw-shaped cautery over both eyebrows, leaving the hair intact on one side.
And be careful not to burn that.
And the claw-shaped cautery is shaped like this.
Chapter XV.
Of the cautery for softening the eyelids of the eyes.
When the eyelid of the eye is softened by illness or moisture, apply a cautery to that eyelid using a lunar-shaped cautery; and this is the shape of it:
And if you, apply the cautery over both eyebrows with a small claw-shaped cautery across the entire area, and they should be elongated from the temples. And the length of each cautery should be according to the amount of swelling.
And do not press too hard with the cautery, but according to how much the third part of the eyelid is adhered.
**Chapter XVI.**
Regarding the cautery of the eyelid, when the hairs change to scabs within and close up the wound.
When the hairs on the eyelid change to scabs within and close up the wound, cauterization is performed in two ways: either by making a cut or by using a medicinal burning substance.
If cauterization with fire is performed, instruct the patient to shave their hairs in such a way that they are neither too long nor too short; and if you need to, tie the eyelids shut with a bandage so that the hairs do not grow back until they have healed.
Therefore, when they are born and engorged, place the patient's head on their left side, then apply pressure over the eyelid of their eye attempting to make a sign, a sign according to the shape of a dead leaf, and it should be the beginning of the sign near the hair.
Then apply a cold compress or a mucilaginous paste of plants over the eye.
Then apply the heat from the cautery, which has this shape.
And apply the cautery over the marked figure, gradually and in small touches, until the surface of the skin, which is as if with a leaf of myrtle, is completely charred, apparently.
The sign of the healing of the eye is that you see the eyelid of the eye contracted and the hairs raised at the point of the eye's puncture.
And so raise your hand and place it there for three days, then apply a poultice to the affected area until the pain is alleviated. And then apply that ointment until it heals.
If it returns through the skin for any reason and the eyelid becomes soft, then make another cautery on that place exactly as you did originally.
If the hair is on the eyelid, then cauterize it until it is raised to its natural place, sealed, and the hair does not smell bad.
But the cautery with burning medicine is what you command the patient to do with the hair until they are prolonged and sealed, and then make a cloth in the shape of a fir leaf from the bandage.
And then take soap known and a sharp object, or what is suitable for this purpose, and mix those causes well, making it into a paste so that it is not frozen; and spread it over the cloth made thus in the form of a myrtle leaf, and place it on one or both wounds; and wrap the wound edge soaked in albumen of egg, and the patient's head should be at a lower level.
And then stop talking about the medicine and apply a small amount, not too much, until the patient feels the burning of the medicine, for burning is how it acts within them.
And so, as you continue to observe this that the treatment is burning, stop the medicine and apply it again with caution; then, when the burning stops, wash the wound with water. And consider if the eyelid is lifted as it should be washed daily with either heat or incision, for that is what is appropriate now; and if it doesn't return to the application of this medicine at the place where the treatment wasn't effective, you risk compromising your operation and causing the wound to close up.
And then place your hand over the affected area until the pain of the adhesion is eradicated, and apply a healing ointment or something else until it is cured.
And it is necessary for you to perform your operation with careful vigilance so that no part of the medicine falls away, and if the eyelid becomes softened after several days due to any cause from the hairs in the eye, repeat your medicine on that area which has become softened from the eyelid, and indeed, just as you did at the beginning, and envelop it until it is cured.
And this is the way of extracting the myrtle.
And you know that the eyes of men differ in size and shape, and therefore your treatment must be adapted accordingly.
And let the path of treatment not be hidden from him who studies this art.
Chapter .xvii.
On the cauterization of a fistula in the tear duct of the eye.
When you treat a fistula as we have discussed regarding the divisions of illnesses and your treatment does not help, then know that you cauterize it according to this manner: command the patient to sit with their head in a low position, and hold their head with a minister between their thighs in such a way that it is neither harmed nor agitated by their head.
And then place some cloth soaked in alum or a paste of flower petals on the eye of the patient.
And then shape the cautery as follows:
which should be curved, similar to the shape of a cane or a serpent's tongue, from one end where the cautery is made.
And if you see, they penetrate into the other extremity. And if you want to get out this way, try it with caution.
Yet he who is experienced is better at the medical work.
And then press the fistula if it is open, and try to clean and dry it. And if it is not open, then open it and remove the infection from it.
Then place over it a cautery that has been well-lit, and with your hand slightly lift the cautery from the part of the nose, so that your hand or the illness is not disturbed, and press the cautery on the gray parts of the nose and burn it.
And so if at the beginning of the burning with the cautery it penetrates into the bone, it is good; otherwise, repeat the cautery once or twice, as needed; then leave that thus for three days, and apply your hand over that area with a dry compress until it heals.
If after passing ten days it is not healed, then apply the sharp, corrosive medicine again until the bone is exposed and it heals as it should in its chapter.
There is another way to perform the fistula cautery that some masters speak of: enter the location of the fistula and close it; then apply your hand over the fissure gently, whose shape must be thus: pour a quantity of melted lead there; with your other hand, hold it firmly without harming the patient, so that the lead does not reach the wound of the illness. Cover the wound of the illness with cloth or water, as lead will adhere to the location of the fistula and heal it by a wonderful process.
And if the fistula is healed with what we have said about cautery and treatment, it is good; otherwise, it will be necessary to apply a poultice and reduce the fistula to the nose inside according to its proper place.
**Chapter XVIII**
**On the Cauterization of the Fistula**
Frequently, accidents cause fissures on the lips, especially in children's lips.
Therefore, when you treat those fissures with the methods we have discussed and your treatment does not take effect, make a small cut with a knife following this form...
and the cavity of it according to the thickness of the knife.
Place your hand carefully on those cracks so that the cautery reaches the depth of the cracks.
And then take care of that moist compress until it is healed.
**Chapter XIX**
**On the Cauterization of Fistulas in the Mouth**
When, during the extraction of the uvula, or in the palate or around the teeth, there is an abscess that forms, and it breaks open, and becomes chronic, and a fistula is formed, and if you treat it but do not fully cure it, then you should ignite a cautery according to the size of the fistula. Place that burning cautery into the opening of the fistula, and with your hand, guide the burning point to reach the depth (of the fistula), doing this once or twice; and thereafter treat it with moist compresses as we have said regarding treatment, until it is healed.
And if the wound is incised and cleansed, it is good; otherwise, it is necessary to expose the location and accommodate the corrupted bone as it will be discussed in its chapter.
**Capitol XX:**
On the treatment of teeth and the softening of arteries.
When the arteries are softened by moisture and the teeth are loosened, and these conditions are not remedied with medicines alone, then place the patient's head on the knee, and shape the cautery so that when you place the flame over the tooth, it enters deeply enough for the patient to feel the heat of the fire at the root of the tooth, having been effectively removed.
Then lift your hand, and repeat the application of the cautery several times as desired.
Then make the patient gargle with salt water for an hour, after which he should spit it out, for the loosened tooth will be firmly set, the softened gums will tighten, and the corrupt moisture will be dried.
Chapter .xxi.
On the treatment of tooth pain.
When tooth pain is due to coldness, or there is swelling or pus in the tooth, and treatment with medicine does not bring relief, then a cautery should be performed in two ways: either with a cow's tail or with fire.
Cautery with cow's tail involves taking a strand of cow's hair and twisting it into a coil, then burning that in the fire, and afterwards, taking the hot end and wrapping it around the affected tooth, pressing down firmly until the pain is numbed by the cold.
And repeat this several times until the heat from the fire reaches the root of the tooth.
And if you see, dip a cloth or twine in the wound on top of the tooth, and place that over the painful spot, and also place the heated iron on it until the iron reaches the depth of the tooth's cavity.
However, the use of fire for cauterization is to address the inflammation or infection, and it should not be too severe or intense so as not to affect the opening of the hernia.
Then shape the cautery as required, place it over the tooth and hold your hand over it until the cautery cools down; do this several times as the pain may return either that day or the next.
And ensure that the patient opens their mouth wide and holds the cautery for about an hour, then spit it out; this is the shape of the cautery.
And apply the cautery as you have made extreme as it is within your ability.
And this is the shape of the cannula:
Chapter XXII.
On the cauterization of extrophules.
When extrophules are caused by fluid and humors that do not obey digestion due to medicines, and you wish to remedy them slightly, then apply the cautery precisely according to its shape, having two pointed ends so that the fire of the cautery may reach both sides, and place the glowing end on the affected area once, and another if it needs more attention, until it reaches the point of the extrophule.
And if the extrophule is small, then apply the cautery according to its size, and leave it for three days, placing a bandage over it gently until it heals completely from the burn.
And then apply that medicinal ointment and bandages until it heals.
**Chapter XXIII**
On cauterization of wounds and constriction of vessels.
When humidity appears on the surface of the lung, especially when it is chilled by external contact, then know that this illness must be evacuated at the beginning with medicinal laxatives, and then cauterize that place with a pointed instrument in the affected area.
And be careful not to harm the gullet with the cautery or inflame the patient's ribs, but only a little.
And cauterize that or another cautery as needed on the joint of the neck in the last spine of the patient. The cautery of him is done with a sharp claw, following the previous manner.
Then carefully tend to that as it is mentioned above until it heals.
**Chapter 23**
**On the Cauterization of Lung Sickness and Coughing**
When coughing and lung sickness are caused by moisture, and the patient has no fever or phlegm, and it is an old illness, then cauterize as follows: make two incisions with cautery on the furcula (the bony structure in the base of the throat) at the spots that are vulnerable to infection; another cautery in the middle of the foot between the big toe and the next toe; and both cauteries should be done with a sharp claw, following the method mentioned above.
And if you wish, your puncturing cautery can be the pointed cautery called a 'punta', the form of which precedes in the puncturing of the pain of the ears.
And make punctures within these; and then carefully apply to it the remedies that are mentioned before so that it is healed.
And the cautery having three bends, for cauterization is made to that: once you can make three cauteries according to this form:
Chapter XXV.
On cauterization of the titillium (the head of the helper).
When the head of the helper is dislocated due to lubricating humidity and does not return in its proper place, you must reduce its dislocation until it returns, and with a slight movement, it should be adjusted as it usually does; at first, reduce the dislocation, then return the malady to its original position on the patient's back or side, and lift the leg that was affected, placing your hand over the affected area above the knee of the injured limb.
And then apply the cautery, which has two points; this is its form:
And then cauterize the wound where one penetrates the other; and the figure of cauterization will appear when using three cautery points.
And in some cases, it is adjusted according to this rule, and these are the eight cauterizations.
Then place the entire cautery over the wound with salt, and make the patient lie in tranquility, and do not move the member for any time until it is healed.
And if the dislocation is in the upper parts and it persists, then this should be done, cauterizing over the muscle with a hot cautery or with pointed cold cauteries, for the joint is confirmed, the humidity is broken, and the malady is healed.
Chapter .XXVI.
On the cauterization of the stomach.
When stomach pain arises with moisture within, causing the abdomen to expand, and if treatment methods are not changed, the patient will feel the disease pressing on their back, extending their limbs and organs, and should cauterize these three areas: first, leave a mark on the foot with a finger-sized cautery, and use two cauteries on either side of the back's costates, forming a triangular cautery shape; stretch those that are not properly adjusted to prevent ulceration.
And if the depth of the cautery is equal to two-thirds of the thickness of the skin.
And the shape of the cautery should be according to this form. And if you wish, cauterize with a larger cautery in the middle area of the stomach, following this shape; and this should be a circular cautery, as shown here.
And the stomach should be cauterized by puncturing it, as long as this cautery does not frighten him: you know how much to puncture with the cautery according to your will, and then cauterize these points; and take care of that treatment until it heals.
**Chapter 27.**
**On the Cauterization of Veins.**
When pain in the vein occurs due to coldness or moisture or excessive windiness, and the disorder has deviated from its normal course by causing excessive discharge, treat the illness as we have said and do not compress it, but rather allow the disorder to be raised over its root; then try three cauterizations according to this form, applying this amount of heat over the vein below the hip bone, which will induce the patient's recumbent position.
And the space between each cautery should be according to its thickness, and the cauteries should be according to the length of the body on the right side.
And do not be afraid of the pointed cautery.
And if the quantity of the substance adhering to the amount of the specific nature of the cord is not sufficiently adjusted; and if the illness stands on the feet of the patient; or if it is not standing, then let him be sitting, who has already extended his things and raised his arms.
And it is possible for you to cauterize these cauteries with a cuttlefish cautery, when it is in your subtlety and prudence in the art.
And be careful not to overdo the cauterization, and focus the sight of all present so that the whole body is warmed and penetrates into the intestines, for here the chain is delicate; and know this.
Chapter .XXVIII.
On the perforation of an abscess in the leg with cautery.
When the abscess ends in the leg and you want to know if that abscess is in the flesh of the leg or in the sheath (tunica) surrounding it, if it is in the flesh, the illness takes on a serious character and the pain becomes acute.
And if it is in the sheath (tunica) surrounding the leg, then the pain is very acute and often exhausts the doctors in their attempts to cure it.
Therefore, position the patient so that their neck is in the correct position; then identify the location of the abscess; and apply the pointed cautery, which resembles a rag, whose shape was previously described on the other page. And cauterize with these cauterization tools until all the wound is healed, so that it reaches the bone, and the infection disappears.
And likewise, take care of that one for the healing of the other abscesses until it is cured.
And do not use this form of cautery except for that which is studied in the art of medicine and has been proven effective; indeed, some may find it daring to perform such an operation, but it is better to adhere to those methods that have been well-established, and they are more safe.
**Chapter XXIX.**
On the cauterization of pleurisy.
Ancient cautery techniques for pleurisy, according to this method, involve taking the long, thin cut end of an artery from the leg and making a point on it with a knife. It should be of suitable thickness.
Then submerge that in oil and heat it over fire, and cauterize the area between the continuation of the furcula and the collarbone with a cautery there; place two small cauteries below, slightly inclined towards the part where the beard is, and two cauteries inclining between the fifth rib and the scapula, slightly inclined towards the rear parts; another cautery in the middle part of the foot; and another over the stomach, and three cauteries in the rear parts; and a cautery in the area between the two shoulders, and two cauteries on both sides of the foot, leaving the cautery between the two shoulders.
And do not cover your hand with the cautery, but hold it over the inflamed part in action.
And they also speak of other ancient practices where certain men use hot iron cauterizes like a ray and burn that part, placing it in the space between the ribs, to overcome that pain and restore health, as we have said regarding the hernia of the foot.
In this perforation with cautery, there is no cause for fear, as it often happens in the infected place, where there is no healing.
**Chapter XXX.**
**On the Cauterization of the Spleen.**
When treating the illness of the spleen using what we have said about treatment in division, and you do not apply your cure, cauterize it in three ways, all of which are correct: one is to make three or four incisions along the length of the spleen according to the figure of the cauterizes on the leg, the shape of which has preceded.
And between each cautery, the thickness of a finger or slightly less, and the manner of the cautery is the same as we have described for the cautery of the flesh equally.
And do not let your hand be burned by the cautery, and the patient should lie on their back.
And there is another way to cauterize, which is that you ignite the cautery having two points, which causes us to speak in the chapter of dislocation of the muscle, and raise the cord which is at the end of the plate so that it holds the patient's left side without pain.
And your elevation should be such that you raise the cord according to the length of the body, so that cauteries are made according to the extent of the body.
Then insert both points, ignite slowly, in that place where they penetrate the cord from the other side.
And then remove the cautery; thus four cauteries are made.
And if you see, three times the cautery has been applied.
And then you should care for the cautery so that it does not fall off for several days, as it is more comfortable than other treatments preceding in the healing process.
Chapter XXXI.
On the cauterization of hydropic (watery) conditions.
Cauterization does not take place in hydropic conditions but specifically in inflammation.
When treating hydropic conditions using the methods mentioned in our division and your treatment does not help, then you should apply four cauteries in the shape of a circle around the belly, one cautery on the stomach, another on the thigh, another on the chest, two cauteries between the spine of the back, and one cautery directly on the foot, and another cautery on the stomach. And the depth of the cautery should be determined according to the severity of the case.
And then apply the cautery gently so as not to cause pain for a long time.
And do not evacuate the patient from treatment with the cautery, as it covers what needs to be added so that two intentions are achieved, and it will be strengthened with the aid of healing.
The shape of the cautery used to burn the belly should be according to its form from before, and it is that which is called 'clavilh', whereas that which is cauterized on the back is 'olivar' according to its form preceding it.
Chapter XXXII
On the Cauterization of Feet and Other Parts:
When the feet are submerged in water and filled with salt water, be sure to cauterize the feet over the arch of the foot between the big toe and the little toe, holding the cautery at a distance, and do not twist it; then lift your hand, but do not lower it completely, for the salt water is exuding.
Make the cautery as follows: Then place two cauteries on both sides, and with the tip of the cautery make a cautery on each side. And make the cautery according to the length of the limb: leave one and place the other at the middle of the limb; and over each side two cauteries.
And keep the plague open for a long time so that no water remains in it.
And then address those causes we have mentioned.
**Chapter .XXXIII.**
**On the Cauterization of Abdominal Parts.**
When abdominal parts are infected and moist, one must eliminate the evil humors, which are the digestive and retentive virtues located in the stomach and intestines, and it is treated with curative methods that do not cause wounds. Sometimes, severe illness requires the use of cautery to expose these virtues, then cauterize them with a large cautery over their stomach as previously mentioned in the cauterization of the stomach, or with circular and four small cauteries around the subtle nerves, or with a fine-pointed cautery; and also cauterize over the gallstone with two cauteries.
And if the humidity persists and the illness tolerates it, then cauterize over the anus and intestines, strongly applying two cauteries over the stomach and near the groin, for this is a perfect cure that does not fail.
Chapter .xxxiv.
On the cauterization of old hemorrhoids.
When they are of a natural origin, deriving from old hemorrhoids, or a thick humor or corrupt humidity, and are not cured by the means already mentioned, then cauterize with three cauteries over the pus left in the small of the back, forming a small triangle, and apply another cautery to the navel on both sides.
If you observe that the patient's stomach is chilled and their food is not digested, and their face appears pale, then cauterize over the stomach with a large cautery as previously mentioned; also apply one cautery to the abdomen, and another cautery to the patient's armpit with a clavicle cautery. Leave the cauteries open for some time, and then dress them until they heal.
Chapter XXXV.
Regarding the cauterization of hernias, they remove the hernia.
When you remove the hernia, you use the cautery that is shaped like a ray. Then insert that flame into the hernia you have removed, and secure your hand over it until the cautery reaches the opening of the vein from which the blood flows.
And do this once or twice, for if the hernias are too numerous, you cauterize each one of them as we have said, and then care for those affected by applying ointment to them until they heal.
And if you cauterize with a large cautery on anything, it is more beneficial for healing.
Chapter .xxxvi.
On the cauterization of fistulas that are formed naturally in the tissues of the body.
When nature does not comply with the procedure we have described in its proper place, and the patient is frightened by this, then healing is achieved through cauterization.
Therefore, when one observes a fistula formed naturally in the body that is old and corrupted by impurities of moisture, it is most worthy to attempt its closure with subtle attempts, and then gradually remove the amount of the depth of the fistula according to the aforementioned attempt.
Gradually heat the cautery that resembles a ray. And place that ignited cautery onto this fistula according to the amount in which it intersects the attempt.
And apply the cautery again until those corrupt bodies are burned, once or twice or three times, according to the extent of your need.
And be careful of the burning of nerves and veins; if a fistula goes to the bladder or intestinal cavity, then pay attention to all those places; and do not attempt this unless the fistula is in fleshy tissue and you believe it is not penetrating.
And take care of the area until it is healed.
And if the area is sealed and the matter that caused it has been removed, and it heals for a long time, then know that it is completely cured.
And if the matter is not of its own kind, then know that it is penetrating or corrupting the tissue where it is, and it will come from those causes of which there will be recollection in its place.
Chapter .xxxvii.
On the cauterization of ulcers.
When ulcers cause pain due to cold or excessive heat, and the patient's condition becomes aggravated, it is necessary to cauterize those over the ulcers with a cautery instrument on each ulcer, specifically a clavihed that aids in drawing out the memories (of the illness).
And we should strongly cauterize it according to the second method, leaving a small space, so that three cauterizations will follow, and thus there will be fewer later complications.
Chapter .xxxviii.
On the cauterization of the bladder.
When the bladder is weakened and softened by friction and moisture such that the disease does not retain urine, apply a cautery to the opening where it leaves the bladder, beginning at the root of the penis, and cauterize with a cautery on both its right and left sides.
And the length of each cautery should be according to the number of pain symptoms; apply a cautery with one at the lower part of the back, or two if necessary.
And the cautery should be applied as it is processed.
Chapter XXXIX. (This indicates the beginning of a new section or chapter, but without additional context, it's impossible to provide a meaningful translation.)
On cauterization of the breast.
When the fever and humidity rise, conception is prohibited, and the patient's menstruation becomes corrupt, making conception delayed, and causing pain with their discharge, then you should cauterize the area around the navel with three cauteries, as we have said about the bladder cautery; or a cautery above the anus, or two cauteries, and they should be cross-shaped.
Chapter XL.
On the cauterization of the displaced ankle.
When moist mucous membranes are infiltrated into the joint space of the ankle, and they cause swelling in that area, and a sign of this is when the affected side appears longer than the other when compared between them. And the site of the dislocation is filled with blood.
Then apply the cautery to the hernia at the opening of the anus with a circular cautery, for you will have already tried to loosen the circle around the opening, and thus the opening falls in the middle of the circle.
And the cautery mentioned previously takes the form of the cauterization of the stomach.
If this cautery is not available to you, then apply three large olive-shaped cauteries instead.
And make the cautery according to the amount of inflammation in all the veins; and take care that it remains healthy.
Chapter XLII (42)
On the cauterization of the sciatic vein.
When pain appears in the lower part of the body due to friction and moisture, the disease is treated with the water we have mentioned and do not mix, and this is ancient, then you should remove the disease from thick humors with foul pills or artificial pills or similar ones; and then cauterize that area.
And the method of the cautery on that area follows two ways: either with medicinal burnings or with fire.
It follows two scientific methods, of which one is to cauterize that area across the opening of the patient's thigh with three triangular cauteries according to this form; and do so with good depth. And the space between each cautery should be according to the thickness of the said area, and if the cautery is olive-sized or large.
Some times, cautery may be applied to the middle part of the ankle for it are four cauterization points.
And if you wish, cauterize the circle from which the form proceeds in the cauterization of the ankle dislocation, one that is circular and burns away the tenderness of all the ligaments.
And this is the manner of cauterization in chronic pain when it is confined to the ankle and not extended into the thigh.
If it is extended into the thigh, then cauterize it as follows: two cauterizations on the thigh over the area where the pain originates; and one cauterization on the shin bone, four days apart on the inner side.
And if the cautery is with a blade, then the depth of the cautery should be according to the quantity of tenderness in the ligament.
And if the disease spreads that the pain is located in the lower part of the leg, then apply cautery here where you see it necessary with three or four or more points if required for that.
And if the disease causes pain to radiate in the vein of the thigh, then apply a cutaneous cautery there.
And be careful in all cautery so as not to finish with the cautery in such a way that you injure nerves or cause great pain, and through this it is upon the patient to do harm or contraction.
And you have already seen one of those who cauterize on the ankle and finish with the cauterization, and the bed of fire inflated within that the swelling achieved the foot, and the fire perforated and corrupted all the foot. And then apply a strong acid solution of the belly, and this brings death.
And if the pain is in two parts, then cauterize each according to this manner.
And certain wise men spoke of the cauterization of water cauteries, of which this is the manner: make it resemble a circular iron hook, whose circumference is the width of a palm; and its orifice should be according to the thickness of a date palm stem or slightly more.
And within that circle, make another one-third of its size; and the space between them should be the width of a night's rest; and these circles should be in two parts; and the length of those lines should be a nut or two nuts, and make on the edge of iron decently adorned with circles; this is the shape of it.
Then light it in the fire until it wraps around and sparks, and then place it over the part of the water, the patient lying on their side. And so cauterize that part with three pointed cauteries at once.
Then, for three days, apply a poultice to that part, keep the wound open for several days, and treat it with ointment until it is healed.
Albucasis says: O, my sons, we have used this type of cautery little due to the fear of its appearance, and because few of us have found those that work best over it.
Apply the best cauteries to him who suffers, and find the appropriate place for them.
Use cautery as a medicine when you make two circles with a perforated armor, in which the lock of the door is inserted; let the length of the wall at the narrowest point be equal to two nuts or whatever suits them.
And if the space between certain parts of the body is such that it corresponds to the quantity of its thickness, they should be opened from above and below, and they should hold each other in this manner.
Then apply pressure to the part where the patient feels pain on their side, and take your hand away from the affected area; then take some cold water and pour it between two circles, making its quality hot little by little, for about an hour, and let the patient endure the burning and tightness — for that tormenting burning is as if fire — until the burning ceases.
Then raise your hand with the instrument and dry off all the cold water with hot water.
Then do this for three days, applying pressure to the affected area until the burning feels less intense, and repeat this for several days, as it will help heal; this is best in youth.
And then apply a suitable poultice until it heals.
If the pain is spread throughout the thigh or leg, put them in a position that holds water according to the method used in the hot spring.
And this is the method of water treatment, and you have already written about it in the treatise on the rectification of medicines. Prepare a mixture of alkali and caustic substances from both sources, grind them, and place them in a new mold where the opening left by the departure is pierced with a small tool according to the amount that goes into it.
And then put the bottom of the mold in another vein or source, and place over it the hot alkali and caustic water with your hand, and after pressing them together, leave the mold so that the hot water from the medicine descends through the opening left in the cold water-filled mold.
And then adjust all that water, and add another living cause and a renewing alkaline, because it will serve as a powerful and sharp remedy, which is administered in many medical operations and cauterization of the other members, for operation is from fire.
And there are certain medicines that include cauterization with wide bandages, both quickly and skillfully, and cause a pleasant sensation and the cure of evil in such a way that they are mixed.
He here recounts a story of an ancient man who performed an operation and cure for the pain of water (perhaps referring to hydrocele or a similar condition) and sciatica, and magnifies it as a remarkable feat. He states that this method is indeed effective and there is no need for other treatments, and because of its strength, one should immerse the affected part in water and ice to achieve the same result.
And it is that near a certain vein (or perhaps a specific location), if it is not obstructed by a vein, a recent fig (or possibly a different object) should be used; many times it is squeezed with a little gray substance and placed in the water where the pain is, or on the affected part, or on the leg, and it is bound.
And it should be left for a period of three hours or for as long as the condition requires relaxation of the adhesion.
Then immerse him in water and as the body of the patient becomes heated, insert hot compresses into the affected area, as this relieves pain and promotes healing.
And know that one should not use cautery with these medicines unless it is for the evacuation of the bowels.
You may already know that when the narrow vein of the foot is cauterized, it heals well; and the cautery should be applied to him in this manner: take wool and dip it in old oil, and place it between the toes and between the bones.
Then take dry goat hair and make an ember with fire inside, and place it on the wool and let it spread within. And then repeat this process, and do not cease to do so until the sensation of the bite disappears into the water and relieves the pain.
And this type of cautery is called a cow cautery.
Chapter XLII.
On the cauterization of joint pain.
Sometimes pain is felt in the back for various reasons, such as from a fall or blow or from excessive discharge, and for similar causes, due to the infusion of foreign, irritating material.
And cauterization does not apply to any other species but this one, which is caused by the discharge of foreign, irritating material.
Therefore, for the evacuation of the malady, prepare pills that resemble them and make them over the part where the pain is felt three lines deep according to its extent, applying cautery in each line as much or little as the patient's endurance allows, depending on the strength of the malady and the virtue of the treatment.
And cauterization should be done with a pointed cautery.
And if you wish, cauterize with three cauteries or four with nail-shaped cauteries according to this form:
Chapter XXXIII.
On cauterization at the onset of yellow fever.
These manifestations should be closely observed in small children; the onset of this illness in children is marked by stiffness in their little joints, and elevation and movement aggravate the condition.
And it examines the last spinal bone of the back and the joints connected to it that begin to protrude over the other spinal bones.
And so when you see this and wish to prevent it, you cauterize it with a circular cautery in the following shape: that takes the cautery across all parts of the spine evenly.
And if you wish, cauterize around the spine with a pointed cautery in two or three lines. And the points should be proper among themselves.
Then properly care for the area until it heals as we have said.
Be careful that cautery is not administered to a swelling that is caused by a spasm of nerves.
Chapter LXXIV.
**On the Cauterization of Gout and Joint Pain**
When joint pain is caused by cold humors that infiltrate each part of the body, and pain occurs in the feet, it is customarily called gout by doctors.
And thus, gout caused by cold humors is treated with a heating method and not just alleviating the pain, then cautery is used.
And it is because you cauterize the appropriate evacuation in the circulation of the joint of the foot with various cautery tools.
And this is the form of the olive cautery:
And if it is necessary to make points on the surface of the foot, then do so with a pointed cautery. And if the pain intensifies within the joints or other parts of the body, and this persists, then cauterize it with three or four cautery instruments using this olive cautery.
And if you need to use these cautery instruments, then cauterize the area and do not press too hard with the cautery, merely touch the specific part of the chain.
And if the pain persists within the joint and the bone, then administer the cautery as we have mentioned in the previous chapter.
And if the pain is in the muscles only and is called rheum, then make points along the course of the tendons thus as they revolve, points on those two lines.
And if the pain persists in these, make points along the course of the tendons on each bone and on the tendon of the hand.
And if the pain can also spread to joints or muscles, then apply a cautery to the affected parts throughout the limbs.
And do not discharge the patient from good care and the reception of medicines, for if good care is taken and the fever is removed by this cautery, then the patient will be healed, God willing.
Chapter .xlv. (45)
On cauterization of fractures.
When a fracture occurs in the angles and opens hernias against the intestines, at this point, it is necessary to begin by asking the patient to stop eating on that day and to use gentle remedies so that the hernia does not protrude from their abdomen.
Then continue to support the patient between your hands on their back, and instruct them to keep their breath inside so that any hernia or opening of intestines does not occur.
Then return the intestine to its place, and carefully try to close the rupture on the bone of the thigh, marking the end of the fracture's extent similar to a circle at the upper openings of the body.
And now, apply the cautery in the shape as follows:
Into which a hot and wet compress should be applied. And then return the intestine or hernia to its cavity, and place your hand over the area to prevent the intestine from coming out.
You have already opened the space between the patient's thighs, placed a cushion under them, another servant on their legs, and another on their chest, holding their hands.
Then apply the cautery again over that mark with your hand holding the cautery straight, and try to get the tooth of the nail into the middle of the toe; and repeat this another time if it does not come out at first attempt.
And observe carefully the state of the hernia during the cauterization, so as not to cause that hernia any harm that might lead to death or other grave illness on top of the existing condition.
And you should know that when you apply the cautery, do not touch the bone, do not interfere with your operation.
And take care that the cautery of children be subtle according to their size and measure.
And take care of the cautery site for three days, applying hot compresses until the burning sensation disappears.
And take care of the other burns until they heal.
And the patient should be laid on their back for 10 days until the wound is healed and the pain subsides.
And take care that the patient's diet be adjusted according to the duration of their healing process, restraining them from eating anything that might disturb their stomach, and prevent the intestine from protruding due to effort during recovery.
And when it is necessary to lift after about ten days, then administer a suitable treatment and keep him on this for another forty days.
And he should reduce his work and the intake of food and drink, and avoid loud voices, for when one follows this regimen of healing entirely, they will be healed.
And I will explain the treatment for ruptures in other parts of the abdomen, which begins at the start, and if they do not heal, cauterize the rupture with a red hot cautery according to its size, and it should be done so that what is expelled from the body comes out as well; and then care for this as we have said, and do not make it too tight.
And some have said that the first rupture should be cauterized with a triangular cautery according to this form, because it is marked by attempt.
And it is a pause line that they hold by the width on the cloth above the rupture, and another line above it; then place your hand with a pointed cautery, but the first cautery is lighter and better.
Chapter XLVI.
On cauterization of twists.
When pain ends in various members due to cold or impact and the pain persists for a long time and does not yield to treatment with medicines, then apply cauterization with a pointed cautery.
And the cautery should be applied to each member according to its size and depth, and the nature and location of the twist and pain it suffers.
Therefore, if it is healed by the first cautery, well; otherwise, repeat the cautery on it; for usually those pains are punctures in members close to them, so you must succeed with cauteries until the illness is cured.
Chapter .xlvii.
On the cauterization of leprosy.
Lepers sometimes require cauterization due to severe damage, especially if the type of leprosy is characterized by putrefaction of the flesh and melancholy.
So, when you wish to cauterize it, consider whether the leprosy is acute or chronic, and treat it according to what has been said in the previous division, without causing further damage, especially if the disease has spread throughout the body and threatens its entire structure. You should cauterize it on the head, starting at the center of the scalp and then moving downwards, and also on both sides, forming two horns; and behind, upon the nape or neck.
Finally, with your hand, apply the cautery slightly inside where it touches the bone, allowing any remaining fluids to drain, thus alleviating the release of harsh vapors; and cauterize on the surface as necessary.
And if leprosy has already spread over the body and appears manifestly, then cover it with cautery those cauteries which we have mentioned in the beginning; cauterize on the tip of the nose, and two cauteries on each eye-socket, and two cauteries on both spines of the neck, and six cauteries on the spine of the back, and one great cautery on the spines near the coccyx, and one on the coccyx itself, and two on each ankle, and one on each heel, and two on each thigh, and two on each muscle, and cauterize the tendons of their feet; cauterize over all the joints of the upper and lower limbs, and over every talon of their feet, and on the soles.
And beware of the nerves which are on the sole, do not irritate those.
And in some cases, it is cauterized with one cautery on the bone of the penis and another on the opening of the stomach, and another on the sigmoid colon.
And you should know that the more precise the cautery, the greater its benefit and effectiveness; and you should know that illness does not reside in the cautery itself, but rather in its application, since the body of the patient is already numbed.
And take note that the size of the cautery should be great or small according to the members and joints as previously mentioned regarding the types of instruments.
Then apply the cautery with fine flour mixed with honey and other remedies, as long as it heals.
Chapter .xlviii.
On the cauterization of stupor.
When a member is stuck or numbed and treated with medicines, oils, and bandages, but it does not heal, then you cauterize the stuck member with cautery according to the size of the member or the extent of its numbness.
And let the hot cautery enter slightly into the depth of the wound. And then apply that remedy until it heals.
And in some cases, a cautery is used to alleviate the pain that radiates to the most and feet, the spine of the back, and the tension of the nerves which affect that limb, and the pain is alleviated.
One must not attempt this unless one is knowledgeable in the anatomy of the limbs and the exit of nerves throughout the body's movements.
Chapter .XLVIII (or .xlix)
On the cauterization of bleeding wounds.
When the wound is old and does not heal with any of the common medications, then apply a cautery to it, using a pointed cautery according to the quantity of the specific kind of cord until the whiteness and color of it are reduced and its color changes.
And then prepare a remedy from flour of oats and lentils mixed with olive oil and leaves of arnica, or pigeon's blood or deer's blood, each one separately and all together, and apply it as a compress to the affected area until it heals.
It appears that the text you've provided is incomplete or lacks context for a precise translation. The term "Capitol .l." could refer to various things depending on the subject matter or surrounding text. Without additional context, it's challenging to offer an accurate translation. If this is from a medical treatise, it might refer to a specific treatment or a part of the body, but more information would be needed to confirm.
**Cauterization of Cracks:**
When cancer begins to form and you want to remove it, then cauterize it with a circular cautery along its edge as it rotates.
And the learned say that it should be cauterized with the last cautery in the middle place; but I have not seen this, for I fear it may be ulcerated, and I have seen this a few times before.
It is better to cauterize it along its edge with a circular cautery as we have said, or with a few cauterizations.
Chapter.
On cauterization of abscesses.
When an abscess is slow to heal, it may be due to excess fluid, or the state of the illness, for it is old and weak, lacking strength, or because of time, and you wish to hasten the healing of the abscess; then cauterize along its edge with a few small punctate cauterizations; and apply pressure to it, as it will aid in maturation.
If you wish to make the incision with a cautery, first heat the cautery whose shape is thus: and place it in the middle of the prepared area until the thread penetrates.
And if the cautery is applied to that place which is most painful, in order to relieve the pressure on the arm; and then take care that it heals properly.
**Chapter II.**
**On the cauterization of corrosion.**
Corrosion is a spreading decay in the member which eats away the tissue as if it were dry wood being consumed by fire.
Therefore, if you encounter that corrosion in a place which is to be treated with fire, heat cautery clamps, small and large as appropriate for the location of the corrosion.
And then apply cautery from all sides until you eliminate all corruption and do not leave any cause for it.
And then apply a poultice for three days, placing it over the cauterized areas, every three hours, using a mixture of oils until all scars are completely eradicated and all corruption eliminated.
And then treat it with a warm, blood-letting poultice.
It may be that after three days, the flesh will have healed without corruption, which is good; but if not, the cautery should be repeated over what remains corrupted in the affected areas.
And for corrosion, it is treated with certain sharp medicines, as those which are applied instead of cautery. However, it is better to use a hot cautery for treating young wounds.
And you have already spoken of the cure for it with sharp medicine in the division, so take that which you will need from it to be prepared.
**Chapter XXXIII**
On Cauterization of Claws and Similar Conditions
You often see protrusions in the parts around the foot afflicted with malady, which is called a claw, and it causes great pain, entering the foot; these are treated according to two methods: there is cauterization with fire and cauterization with water.
Cauterization with fire is done by igniting the cautery instrument shaped like a bird's claw, made of iron according to the quantity of the claw in all its parts, and it should have subtle edges.
And then place that hot instrument on the toe, and rotate your hand with the cautery around the toe until it reaches the depth of the toe. And leave that for three days until it begins to heal. Then apply that paste made from wild mallows trifolded with salt to it, and leave the paste on it for one night, so that it will be eradicated from its roots.
Then care for the area with generative flesh-based ointment until it is healed.
And if it does not heal and various accidents occur on the surface of the body, especially in the joints and feet, then you must administer to those cauteries with water, and take a small pipe of earth or iron or a needle, and place that over the toe; then pour a few drops of water into the pipe, hold your hand, and rotate it with compression on the toe, pushing the edge of the pipe along the root of the toe, and watch the water flow out from the root of the toe. Wait for the patient to feel the bite of the cold water for an hour, then remove it, because the toe will be freed from its roots.
And thus they do to those who have it, return the other within them so that all of its parts in their body come together.
And then take care of those pus that the roots of the clots have been eradicated with these ointments that the flesh engenders.
Chapter III.
On cauterization of tremor.
When you encounter any tremor caused by friction on the nerves or by fever from a harmful cause, or for any other similar reason, it is necessary to cauterize that with four cautery points or two over each spinal joint, and also cauterize the foot of the patient and the stomach with olive cautery.
And the tremor of the patient will cease and hasten the healing of the harmful illness.
Chapter .lv.
On cauterization for accidental burns on the body.
When burns on the body cause blisters and cracks filled with corrupt thick matter, at the beginning, cover it with an appearance that is cauterized over all parts of the fistula with a delicate cautery or a mirt's twig, whose tip is extended towards the fire; or shave it with a long razor; or cauterize it with a lenticular cautery.
And in some cases, cauterization is also applied at the beginning of its expulsion according to this method; they are not rigid, and the excess matter is removed from them, thereby healing those affected.
However, it may be necessary to cover that this is done with an evacuation through phlebotomy.
Chapter LVI.
On the cauterization of flux of blood from an accidental wound by incision of the artery.
Wounds that show a flux of blood from an artery that has been incised must be treated immediately, or after the incision of blisters or cauterization on a limb, and it appears similar, and it is difficult to control that.
Therefore, when this happens to anyone, you must use both your hands on the wound's edge, pressing firmly until the bleeding stops, and ensure that the bandage is placed correctly so that it does not move.
And then apply a few small and large olive cauterizes on the fire, and blow into them until they are ignited.
And then carefully take from them a small or large amount, according to the location and the illness in which the artery is broken, and apply the cautery swiftly so that it is incised and the flow of blood restricted.
And if the blood is expelled from the orifice of the artery as you withdraw the cautery and remove it, take another cautery carefully from those prepared in the fire, and continue doing this until the flow of blood is restricted.
And be careful not to hurt the nerve here, which might bring about other evils for the patient.
And you should know that when blood flows from an artery, it is not possible to restrict the flow in those cases, especially when the artery is large, unless by one of four means: either with cautery as mentioned above, or by drawing it out when it is not drawn out, for when its extremities are cut off, the flow of blood is restricted and the clot is tightened; or tied up with thread or ligature by strong constriction; or medicated so that its virtue restricts the flow of blood; or compressed with a cushion at the cost of great pain.
He who administers a reasonable restriction of movement and applies compression with bandages or due to burning causes and similar ones, does not relieve but aggravates.
If this must be done for someone and neither the doctor nor medicine is present, then open the mentioned passage of the affected vein as we have said, and understand the great constriction within it that prevents the plague from spreading; and on the swelling, do not apply remedies but rather pour cold water over it until the inflammation cools down and subsides; and consider what cautery or medicine is needed.
Of incisions, punctures, blisters, phlebotomy, wounds, and their likes.
We have discussed in the first chapter all illnesses in which fire cauterization is appropriate and medicinal burning useful, along with their occasions and causes, and the instruments necessary for it, according to the forms of the cautery; I have arranged the chapters on the ascending order from head to feet.
And you will proceed in this chapter in such a manner that it may relieve those who seek it, as far as it is necessary.
And before you begin this, know, children, that this chapter is about fear, as it is in the first chapter of cauterization.
And since it is necessary to be in great caution, for the operation which is in this chapter often requires the evacuation of blood, which is dangerous to life; you must apply the vein or make an incision over the abscess, or perceive the discharge, or purify the wound, or extract the arrow, or begin the healing process, and similar things. And all these are accompanied by fear and trembling, and in most cases, death.
And I warn you that this should not fall upon you, for sometimes you must be careful with the ways of men, as with the sudden ways of illnesses. And it is of their nature that as soon as you turn away from their illness, death must be slighted; and this because of the vehemence with which it finds its illness, and because of the longevity of his illness, and the fearsome illness for which death means.
And it is those who give to you joy and words of hope, expecting health from them; and their illness is deadly.
Therefore, do not agree with anyone who comes to you of this nature; let your caution be greater than belief and your greed; do not presume any cause regarding it except through certain knowledge that verifies for you what must happen to them, and to which a commendable succession has occurred.
Use in the treatment of all your illnesses the prognosis and indication of that which is to be made whole, for it assists you in acquiring fame and memory, praise and glory.
Oh, sons, let God inspire your understanding and do not seek direction and protection elsewhere, for it is in His hands.
And you have ordered this chapter to be distinguished into sections according to what precedes in the chapter on cautery, from the treatment of the head down to the feet, so that it may assist you in anything concerning which you inquire and of which you stand in need.
First Chapter.
On the treatment of water contained in the head of children.
You should know that this illness often causes complications during childbirth, and when the child is born, the mother's life is in danger.
And sometimes it occurs unexpectedly due to an unknown cause.
This illness is rarely seen in adults; indeed, I have only witnessed it leading to death, and for this reason, I have observed its effects on the bodies of those who have passed away.
And you have seen that the head of a child, whose skull was filled with water, was always thus magnified to such an extent that it could not be compressed by any means due to the size of its head, and indeed, the humidity increased to the point of causing death by fire.
And this humidity is either added between the bone and the skull, or it accumulates beneath the bones on the brain.
For the operation, if the humidity is between the tendon and the bone and the apostema is small, you must make an opening in the middle part of the head as a fissure in width, and the length of the fissure should be two fingers deep so that the humidity can flow, and this is the shape of the spatulum.
And if the humidity is greatly increased and the apostema is larger, then here are two fissures according to this manner:
And if the humidity leaves the bone, it signals that you must fully open the commissures of the head and the water is squeezed out when you compress that part with your hand inside, and this should not be withheld. You must make an opening in the middle part of the head as three fissures according to this manner:
And then remove the incision and drain all the moisture; tighten the openings with bandages and sheets; drill holes from above into the wound and apply vinegar and oil within five days, loosen the stitches and treat the infection with poultices and ointments, tighten the bandage equally; and feed the patient dry bread with little moisture until the member is strengthened and healed.
And there is another way of making an incision, which considers the magnitude of the abscess and the collection of water, as sometimes it appears at the back of the head, or in front, or on the right, or on the left; therefore, pay attention to the incision where the abscess appears and the swelling of the water, and do this as best as possible.
And observe that you do not incise the artery and seek to drain blood and prevent the patient from suffering due to the flow of blood during the evacuation of moisture.
**Second Chapter**
When there is an event or injury to the ears or feet, and it is ancient and does not respond to medical treatment, then the final cure in this case is the incision of those two arteries.
And therefore, when you wish to incision those that the patient's malady has made its head, then rub the place with rough cloth to expose the arteries, and tighten the collar of the malady with some cloth; then consider where the vein pulses; and the places of each over the places that are close to the auricles become dull, and they are concealed in certain people.
And then place a seal over the artery with a bandage, and incision each one with the sharp edge of the scalpel as the incision reaches within the bone, and this is according to the size of the head.
And if you wish, insert the spatula between the artery and squeeze it to press against the opening of its compartments.
And the length of the incision should be such that when a vein is incised, the blood flow is immediately halted by the pressure, which otherwise would gush out frequently.
But if the artery does not appear at the belt, then measure from the edge a distance of three digits and make an incision here, then carefully open it and enter within the bone.
And the amount of blood that gushes out should be about a cupful, and do not let it flow more or less, and all this depends on the extent of the patient's weakness and the elasticity of the artery.
And consider the plague, and therefore if there remains any cause of infection on the bone, incise it here so that it does not lead to gangrene.
And then apply a strong poultice with feathers and linen cloth from the drapes, and take care of it until it heals.

Extracting the arteries located in the temples.
When an ancient or sudden migraine occurs due to excessive humidity and the state of the temples' lacertae (possibly referring to the skin or membranes), resembling those of a sore throat, and standard medical treatments are ineffective, we often resort to extracting arteries in the temples through cauterization, as previously mentioned.
The method of the operation and extraction of these is to address the condition that causes them in the temples; and understand the artery involved in the temple as you have seen it pulsating, which is hidden from most people due to its velocity and force.
And if the patient's condition is obscure, tighten the opening of the wound with a cloth; then rub the area with a rough cloth or evaporate it with boiled water until the inflammation appears to you manifestly. And then you take the sputum that has this form: And then you cut the cord with ease to reach the inflammation; and tie it at its origin and extract it from the upper parts until you extract that from the cord and discover that of the tunics which are left, from every part.
If the artery is thin, then you should wrap it at the end of the finger and cut it into a segment according to the amount by which its extremities are elongated and contracted, and if they are not cut, blood will not flow from them.
And then evacuate the bowels of wine within three.
And if the swelling is great, you should bind it in two places with a strong double thread of silk or with cords, and do not allow putrefaction to occur in front of the healing of the wound and apply flow of blood.
Then incise the excess that is between two ligaments; and do this at that time or another time.
And if you wish, cauterize it with a hot iron within the bone or cut a knife across its extremities, and apply that kind of work in that place.
And it is better work if the patient has fever or a cold complication; for cauterization is of those causes that help to end humidity, and therefore it is better in youth.
And then carefully extract the tendons that you have loosened from their original position, and place them properly in their place, adequately dusted, and treat with dry medicines to make the flesh and bones heal completely.
And if while working another time the flow of blood from the tendon occurs, then you must constrict that blood flow, either with a cautery or by filling the socket, and strengthen your hand until the blood is stopped. And if any of these causes is not present for you, then place your hand over the area until the pain is frozen, and apply the location with water of intense coldness until the sensitivity subsides, and tighten according as necessary.
And what is more lightly extracted from the tendon, it is that you cauterize the vein with this cautery having two edges, after you have felt both locations by trying, and stop them, ignite some fire, until they reach the bone and cut the vein in two places, so that what is between the extremities of the patient is elongated, as it is not solidified entirely by this cauterization.
And this is the form of the cautery:
And the sharpness of both knees serves as an example. However, it may be better to have greater sharpness than two knees, because if they are very sharp, they do not cut the flesh too quickly.
Therefore, when there is no great size involved, the heat of the fire is retained in them and the flesh is cut slightly.
And this work is better than any other and is performed more lightly.
And the space between the two knees is the amount of thickness of that.
Capital quarter.
On the treatment of acute and acidic eye sores.
When the eye sores are acidic, and this affects those veins located on the surface of the head, deforing it, and no medical cause for treatment is identified, the patient's face may appear discolored and their front movements are so hindered as if they were being moved by ants, and the eyes of the affected individual are exhausted, humid to the point that their eyelids are uncomfortable, and their eyelashes chafed due to the intensity of the tears. The ancient remedies for treating such conditions in this operation are sparse.
And so you command the patient to pull their eyebrows, which are located on their forehead, and then make three cuts in the forehead, evenly spaced apart according to the length of the forehead. And if the length of the fissure is two days: one fissure should be equidistant from the length of the nose at the middle point of the forehead, and the second according to the length of a small movement of the eyelids which are in the lacrimal, and the third from the other side.
And observe the beginning of the arteries which are in two openings, and extend your hand along the continuation of both mandibles. And if the space of each incision is three days, adjust accordingly.
And if you have a piece of sponge prepared or dry cloth with which to absorb the blood.
Then insert the spatula with its two sharp ends, which is the form of the incision for it: That concerns the part of the temples within the second incision. Excise all the cord between two incisions at the muscle that is above the bone, and then do this from the median incision into the second incision. And then stretch this space and insert another instrument called a scalpel, sharp on one side and not sharp on the other.
And place the sharp edge of this instrument against the flesh attached to the tendon, and the blunt side against the bone, and use it to reach the median fissure, and cut away all the vessels that descend from the head to the feet.
The incision should be continued to where the tendon becomes visible, and then make this in the median fissure within the other fissure.
And when the flow of blood stops, squeeze the areas of the frozen parts of the veins.
Then apply some cold water and oil to each crack, and press over those powdery substances that are wet in wine and oil, and be sure not to allow any infection.
On the third day, remove the bandage and apply a great deal of warm water or tea, then treat it with basilicum water or rose oil and other remedies to ensure that the wounds are healed.
It appears that the text provided is incomplete or missing context, making it challenging to determine its meaning or provide an accurate translation. The term "Capitol" could refer to several things depending on the context, such as a geographical location, a building, or even a name. Without additional information, I cannot offer a meaningful translation.
Regarding the treatment of tears due to cataracts and the descent of fluids from within the head.
When a sudden and continuous purging occurs, and the patient's feet are exhausted from walking, and their attention is weakened, and their eyelids are ulcerated, and their eyes' lashes are fallen out, and sharp pain is felt in the head along with subsequent vomiting, then you know that these accidents occur when materials and purge come not from within but from the veins of the parts proceeding outward.
And the best cure for these is this: command the patient to clear their front, and then cut a fissure in the middle of the forehead, slightly to one side (and begin the incision from the left temple towards the right temple; and make the cut within the bone; and with your hand, remove the clotted blood from the temples, which is best after mastication). As long as the bone is exposed.
Dry all the pus with a sponge or clean cloth, and then fill between the two edges of the fissure with warm, thin fabric or a clean cloth. And then apply to them dry poultices soaked in wine and oil, lest they contract a dangerous infection.
And when you cut it and see that the infection has already decreased, then you know to rub the bone that begins in the deepest flesh, and apply a dry dressing made from mixing two parts of flour and four parts of colophony, as if you were making a paste, and administer this remedy to these wounds of carnal origin.
Chapter VI
On the treatment of what cats have in their ears.
Any cause that cats have in their ears is one of four types: it may be a hard mineral or something similar, such as iron or copper, or it could be from plants like chickpeas or fava beans, or fluid-related, such as water mixed with wine and similar substances, or some animal.
And therefore when a catarrh occurs in the ear or any other similar cause that does not adjust or adhere to the ear, hold the ear to the sun, and if the catarrh persists, it will distill into some cause of violet oil or butter, then administer the extraction of it, and make it flow out in a condition, and oppose the nose to prevent the sneeze. And then place some pieces of cloth or wool around the ear canal and pull the ear away from its attachment, as these movements often dislodge the causes behind these issues.
If it is not dislodged, then administer the extraction of it with the instrument called a delicate epichiric forceps, of which this is the form:
And if it is dislodged with the forceps, then it is good; otherwise, administer the extraction of it with a very thin instrument with slight curvature.
And therefore, if it is not forgotten, make a cannula of linen and insert the end of the cannula into the channel of the ear, closing around the cannula with wax and soft oil so that only the cannula opens. And then extract the tongue with great force, as it is often seen with what we have described.
If this method is forgotten, take a piece of hot embers or a torch with which the outsides of the limbs are gently heated, and place that on the end of the ray, then neatly wrap it around. Then insert it into the ear canal with ease, and carefully dry the ear from moisture.
And therefore, if all the causes we have described are not forgotten, then quickly tie off that which causes abscess or spasms.
And the method of cutting is that you begin by cauterizing the infection from the saphenous vein and extract the pus according to the nature of its virtue, then make an incision between your fingers and turn the edge away from the parts above, and make a small fissure at the base of the edge where the greasiness of the pus has been most pressed against it. And if the fissure extends to the pear (testicle), and when the pear is swollen, you can stop it with an appropriate instrument; then quickly apply pressure to the fissure at that time to heal it.
And if the cause of the pain in the auricle is one of the grasses that have grown and are inflamed, then administer treatment and extract it; but if you do not follow your own advice, then take some thin sponge according to this form: and administer the removal of that grass which has fallen into the auricle.
And do not attempt this when you think the affected area is already moistened by heat, place it on heavy weights, or try to extract it with scissors or subtle movements, or through incision as we have said, for it eases the extraction.
In the water that enters the ear, it is important to understand that the disease often starts with sneezing, and the inner ear should be filled with some soft substance up to a certain extent. Then, place your hot hand on the affected ear and if the water is expelled through this method, it is successful. Otherwise, take a few peals of eggs or lemon and slightly warm them in the fire, and then place one of these between the patient's fingers and press hard against the ear canal. Therefore, do not stop until all the water is expelled.
Therefore, do not stop until all the water is expelled. And already the water has been drawn off so that you take some paper or cloth, and place one end of it in the ear and extend the other end over the fire until the entire length is burned.
Then place another cloth and repeat this process until all the water is drawn out, and strip off that one with the cannula as they say the water drawer.
In the extraction of a foreign body from an ear, if it is small and resembles one, it should be treated as we have said in division; but if it is of great size which causes appearance at the sense of disease, then administer the extraction of it by gesture and incision, and the cause of it is pus more lightly than all other causes that catch in the ear.
In the extraction of worms generated in the ear, when you treat it with the methods we have said in division and in the treatment of distills, and do not agree with your care, then take care to watch the ear towards the sun.
And therefore, if any cause of the worms appears here, then extract them with careful or subtle gestures, but if no cause appears, take a tube that is narrow at one end and wide at the other, which is the form of it. Then insert the extremely subtle end into the ear according to the amount of suffering from the malady; then suck it with a strong suction, and do this in turns, until all worms are expelled.
If you do not follow this method, then seal and close the tube in the circle of the ear with wax as we have said; administer distills which have already been prepared in the treatment of worms, and you will find this in the treatise on distills.
And your flow of oil with which you pour medicinal oils into the ear, is with this instrument, whose form is as follows: And make a small, narrow incision in silver or iron, leaving it open, and place a plate over it.
And so it is with what is in the cavity of the container here, it will be necessary. And if you wish, take the ray and wrap it around the end decently close, and then pour oil into the cavity of the hearing aid, or some herbal juice, or whatever you choose from these medicines into the canula — in the ear —, and then insert the ray under the skin and press with your hand to make a compressed wound so that the oil is expelled into the cavity of the hearing aid and the patient feels the oil inside.
And what is inserted into the ear should already be softened with a small amount of fire. And be careful that the cause which you have distilled in the ear is not too severe, because the ear medications do not tolerate this.
Capital .VII.
On the treatment of earache.
Sometimes certain children have an inflammation of their parents' bellies that is not perforating, and this also happens in some adults, an inflammation of the tissue inside the ear due to a plague or a wound, nothing external; and sometimes this inflammation is in the area surrounding the hole of the ear, which is not always apparent.
And those that occur in the area surrounding it, which do not comprehend the cause, are in the most difficult situations for healing.
And in those where you can perceive the cause, take the patient's ear to the sunlight and examine it. And therefore, if an abundance appears, open that delicate blade of which this is the shape.
If the extremity of the blade where the width is required has one side sharp and the other not; and the blade is of two lengths to prevent it from cutting into the skin.
And therefore, if the enlargement is due to flesh grown in the earl or in the body of the blade, then take those delicate scissors and cut with a sharp ease until all the flesh is removed.
And if the enlargement is in the root of the earl, then take a thin knife and heat it with a little fire, and then insert it into the flesh of the earl.
And therefore, if you have sensed an enlargement as something that the patient finds easy to remove, due to its urgency, exert pressure on it to facilitate its removal; and be careful not to hurt the nerves of the earl.
And then place it (the cloth) on the affected area according to the width of the wound you have wrapped with the Egyptian ointment; do this for several days until you are certain of the healing of the ulcer or take some and pour it into waters and sprinkle over it after every third day and use it; if the ulcer has already formed a crust, be careful not to destroy the water and replace it with another water that you wrap in cloth that is made of oil or grease, until the sore cauterized wound yields. And then tend to it so that it heals.
If a flow of pus occurs, then immerse a clean cloth or drape in hot water and place it on the affected area, and use another treatment that you have prepared to stop the flow of pus, as mentioned in the distillation treatise.
**Chapter VIII**
On the treatment of atherosclerosis affecting the eyelids.
Moisturize the eyelids of the eyes sometimes become dry, sometimes moist.
So it is necessary that you have these tools or scissors, and cut off the rough edges from their roots, and then place your hand over the affected areas.
If the pain flows with hot blood venously, then you should cauterize them with a subtle antilithic cautery.
And the best cautery is to make incisions and return them when there is no cause for their roots; and when cauterized with fire, those roots are consumed and do not return.
Chapter IX.
Treatment for a severe condition that comes to the eyelids of the eyes.
Motas visible on the eyelids of the eyes, caused by some condition, resemble great strength and hardness, hence they are called cataracts.
And there is an addition of thick moisture on the lower and upper eyelids.
Therefore, the operation on them considers when the great size is proceeding from what appears on the eyelid and is reduced entirely; and the cause of it is slight.
Therefore, cut along that narrow fissure, and extrude it entirely with ease, and then suspend that one from above, and cut and separate that.
And if the swelling is large, you adjust it with a stitch; and treat it until it heals.
And if it is minor, you will not suffer greatly because the heat of the poultice restores and incarnates it.
And if the enlargement is decreasing within the folds of the eyelid, you must remove the surface, lift the eyelid, and suspend the enlargement with a stitch, other than what you initially desired, and press it from all sides; and if the eyelid itself is elongated for some reason, this should not be noticed in any case.
Then make the incision, wash the wound with salt water; and treat the area with hot compresses until it heals.
Chapter X.
Regarding the treatment of the eyelid above the eye.
Axcirnath is an inflammation caused by the growth in the layers of the eyelid above, and it most often appears in children, aggravating their eyes and leading to their discharge; and due to this, they cannot see the clarity of the sun as tears accumulate on their eyes.
And so you apply these to their faces all the time and while they sleep; and as a result, the eyebrows on their eyelids become moistened, already covering inflammation, and the imminent occurrence of discharge appears in the eye; and when you press the area with your fingers, you feel acuteness within those.
And certain techniques of operation are used when the hernia is in the thigh, and a cloth is placed over it and cold applied; then the hernia is formed according to the amount that contains the seed from all sides, and the aforementioned is placed on top of it and pressed with your fingers throughout so that discharge accumulates in the middle of the ring, and then ends in the middle of the other by applying a humid spatum to the fissure according to its extent, and the fissure should not be larger than the one made in flaubotomia.
Place the heated knife in the opening and completely cut through until you reach the cavity, for in the most advanced cases, the cavity itself is blocked by a white, grainy deposit.
Then extract those rags that you have wrapped around the affected parts outside and twist them between your right and left hand until they are completely severed.
And be careful not to pull back the edges of the opening, so that the spatulum does not go beyond and tear it.
If it does not appear to your assistant at the beginning of the fissure, then adjust the fissure a little more easily until the process begins; and then extract those rags that we have mentioned; and subsequently immerse them in water and vinegar, apply pressure over the area, and sprinkle on some powders.
And then some who squeeze salt and place it in the cavity of the fissure to draw out that which is removed by that moisture.
And then attend to that inside which must be healed.
If it happens at the infected site with caution, then treat it with plaster until it heals.
Chapter XI.
On the ways of examining through touch.
When in the eyelids of the eyes there are growths due to natural aging, and these become painful, causing constant tears and softening of the eyelids, which leads to the destruction of the eye that is called "tactinir of the eye," and its cure is in four ways: either with a pointed cautery over fire; or with acute medicine as mentioned previously in the chapter on cauterization; or by incising and stitching them; or with canes, as I will explain.
And so take care to place the head of the patient in a low position; then turn the eyelid with your left hand, and if it turns, that is good; otherwise, insert a needle into the area where the lid is stuck, and let the needle penetrate through the thread onto the lid, close to the edge of the eyelid where there are no hairs, and pull the thread away from the lid and turn it to the side.
Then, within the gap between the eyelid and the hairs, carefully cut with a scalpel the thread that joins the greater lacrimal to the lesser; remove the thread and place the eyelid gently using small cotton or cloth swabs, then press it firmly with your finger, forming a shape like a mitten.
However, it is important to consider that the shape should be adjusted according to the amount of swelling in the eyelid, as this varies among individuals; those with greater swelling will require a deeper cut into the eyelid.
And then cut open the space between the two lines that you have identified, starting from the lacrimal gland greater to the lacrimal gland lesser. And if your fracture is near the natural hairline, it should be treated with equal severity as that of a king.
And then place the onion in one of the two angles of the wound, scrape it entirely, and adjust the stitching of the two lips with glue or fine wool, clean the pus, and make what is superfluous of the medications adhere to both eyebrows for certain reasons, if you wish, but if not, do not treat it.
And then, after three or four days, examine the stitching of the medications and take care of it.
And if you wish, leave the plague open without stitching, and treat it with what dries and constricts, because the eyelid is lifted due to the sealing of the plague and the addition of medications; but more stitching is better. Thus, I have told you the ancient remedies for this.
Despite the stress placed on the patient, it is a good operation, and there is no cause for fear.
And there is another way to treat it, where one sees on the eyelid a growth resembling a cherry, and then lifts the eyelid with three incisions, separating and bringing it together in this manner:
But if this is not possible, having made the incisions, and it does not heal equally, take a needle with a thread and insert one into the center of the growth, and the other two close to the lacrimal ducts, and adjust between them so that the threads are equal, then raise your hand in the same elevation as before, lifting the entire eyelid over the area where it was grown.
And then adjust the two edges of the wound with stitches, and heal that which is healthy.
If an abscess occurs after your incision or fistula, treat it with cerate and resemble it, and anoint it with fire.
And in some cases, it is necessary for the eyelids that their hairs turn, so use what we have mentioned above regarding incision; however, a more artificial suture is often used in some.
Inserting needles is done in this manner: and it is that you turn the eyelid and divide the figure within according to what I have mentioned; then, using a needle or two thin splints whose length corresponds to the length of the eyelid and whose width is proportional to the width of the space, do as follows: And you have already made incisions at the ends of each split, where you have the threads.
Nearby, add some subtlety to what superfluous of the eyelid of the eye, and constrict the vessels of any broken parts with strong tightness, and leave it for a few days, because the cord by the tightness will die and be rejected, and it will become relaxed until it falls on its own.
If it is delayed, then break open the abscesses, and then treat the infection until it heals.
So when it is solidified, the eyelid is raised and the hair does not hurt.
And this is the way of making two vessels according to this form: and it should have the quantity of length and width neither more nor less.
Chapter .xii.
On the elevation of sharp pimples on the skin with an agule when the skin is hard.
When there are unnatural, hard, and sharp pimples in the skin, the operation on them requires that you use a subtle needle and insert it into that delicate fiber, and then adjust the edges of it carefully and gently. And the length of the fibers should be about the size of a palm.
And then you insert another subtle needle below it briefly, and adjust the edges if you wish.
And then place the patient's head in a small position, close to the sun, so that your work is revealed, for it is a delicate and fine operation.
And then carefully insert the needle into the root of the hair where it is necessary, and make it penetrate the eyelid swiftly until you extract it from its natural hair.
Then pull the hair from its root and insert it into the oil, taking care that there is only one or two or three hairs, and no more.
Then gently pull your hand away, removing the hair from the oil into the eyelid, along with the natural hair.
If the hair is not removed from the oil and remains stuck to the eyelid, re-insert the needle into the same point where you made your incision, until the oil is completely extracted from the wound.
And then examine the wound for its appearance, as you remove the oil and thread, gently pressing around the wound, and leaving the bandage on for two or three days, until the hair attaches to its place and a new skin grows over it.
And if the hair is too short, then you adjust a longer natural hair, making it elevated to that extent that it covers some space, and then you raise it.
**Capitol XIII.**
On the treatment of a condition that appears on the eyelid above.
When you see a condition on the eyelid, it is a contraction of the eyelid when it's drawn to one side or the other, due to poor healing from a wound, section, or cauterization, and it's called leukoma, and this condition can be either natural or accidental, caused by the healing of wounds, sections, or cauterizations, or similar conditions.
The manner of the operation is that you open up that healing and separate the edges of it, placing a piece of linen cloth in between them, and then bind them together until they heal.
And be aware that you should not use the treatment for gout from the causes that dry out, as it only exacerbates the condition and brings about even worse pain than before.
Use those treatments that soften it as well, such as fenugreek, and immerse in water where the seeds are cooked, or in distilled alcohol, which is liquified with one of the oils, and apply to the affected area.
And the key to your treatment is that you pierce through every part that is not solidified according to the shape that you observe at the beginning.
And this operation that we have mentioned is nothing but a correction of the curvature that does not return to the original form as observed.
Chapter XIV.
On the care of a fracture which is done on the eyelid.
This fracture, which is done on the lower eyelid, is actually not called a fracture; it is either of natural origin or accidental.
An accidental fracture can be caused by a blow, or a cut, or a cautery, or other similar means.
The method of operating on it is that you take a needle with a double thread and insert one end into the flesh, and pass the other from the left tear duct to the right tear duct, so that the thread passes through both ends of the flesh.
Then stretch the flesh apart from its attachment with the needle and cut with a sharp knife when you have separated it from the needle, making an ample incision. And thus, the shape of the eyelid is restored according to what it should be; if not, take a reed and press that into the split shape, and turn the eyelid, and make both slits in the edge of the eyelid.
And the ends of both slits should be at two angles of the incision you have made, where they meet, and the angle between them should form their figure when they converge.
And this figure is the Greek letter lambda.
And then push the flesh away from that part which has been left open, where the eyelid is.
And then bring the separated parts together and attach them with wool thread; also, apply those treatments involving the moistening medications and cold compresses as necessary to promote healing.
And if you need to increase the opening by incision or suture or cautery, be careful to make a flat incision over the hairs of the eyelid as previously mentioned. And then separate the discharge between two lips as we have said.
In the entire discourse on the treatment of incision when it is elevated or left open, allowing it to heal, according to how it is prepared in the form of an incision, and that form varies in many ways.
And the skilled artisans always prepare various means by which they can return the affected part to its natural shape or close to it, and treat that malady according to what suits them in the operation and with the best tools at hand.
Chapter .XV.
From the adhesion of the eyelid to the conjunctiva or to the cornea.
When this adhesion occurs in many people, it makes the eyelid seem solid and fixed above the white part of the eye, hindering the ease of natural blinking and movement. Therefore, you must insert your finger between the eyelid and its edge, and gently lift or extend it away from the corner.
And then you carefully cut the adhesion with a thin spatula, not cutting too deeply, slightly blunting the edge to avoid disturbing the patient during the operation, and removing the spatula without damaging the eye's sensitivity.
And your cut should excise the adhesion with ease, allowing the eyelid to return to its natural position and ensuring that all the adhesion is healed.
And then, put salt water on the eye, which you wash it with; or distill steam from the sun, dissolved in water.
And then separate the eyelid from the eye with cold water, and place a cloth soaked in honey over the eye, and on the third day use consolidating remedies until it heals.
**Chapter XVI**
**On the incision of the eye and the prominence of the carnal tissue of the eyelids.**
**You know that an eye can be in two ways, either it is nervous and resembles a delicate glass chip, or it is non-nervous, resembling frozen white humidity; when this is pierced, the fluid is expelled, and the chip does not remain.**
**Both these conditions do not begin until the larger eyelid is involved, gradually covering the sight and blocking both light and eye movements.**
The method of operating in the incision of the hernia is that the patient should lie on their back, open the hernial ring with your hand, raise the upper eyelid with your finger, and then carefully seize the edge of the hernia with the thumb and little finger of one hand, making a gentle fold with it. Then take a needle and insert it into the edge of the hernia using a horsehair or similar thread, slowly duplicating the end of the needle, and placing it in the middle of the nail. Penetrate the hernia with the needle, tie the thread to the nail, extend it upwards, and remove the hair from around the pupil's edge. And also, cut the thread with the hair inside the hernia's opening.
Then, using a fine spatula or small scissors, incise the skin at the root of the tear duct, removing the mucous membrane to prevent continuous discharge of tears during the operation.
And some times the ungual (nail) is extended or detached, as we have said, and then it should be carefully extracted with a surgical lever of which this is the form.
And beware not to touch the tunica cornea with the lever, lest it rupture, and that the pupil is punctured.
Then make the incision in the hernia using a little salt or sharp stone, and leave it open for the next day; and then take care of it so that it heals.
If the nail is not infected and you cannot insert the needle, nor is it attached to that finger, then pay attention to this type of nail being cured with medicines, and thus healed as well as if it were cut off at the joint.
And if you want to incise that, then open the hernia wound of the patient and take a fine lever with a sharp point according to this form: With care and subtlety. And if it happens that the infection is so severe and stuck in the wound that it emits a bad smell, or becomes pus or a putrid discharge, then apply a poultice to it for the next day.
Then repeat the operation until everything infected is removed; otherwise, a foul smell will spread, so you must quickly treat the onset of infection until it heals.
Then repeat your operation on that wound until it heals.
The urgency of the lacrimal tissue, if noticed in the wound causing great pain, should be suspended immediately; then incise it from that one side, and do not close the incision to prevent the flow of tears.
And then gently distill the strong and effective tear in the lacrimal passage until it heals.
**Chapter XVII**
On the incision of gallstones and that which arises from contracted flesh in the bowels.
Sometimes in the bowels of certain individuals, diseased flesh is formed, and it becomes so enlarged that it covers the pupil, or it protrudes closely to the outside or draws the eyelids inward, and strongly presses on the eyeball, causing it to be held together by a framework like a bulwark.
But in the operation on it, the disease must first hold its place in the small intestine; then open the bowels of that part and collect all the flesh with the appropriate instruments, and to this end use either a forceps or a basket; and then cut the flesh from the beginning until everything is finished with the knife, and be careful that you do not damage the bowel during your operation.
And this is the suggested translation: "And it is your incision, with which you cut these or scoop out the pus that we have extracted in the incision of the finger, or small scissors with which you collect it according to the form it takes closer to this chapter.
So when your incision is complete and all that flesh is removed, fill the wound with fine salt or sprinkle it with powder made from herbs and resembling corrosive medicines, and place a clean bandage over it until you are sure there will be no abscess.
And if you notice any cause of swelling and it is painful, and you are worried about an abscess, leave the wound and treat that abscess with whatever medicine is suitable for that abscess, and then repeat the operation on that part until it heals, and do what seems right regarding the flesh attached to this wound.
However, you must avoid any complete cure of the acute wound by natural or accidental means, using fire, and do not place your hand on any of these operations until you see that the member is suffering from that operation.
Chapter .xviii.
Collection of sabers in the warehouse.
The saber arrives bent, its edges protected over the warehouse and prevents access to its operation; the warehouse remains open for days.
Therefore, at the beginning, you must consider if the warehouse where the saber is kept is strong and free from other ailments except for the saber itself, then you should collect that saber.
And it is that you command the patient to rest their head on a small cushion, and suspend those veins with a pin or two, according to your prudence; and let that pin have a subtle, double prong, following this form:
or two pins, gradually in a body, following this form:
And then gently compress those veins with subtle forces, in a subtle manner, and drain the blood at the appropriate time, until you see those veins filled with humors and turned red.
And be careful not to touch the pain in the extremities of the wound; and if your operation is in the morning facing the sun, be very firm in your operation and only cut those veins.
And when you have finished, distill the hot liquid into the wound, either green or red, so that its sharp acidity dissolves what has been extracted from the blood.
If it is not possible to collect all of this at once, then apply a poultice to it, which relieves the pain, and leave it for several days until the pain subsides and there is no risk of infection.
And then repeat on him according to the manner of the disease until it is healed.
And this is the form of the scissors:
Chapter XIX
On the reduction of raised nose.
When you treat a raised nose with cautery or sharp medicine according to the disease's nature, and it is not healed, do not apply any bandages to it; instead, make incisions over the affected area after waiting for its maturity, and extract all the moisture present within until the bone becomes visible.
And so when the bone is exposed and there is decay or blackening in it, take a tool with this shape:
And it is called an acute headache, and it is made of fire, and the head becomes red where the point is made by pricking with a lime or alkali-based point (thus as in the following form).
And press that over the corrupt part of the bone, then slowly turn it between your fingers, and gently press your hand until you know that corruption is gone.
This should be done at certain times, and then the place is restored using drying and stopping agents.
Therefore, if the place is consolidated and there is good flesh there and the body is separated from the sanie and romance for forty days, and it is not renewed or apopthetic, and no accidents occur to it, then you know that it is healed.
But if it is not in a good state for healing, reduce the fissure to the shape of the nail, and according to this manner: and it is that you uncover according to the bones that are fixed with iron or acute medicine, and when the bone is uncovered, then take hold according to this form:
Let the end of the tool be triangular, and the shaft of the instrument first extended within the extremity in such a way as it reaches thus far.
Then place your hand over it, specifically on the lacrimal bone; extend your hand a little further, and then rotate your hand within so that it penetrates all through the bone, and you will feel the pain as it seeks to escape from there when you remove your hand.
Therefore, you will now restore the area with astringent medicines that dry out as required.
Therefore, when the flesh no longer fills the space, the matter that had discharged outward to the openings returns inside, thus alleviating the illness.
Chapter XX.
For the reduction of the hernia's bulge.
When the hernia protrudes completely and does not give way to manual pressure or reduction, it is necessary to relax the patient, and as you continue, perform a scarification of the cervix with sucking for good drainage; then apply over the hernia a liniment made of mullein and aloe and henna and sarcocolla, and tighten the bandage over the hernia with moted powders.
And the way of the powders is that you take linen cloth from the lion's fur, and each cloth is folded in four parts; and make those powders from them.
And then arrange them one over the other according to the amount of hernia that requires it. And tighten them over the linen with a strong, firm bandage; repeat the suction with the ventoses for good drainage; and then remove the ventoses and leave the hernia tight during the day and night.
If in the meantime the ligament becomes softened, then it must be made very tight.
And at night, as well as during the day, hold the ligament as we have said.
And if the hernia has already been reduced, that is well, but if not, repeat the application of poultices, compresses, and ventoses until it heals.
**Chapter XXI.**
On the incision of the eminence of the uvular tunic.
When there is a disruption in the uvular tunic, and it is distinct and processed by removing the eyelids with a gentle pull, and the shape of the eye is thus exposed, and you wish to make an incision, then the operation on it should be as we have recommended: insert the needle at the edge of the uvula, starting from below, in the direction of the lacrimal part, and another needle should pass through it with a double thread from the same side; then make an incision at the point where the double thread is, and raise that segment of the uvula along the needle, and cut it off.
And then extract the needle, placing it over the humid wool soaked in a mixture of honey and wine, and wait until the thread falls off by itself.
And then apply the humid wool to it, providing comfort until the plague is healed.
And in some cases, from all directions, around a circular piece of cloth, placing the wool with great emphasis, then perforate it with a delicate spatula that reaches the surface of the wool, allowing the albumin humidity to escape, and remove the wool and replace it after some time.
And tighten it until it is healed.
Chapter XXII.
On the treatment of eyes.
This illness called alcionat is nothing but a healthy condition that adjusts itself in the affected area, resembling descending water, and it is not that one.
The method of working with this condition is to stop the disease from advancing in the affected, left, and right parts, and then take hold of its head with both of your hands from two sides, and as you see the health returning to the divided areas, make sure it does not descend, and prevent light from reaching it. Thus, the illness would see its causes in this way.
And if it does not descend, you will know that it is water.
If, however, the descent of the health is not prepared in the way we have said, then stop the disease between your hands and take a fine, sharp instrument to that place above the panniculus, just before the continuation of the conjunctiva with the tunica cornea on the crown (at the site desired), until the health is expelled.
Therefore, when it is gone, you will distill the warm water in which you have mixed honey or water in which fennel and honey have been boiled.
And then it is cured as the other causes have been healed.
**Chapter XXII**
On the treatment of water coming from the lung.
We have already discussed the types of water in division and what suits to puncture on the tongue, according to health.
Now you understand that you should remove the illness between your hands on a clean cloth and tie its tongue tightly.
And then place your hand close to the patient's eyelid, if the water-bearing eyelid is the left one, use your left hand; or if it is the right eyelid, use your right hand.
And then take your right hand if the pain is on the left side; or use your left hand if the pain is on the right side.
And then hold the end of the finger near the edge of the eyelid, considering the thickness of the tear in the inner corner of the eye, and gently press the finger while turning your hand towards that side.
And then penetrate into the eyelid pocket and feel that the finger has already reached it due to pressure.
And it should be noted that the measurement of the path of the finger to the point (the corner of the eye) corresponds to the measurement of the space between the pupil and the edge of the black circle (the iris); this is the crown of the eyelid; so you will see the pupil through the clarity of the corneal tunic.
And then place the alm (or some kind of compress) into the area where the water is, and pull it down once, then up another time, and thus, as the water descends, you will see the affliction upon which its sight rests, and alm on its wound.
And then rest for a moment; so when the water has descended, you will relax that other time before the alm is thrown out.
And so when it stops descending and does not come down, then extract the alm with ease, turn your hand a little by little, dissolve a small amount of clear salt from a gem in the water and wash the wound inside; then remove the swollen or stopped or woolen bandage soaked in warm oil and honey and apply it to the wound.
But for us, and those of our time, we do not apply such treatment with warm honey as much anymore.
And if you do not comply with your knowledge in the use of the instrument into the wound due to its hardness - which is one of the men for whom the wound is hard to bear -, then know that you take the spatula which is called 'alberid' whose form this is:
And so pierce that joint, and do not stop your hand on the tract, and it is only then that you make a subtle place for knowledge.
Then insert knowledge as we have said.
And you must complete your work, prepared for the sick bed, carefully made so that they sleep on their backs in a dark house, and prohibited from all movements.
And attend to the nature of it so that its true nature is revealed, and do not distort their heads towards the right or left in any way.
And according to its disposition, the ligament should be treated on the third day.
Then, in that dark matter, he should examine the root cause and make it visible, and after identifying the issues, return the ligament by the seventh day.
And be aware that this should not be done during the hour of treatment or sometimes, if it is an infusion. You have noticed that this happens because the water tends to evaporate rapidly due to its great heat and force of observation.
If it is a mild apoplexy, then be aware that after the seventh day, you should straighten the affected part and correct any deviation with water.
Then you should close your eyes and focus on the patient's mouth, regulating the flow of air from it for several days during this dark period.
And then gradually and carefully consider its nature and discuss its causes.
And you should know that in alchemy the student is not excused from seeing some things at times, and then it is up to you to be bold about the operation.
And we have already succeeded in understanding some of those who are with alchemy, and someone said to make fire in the air with a magical syringe through which water is sucked out.
However, you should not think that this is completely new to our land, nor is it written in any of the ancient books, and it may be a novelty.
And these are the ways of the spices of magic, so that it may be about those who ignore those.
And they are made of iron or bronze properly, and their ends have this subtle triangular shape, the acute end thus with it is the form.
Chapter XXIV.
On the treatment of nasal flesh injuries.
When in the nose various types of flesh are born, some due to a gathering of blood from the feet or polyps, and this illness is called polyp because it resembles that particular foot. And it is cancerous flesh, pale, of thin color; and from it comes the flesh of the lion, not of a dark color.
Therefore, in those who have this lion flesh, neither fraudulent nor cancerous, you must cut the injury between your fingers and place it in the sun, and dry the nose of it, and pick at the small spots in those meats. And then carefully extract it from the parts outside, and then cut what you have understood of them with a fine blade between the partitions, knowing that all the flesh is held together; if there is any cause from which this separation could occur, then use a sharp instrument at your disposal to do so. If it is an infected or acute abscess, then apply it to what it covers; but if it is of malignant abscesses, then incise and cauterize that which has been separated, leaving the cavities intact.
Then carefully prepare the wound, making an incision with great precision and applying either water or wine. If the wound is open and you apply moisture to it through the palate, then know that it has healed.
If the moisture does not penetrate according to how it covers, then know that inside there is no flesh but pus over bones of the nose to which the incision has not reached.
Therefore, you must insert the instrument carefully into him where there is any obstruction, and use it gently, placing between each tooth the amount of the said instrument or less, and remove the obstruction and insert one end of the instrument into the naris either by force or for another reason that is possible.
And moreover, when this has been done, it releases its fragrant odor so that it reaches the nasal canals, and is held in place over their soft tissues; for many times children at school are made to do this, and it is a light cause for anyone who wants to do it.
Then hold both ends of the instrument, one end emerging from the nose and the other entering into the nose, and apply a pressure on the flesh around the teeth that are in the instrument, and do this until you know that the flesh is around the teeth of the instrument.
Then remove the instrument, place a cool compress on the nose, and do this for three days or more until the pain is completely absorbed by the ointment.
And then, at the end of the treatment, place a lead tube in the nose for several days until it heals.
If the treatment comes to an end, use this method.
And this is the form of the instrument, called a distiller, which extracts oils and medicines from plants:
And make it of silver or brass, which is similar to a small lamp with a small opening at the top, and fill it with something resembling ash.
And if you wish, make a closed tube from cane, and the tube of the distiller should be flat and open; it should have a handle at the end, which you hold when you heat oil or water that you want to extract from the sucs and absorbed causes within.
It appears that your message contains only a chapter title, "Capitol .xxv.", without any accompanying text for translation. If there is specific content from the chapter or further context you'd like translated, please provide it.
They grow on the ends of the nose.
Various symptoms appear as a growth on the ends of the nose; it swells and increases in size over several days until the condition of it becomes noticeable.
And for this reason, you should pay attention to the beginning of its appearance and eradicate it entirely. And then apply a heated cautery or medicine that burns over the area where it is located.
If the operation takes too long and becomes inflamed, consider if it is tender, hard, of a dark color, and has little sensation. Then do not touch that part with a hot iron because it is an abscessed cramp; for the pain experienced by anyone who incides this abscess is due to great harm to him or her.
If the abscess is painful but not dark in color and the incision is possible in that area, then evacuate the pus and cut into it without much fear, and treat the place with a liquid that will drain and heal it until it is cured.
**Chapter XXVI**
On the suture of the nose, lips, and earlobe when the continuity is broken due to a wound or similar.
You should know that when there is a rupture of continuity in one of these cartilages, it causes little concern in the operation on some people.
Therefore, when you encounter any cause of those, considering it a fresh plague or its corruption, then you adjust the two edges of the plague with sutures and subsequently care for the inside so that it heals.
And if the edges of the rupture of continuity are already separated and each part is healthy, then you must extract each segment from its neighboring tissue so that it does not become infected. Then you adjust the two edges with sutures and strengthen them, and sprinkle dragon's blood and tripe on those, and place a piece of fine plaster or some other consolidative plaster over it, and leave it for two or three days, then remove that and replace the plaster and take care with ointment so that the wounds heal by themselves.
The technique of suturing is that you add the solution for continuity with needles as we have recommended in the suturing of the abdomen, or add the solution for continuity with thread as it has been explained to you.
**Capitol XXVII.**
On the extraction of those causes that come in both lips during the divisions within.
You often observe various conditions in many individuals during the divisions within their lips; some have hard apothems resembling errant grays, and others have larger or smaller ones.
Therefore, you should remove the lips and cleave each of those hard conditions from every part, and then fill the void with a clean thread while the wound is still fresh, and afterwards wash it with wine and apply a poultice to the spot that has been punctured, until it heals.
Chapter .xxviii.
On the incision of tissue attached to the gums.
Cutting tools should not be placed on the attached gum tissue that ancient physicians called "albulus". Therefore, you must either suspend it or hold it with forceps and make an incision along its edge, allowing the blood to flow or pus to drain.
And then apply pressure over the area with a compress or other astringent or caustic powders.
And if that tissue returns, make another incision secondarily and cauterize it, for the cautery should not return.
Chapter .xxix.
Due to the reason of teeth aching.
When on the surface of the teeth within and between the gums there are rough, sharp edges, some blackened and some discolored, due to this corruption penetrating the gums, and the neighboring teeth are also affected, they become citrine or green in color.
And so you should close the space between your thighs, place the head of the patient in a suitable position, and pull out the teeth where these rough edges appear, causing a similar sensation to sand, without any visible cause, and this leads to the darkness, citrinity, and other colors as they are cleansed.
Therefore, if this remains as in the beginning of the reason, so be it; otherwise, you should repeat the reason about these to the other parts each day, and on the second and third days, until you reach the final statement in what you wish.
And you should know that teeth require various types of precise tools and shapes according to how they are prepared for your operation. And for this reason, the tools with which a tooth is extracted from within are different from the tools used to extract teeth between each other, and these forms of tools that you will prepare should be as follows:
Chapter .xxx.
Eradication of teeth.
Understand that you cure the tooth from its pain with all possible care and time in its complete eradication, for there is no reason to replace it once it is extracted, as it is a sublime substance whose absence is the justification for its eradication.
You may also understand that when the disease forces you to extract a tooth, it is essential that you are certain which tooth is causing the pain, as deceiving the pain can lead to mistaking a healthy tooth for a diseased one, and extracting the wrong tooth will not cease the pain until the diseased and painful tooth is eradicated, as we have seen this in the operations of barbies.
Therefore, once you have certified that the painful tooth is, and know it well, you will cover it with a spatula in which there is some virtue, until it is dissolved from the tooth of the gums entirely, and then carefully make incisions with your fingers or small forks, little by little, until the tooth falls out.
And then use pliers with strong jaws for good speech or a firm bite, and place the patient's head between your hands that hold them, to prevent any injury, and carefully extract the tooth in such a way as not to break it, nor cause greater pain to the patient.
And if that is not forgotten, then take one of those instruments and put it beside the tooth with all ease and effort to facilitate its removal as it was at the beginning.
But if the tooth is loose or corroded, you must cover that decay with a cloth and tighten it with the tip of a fine needle to prevent it from coming out when you apply pressure with your pliers.
And be sure to perform the scarification carefully around the entire gingival margin, and maintain your strength so that you do not tear or break it open again, and return to the patient for further treatment if the malignity is greater than the initial pain of the condition.
And beware that you do not perform what some ignorant barbers do in their hasty and reckless attempts at removal, for these actions do not administer what we have recommended; indeed, they often bring about great illnesses in men, which are more difficult to cure, and the roots of these ailments, or some of them, or even certain bones from the mandible, as we have witnessed with our own eyes.
Then perform the eradication of it, wash your mouth with vinegar or salt water.
And if pus flows from it, as is often the case, then, as we have witnessed, you should squeeze out some quantity of egg and sprinkle it over the wound, and if that egg is not available, apply a cautery.
The design of the forceps should be delicate, with a fine grip, suitable for extracting a tooth from its beginning, both from the external part of the tongue and also from a short and thick manipulation, so that they do not bend when performing these tasks.
And they should also have thick handles for when you first use them, so that they are not bent; instead, their ends should be short.
These are made of Indian iron with right-angled ends; on the ends of these are teeth that interlock with each other and start by strongly constricting descent, and sometimes the ends of these forceps take the form of a bird's beak, which is curved, and they are very strong.
**Chapter XXXI** (Note: This is a placeholder heading based on the formatting, as the text provided does not contain any identifiable chapter titles or numbers in a recognizable format.)
For the eradication of teeth and the removal of broken bones from the jaw.
When you need to eradicate a tooth that is stuck for any reason, you should place your hand over the area with a border for one or two days until the location becomes softened. Then insert some pliers or tongs whose ends are assembled in the shape of a beak of a bird called a ciconia or guanta, which resembles forceps.
The ends of them should be cut with a file or chisel.
And if you do not obey the instructions regarding these pliers or tongs, then you should lie down and expose all the flesh, and insert the instrument which is called a small lever with this shape:
It should have a short thick end and not be smoothed over so that it does not get stuck.
Therefore, if the incision is forgotten, this is it; otherwise, help me with these other instruments, of which these are the forms: the form of the first instrument is triangular at its end, with some thickness.
The form of the second instrument is triangular with a very thin end.
And now, with this instrument, having two inclines, the appropriate form is as follows: And other instruments which are used for tooth extraction; for it is done with this tool, similar to a large knife, and its form is:
with a triangular end, either bent or straight, of certain thickness, and not encrusted so that it is not jagged.
And you should know that the tools for drawing teeth are similar in appearance to other instruments.
The skilled and subtle artisans, through their own study, discover for themselves according to what the operation means and various ailments; for there are ailments to which the ancient ones did not give name or pause with their proper instruments, due to their diverse forms.
If it is about the bone of the jaw or other bones in the mouth, or if there is a fracture, then apply gentle pressure to that area in its proper place using the instruments and forceps we have mentioned regarding the extraction of teeth, and assist with the gesture which this shape requires.
And for any lump, little by little, and whether it is tightened or held in the mouth so that it does not escape or protrude until the bone is completely extracted, then restore the area with appropriate medicines.
If there is a small breach in the bone, then quickly remove that part and clean it, and treat it until it heals.
**Capitol .xxxii.**
On the care of the prominent teeth among others.
When the teeth are prominent in an unnatural way due to their shape, particularly in women, especially young and chaste ones; then consider: if it is not possible to extract or clean that tooth, then root it out; rather than leaving it attached to another tooth, cut it off with this instrument which resembles a pig's tusk, made of Indian steel with an extremely sharp point.
And your incision should be made in such a way that you cut off the tooth after several days due to the hardness of the tooth, and it should not affect any other teeth.
And if the prominent tooth is exposed to friction, then file it with this iron lime file in the shape of:
And all of this is from Indian iron and the margin precisely; and it has many small points as if with a lime, whose edge is sharpened day by day easily, so that there is no other tooth like it that cuts and hurts. Then measure that at the end, and cut it with some other scissors.
And if it is the tooth from which a piece has broken off and affects the tongue, then you must file that edge where the fracture's sharpness is trapped and embedded, and smoothen it so that the tongue does not get hurt or the word is not corrupted.
Capital (or Heading) .XXXIII.
On the restoration of lost teeth with gold or silver wire.
When teeth are affected by concussion and removal due to impact or extraction, and the patient cannot bear the pain, having tried various stiptics, then one must resort to those that are tightened with gold wire, not silver, because silver corrodes and soon becomes useless, while gold remains unchanged forever.
And the wire should be of such subtlety and thickness according to the amount that can fit between the teeth; the shape of the correction is to take the wire and bend it twice between two healthy teeth, or if there is only one or two gaps, ensure that the wire reaches the healthy tooth from the other side. Then repeat the stitching within the gap from which you began, and tighten your hand with facility and wisdom, lest it be damaged.
And the strain you apply with which to tighten the wire must be such that it does not cause the teeth to loosen.
And then cut the excess thread ends with forceps or scissors, and insert them at various points by gesture, and turn them and hide them between the healthy tooth and the damaged tooth, so as not to harm the tongue. And then bind it tightly with a Roman bandage.
If it becomes unfastened or torn, tighten it or those parts with another thread in such a way that they remain tight at all times.
And this is the form of the teeth and the shape of the correction of two healthy teeth and two damaged teeth, thus when these ligatures are tied:
And when it is done so that a tooth or two returns to their proper place in their respective locations, and they are grown back as we have recomposed, then they become renewed.
And this is only achieved by skilled artisans and wise men.
Sometimes, it is found that the cause of this condition is a bone from a cow, shaped somewhat like a tooth, which is placed in the area where the tooth is missing, and held tight as we have said, remaining and serving in that position for a long time.
Chapter .XXXIV.
On the knowledge of the ligament which is found in the tongue and prevents speech.
This ligament which is found in the tongue sometimes stops speech, either because it is a natural condition or due to an accident that occurs as a result of a plague which has already healed.
And the operation on it is to open the mouth of the patient, making its jaw no longer exist in place; raise their tongue, and then carefully cut that nerve ligament according to its width until the tongue is freed from its attachment.
If there is any stiffness or resistance in that area, which is due to the hardening of the disease, then you apply oil and split it apart with your fingers until you can separate the ligament and the knot is dissolved.
And be careful not to cause any rupture in the flesh, and split open the rear part, and let the pus flow out.
Then, wash the dressing of the incision with hot water or vinegar or clean water; and place a cloth over it; it is best to keep the tongue out of the way during this time, as any pressure on it may harden the condition again.
If pus flows, apply vitriol to the area; if the pain is sharp, cauterize the area with a hot iron suitable for this condition. And then proceed with the treatment addressing the other causes until it is cured.
It appears that you have provided a reference to a specific chapter or section marked "Capitol .xxxv." without including the actual content or text. To provide assistance, I would need the textual data from that chapter for translation or analysis. If you can share the text, I'll be happy to help with your request.
Extracting the sac (ranula) with the tongue.
In some cases, the tongue becomes inflamed and resembles a small, stiff lump, preventing its natural movement; it is greatly swollen and fills the mouth.
And the procedure for it is that you open the patient's mouth wide, facing them towards the light, and examine the inflammation.
And if you notice a dark, hard lump that the patient cannot feel due to numbness, then do not touch that area which is brittle.
If it turns white and is moist, insert your fingernail into it, cut it with a fine spatula, and divide it entirely; if you have good ventilation during the time of your operation, place a zigzag veil over it, provided it constricts the flow of air.
Then return to your work until you have completely treated it, after washing it with wine and salt; and tend to the other remedies for this until it is healed.
Chapter .XXXVI.
On the extraction of the abscess from two ears and that which is in the throat, and other abscesses.
When an inflammation in the throat occurs, there are glands that are gathered closely together, which protrude outside and are called "two ears," which, when you treat them with what has been said above, and they do not heal, consider whether the abscess is hard, of a dark color, and has little sensation; in this case, do not touch it with a knife.
If the disease is of a certain nature and the root is thick, do not cut it with a knife due to the flow of pus; instead, let it mature within, and either you will extract it or it will break off on its own.
And if it is of white color, hard, and the root is thin, then that must be carefully incised.
And the operation on it is that you consider, in view of your operation, if the abscess has already rested and been healed completely or if it has decreased in size; then make an incision against the disease under the sun, with the head of the instrument in the lower part, opening its mouth, and a servant taking hold between his fingers of the patient's tongue with a delicate instrument of this form.
It should be made of silver or brass, and the blade should be thin and sharp.
Therefore, when you press against that place with your tongue and the point is shown to you, then take a needle and stick it into that flesh, and draw it out of the body as much as possible. Another thing that removes some cause from the tunics, and then cut with an instrument whose shape is as follows:
Another thing that removes some cause from the tunics, and then cut with an instrument whose shape is as follows: and is constructed like forceps, however the ends of it are curved, so that the point of each of those is in the opposite direction, very sharp, made of iron coated with steel.
If this instrument is not available to you, then cut with a spade whose shape is as follows: sharp on one side, blunt on the other side.
And having cut a wound, cut the other in the same manner of incision, and then close the incision of the patient with hot water.
If there is a flow of blood, rinse with a decoction of grain or myrtle leaves similar to the causes of the stoppage until the flow of blood ceases and then treat it so that it heals.
And in some cases, there are other appendices or those two auricles, and you incise them as you have seen and said in the incision of two wounds equally.
And you have already treated a woman for an abscess that was born in the groin of her, an abscess that tended to a dark color, with little sensation, which had already closed the groin of her, and the woman was breathing heavily, and she had forbidden herself from eating and drinking water, and she was on the brink of death if more time passed, even one or two days.
And the abscess had already punctured so much that it had created two openings through which pus would flow.
Therefore, listen to me attentively and stay in one of their wounds, pull out that one, and the discharge from it is a great portion; then you should inspect where you understand the other injury is coming from, and then close the mouth of it, and grasp its tongue, and then leave the wound in that position.
And then you should cut out a large part of it, and there is not much discharge from it but some blood. Therefore, it is absolutely necessary for that woman; and soon after she begins to drink water, and take food, so you should not continue to incise those wounds again for a long time, but rather let each one heal in its place, which incision prolongs that condition.
Therefore, you should apply this and cauterize the wound of the patient, thus adding to it; and also walk around and do not clean what God has done for that patient.
Chapter .xxxvii.
On the incision of the hernia when it is located.
When the catarrh is in the hernia, and it is located and long, then it is called perpendicular; and if it is on the side, thick and round, then it is called a bubo.
In cases where the treatment mentioned in the previous section is not effective, and the hernia has already formed into a hard mass, it is necessary to incise that which is round; but if it is of considerable length, and it bleeds, either dark red or black, and there is no sensation in it, then one must be cautious with the incision, for fear of aggravating the condition.
And when you observe it according to the manner I have described regarding its whiteness and length, you must relieve the patient and press the hernia with an instrument that shapes it, then move it down and make an incision with one of two instruments used in the procedure known as the inscizio de dos mellas (incision of two wounds).
And be careful not to insert anything that is contrary to the natural order of its addition, for if you insert more than necessary, you will harm its function.
Then, make the incision, use what we have recommended for the incision of two wounds, and heal it so that it becomes healthy.
If the patient was frightened by the incision, use cunning in the cauterization of it to calm their fear, and the manner of the cautery on it is nothing but sharp fire, and this is how you place the head of the patient on the table, and then press the tongue with the instrument we have mentioned, and take water as we said in the chapter on cauterization, and apply that as a living force, and do not make it too thick or too thin, and fill the concavity of the instrument whose form this is:
Let the end of it be concave in which the medicine is placed, just like the concave part of a spoon, and place the instrument with the medicine on the wound, and have the patient lie on their side so that saliva or mucus from their mouth does not fall due to the inherent nature of the medicine, so as not to cause any harm to their throat.
And then apply your hand to the medicine, and extract it from the throat by making space for a while until it becomes weakened and numbed by the bite of the medicine.
And if you wish, take care and wrap that around the end of the ray, immerse the wrap in the medicine, insert the ray into the wrap in a pipe-like manner until the wrap adheres to the pipe, and do this as many times as necessary so that you achieve what you want from the cauterization of the ulcer, then let it dry so that it falls off after three or four days.
And if you need to repeat the medicine, repeat it, and then remove the cauterization from the ulcer with a cloth soaked in the medicine, clean that which is in the patient's wound with the same medicine, wash it with warm water, apply external remedies, and use internal treatments until it heals.
And this specific type of treatment is much safer than incision and free from fear.
Sometimes the ulcer is cured with something more subtle than cautery or incision, and this is done through sublimation in this manner: take calament, hyssop, origan, rue, scorzonera, chamomile, broad (possibly a type of herb), and similar ones from among the herbs, and address all those causes, or some of them, in a single mixture, and let them be submerged in wine and boiled; and the wave should be beaten decently with a wooden instrument according to this manner; it should be made of silver or bronze.
And then the extremity should be inserted into the patient's mouth until the vapor reaches the ulcer and covers it, so that the ulcer becomes completely obscured.
Then repeat this process for any remaining spots that appear dry, but be careful not to perform this treatment during the acute phase of the disease, as it might over-irritate the affected area and you should only proceed if you have properly diagnosed the hernia (apostema) through cautery.
If you do not have this instrument at hand, take a cane and, at the end of it, make a hook with wire, so that the mouth of the hernia is closed, because the hook of the wire prevents the internal gas from burning the mouth.
And this treatment is good for health.
Chapter XXXVIII.
On the removal of splinters and substances adhering to the skin, and other causes.
You may observe substances adhering to the skin or splinters of nails or any other cause.
Then, you should extract what is apparent from these, examining it with the eye, after having pressed your tongue against the instrument, in order that you may clearly see what is in the mouth.
And if something appears hidden in the stomach and is beyond your knowledge, make the patient vomit before the food is digested in the stomach, because the powerful cause attached to the stomach will be forgotten through vomiting; or let the patient swallow some piece of nap or finely chopped lettuce or a bite of dry bread; or take a piece of dried seaweed, twist it tightly with a needle, and make the patient swallow it, for when it reaches the place where there are spines and it is extracted, then it will be forgotten. You may take a snake and twist it with a needle, place it on the table and extract it carefully; or take a reed and carefully pull out its inner core.
If these causes are not forgotten, then use an iron instrument in the following manner:
And make it a thick wire with a thin point, and at the end of it, there should be a concave part that you insert into his mouth easily.
And he raises his head up and be careful of the touch of his bone in the throat, so that he understands what causes him pain, whether it is from a bone or a spine, or how that doctor places his hand on him.
However, if that patient has more pain, it is better because of his knowledge of the place where the cause resides and he pushes it down and pulls his hand with the instrument towards him, all according to the amount prepared for him until it is forgotten.
**Chapter XXXIX.**
On the extraction of blood from the throat.
When treating phlegm as we have discussed in the division of treatment with medicines and it does not correspond, consider the throat of the patient at sunset, since you will have to use an instrument to extract his tongue, which you have recommended.
Therefore, if you examine the blood flow, extract that small or subtle swelling decently.
If it is not possible to extract the swelling, take a concave needle and insert it into the wound of the patient, then place over the concavity of the needle a hot iron, and do this several times (as long as the blood flow stops and the swelling is removed from the wound) and keep the patient on water for the rest of the day.
Then take a vessel filled with water, apply its mouth to the wound, and wash the wound with it; do not spill any of that water and change it every hour or so, as the blood will soon absorb the water.
If we have not forgotten what we have recommended, then fumigate the patient with spices or asafoetida using the instruments we have prescribed for the suffumigation of the throat.
Do this, so it falls in the right place.
And another way of operation through suffocation of that is that you take a cloth in which are ignited coals and the cloth is covered with a cover in the middle of which there is an opening, and it is on that opening that the tip of the instrument is placed; then apply suffocation from above; and the patient should hold his mouth at the end of the tube, and close his mouth so that the suffocation is not blown away until you know that the suffocation has reached the blood flow, for the blood flow will fall shortly.
And if he does not eat, then you repeat the suffocation with motes again, and prevent the patient from drinking, and eating salty and cold foods, and do not let him drink water, and so it is necessary that at this regimen he should abstain.
And this is the form of the instrument used to extract blood from the body when it is seen; and it is similar to forceps also, but with some curvature: Which is placed over the gullet, and its end resembles a spoon beak, which is called a quile, that is sharpened with lime, for this reason, when we encounter any cause, it does not leave.
**Chapter XL.**
In which the whole of the discourse is concerned with the perception of apoplexies and their section.
Apoplexies are special motifs, with various manners of occurrence, according to the recollection of their memories, each one in this book.
And they are diverse in their piercing and section in two ways: one is for the specific type of apoplexies themselves; and by what we understand about humidity.
And the second manner is the locations in which bodily accidents occur, where an apoplexy occurring in the head is different from one occurring in the buttocks; and an apoplexy occurring in the fleshy part is different from one occurring in a joint; and each of them has its own treatment through operation.
And some pustules are such that they do not need to be pierced, but rather serve as a maturation of the health in those or their completion.
Other pustules that need to be drained when they form crosses and are not mature according to their size, also include those that occur near joints, where a pustule forms close to a joint, the condition of it persists as long as you can see it in the circulatory system of the body, and it strongly corrupts the ligaments or nerves of that joint, leading to the contraction of that member; or it is a pustule near a major limb, and if you delay piercing it until it has matured, it will affect the main limb; or it is near the buttocks, so you should pierce the one that has not matured; and do not drain the crusty one, unless it is one forming near the anus, where you cannot drain it from the inside, but rather it elongates into the anal fissures within the buttocks, and a fistula forms or some other condition in its place. You also know the time to drain the pustule, and that is when it has matured.
And you will know that recovery has begun when the pain ceases and the fever abates, and there is a reduction in rigidity and pulse, and the redness of the affected area becomes less pronounced, as well as other symptoms.
And furthermore, know how to recognize when the incision should be made in the location of the abscess and when pus is present as a result of healing of the swelling.
The incision should always be made through the skin or flesh, if the abscesses are in the thighs or feet, and in places where there is no reflection; for in those that do reflect, the incision should be made according to the member affected.
But when the abscess is in a fleshy location, it is better to wait until the digestion of the pus is confirmed as per our previous discussion; for if you make an incision there before, it prolongs the course of the disease and intensifies the pain and swelling around it, making it deeper.
You may make some incisions through the thickness of the flesh or body part as required, or according to what the member needs.
And be aware that you should make small incisions, and in large appointments, a great perforation and wide sections according to the diversity of the size of the appointments.
And others are of appointments where it is necessary that the skin be turned in and cut, when thus done as if bread and made is in a term that already exists, so as those that occur in cases of doubt and abscesses.
And of those that are incised in a section with three angles; and of those where it is incised thus like the figure of a myrtle leaf, so as the appointments of the ankles.
And of their kind where a round section and lunar section is administered, and similar to those.
If that one has no such problem when the surface wounds are minor, then you should make a shallow or flat incision only.
And when the wound is deep and has already collected a lot of pus, you should make an incision and do not be concerned about extracting all the pus at once; after removing a portion, wait until the next day and then remove another piece, increasing the size gradually according to the degree of healing.
And especially if the patient is a frail individual, or a woman in labor, or a small child, or an elderly person, since the animal spirit moves quickly towards healing, and strongly resists the removal of the wound, and you operate on them.
Pay close attention to this chapter, and be careful with the incision you make for these wounds; clean the infections and consider whether the wound of the apostema is small or a flat incision, then administer the appropriate treatments; if the apostema is large and the openings of the incision are deep, then apply pressure on each opening until they heal together.
And if in the abscess a portion of the cord or its concavity is separated, then cover it with thick cloth or thread made from linen, just as you would bandage a cut or wound; tighten it on the third day and treat and heal the inflammation from infections until it is cured.
If a flow of blood occurs during your operation, then administer clean water and vinegar mixed together, place a cloth made from linen over the area where the bleeding is happening, and apply pressure.
If the bleeding persists, then you must administer remedies and treatments, and apply powders recommended at various locations of this book and division.
If it is during winter, and the location of the abscess is in a place with many nerves, then you must soak swabs in hot oil and vinegar, and apply them to the affected areas.
And if it is summer and the parts are fleshy, then you should apply cool poultices soaked in water and oil or wine and oil, and all of this should be changed every third day, as we have said, and you should loosen the crust and clean that part and administer what is appropriate for its healing until it is cured.
And this is what is necessary for the knowledge of the treatment of all types of hernias generally, but more according to the method of distinction that I have already mentioned about each type of hernia and its specific way of treatment.
Chapter .xl.
On the section of hernias that occur in the neck region of the head.
In the neck region of the head are small hernias, which are of various types with membranes that contain them; and these types are distinguished by their names.
And from their glands flow drops, and those contain a moisture similar to lime. And those that contain moisture similar to sweat, and those that resemble them; and those that are stone-like, hard.
And in the removal of all, and in the extraction of those, there is no fear, as the incision of those does not cause painful resistance.
And the operation in incision of those is that you expect those to be in the form of instruments, which are called entromes, as you know that they contain.
For if what contains is moisture, then you cut those as you separate them according to their length by making a superficial incision in this form:
And it begins at the section of the line B within the line G. Therefore, when the humidity is evacuated, you scrape that which contains that humidity, and do not leave any cause for it, as troops seen returning may indicate some other cause.
And then immerse the affected area in Egyptian nettle, if present, or in water and salt; fill it with that plague and leave it for another day, as it corrodes everything that breaks through that crust.
And then you repeat the application of Egyptian nettle to that area according to need, as long as you are confident that there is no other cause behind that crust; cure the plague with nettle until it is healed.
And if there is an abscess with fatty nodes, then you cut into it according to this form: I have a section without the form of a cross, and cut between the two lips of this section and tear it apart from every side, and use your virtue to extract the tunic which contains that.
If it causes you discomfort, do what I have first told you.
And similarly, perform in the abscess of the section and treatment as I have told you; and cut over the abscess that is lighter, because it is less painful and has little humidity.
And sometimes there are certain abscesses of these which are in the head on some men who have no humidity at all; which causes because you must incise an abscess on the head of an old woman and drain the abscess thus with a hard, blunt, white stone that cannot be chewed, and if anyone were to touch it, they would be infected.
In other instances of accidental apoplexy in the head, different from this chapter, there are such apoplexies that come upon the children's heads and require the removal of the auricles, but the section concerning all these should be a superficial one.
And stop the perforation of those in the lower part of their division so that the matter of the wound is removed from the lower parts.
Then tend to those affected by it as is appropriate for healing.
Chapter .xlii.
On the section of scrofula that occurs in the collarbone.
Uncommon instances of these apoplexies occur in the collarbone, armpits, and angles, and sometimes they occur in other parts of the body.
And so those that occur in the colon, and so movements that are generated within them, and all scrofula of those comes from their own tunic, and thus as with the nodes and abscesses of the head, so we have treated.
And the types of these scrofula are movements, some of which are stone-like, and others contain moisture, and some are malicious that do not obey treatment.
Therefore, in that case where you perceive good disposition in the touch, of which the color of what is manifest is proper to the color of the ulcer, and it is degraded throughout, and not attached to the colon's nerves, veins, or arterioles, and it is neither full nor swollen, you must incise it at the dry superficial part of the ulcer from its position within the body, to the position beyond the body, along the line of G. within the line of B., and remove it from all parts, and cut away the edges of the ulcer with a knife if necessary, as we have said regarding abscesses in the head, and extract that little by little.
And it is more careful that the vein or nerve is not incised.
And if the knife is not sharp, or does not fit in your hand for incision, or causes anxiety to the patient, and you make an unnecessary incision on a vein or nerve, then it hinders your operation; the abscess will fester with vinegar or other powders that prevent pus from flowing out, and it will cause pain and leave a scar until the inflammation of the abscess subsides and the infection begins to heal. When the pus is drained.
Therefore, return to your operation until it is completed.
And then carefully inspect the small scrofulous nodules; if any show signs of infection, make an incision and clean them.
And if it is at the root of a large scrofula, you must be careful not to incise that scrofula from its root. Furthermore, be careful not to cut that thin, folded string too short, as it might slip and cause harm.
Then fill the wound with warm, thin wool that you have already soaked in Egyptian ointment, and treat it accordingly.
And if you completely cut out the scrofula, be careful to close both sides of the wound tightly so that no excessive pus forms.
If you notice that there is excessive pus due to the size of the scrofula, be careful to understand where to cut, remove it, and then stitch it up and apply what is said.
And those of scrofula that contain moisture, pierce them with a superficial piercing at the place where you see the maturation of it, and stop the piercing of what is the base of pus in the body, as we have said.
And then administer the piercing, you should find and similar things to these, so that it corrodes what is broken down by corruption. And then when you see the plague already cleansed, you should cure it with the ointment of generative flesh until it is healed.
Chapter .xliii.
On the section of the pilot (or membrane) of the abscess, make an incision.
The ancients said that this incision on the pilot (or membrane) was effective, and they have not seen any other thing like it done in their land.
And this is the inscription of the speech of those.
In some men there is a deficiency, so the extraction of the stone should be avoided, for by doing so prematurely, all the veins and the major ones related to the illness are here.
In those who have sores in the mouth or throat or both ears, when the illness is not in the gums, it is necessary to avoid the extraction of stones to prevent the loss which is caused by perforation.
Therefore, when we want to do this, the stone should be incised below three circles of the stone's circles, or four with a small section in the space between two circles for its quantity, that the incision is in depth, not in the cartilage, and this place is suitable for an incision because it is devoid of flesh and the blood vessels of the stone are open.
And if the doctor is cautious, you must ensure that he extends the cord of the gauze slowly, and then cuts the cord until it reaches the canal, but avoid the vessels of blood if you encounter any cause to do so.
Then, we insert the scalpel as recommended; it is meant to section the canal for the flux that is situated here, which is due to something broken and detached from its place, and through the removal of the voice.
And leave the wound open for some time.
Therefore, when the hour arrives for the closure when the opening is feared, add two layers of the gauze cord to the wound, and use one alone for the cartilage.
And then administer medicines that promote the healing of the flesh until it is healed.
And Albucasis says that the essence of our discourse, which we have collected, is to observe that some of these apopthems have already compressed the gullet of the patient, and the malady has entered into the body, and the air of it has been cut off, and some wish to incision the epiglottis so that the malady breathes over the place of the wound through some respiration, and thus be saved from death.
And for this, I will order the wound to remain open until the evil of the malady is consumed; and the evil lasts for three days; so now I will order the treatment of the wound, and its cure, until it is healed.
And what I have seen myself, is that a servant used a sharp object and cut into the throat of the patient, and also made an incision on one part of the lung, and I was called to treat it; and I observed the death rattle as if from a dying person, and discovered the wound, and found the inflammation which had come from the wound's infection.
Therefore you shall confess that you have neither cut a vein nor guided the flux, and the air still comes from the plague, and you treated it until the fire of sickness was cured.
And do not press the servant unless it is necessary in your voice, and after some days return to the improvement of their dispositions.
And now I say that in the section of the epiglot there is no fear.
Chapter .XLIV.
Of the section about an abscess that occurs outside the stomach, which is called a stomach hernia.
This abscess, called stomach hernia, is a great abscess according to the color of the body, and it occurs more in women.
And it is divided into two manners, either natural or accidental.
And in the natural, it is not subject to cure.
And the accidental is divided into two manners: one is similar to gouty nodules, and the other manner is akin to apoplexy caused by the blockage of an artery, which is fearful. And one should not make a diagnosis with certainty except for the patient who seeks help. And you should examine the patient and if it appears similar to gouty nodules, and there is no obstruction in any of the veins, then you puncture them thusly with a needle, and extract that which contains the pus from the abscess; otherwise, you should scrutinize the entire body and appropriately treat the area requiring cure until it is healed.
Chapter .xlv.
On the section of the removal of nodules.
The nodules have various shapes and sizes, and as I have already described all the types of their divisions.
And it is important to distinguish between a nodule and an excrescence, with careful consideration.
Therefore, one says that an excrescence is a hot condition and fever with violent pains, until the ebullition of the excess subsides; and it is putrefaction that stops the fever, pain, and heat.
A nodule is not hot nor febrile nor painful, but it is like a lion that has been taken from its den and brought to light.
And according to the color of the body, its beginning is like a cease and is done thus with vacuum, either greater or lesser, and they are according to two species, as if they were fat and contained humidity, and the colors of the humidity are spots, as I have said in division.
Therefore, when you reach the treatment of a node, you must expel that and inquire about the beginning of the disturbance which is called an "intromis", according to how it takes its form in the chapter most appropriate to this.
And this is the manner of inquiring into abscesses and all nodes; you take this disturbance and insert that into the place most humid which you find in the abscess, and you will turn your fingers around there bit by bit until you know that this disturbance has already penetrated the wall.
And then you close your hand according to the measure of the abscess's size, and you extract the disturbance, and consider what has remained in the trace of it.
And if the current humidity is forgotten, of whatever color it may be, you insert a scalpel into the superficial section as I have said in the other posts.
And if there is no humidity left from the intrusion, then you know it is grave.
And dry it with a section having the shape of a cross according to this form: Thus taught, lift it up, and extract the stone from every part with ease, and inspect the pouch or sac if possible over that, and draw out that health from the node.
If it is broken during the operation, it is not possible to extract that health, and you should repeat this process until it is successfully extracted from within without causing any further damage.
If from the lung arises any cause, either little or much, the nodule returns according to its nature.
And if you notice that from the lung any small part is affected, complete the plague with some sharp corrosive powders and strengthen the plague, and apply a hot poultice to the one that is infected, and cure the other with appropriate treatment until it is healed.
And if it is not large, then you cut both lips of the lung and cure it with this that incrusts.
If the vein is pulsatile or not, you cut and apply the place of a trissate seal that is vitriol and let that strangle for two days or three until the plague subsides and the inflammation of the sanc ceases; then return to incise what is broken from the node.
Chapter XLVI.
On the shapes of instruments necessary for incision and piercing.
Of these are the forms of the instruments, and they are of three kinds: one of great size, another of medium size, and another of small size.
The shape of the large instrument is this:
The shape of the small instrument is this:
They are made of iron, aluminum, and powerful materials, meticulously designed to perform the instruments in specific incisions.
And these are the shapes of the experts, and they are called blades, and one of them is known as a bore.
And thus, of these three qualities, one is great, another moderate, and a third slight.
The form of the great experience is like it:
The form of the moderate experience is like it:
The form of the slight experience is like it:
So, it is appropriate for those with apoplexy, ulcers, fistulas, and buboes, so that they are between the bones and from other causes.
And thus, they make rounds, thick, leathery, also with large needles sewed to them, and are of ermine, or of iron, or of silver, and the best are when they are made of ermine.
And the experience of black plums is used, which remember that by opening these, the fistulas in the concavity of which are reflected, those reflections are reflected back to their lightness on those reflections.
And they are of three kinds, some being long, and others middle-length, and others short, according to the extent of the fistula and its stricture.
Shape of the large plum experience:
Shape of the middle plum experience:
Shape of the small plum experience:
The shapes of the incisions are of various spices, some being simple curves, and they are of three kinds: large, few, and middle-sized.
And of their body's humors, there are three kinds.
And of these humors, there are two types with curves, which are of three kinds.
And they have three types of curves, which are also of three kinds.
And all these are necessary at their place.
Shape of the simple rare humors, shape of it:
A large wound with two curves: A smaller wound with two curves: A very small wound with two curves.
A large wound with three curves:
A smaller wound with three curves:
And these are the forms of scalpels that are used to cut and scrape nodules and abscesses, which come in three sizes: large, medium, and small.
Form of the large scalpel:
Form of the medium scalpel:
Form of the small scalpel:
The ends of these have sharp blades, and the other ends are not sharp, but rather rounded in such a way that they do not cause damage to veins or nerves during the scraping of nodules, and for them to heal the disease and bring about tranquil rest, even if some adjustment is required due to the depth of the abscess.
And these are the forms of weapons, and there are three kinds: great, middle, and small, as you will see.
They are made of iron and look like rays from which alcohol is produced.
And at the tip is a pointed spatulal edge hidden, which cuts into the inside and comes out again, as you wish.
The shapes of the spatulas, which are hidden between these parts during the piercing of the skin and do not harm the patient, are of three kinds: great, middle, and small. And these are the ways of those:
The forms of veins through which the blood flows are divided into three types; large, medium and small; their forms:
They are made of thin, round or slightly elongated erys (veins), delicate.
And it is necessary that these types of veins be large, medium and small, so that by them the flow of blood is divided at the right speed when required, and in this way, when you first apply treatment, it is not medicine.
I do not recommend using them to divide blood in all parts of the body, but only in fleshy areas, just as with the veins in the legs, thighs, arms, breasts, abdomen and groin, similar to the veins in moist flesh.
And in some cases, these instruments are made of small blades resembling scalpels according to this form; by which the vein is incised when performed through phlebotomy, or incision of a vein or artery.
And some incisions are made round according to this form:
Chapter XLVII.
On the care of the breasts of men, which are assembled from women.
Some incisions are inflated in the breasts of certain men due to the pressure of sleep when they begin to be hairy, and then the breasts are inflated, and the breasts of women are assembled, and they remain apart, distant.
And for those who wish to treat this, they should incise those sections of the moon according to this form, from the line B to the line G, and then remove all the grossness, and fill the wound with incarnate medicine, and adjust both lips of the wound with stitching, and heal what is within so that it becomes healthy.
If a nipple retracts from its attachment and becomes softened due to its magnitude, as is often the case with women, then it should be cut in two parts, its pus drained, and each portion shaped like a crescent moon; each should contain the end of the other, so that the longer line contains the shorter according to this form of the line B and G. Then excise the cord connected between the two lips of the wound, stop the discharge, and administer what has been mentioned regarding sutures and powders, as necessary for healing until it is cured.
And if you do not perform the incision as required due to the restlessness of the patient and the flow of pus, then fill the wound with a corrosive ointment and leave it until it corrodes the hardened matter, and then cure it until it is healed.
**Capitol .xlviii.** (Note: "Capitol" here likely refers to a chapter or section heading, not a physical location.)
About the perforation of abscesses that come from beneath the skin.
These abscesses that come from beneath the skin are caused by the species of scrofula, hard ones, which contain a pus that needs to be drained.
And of those, some contain humidity; and those that contain humidity should be incised during the lunar month according to this figure: from the line of G to the line of B. And once all that is within the abscess has been evacuated, you should close it with a strip of cloth and leave it for another day.
And keep the bandage in place and treat it with a suitable ointment until it heals.
And if the abscess is of the nodal species or from scrofula, you should incise it as we have said in the section about scrofula generally.
If the plague has spread so much that it causes gangrene, then apply cautery to it as we have mentioned before.
**Chapter XLIX**
On the section of abscesses that occur through archery or vein injuries.
When an arrow breaks and the string (or cord) is tightened that is above it, then abscesses are seen to occur, and the signs by which it is known that inflammation and abscess are due to an artery or vein: for when an abscess is from an arrow, a long accumulation occurs in the preceding part of the body; and when you press the abscess, you feel a ringing sensation within.
And that which is from a vein turns into the general manifestation of the body.
And the section regarding this abscess is incorrect, especially in those that leave openings, and in the angles, and in the collarbone, and in most parts of the body; and since it is so large, it is necessary to avoid its treatment with iron, and for those in the extremities, or at the head, it should be avoided.
Place a linen over the affected area due to inflammation from archery wounds, cut it in the middle of the thigh; then incise the section with scissors and expose the wound, removing the arrows and tunic until it is uncovered.
Then take a needle and make it penetrate through the other layer, opening the wound at two points—which causes the patient to experience pain due to the removal of two arrows lodged in the thighs.
Then apply pressure to the area between the two ligaments using a spatula until the swelling subsides and the abscess is dissolved.
Then administer treatment to the area where pus has formed until the ligaments fall off, and care for it with suitable ointments until it heals.
If the abscess is due to vein section, then you must cover your hand over it as much as possible near the abscess in the thigh, and insert the needle into the area where you have placed your hand, making it penetrate; then pull out the foreign body from the other side while maintaining the thread double, and bind the abscess with suitable ligature according to what I have said earlier regarding the grapevine ligature on both sides of the thread.
If you fear that the thread might break, insert the needle into the remaining aperture, following the path of the first incision, and tighten your threads at four points.
Next, dry the aperture in the middle part of it; when the swelling has subsided, make an incision into the excess of the cord and leave what is attached to it.
And then place a poultice on it, which you have soaked in vinegar and oil, and apply the treatment that is done with heat and cold until it is healed.
To complete the treatment of the hernia that occurs due to nerve strain.
Thus, hernias occur in the rear and venous regions; they also seem to occur in the nerves when they are struck or due to excessive labor, or in a similar manner.
And it is applied to the most painful areas of the legs or feet, or anywhere the joints are troubled.
It is a severe apoplexy, resembling the color of another body, and it affects its largest parts; when squeezed by violent force, a sense of stupor seems to envelop the patient.
It is not an apoplexy affecting the whole body, and therefore the patient remains conscious; it is felt throughout the entire body and does not affect any specific parts in front or behind.
Therefore, regarding those who have it in the joints, it does not indicate that it is caused by iron; for as their pain increases, contraction will ensue.
The person who has it in the head or forehead should bind the neck with a bandage. If it is a minor abscess, then cut around it and remove that part.
And if it is large, then lift it with a spoon, remove that, and close it; and dress the wound with stitches, and treat it until it heals.
Chapter.
On the section of the abscess that occurs from the wound that occurs in the abdomen.
Indeed, some people observe swelling in the abdomens of these individuals and in other parts of their bodies, which are called fungal because they resemble mushrooms; the root of those is subtle and the head of them is large; and the edges of those are convoluted, and it is from these that a great deal of discharge is produced.
And you have already seen one, and in its belly there were two parts which were more functional and similar in appearance, and there was no difference between those white ones, of small size.
And the lips of those [parts] were everted and cracked, and moisture flowed from them constantly.
Therefore, you should cut these off and tighten the bandage around the foot, one at 18 inches and the other at 6 inches.
And the operation in the incision of them is that you consider when the illness is humid, and the color of the swelling is white, moist, of fine size; then you cut them with a broad spatula, and bring near to you hot cautery from the fire, as you have seen the section of it is expelled with much blood; and if the blood comes out, cauterize that.
And if the patient is fearful and anxious, beware of sudden movements with a sharp instrument; then take fresh lead from a well-prepared mold, tighten that bandage in the manner we have described, and leave it for two days.
Then adjust the tightness of the lead thread; therefore, do not cease to tighten the large lead after it has been incised and falls out by itself through its work.
If that part is of thick texture, there is no cause for fear or anxiety in its incision, especially in those located in the abdomen.
It is possible that you incise the bulk of it and then cauterize that so that it does not return.
And then take care so that it is cured as the disease heals.
And be careful not to presume to cut that which is of a dark color, with little feeling, and regularly shaped, for that is absolutely cancerous.
And now let us recall some further remedies for this.
Chapter II.
On the cure of hernia (or 'eminence' of the navel).
The hernia or protrusion of the navel is caused by various reasons: either through fissures in the abdominal wall above the belly, and the intestine or hernia returns to its cavity as it should in other ruptures; or through a vein or an artery that flows from it (as described above), or due to excessive flatulence confined within.
If it is due to an abdominal wall fissure and the hernia's protrusion, then the color of the hernia will be similar to that of the body; it will be painful, and its position will vary. And if it is for the removal of the hernia, consider the position of that which we have recounted with greater diversity, and when you press on those ties, it is as if they are concealed, then return; it is firmly attached to its own place, and it magnifies the need for much bathing and vigorous work.
If it is due to humidity, it becomes hard and is not concealed when you press with your hand, nor is it constricted or ruptured.
And if it is due to scrofula, then these symptoms appear as an abscess turning black and declining.
If it is not due to flesh, then the abscess is severe, thick, and hard, and it is fixed according to its quantity.
If it is due to windiness, then the touch of it is hard.
And the operation on it is that you consider when the prominence of the navel is due to a hernia, or a vein, or from flatulence; then know that you should refrain from treating it, for there is fear and danger as it is taught in the chapter where I have spoken about hernias by arteria and vena.
If the prominence of the navel is due to an intestine or hernia, then know that you should order the patient to take a few deep breaths and lie down; then gently press around the entire navel, and command them to keep it reversed between your hands on their back, and wrap a broad spatula around the navel in the area where you felt the pressure; and extend the amount of the hernia upwards towards the thighs with gentle force; and then secure the opening with a strong thread or catgut in a proper manner.
Then open the hernia by cutting through the ligament and insert your finger into that opening to explore the intestine; and if you have tightened or tied it up with the ligament, then carefully cut it free and gently push the intestine back inside the abdomen.
And if you have found the infection, then take some ointment; and cut away its excess.
If it is contrary to your skill or vein, then circle that part, and return to your operation; and take two needles and insert them into those two strong threads and pass two needles through the loop which you have made around the abscess in a crosswise manner, which will make them penetrate; and then tighten the abscess in four parts over the needles.
And if you wish, leave the needles and allow the location to heal until the flesh is extended and falls off by itself; or cut it when it has thickened and can be removed, and then care for it with something that covers the wound until it heals.
And if the prominence of the navel is only flesh or due to moisture, then cover as you have done with the abscess, thus removing the sanch or moisture which you find in it, and then care for it with something that covers and strengthens the area.
Chapter .liii.
On the Cure for Cramp.
We have discussed, in our previous section, the types of cramp and the manner in which it is treated by medicine, and that cure with iron is to be avoided as it may ulcerate; we also spoke about the causes of cramp and precautions for its treatment.
And the ancients said that at certain times cramp is in a location where it is possible to eradicate it, as with cramp in the breasts or in the groin and similar places in the other members, to extract everything, especially when it is just beginning.
But when it is old and severe, it does not respond to treatment, as I have neither seen nor heard of any success in that regard.
And the operation on it is as we have said, you should proceed and remove the illness and purge it of black cholera several times, and then cut off that part if a distinct refllux is observed.
Then prepare the hernia for the operation with a preparation in which it is located, and cauterize the incisions that cover it; and carefully explore all parts with the knife to avoid any cause for concern regarding the roots of the hernia. And do not let the blood flow, nor cut off that part abruptly; squeeze the spots and wipe away the thick blood with your hand or an instrument suitable from among the available tools.
If it causes you difficulty to make an incision of a thick vein or artery, cauterize it until the flow of blood stops, and then care for the other part with the appropriate treatment as long as it heals.
Chapter .liv.
On the cure of hydrophobia.
We have already discussed, in the previous section, the types of hydrophobia and the signs of each type, as well as the medicinal treatments for them.
And the one that is cured with iron is only the species of altitude, and it is not approached with iron to the species of tympanitis or the species of hyposarchea, for that is mortal.
And when you have already medicated this species of hydrophobic tympanitis with medicines and do not confirm your treatment, consider this, for if the disease has been weakened in the patient or it is another malady, other than this type of hydrophobia, similar to those in the throat or abdomen, then beware that you do not treat it with iron, for there is fear over that.
If you examine the disease of an exuberant vertute, and it is nothing but hydrops only, without inflammation or aging, then the manner of operating on it is that you lift up the disease between your hands, and apply them appropriately to extract water from the abdomen at the base of the penis, and take a spiny spatum according to this form:
it should be of two sharp parts long, with a pointed extremity also like the spatum; however, make it in no way too short, bit by bit, so that during the operation on him, it does not enter the abdomen, and you hold it.
And consider whether the generation of hydrops is from the intestines, for then you will see that by sectioning near the navel, about three fingers' distance on either side, it opens to the parts beneath.
If the generation of hydrops is due to a disease of the intestines, then make your section on the left side of the navel about three fingers' distance.
And if the formation of it is due to moisture, then your incision should be on the right side.
And ensure that your incision is on the side where the pain is located, so as not to spread fluid to that area.
Then completely perforate the abscess with the instrument, and insert your hand into the opening, and raise your hand with a spatula between the abscess and the anus, and extract it; and if it is the size of a finger or smaller.
And then perforate the anus until the spatula reaches the desired location, which is where the water is. Then extract that, and insert an instrument of this form: It resembles a thin silver tube; it is made of silver or bronze or iron, and at the lower part of it there is a small opening, and on its sides are three openings: two from one side and one from the other; and its end is incised according to the shape of a pen, thus:
And at the upper end of it is a ring, for when the instrument reaches the water, this will immediately seize upon the instrument, thereby evacuating a large quantity of water in the meantime, for if you evacuate less than necessary during that time, strong pain may result from the resolution of their animal spirit or death may occur.
You should evacuate according to the quantity required by the virtue of it and according to your understanding of the patient's condition, based on the virtue of their pulse and the goodness of it.
And after withdrawing the instrument, retain the water that is caused, for it is retained by the string which blocks the opening over the organ from which it was extracted, and you should perforate that according to that method.
And then repeat the procedure on another day if the patient tolerates it, extract a small amount of water and do this for several days with caution, beware of error as not to remove too much water.
If you are concerned about the condition and drain a large amount of water, then treat it with burial in sand, moistening it in a bath, and exposing it to the sun for a long time; and treat it with drying medications until it is healed.
And apply a cautery to the stomach, and the intestines, and extract the water as I have described in what precedes.
Chapter XXV.
On the treatment of children whose birth places are not perforated.
Sometimes, certain children are born with a hole in their mother's womb and the head of their mixture (amniotic sac) is not pierced (or it has been cut too early or not in the right place).
Therefore, one should carefully consider the perforation of the womb as soon as a child is born with a thin, subtle discharge in this manner:
And then, in the wound, insert a subtle lead pin and bind it with a cloth, for three days or seven.
And as for urination, it should be done repeatedly and then return to the bed.
And if you do not bind the lead, it is possible that the urine which flows over this area will not be effectively prevented from entering.
May the one whose pain is severe be treated with a lead clavicle, as we have said, for many days until it is relieved.
For those whose pain is out of place, it is said that the cause lies in a person who is born with a defect or an injury to their bladder, preventing them from urinating properly; until they raise the bladder with their hand above their genitals, and due to this, the semen cannot reach the mother as it should, and it becomes a motley illness.
The manner of the operation is as follows: the patient lies on their back, and you extend the head of the bladder with your left hand while gently pulling it, then incise the base of the bladder's head at the opening of the urethra using a scalpel, or any instrument you prefer, so that the middle part of the bladder resembles the head of the bladder and the pain is relieved in its proper place.
And be careful in your procedure to drain the pus, for complications may arise from it; stop it from draining and treat the wound until it is healed.
Chapter LVI.
Of the alba (a term related to the foreskin) that occurs in the prepuce at the head of the penis due to decay and corruption, and the blackness and adhesiveness of the prepuce at the head of the penis.
Various complications occur with this alba on the penis, and there is an emission of putrid flesh.
And some of these are malignant, while others are not.
For the non-malignant ones, you should suspend them with a subtle hook and cut off that which remains; then place your hand over the affected area with Egyptian niter, and after that, treat it with refined honey until it is healed.
And if the abscess is malignant, of a dark color, then you must administer cautery near its incision and reason for it.
If the abscess is on the foreskin of an uncircumcised man, and one part of the abscess is within the foreskin and the other part is outside, then you must drain the abscess that is inside first, until it is consolidated; and at the same time, treat the opening outside, because when you cure that opening, the foreskin may still be infected.
And also there are incidents in the genitals and foreskin that turn black and swollen, so you must extract everything that has turned dark or is about to decay or is already corrupt; then apply a line of that which is beneficial, made from flour of millet mixed with crushed and powdered thistle.
And then treat that with the other treatment until it is healed.
If there is an end of blood flow, then apply cauterization monthly according to this form:
The cautery that is most beneficial is to two dispositions together, either for the flow of blood or for a corrupted ulcer.
And if the head of the ulcer is corrupted and completely destroyed at that moment, then insert a lead cannula into the flesh of the foreskin so that the malady urinates through that.
In the adherence of the foreskin to the head of the ulcer (and this adherence occurs only in those whose foreskin is, and circumcision is not required over it; and when adherence occurs due to a wound or abscess), then with an obtuse spatula, loosen until the adhesion is dissolved and the head of the ulcer is completely freed.
And if it is difficult to separate those exquisitely, then with a spatula, carefully loosen from the head of the ulcer and the foreskin, and thus it is because when the foreskin is thin, its strength is slightly perforated by its thinness.
And then carefully separate the prepuce from the head of the penis with a sharp instrument, which has already been soaked in hot water to prevent it from adhering again.
Then, it is necessary to care for the wound with a hemostatic agent until it is healed.
Chapter VII.
On the purification of infants and the treatment of what happens to those of circumcision.
Circumcision is not a solution for continuity, as with other ailments; however, when it is of our own making and our own volition, and it concerns children, it is necessary that we assign to this better operation and method the least possible harm for their health.
Therefore, it is said that the ancients did not practice circumcision in any of their free lands, since they do not write it in their laws, and this is because we have acquired through experience that it causes great harm to many skilled practitioners and barbers, who use circumcision and purification with razors and hot iron; instead, they use lint and cutting with the fingernail.
And having tried all these ways and not finding better relief than with scissors, lint, or thread in the operation, since the thread moves away from the wound, as the thread of the prepuce is torn into two layers, and the inner one remains, and often it is necessary to make another incision and a sure pain follows. And the operation that is performed by cauterization, which is digital, and is used by barber-surgeons, is not secure in making an incision at the end of the male member, because a strong tension occurs within the wound.
But in the operation with hot instruments, strong tension breaks and corrupts your operation. And the foreskin of a child is short by nature, and it happens in such a way that it does not need an operation, and I have seen this.
Regarding the preparation that is done with scissors and thread, I have discovered through experience its true nature, for the scissors are of precise incision, thereby matching the sharpness above with the sharpness below; and thus, when you apply your hand in a measured way at one time, compression of the thread takes place in the form of a circle containing all the pain from every part, to which no error can attach.
And the first manner of the operation is that you must keep the child mostly still if it is one of those who understands a little, doing nothing but tying the thread to its hernia and letting it be for another day.
And then do all you can to make the patient happy in every way that his intelligence allows. And then be sure to prepare everything carefully and do not cause any pain; hide the scissors in your hand or place a cloth over the child's feet so that he does not see the scissors or any other instrument.
And then insert your hand into the patient's anus and blow into the rectum, pulling it until the tip of the instrument reaches the end, and clean that which has been added to it from filth.
The form of the instruments for cleaning, this is the form:
The extremities are not all of the same length and some are longer than others; the foot's bone structure should have the same angle as two handles, each with the same length.
But the correction of this error lies in understanding that the intrinsic tension must not be entirely escaped, or a part of it must be preserved for incision.
Therefore, it is necessary to stretch the skin of your finger towards the direction of the joint's movement and make an incision according to this equality.
And if you cannot hold your finger's skin towards the joint's movement, then remove it with a knife and make an incision there.
If it has been three days and there is an inflammation left from the apithesis (possibly a type of skin condition or injury), then leave it until the inflammation subsides, gently remove any hardened matter, and make an incision according to what you have prepared.
And be mindful of the head of the hernia, as it will not tolerate this.
And therefore, cure that which the plague solidifies from the powders that we have mentioned in the treatment of powders.
And if it is incised from the cord on measure, and you adhere to its parts, this will not bother it.
And make cure for that which we have said, so that it be healed.
Chapter LVIII.
On the cure of urine retention in the bladder.
Urine retention in the bladder is caused by swelling due to stone or sand, or obstruction or inflammation, and resembles those of which we have spoken regarding treatment in division.
And if it does not dissolve as we have said, then know that the cause of the disease is vehement, and extract it from the patient with an instrument called a syringe, which has this form: Both silver and lion-shaped, with a needle as thin as a long ray, similar to a palm and a half, and a thin cane at its tip.
And the method of urination is as follows: take the folded thread and tie it at the end of a thin thread or string for proper drainage; insert the ends of the thread through the opening left by the urethra, cut them if there is any superfluous cause from the string, but insert them forcefully into the cannula, and then open the urethra with forceps and cover it with a sponge and alum.
And make incisions on the patient's belly, open the bladder and the wound with oils such as olive oil and water.
Then insert the urethra with ease until it reaches the depth of the wound; fold the wound upwards at the opening of the catheter; push the catheter from inside; and push it until it reaches the bladder, ensuring that the hernia is brought to its proper position, not causing any damage.
And then carefully extend the intestines along the small incisions, as urine dries out the intestines.
Then extract that one for the treatment of urine, using a catheter, do not cease to do this and use a catheter until the bladder is emptied and the patient's condition is relieved.
**Chapter LIX.**
On the quality of bladder cleansing with clamps and similar instruments that are suitable for this purpose.
When it happens in the bladder ulceration or abscess, or a congestion of pus forms there, and you wish to drain water and medicines from that place, then use an instrument called a clamp, and this is how it is used:
but if its opening at the end is blocked, it is closed. And there are three steps: two from one side, thus as often.
In the beginning, there is a congestion, which is what is being pushed, and according to its quantity, it accumulates, until some cause throws off the humidity, which is then expelled, and when it is expelled, it is thrown back, and when it leaves completely, it acts like a clamp that holds naphtha in maritime battles.
Therefore, if you want to prevent humidity in the bladder, insert the end of the clamp into the humidity and throw it against the parts below, for the humidity is thrown back into the cavity of the clamp.
And then insert the end of the clamp into the wound as we have mentioned in the circumcision; and push the humidity against what you are pushing, for that humidity reaches the bladder soon enough, and the illness focuses on that.
The shape of the delicate crystal through which the bladder is crystalized, and that shape is:
Whether it is made of silver or iron, which resembles a small feather at the top and leaves a mark inside the wound.
Then take the bladder with motion, and place in that humidity which you want to crystalize in the bladder, and then tie it between two firm ligatures with double thread, and heat that humidity over fire.
And then insert the extremity of the crystalizer into the vein.
And then place your hand over the bladder with the humidity and stretch gently until the patient feels that the humidity has already reached the bladder.
If you do not have a bladder at hand, take a piece of cloth and make a circle from it; then perforate that circle completely through its roundness; and insert the thread firmly into those channels, turning it as needed; then add the cloth to the water so that it retains the desired humidity, and also smells and tastes.
And then you insert that into the instrument and make it in the same way as you have made the bladder, and express with your hand while the moisture reaches the bladder.
**Chapter LXX (60)**
**On the extraction of stones**
We have already discussed the division of stone types and their treatment with medicines, as well as the difference between stones formed in the kidneys and those formed in the bladder, and the signs of each.
And we have discussed the stone that requires surgical intervention with the hand, and incision.
And the stone formed in the bladder specifically is the one that is lodged in the bladder.
And they relate that this manifest exposition and concise summary should be followed.
Therefore, it says that the disease born in the bladder mostly affects children; and among its signs, the urine expelled from the bladder is similar to water in its subtlety, appearing cloudy; the illness irritates their pride, causes frequent urination, and when treated, leaves a scar.
And the healing of children from that illness becomes easier after they have reached 13 years old; and it is a difficult cure for the elderly. In the young, it is more common due to what happens between those affected.
And concerning him whose stone is larger and healing is more difficult; and if it is few, it is contrary to that one.
Therefore, in order to address this issue, we must begin by cleansing the malady with Christ, which extracts all the opening present in their intestines; for that opening sometimes blocks the flow of urine after its inspection.
Then, with the malady affecting their feet, position and massage them gently so that the urine descends into the bladder or sometimes, it may leave its place.
Then apply that compress between their hands, and the patient's hands should be left with things related to them, so that the bladder is completely emptied towards the exit parts.
Then, thoroughly remove that and all other foreign objects.
Therefore, if you feel the urine in the space, then immediately cut it off with a scalpel over it.
And if you do not catch it from the beginning, cover it with oil the specific indication of the left hand, whether the illness is a child or that small seed if it is an adult, and insert it into his anus. And once the stone is removed, make sure it does not return. And convert that small stone into smaller pieces within the bladder's neck.
Then press on that specific area with your hand, and expel the stone outside from the place where you extracted it.
And command the assistant to press the bladder with their hand; and command another assistant to extend their legs with their right hand above, and with their other hand to hold the skin around the opening where the extraction is done, keeping it tight.
And then insert a knife into the incision from which this hernia proceeds: It splits in the space between the buttocks and the genitals, not in the middle of the leg, first on the left side; and the incision is made over that bone, and it is said to be in the buttock, and a transverse cut is made so that the external cut is wide and the internal narrow according to the amount that the stone projects from the buttock, as much as possible, but not excessively, for the saying is that when the incision is made in the buttock, one must consider the position of the stone, and this should be avoided at all costs.
And you should know that there is a stone with angles and edges, making its extraction difficult because of this.
And from that, it resembles a pearl, round and is of the lightest consistency.
Therefore, if it is that which has angles and edges, adjust it in the fissure.
And if it cannot be done in this way, then cover your fingers over that part, or tighten it with a gesture appropriately, the extremity of which is as sharp as a lime, with which you tighten it onto the stone, and do not slip from it; or insert between them a delicate instrument with a curved extremity.
If you cannot do that, then amplify the opening a little, and if you see a flow of pus, cut it off strongly with vitriolic treacle.
But if the stone is larger than one, at the beginning, push your finger into the mouth of the bladder and cut into it; then insert a smaller one; and in this way, they seem to be divided into two.
And if the pain is very great, it is ignorance to cut into that great section, as it causes harm to the patient due to one of two reasons: either it stops (the flow) or it promotes the discharge of continuous urine, which is why the area is not completely consolidated.
If an expulsion of the contents inside that is not natural occurs, or a fracture of the bone uses forceps to extract those in pieces.
Therefore, after you have completed your operation, fill the wound with aloe and dragon's blood, and strengthen it. And place that cloth soaked in oil and wine, or oil and water, over it to promote the release of pus.
Then return the patient to their bed, and do not disturb the bandage for three days.
And when that is loosened, wet the place with water and oil, and then apply a mixture of fine and coarse salves until it heals.
If, in the case of an abscess, cauterization and drainage are performed, and it resembles as if the urine is frozen in the bladder, and because of this, urination is hindered (and this is known as the egress of urine), then insert what I said about the plague and extract that pus, for it can cause corruption and putrefaction of the bladder and itself.
Then wash the plague with vinegar, water, and salt, and in opposition to all kinds of things that are beneficial for its healing until it is cured.
And during all the hours of healing, make sure that you attend to both parts and adjust the medications that are placed on the affected area.
And if the stone is small and located in the urethra, lodged there, and urination is blocked, then treat it with something that you have previously recommended before it leads to amputation, as troops used for this treatment are accused of causing amputation; and already you have squeezed it and it is such that you take a steel probe, from which this has the form.
of the triangular end, sharp, lodged in the wood.
Then take a thread, tie it to the urethra, leaving the stone behind so that it does not return to the bladder.
Then insert the steel into the urethra, piercing with ease until the probe reaches the stone. And turn the probe with your hand on the stone, slowly and carefully, piercing until you have made an opening from the other side; for urination will soon be restored.
And then press your hand upon that which is broken off from the stone of the kidney, outside the bladder, for it is squeezed and discharged through urine, and the disease is healed.
If this treatment is not suitable for any reason due to the patient's condition, then tie a thread around the kidney and another thread on top of it. And then close the bladder around that stone in this opening between two passages. And then extract that one. And then loosen the adhesion and clean the infected gangrene, which is formed in the wound.
And it is not necessary to tie a thread around the kidney again, only to prevent it from returning to the bladder; and the other ligament on top is removed when the thread is loosened, for when the kidney stone is discharged, the infection returns to its place and afflicts the patient again.
And for this it is necessary when you tie the patient's legs, that you raise the knee to their sides, or that you return them to their proper position, and correct the deformity as we have said.
Chapter LXI.
On the extraction of stones from women.
Stones in women are rarely generated.
If you see a stone in any of those areas, its treatment is difficult, and it is forbidden by numerous methods.
One of their weaknesses is that women who are very strong may be vulnerable.
And the second weakness is that you may not find a woman who knows how to discover a stone if she has never been examined by a doctor, or if she is married to a man who lacks medical knowledge.
The third sentence translates to: "Cleanliness is why you don't allow women to perform this art, especially the operation with their hands.
And the fourth sentence states: "And in women, the place of incision over the stone is far from the actual stone, so it requires a deeper incision, and that is where fear lies.
If it is necessary to do this, then ensure you seek the help of a knowledgeable female doctor, as they are hard to find.
If you are lacking in this regard, then seek out a skilled and subtle doctor, or present a woman midwife well-versed in women's matters, or a woman who has herself undergone this procedure.
So, present this woman, and command her to do everything you instruct, from the examination of the stone to its removal. This is because it is important to consider if the woman is a virgin, ensuring she keeps her statement confidential when inserting her finger into the patient's anus and examining the stone.
Therefore, if you find it, cut it off, leaving its root, and then command him to incise upon it.
If it is not virgin, then command the midwife to insert her finger into the patient's urethra and feel over the bladder, for she places her left hand on the vesica and grasps it firmly.
Therefore, if you find it, cut gradually, moving from the horror of the bladder to the exits, at the top of its power, so that it prevails over that matter.
And then make an incision over that position of the bladder at the top of the thigh, stopping from some part, centering the urine on that side, and the finger should not be withdrawn from the urine while cutting.
And the incision should be slight at the beginning; then insert the ray over that incision, and if the urine is felt, adjust the section according to the quantity, knowing how much urine will be released from that.
And you know that the spices of the pear are diverse: for some are small and sharp, others large and harsh, some long and round, and they have spikes.
Therefore, you know the number of spices it contains according to what you have said about what you want.
And if you wish to stop the flow of blood, apply vitriol trichate to the site and leave it for an hour until the bleeding stops, then return to your operation until the pear is removed.
And prepare for yourself the instruments that are mentioned in the removal of pear in men, so that you will be assisted by them in your operation.
And if you wish to stop the flow of blood, and know that the expulsion of the blood is from the vein that is incised, then place powder on the site, open it with a pulley and stricture gently, and do not repeat this; leave the pear and do not extract it, for otherwise the illness will worsen. And then apply the remedy.
Therefore, when the inflammation of the wound has subsided after a few days, and the location is suitable, then you return to your operation while the stone is removed.
Chapter LII.
On section regarding hernia surgery.
A hernia inguinal is nothing but an accumulation of moisture in the white cavity, which leaves the genitals of the contents, and it is called the cavity.
And in some cases, it is within the natural lining that prepares itself for the passage of the houl, as long as it is a new houl; and this is the closure of the genitals between the white cavity that we have mentioned, and it is not this but a tartar.
And the generation of this hernia is due to weakness that occurs in the muscles, as this material is discharged into them, and sometimes it occurs due to impact made on the muscles.
And this humidity does not have moving colors, for the color of it declines to citron or sanguine, or red, or black and sticky, or white and watery, and it is this that is most common.
And the signs by which it is known that this addition of water occurs are as follows: for if it is in the white flesh that we have mentioned, then the swelling becomes round, declining slightly in length, with a figure like an egg, and the muscle appears, because the humidity covers all parts.
And if the humidity is in the own fat layer, then the swelling becomes round and separated from the muscle, and thus one thinks it is another muscle.
And if moisture is between the bones of the spine and the white scalp, then scrape away the feeling.
And to determine the colour of the moisture, you should observe the colour of the moisture in the aperture through which the abnormal growth emerges; and according to what is seen in the traces left by the growth, judge what lies within it.
Therefore, when we come to the treatment of a hernia, you should know that the patient must be made to lie down if it is possible, and then turn the organs inside it over.
And then lay the patient on their back for some time, due to any cause, and cover them with warm blankets.
And then place yourself on the left side of the patient, and order the assistant to follow the right side, extending their finger from two fingers' breadth below the spine to the base of the spine and to the opening of the abdomen.
And then carefully take a broad knife and cut through the cord of the testicles along their length near the scrotum.
And make the incision according to the same distance from the line where you have shaven the skin of the testicles, reaching down to the white bone.
And extract it, observe, and be careful not to pierce; your incision should be as wide as necessary, and examine the extraction carefully according to the amount you can achieve.
Then carefully pierce the white bone with a wide puncture and extract all the water.
Then separate the two lips of the incision with forceps, and extend the white bone apart; do not touch the cord attached to the testicles, and incise the white bone in that manner as best you can. And incise it completely through, focusing particularly on its thin edges, because if you do not carefully scrutinize the incision of it, there is a sure risk that the water will return.
But if during the process of removing that from its container at the time of your operation, you have completed the section of the circumcision, then return inside it, and properly adjust both lips of the container from the genitals with stitches, and take care of it just as you do with other wounds, until it is healed.
And if you find that it is corrupted by another disease, then tie the vessels that are above the suspension, extract it, and treat it as we have said.
But if water is added in two instances, then you know that both are hernias; so incise that part according to what you have done with the other in contrast; and if it appears to be an operation to you, then perform it.
And then, you shall wash the wound, and enter the sections with wool soaked in oil or olive oil; place outside another piece of wool soaked in wine and oil, and spread that over the two genitals and the wonder of the belly; lay it upon folded sheets and powders, and bind those with a lint as follows:
Then, take two sheets of cloth and stuff them with woolen rags as follows; secure the extremities with tape or damp wool, and add structure in the crotch area of the pants, taking one extremity from the buttocks towards the two, and the second from the opening of the legging, and two other extremities on either side, leaving two unbound for the thighs, and all adjustments are made to fit in the crotch of the pants.
And in some cases, this hernia is treated artificially with cautery instead of sectioning with a knife; so you take a delicate cutting cautery and inscribe at that place the seal of the genitals, and light it according to what we have recommended until the white scar tissue containing the fluid becomes exposed, and then you take the cautery as follows: It resembles Greek writing.
And then perforate that seal, and ignite it until all moisture is expelled.
Then extend the seal with scissors, cut it with scissors, and burn it gently with a small cautery; slice open that second one as much as you can until you eradicate all of it; be careful so that the fire doesn't touch you.
And you know that this operation is more safe and further from infection than an amputation. It is better than surgery with a sword.
If it causes you difficulty to use a cautery in the time of amputation or in the time of burning, or an infection flows, then cure what opposes you with regard to this, as a treatment that is suitable for it according to what has been said.
If the disease is severe and does not expect a second operation because of its horror, then perform an incision as you have been instructed; and it is at this point that you must, based on what we have said about signs, certify that this hernia is watery.
Now you must address the disease on some raised spot, then pierce the abscess at the lowest point of it with a sharp instrument, and pause the incision according to the length of the body.
And if the opening is wide enough, then let all the water flow out.
Then place your hand over the area tightly and hold it there until the flow of water stops. And then dress the wound until the plague is healed.
If there is a contradiction to the flow of water at that moment when you perforate it: this is not done unless the white pannus in the orifice of the wound causes resistance and prevents the outflow of water, then insert into the wound a needle or instrument with which the water from the drops is extracted, whose form precedes; or apply a small amount to the size of the wound.
And you know that water returns and remains there for about four or five months; and when it is added, then pierce it in the same manner as before, because the disease will also spend its days like this.
Chapter LXXXIII
On hernias and their treatment.
You know that in the operation on this hernia there is great danger of losing life; so I, for my part, recommend its removal and salvation through a better method.
And you should remember the operation on those and the spices of the abscesses.
Therefore, it is said that the abscesses originate in the bodies of those whose genera are composed of them, and this is done for several causes: either due to a severe acute inflammation that overflows into the genera, or through impact.
And the color of the abscess is according to the color of the body, and it does not cause pain in it, and it is a grave abscess.
And very rare is the lapified abscess, of which the color is dark, and it does not cause pain.
And sometimes it is caused by the compression of the arteries, or by inflammation of those areas where the memory of it has already been perceived, or by inflammation of the veins.
It is known that what is called inflammation of the joints is due to the dispersion of pus when you press on those parts, and it should not be probed.
What is formed due to vein inflammation should not be dispersed for any reason; you should not probe it with compression on those parts.
And it is possible that on this specific case, incision and section are performed, as well as on other tissues; you insert the knife into the openings of the genitals, then extract the white-colored fluid from them, sever the suspenders of the vessels, tie them, and incise the most distant suspender after you have severed that of every part of the testicle.
Therefore, if the testicle is already consolidated in those tissues, then you should extract it and incise it.
And if there is an adhesion within any cause of the fracture, or between what is between the bones, you must loosen all that adhesion and cut it with a round incision.
If there is a natural opening in the adhesion behind the cause of it, you must then cut everything that belongs to it and extract the humors as we have said.
So when your operation is complete, fill the wound with warm oil and vinegar; and then care for it with other remedies until it heals.
Chapter LXIV
On the treatment of hernias that occur in the abdomen.
This is a hernia that has become enclosed by some kind of swelling, similar to the softening of the testicles, and it makes movement, exercise, and walking for the patient difficult.
And in the treatment of this illness, it is for fear of that which precedes its remembrance.
However, I note that they say operation in that second when I perform the first.
And it says that you should stop the illness on a high chair; then dislodge the suspender of the testicles from their sockets; and take hold of the chain of the genitals with your hand placed between the testicles, which have been proven to be inflamed by the flame; and use those other instruments as needed, extending them to their fullest extent.
Then cut with a knife, as it were, the hard substance that has closed the passages of the vessels while they are still uncovered.
And extract from every part as we have said about removing the obstructions in the temples.
And then insert a needle with two threads, fasten it to the first place where the pain occurs, and do the same again at the end of their course. Then make incisions at the middle of the affected area in a straight line according to the length of the body, and extract what is accumulated from the putrid and corrupt humors.
Then treat the disease with remedies for other diseases in which you wish to be free from pain, so that the vessels that cause suffering do not remain blocked, as it is not harmful for these reasons.
If it happens that all the vessels are affected, then remove the testicles or tie them off with the vessels, so that they are deprived of all nutrition through the incision of the vessels and become atrophied, or tie them to prevent their growth with these.
Chapter .lxv.
**On the treatment of intestinal hernias.**
The occurrence of this hernia is due to a tear in the abdominal wall extending from the openings of the abdominal viscera, allowing the intestines to protrude through the rupture.
And this rupture can be either of the abdomen or of an outgrowth (excursion) of it, and these two types occur for various reasons: beating, sudden shock, loud noise, the lifting of some heavy cause, or similar things.
The sign of this, when it is due to extension of the abdomen, is that it occurs gradually over a long period, and not suddenly, and it is accompanied by swelling in both the small and large intestines as the abdomen becomes compressed.
And the sign of the illness is when it is caused by a rupture in the bowels, which at the beginning causes violent pain suddenly; and it appears as an abscess different from the usual ones near the knee joint, and this is due to the protrusion of the intestine, and the contents of the intestines coming out.
And sometimes the intestine pushes through a weak spot in the abdominal wall, and this is called an intestinal hernia.
And sometimes it is caused by bloating, and sometimes it runs through the abdominal wall gap, and here it gets trapped, and this is where it causes great harm to the patient, and sometimes it causes severe and intense pain especially when pressed.
In the treatment of this illness with herbs, one must be cautious, as it is important to avoid the wrong herbs in that case.
And the method of operating on that is to command the patient to reduce the hernia with their hand into its cavity if they obey its return, then place yourself between their chest and legs, and raise their legs.
And then tighten the cord that is the cord of the testicles away from them, and cut the cord of the testicles completely through; and fasten in two folds the incised section as you need to open the section with these.
And if the section is according to the quantity that it is possible for you to make, then make sure that from that, a hole will not be left behind.
And then remove those chips which are left below the cord of the testicles, as long as the white hard lump of each part is exposed.
Now insert your thumb into the space where the testicle is located, between the white hip bone, which is below the scrotum, and between the second hip bone, and free that adhesion behind the testicle.
Then take your right hand and grasp the scrotum at the external orifice, extend the white hip bone with your left hand, raise the testicle at the juncture of the section, and command the assistant to spread the testicle open, and you will dissolve the adhesion behind it with a complete solution.
And press with your thumbs where there is no cause of the intestine's entrapment within the white, hard hip bone. If you find no cause within it (the intestine), then press on the abdomen below.
And then cut into the opening left after the cords of the testicles, so that blood and pus can flow out as we have recommended in what we have said above.
And then apply a cloth soaked in oil to the wound and place it on the ulcer; and use the bandage we recommended (and sometimes white cauterization with a hot iron, as we said, is applied for fear of pus flow, since such cases often occur) and leave the bandage until it falls off by itself.
If the case of the patient is prolonged, then water should be poured over him and he should be placed in a position where the water falls as we have said.
And then cure the ulcer with other remedies for ulcers until it is healed.
Chapter LXVI.
On Ventose Hernia.
In this hernia, nothing has been seen that indicates a successful treatment for it other than the use of forceps.
And the first step is to perform the operation as we have recommended for hernia, which is to close the vessels near the section with ease; and then dry the middle part around the fistula with something that will facilitate its healing, until the vessels fall.
And cure the plague as we have said until it is healed.
**Capitol LXVII**
On the dislocation that occurs in the ankles.
Sometimes, dislocations in the ankles break apart, as we have said, and this excites the place.
And do not deny any cause of hernias to the genius; and if they do, it is rare; and return to it at all times.
If the time is prolonged, a fissure is corrected in the skin until the hernia descends into the skin; this occurs due to the expansion of the skin in the ankle, as we have said, which causes it to become stretched, and then hardened, and the place excites.
And the cure for it is with cautery, as was preceded by the description of it.
And sometimes the disease is cured by cutting it in this manner: for the malady lies between the thighs and close to the anus, then return the opening of the rupture of the aponeuroses to its place according to the extent, in length, according to the quantity of three fingers.
Then tighten the white string that is beneath the skin, as soon as it is discovered.
Then take the ray and place it over the prominent area of the string, and press it against the belly's projection.
Then pinch the two prominent points on the end of the string's ray and align them with one another by adjusting the suture.
Then pull out the string's end, without inserting it into the hernial sac or extending the hernia, or any other cause as you should know in the treatment of intestinal hernias.
And then apply the cure for the disease, and when you cut away the pus, cleanse it and restore the wound until it is healed; for the infection is contracted and the prominence of rupture is not adjusted.
And cauterization is better at this location, for it is closer to health.
Chapter LXVIII.
On the softening of the cord of the testes.
In some men, the cord of the testes is softened due to the softening of the tissues surrounding it; thus, care must be taken regarding it.
Therefore, it is necessary for the one who is tasked with the healing of this that the patient be positioned according to their condition, and all the softened cord be removed from the natural cord; and then make two lips adhere to the wound.
And if you wish, at the beginning, using the excess of softened cordage, make three or four stitches and a secure suture.
Then cut between the stitches; and carefully tend to the healing of other ailments within, so that when the flesh heals, the pain disappears.
**Chapter LXIX**
**On Castration**
You know that castration is forbidden in our law, but I will recall it in this book for two reasons: the first is so that doctors may understand it when they are asked about its treatment, and the second is because we sometimes need to castrate other animals for our young, as with horses, dogs, pigs, and similar creatures.
And therefore it is said that castration is performed in two ways: either by constriction or by a surgical incision.
In the case of castration by constriction, the procedure involves cutting off the testicles while they are still soft and hanging. Then take those with your hand, resolving them so that they do not appear as a result of the manipulation.
For castration by incision and section, first ensure you have the animal and with your left hand, press on the cord of its testicles.
Then join the suspenders together, and make an incision on each one with a section between them.
And then you carefully incise those purulent sores that you have lanced. And do not leave any cause untraveled regarding the cyphac, but rather the subtle cyphac that is over the vessels.
And in this manner of castration, the one that is done by ligature, is better because it leaves no cause for the testes, so that the animal does not desire to copulate.
And then take care of the plague until it is healed.
Chapter LXX (70)
On the cure for hermaphroditism.
Hermaphroditism in men occurs in two ways: one where there is an appearance of a space in the scrotum where the testes should be, resembling a woman's body with breasts; and another where both male and female characteristics are present.
And in some cases, a flow of urine can be seen from the urethra at the base of the testicles.
In women, there is a difference: their clitoris resembles two testes of a man, slightly smaller and located internally, just as the penis of a man has a foreskin and two testes.
And the treatment is of three kinds: two for men and one for women. It is because you must make those tissues tight within which the discharge of that fluid escapes, and then cure it with a treatment for other ailments.
And in the second type of men, for whom urine is discharged from the base of the testicles, there is neither cure nor operation for it.
Chapter .xxi.
Of springtime and flesh swelling due to causes related to women.
The swelling of the legs is closely tied to natural causes, as it is affected by stress, and its observation is essential; in some cases, it is exaggerated in certain women to the same extent as in men and can even occur during sexual intercourse.
Therefore, if you have excessive swelling in your legs with your hand or using fingers, then pierce it.
And do not finish with the piercing, especially at the base of the swelling, to prevent the flow of pus.
And then take care of that which is under treatment, until it is healed.
The flesh that is born hidden within the body, which fills it from inside, and is strongly inflamed outwardly according to the appearance of a worm (and for this reason they also call it "tailed malady"), therefore we must incise it thus as we do with a wound, and treat it until it is healed.
Chapter LXXII.
**On the Treatment of High Blood Pressure**
High blood pressure is characterized by the constriction of the female womb or the closure of its passageway. And it is either natural or accidental.
Accidental is due to a previous malady, or from flesh that is not properly adjusted, or from subtle and thick phlegm.
And it is made either in the region of the heart, or on the sides of the body, or in the bowels above, or in the lower bowels, and you should forbid all eating and drinking and conception, and strongly forbid menstruation.
And the knowledge of that is gained by observation of the menstrual cycle; if the swelling is apparent, it is advised; but if it is not apparent, then you should seek it out through your touch or through a mirror.
If the swelling is very subtle and is felt on both lips, then you should cut and disrupt it.
And it should be applied over both soft lips, and then your fingers indicate the pain in both places at the same time.
And the woman should be on her back, her legs extended, and then you should force open both lips until that subtle swelling is broken and the pain is relieved.
And then take wool and wrap it in oil and place it over the area, and apply heat to the site daily so that the incision does not become scarred.
If the growth is large and thick, then you must incise it with a broad spatula or a blade of mint.
If the abscess is due to food, then suspend it in a container and incise it.
And these are the medicines that stop the flow of pus from these bites, as well as pain and dragon's blood, and herbs, adjusted to the patient's albumen.
And then administer a wide metal needle to prevent the swelling from becoming hardened.
Hold it for several days and administer water from the source.
And then it is treated as another cure of consolidation until it is healed.
And sometimes it happens in the innate nature of other meats, and then you must incise according to this manner. This is also for gangrene, for the gangrene that is in the innermost parts should not be opposed with force in any way.
Chapter .LXXIII.
On the cure of hemorrhoids, tail, and red botch that occur in the vicinity of a woman's vagina.
Hemorrhoids are perceived as the openings of small veins more than those of the larger ones; and since old hemorrhoids become hardened, they are treated as such.
And already have I discussed in the division the species of those and the signs of those, and to say thus those that receive treatment and those that do not receive treatment.
Therefore, it says that hemorrhoids and ulcers are when they are in the lower part of the body and do not appear in sensation, then in those cases treatment with iron is not done.
Those that are in the upper part of the body where sensation is felt, those are the ones that are cured.
And be careful to place the woman in a reclined position, and extend her legs with forks, or a rough blanket, and insert those into the cracks.
And then sprinkle over those parts the flow of salt from a precious stone, in the same way as with cassia and similar ones.
And then gently rub their feet for an hour, and place them in cold water.
And if the flow of pus persists, then make a incision in decay to drain and remove the abscesses, stones, and similar obstructions.
Then take flour of wheat and mix it with honey, wine, and make a plaster with this over the patient's back.
If the abscess has drained, good; otherwise, make it adhere to two bandages, and perform scarification on the nipples.
Then take wool and immerse it in vinegar or in the juice of plantain or in the juice of nettle, wet it with wine and make it adhere to the place; and take care to keep the place clean until it heals.
And take care of that which needs to be cured.
**Chapter LXXIV**
On the perforation of the eye socket during an accident in the head.
There are various special kinds of abscesses that occur in the head, as well as cracks, ruptures, ulcers, pustules, erythemas, hemorrhages, oedemas, and other abscesses. And you have already described these ailments and their various types, the signs of those ailments, and the treatments for them in detail.
And it is necessary to say in this treatise about gangrene the method you see in the main when it comes to the gangrenes that you treat, and if you want to know the manner in which the operation of cutting it off is performed.
Then consider whether the pain of the gangrene in its beginning is acute with percussion and flecma (inflammation) and fever, and sometimes that swelling occurs and if you feel it strongly, do not cut off the affected part, but treat it with something that aids in the maturation until the acuteness of the symptoms ceases.
And then know that you must tie the woman down on a bed with two ties; recline her on her back and adjust her feet to the lowest part beneath the belly, expanding her thighs and holding her arms below her body, and attach some to the bed with suitable bindings.
And then the midwife should stand at the right side and administer the instrument with which the opening of the womb is expanded, the form of which will appear in those cases that require it.
And when you want to use this instrument, hold the handle of the main part of the tool close to the woman's body, and whatever part of the instrument enters the woman should not be larger than the diameter of her own neck and treat the illness. If the instrument is larger than the diameter of the mother's neck, then you should apply poultices over the texture of the mother's neck to prevent any further penetration of instruments into her neck.
And you should ensure that the angle of the instrument, as it enters from the side, is placed correctly and that the one administering the instrument holds it and rotates the angle until the opening of the mother's neck is fully open.
And when the contraction appears and it is felt with the hand, warm and moist, then you should immediately take a long spatula and clean the head of the mother.
And when the sanie (bowel movement) is evacuated, you should place a compress soaked in warm oil or vinegar on the affected area, and hold the pressure in the region of the anus.
Then remove the compress from the anus and place a clean, wet cloth over the penis, containing lavender.
And the treatment is considered complete after two days, applying whatever remedies are appropriate until it is healed.
In some cases, the anus and the affected area are washed with a mixture of water and honey, and then treated with water containing crushed lilies or aristology (a type of plant), and finally, the compress is reapplied.
If the infection is deep within the anus, you should abstain from any treatment with fire, and instead, focus on the remedies we have mentioned in the previous section.
Chapter .lxxv.
To teach midwives in what manner the embryos within should be treated when they deviate from natural form.
A midwife must recognize the beginning of natural childbirth by certain signs: when she sees a woman struggling in her pains and wishes to breathe freely, and is distracted by what is happening to her during labor, and hastens the emission of the embryo, then know that this labor is according to natural form, and that the emission of the child is upon his head, or suspended or hanging from the navel.
Therefore, when you observe those signs, know that her stomach is compressed so that the embryo gradually descends as it moves over his head, and he receives the second breath, and is freed from those superfluities with good cleansing.
Whoever is different from this part is unnatural and not commendable, for when the drunkard's condition has taken hold of his feet and his body lies before his head with his legs up or his hand on his foot or his head and his hand, or his abdomen, and he is strongly twisted on his spine, it resembles a figure that is uncommendable.
For just cause, the midwife must be wise and subtle in all those matters, and guard against errors and disappointments.
And showing all the signs of those, and what cunning is in those for their meaning and their standing upon that.
When the birth is located on their head due to natural difficulty, and it is pressing on the woman, and it becomes a difficult task, and sometimes his virtue is already weakened, then that one should stop, or what women have it, and evaporate the heat of him with fennel seed and mint oil.
And then carefully insert the catheters between their dilated and fractured spaces, or rather, through that second opening, or directly into it with your finger until you feel the moisture within it. And press the woman's belly as the baby descends.
If it does not descend, then cover the woman with a poultice of chickpea flour and fennel flour mixed together.
Then command the patient, remove the poultice, which should be changed and made to sneez vigorously; and close both his mouth and nose for an hour, so that the baby is expelled as soon as possible.
And if both of the baby's feet have been expelled at the beginning, then cover them with something to facilitate their delivery little by little. If you do not obey the treatment, then place the woman on a mat and lift her legs up, and then carefully position the mat on the ground; and ensure the woman does not fall due to the movement.
And if the pains are not relieved and the child dies, then incise them and extract the remains of the fetus from the mother's body or tie the womb to her hand with a cloth and remove that completely, for it will be forgotten.
When the fetus is on its feet, you must gently press those below, and gradually turn the small body, and then take one of its legs and stretch those little ones out bit by bit.
If he is situated within the tight spaces, then command him to relax and make him cough up the condition, for it will be forgotten if God wills it.
And if what we have recommended is not forgotten, then gradually return the small effect until it settles into its second natural form, for that will then be forgotten regarding the lighter aspect.
And if it is prohibited to do what we have recommended, then take a mixture of alder and dissolved gum, and pound it all in a mortar with good percussion, and then apply the cone of the woman, the base of the patient's belly. And then apply that cessation in distilled water, until the humors are achieved.
And when the openings left in him are closed, then do the suffumigation of myrrh and gently apply it to him. And after the suffumigation for an hour, then stop it over a hot pad, and make him sneeze and open his mouth, and take away from that, and press the lower part of his belly with light compression, for the effect will soon be forgotten.
The condition of the patient hanging laterally depends on one of their limbs. Use ingenuity to reduce the patient's hand, but if you cannot do that, then elevate the woman and try again.
And if trying does not work, then place the patient on their side, and cut things around them with a violent blow, and then apply medicinal mud and bandages that you have prepared earlier.
And if labor has begun, then perform a cesarean section immediately, and then study the reduction of the hand, and gently return the fetus to its natural position, and make the woman sneeze, and order her to press herself until it is safe.
The condition of the fetus, with its limbs expanded and the fascia stretched to both sides, is a sign of its large size. Nurse should hold the baby's hand and gently turn it this way and that, to make it easier.
And as it is heated and inflated, then apply pressure to the hernia where we have recommended oil and bandages.
Then gently guide the patient to contract and relax their muscles, after which place a hot compress on the affected area and command them to lean to the right, then reverse the order; this should alleviate the condition. Prepare for the exit of the foetus on the side.
When you observe the signs of labour from the mother following this pattern, consider and then insert your second finger into your own palm between the joints to ensure it is dry before proceeding.
And if the object is suspended over the face and neck of the patient, you will cut through that with an instrument, so that it does not get stuck and suffocate.
Then gently pull the object out from within, waiting until it stops moving, and tell the woman to wrap some cloth around herself, and then slowly extract it with ease, if God wills.
The outcome of twins or many fetuses. You should know that twins are sometimes born alive, and sometimes not at all, or three or four, which is strange and rarely happens; perhaps the causes are natural, and not human intervention.
And for those cases, whether they are multiples and separated by a thread, distinguish them within the ligament in each child's navel; some children are born this way naturally, and sometimes children are born without sight, as we have mentioned.
And if certain things are difficult to deliver due to their position, and you reach the point we have discussed regarding unnatural positions, then treat them as we have described.
And if the midwife is skilled and does what facilitates and simplifies delivery, and she takes her time, and is ingenious according to every figure as she prepares the body for childbirth, bringing about safety.
Reminder that it forms in the womb from embryos, and they are aborted.
Sometimes they form in the womb one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, and even more, and it is necessary for you to verify that a woman who has aborted none should not get pregnant again, or otherwise, another could be completely formed, which causes great damage due to the measurement of the wise doctors.
And all of this is included in the science of midwifery, which teaches her how to deal with that young woman as if it were this, and therefore she must be very careful about it.
Chapter .lxxvi.
On removal of the dead fetus.
When you treat the dead fetus as we have discussed in the section on treatment methods, and it is not possible to avoid surgery, then you must consider whether the woman's health is good and she is free from any of the conditions that might lead to her loss.
Now you must place the woman in a recumbent position on her side, with her head tilted upward and her legs elevated.
The practitioner should hold both parts or place her in a position on the bed to prevent the body's contents from spilling out during the extraction of the fetus.
And then moisten the patient's mouth with fragrant oils and mucus from aloe, fennel, and fenugreek seeds.
Then the midwife uses her hand with these oils and mucus, easily inserts her hand into the mother, and carefully feels for the place where the cuts are made in the baby.
And in this regard: consider then if the baby is ready to be delivered headfirst, and place your attention on the cuts in the feet, or neck, or mouth, or roof of the mouth, or leave the beard, or in the crotch, or in places near the ribs, or around the hip joints.
If the delivery is to be over the baby's feet, then in the birth canal, or at the midpoint of their ribs.
And he should have the thumb of his right hand raised, curve it at that place which is between the fingers of his left hand, insert his finger with ease and keep the thumb in one of those positions we mentioned, until he reaches the source of the pain.
Then he should place and hold another finger, or the third if necessary, in the same position as the first, ensuring they are equally attracted and do not extend beyond their natural range.
And thus it is beneficial at every step, so that the removal of the hernia is facilitated as much as it is done in tooth extractions.
And be aware of what is between them, where the extension is softened; if any part of the hernia is retained, then the midwife should apply some of her fingers coated in oil and insert them skillfully and rotate those parts that are stuck.
Therefore, if the opening of the hernia is overlooked, then the incisions should be changed to another place where there is pus; and do this until all the hernia is removed.
But if the hand is positioned away from the other and cannot be reduced due to the tension of the hernia, then a bandage should be wrapped around it; and extract it until it is all removed, and cut it either at the joint of the hand or in the groin.
And the same should be done for the other hand and both feet.
However, if the head of the hernia is large, or it becomes constricted during extraction, or it is located at the top where there is tense fluid, then you should insert between the sharp edges and open the head and extract the fluid, or use an instrument called "alundat," which resembles the shape of other instruments in the chapter concerning this.
And apparently, the creation of such a splint is a great feat by nature: and now you insert that into the wound or take away that swelling as we have said; then extract the bones with forceps.
And if the head is fixed and tight, then you must cut through the fork; otherwise, the moisture in the foot will not be drained.
If it is not complicated and does not contradict the observations, then you should insert the head as soon as possible.
And if the abdominal pain is a cramp or related to moisture, then you must perforate that place so that the moisture inside it drains.
If the object is in their foot, then its attraction should be light and its direction towards the mother's opening should also be gentle.
If the abdomen and foot are squeezed, then you must extract that thick cloth which you have wrapped around your hand, and open the abdomen and foot until what is inside flows out.
If other members are stuck and the head is turned, then the left hand should be inserted; if the mother's mouth is blocked, then insert the hand in the opening of the womb, seek for the head, and draw it with these threads into the mother's mouth, and then insert one, or two fingers, and pull them towards those parts.
And if the mother's mouth is blocked by an apoplexy that occurs in the womb, then be careful not to disturb it; instead, immediately provide warm, greasy effusions. And apply bandages, and continue the patient in waters that soften and moisten.
And if the condition is on their side, try to reduce it gently; and administer what we have said about the living condition.
And if this is not possible, then make an incision in the leg, and extract it.
And be sure not to leave any cause within the second one.
And when you have completed all your operations, administer what we have said about the treatment for the wounds that may occur from the procedure.
And if bleeding occurs due to the wound, then use strict waters and administer the other treatments.
And you have already seen a woman whose belly was swollen with death, and again over that fire another conception has taken place, and the other fetus is dead. It has happened that after a long time an abscess has formed in his leg; and as it opens, fire appears, and he begins to shiver with cold.
And you have been frequently called to treat it, and medicated for a long time, but the disease is not improved.
Then you should pause and consider some causes of great attraction from outside, and reduce it to a bone, and after a few days, another bone will form, and yet another after some time has passed; and you will be greatly amazed when there is no bone in the belly.
And then you will realize that they were bones of the dead fetus.
So you will continue to investigate the disease, and extract some bones from it, following the woman's existing dispositions in her various states, and I have seen it in such a manner for a long time, correcting it with a slight tremor.
And it should not seem strange to you, for in this there is knowledge and aid to the patient, as the doctor with his hand administers treatment gently.
On the forms of the instruments necessary to extract the hernia.
The form of the instrument used to open the hernia:
This is the form of the forceps in which the edges are curved, with two jaws on either end of the handle. However, this forceps should be made to be very subtle in its tightness, and it can be done either with ivory or with ebony or bamboo wood.
And the thickness of each wood should be such that two fingers can fit between them, and the margin on both sides of each wood should be one finger's width, and in the middle part, there should be two adjustments of the same wooden pieces, which are already fixed, with a length equal to half a palm, and the breadth of each piece is two fingers or slightly less.
And these two additions are inserted into the mouth of the womb so that it opens to receive those which you turn over the two prescribed virtues.
Another similar form of that subtle and lighter pus.
It is made of wooden sticks or bones according to the appearance of tongs. However, at the extreme end of it, two additional parts can also be attached, and the length of these additions is about a palm, and their width is approximately two fingers.
And when you want to open the womb, you place the woman on her side over the legs, opening what is between her thighs. Then open your hand over the instrument using the clamping forceps according to the amount you want from the aperture of the womb until the meter shows that it is enough.
The way of vertigo that the ancients spoke of:
The method of pushing that which is pushed:
The method of healing as which the great head is contained:
And it is assembled like tweezers to which are attached teeth at the end, also when using them, and sometimes they are made long according to this form, also when using them, which have teeth as well, with which it cuts and contains. Method of minimal healing:
Method of unwinding without a spine:
Method of unwinding with no two spines:
A pair of scissors with two blades, used for cutting through the head.
A shape of two wide scissors.
All those instruments require practice, and when the number of their kinds is multiplied and they are well prepared by the artisans, then they become easier to use and more useful for people in large numbers.
And do not neglect those instruments, for the need for others is not an excuse to disregard these.
From the extraction of the second (object or part is unclear without context).
When the second stage of labor is reached, you must command the patient to hold their breath and make them sneeze in that position, then place your hand over their mouth and nose, and if they breathe freely, so be it.
And if that happens, then take a cloth and make a hole in it, placing it over the mother's mouth, with warm and harsh herbs such as mint, rhubarb, chamomile, licorice root, and cassia wood, and also some holy (or perhaps sacred) althaeas. All these herbs or some of them should be submerged in water in the cloth, and then that cloth should be placed over the fire.
And then place a tube made of canvas in the mother's mouth, and ensure that the steam from the herbs goes into the cavity of the mother.
And then perform that sneezing as we have said, and the second one should be expelled quickly.
If this treatment does not work and it is not excessive, then command the midwife to immerse her left hand in warm oil or in an infusion of althae, and insert that same hand into the vagina and gently seek out the second one, and once found, take it slowly and carefully, according to what we have recommended, so that the mother does not feel any violent attraction. Then, it should be changed from side to side with ease.
And if the mother's mouth is restricted, we have already recommended treatment with sneezing and medication with all kinds of herbs.
If all the causes we have mentioned are not forgotten, then be careful not to perform any operation on that in the process of abstraction, but nevertheless understand that what lies between him and the mother's womb is a woman's matter, and baptize it with medicine and tetracyclic; for this will rot it within a few days and dissolve and be forgotten.
When it is observed that there is a high fever in the head and stomach, which causes the disease, then understand that fumigations and appropriate remedies should be administered to it.
Some of the ancients already used fumigation with nasturtium and dried figs.
The form of the instrument used to fumigate women for the retention of menses and afterbirth:
It is necessary to make an incision or a cut.
And the delicate end of the instrument should be in the cavity and the broader end over the fire, and the smoke should be controlled above the arms of the fire.
And hold that until the smoke is consumed, and repeat another.
On the treatment of the unperforated anus in infants.
Many infants have this problem, with their anuses being narrow and swollen. Then instruct the midwife to pierce it as she has said, if the swelling does not go down; otherwise, use a sharp instrument to pierce and be careful not to touch the wound.
And then apply pressure over that cloth soaked in wine and oil; and carefully treat that sore with a poultice until it is healed.
If there is a risk of infection, apply heat to the wound for several days, and stop when the child's fever subsides.
And it also happens that the infection in the anus occurs for the consolidation of a wound or abscess; then, once that consolidation is incised, it should be treated with water and lead, as we have said regarding treatment and plaster.
On the treatment of fistulas that tend to leave (or open).
Fistulas that open in the perineum or in the space around the anus tend to produce a small amount of thick pus.
And it is a fistula or a mass.
And when that nodule is old and corrupt from moist white pus or subtle decay, sometimes these fistulas penetrate from them.
And those that penetrate are guided by the liquid that issues from them due to discharge and inflammation; and sometimes the disease of discharge uses malady for its exit, and strongly it is issued from those worms.
And from those fistulas, some are found in the space penetrating into the bladder, and into the flesh of the penis; and some penetrate into the joint of the thigh and into the nut of the testicle.
And for the case where the fistula penetrates into the anus and does not penetrate out, you should insert a thin, pointed object into the anus, and try to gently pull or force on the fistula when there is no resistance.
If there is stiffness in that area, then insert a thin probe of lead or horsehair until you feel the tension or hair in the proper location.
And if you do not feel any tension at all or do not notice any cause for the pain, as we have said, then you know it is non-penetrating, and you should stop treating it.
And when the fistula is penetrating into the bladder or into the flesh of the penis, then the meaning of it is the emission of urine from that area and its prohibition from being used for treatment until the location is medically consolidated.
If it is penetrating into the joint of the thigh or into the bone and causes pain in the surrounding area, then its sign is that tension prevails here if there is no stiffness within the bone, and pain in the radiating parts; and it festers forever; and it does not respond to treatment, nor is it consolidated with ointment.
And in all those penetrating fistulas, there is no complete cure, and the cure for them lies in the diligent and thoughtful work of skilled physicians over which they remain firm.
However, in cases that are not penetrating or recent, healing with ferric substances is hoped for according to what you have been advised and what has already been tried.
And indeed, the patient's affliction is between your legs over their intestines, the legs are raised within them, the parts are inclined towards the patient's abdomen, and then you insert a plug of lead, or iron if it is in a narrow fistula, at the place where you know the tent enters.
And if that feels like the affliction is around the heart, then you must insert your small finger vertically into the chest.
And if you feel in the small finger a sensation as if it were already discovered and the attempt to penetrate is complete, or if you feel something between the thumb and that part, then you will certainly know that it is penetrating; and therefore do not work on that one, because there is no cure in that, as we have said.
However, they may say that it heals certain people at times.
And for the treatment by which one hopes to heal them quickly, you make subtle cauterizations according to the size of the fistula, as mentioned above, and insert that hot iron into the fistula until it reaches around the core; then repeat this process two or three times until you know that all the flesh surrounding the fistula, which is similar to a quill of pen ink, has healed.
And then attend to those with wrapped bandages until all the flesh that is adjacent is healed, and treat those wounds with medications that nourish and strengthen the flesh, and if it heals well; otherwise, it will not be healed in any time through other treatments.
If the attempt enters, but does not penetrate into the deep tissues, and between that and the attempt, there is a thin layer of flesh or muscle, and the fistula reaches to the surface of the skin, then dry the skin from the beginning of the fistula, and watch as the attempt dries, and continue this process until the drying of the attempt reaches the place where the tip of the attempt enters, and by the attempt, it is freed and cut.
And then cleanse those infected flesh that resemble a canal of penance and are not opened for any reason.
If a discharge of pus appears between you and your operation when examining those flesh, then the best thing to do is to use a clean instrument heated by fire or acute medicine, for cauterization with fire adjusts both good and bad habits: it is suitable for those attached flesh and cuts off the pus by drying out the moisture.
And then treat those wrapped in calluses or hardened flesh that cause pain in the affected area, and take care of the infection with hot embers or hard, infected flesh that generates and solidifies a cure.
And these medicines consist of sting and excision; when the pain is relieved, it is healed and you need not fear recurrence.
If a fistula has already penetrated into the perineum and is elongated from the surface of the body, then insert the finger into the anus and investigate that area carefully.
And so if you sense a tumor and between you and it there is clearly a soft or fleshy substance, and it is prone to penetration, then it is not an operation on it but rather through a path of trust and hope.
The treatment for this condition can be administered in three ways: first, by cauterizing it as we have mentioned; second, by drying it out so that you can return the intestine to its cavity, and place your hand over the area to prevent the intestine from protruding, without performing a surgical incision since you will not know the extent of the tear containing the intestinal contents, and thus do contrary to the patient's best interests; or third, by carefully curing it as we have said, elongating that tissue, and draining the pus that has formed within it so close to the anus, again as we have mentioned, or by attempting or using another instrument of extreme acuity, and then repairing all the torn flesh in the fistula that is inside the cavity through incision, and if the opening above does not heal properly, and the fistula remains open at the anus, it will become less painful for the patient. And in some cases, the fistula is ended in this manner: when you insert the probe into the fistula, it is at the side of the anus around the surface of the body and at the margin of the anus, take the probe of the perforating extremity, which is thus with a needle prepared to pierce the skin in this form:
and insert yourself into that wound enveloped in lint or around those; and then insert the probe into the fistula until you reach its cavity.
If it is penetrant at the margin of the anus very deeply, then you extract the thread from that trap by inserting the tip into the anus; and you extract the end of the thread and adjust both ends, then open each one, and leave it for a day or two, and when you more deeply insert the thread into the flesh, open it until those flesh parts are opened between the two ends of the thread and they fit.
And then treat the wound until it is consolidated and healed.
If the opening of the fistula is not deep enough, then make it penetrate in some way as you are prepared, either with forceps or other means, for it is not appropriate for you to do this yourself so as not to hurt; and then treat it until it is healed.
The shape of the spade with which the fistula is incised: its curvature is very acute and the other edge is not, so as not to hurt what is unnecessary when you cut.
On the stitching of hemorrhoids where pus runs from the incision of those.
Hemorrhoids are of two types, either they are between the buttocks resembling coal, or those are with a mass of grainy fat. And they are small and large, the heat flows from them at that time and it is one, it is many, it comes out of them, and in their extremities.
However, those that are open only in the anus are usually due to a lack of moisture, from which clear or slightly yellow urine or a little blood flows continuously, and they are according to the color of the body.
And the treatment for that which is inside the anus is to order the patient to sit down and press until the pain subsides and the hemorrhoids appear to you. Then hold on tightly and suspend yourself or have someone hold you, and close your eyes. Then cut open those parts that need it, and reduce the swelling.
If the cuts are not held in those parts due to their moisture and softening, then take a rough cloth or a towel or woolen thread, and pull out the threads from the roots, and then cut them and sprinkle some powdered substances over them at the incision, so that they adhere to those places instead of cauterization; or cauterize them as mentioned in the previous chapter on cauterizing. And then attend to those and other remedies until they are healed.
And if the hernia does not obey and comes out, then dissect the malady by making small incisions, wash with water that is in the wound and helps to expel it more easily when the hernia protrudes.
But if the hemorrhoids are outside the anus, their cause is light, and it is because you take those with your fingers, or those with a candle, and make incisions in them, and then attend to them with water as we have said until they are healed.
And for whoever makes the incision, know how to administer sutures according to this method: take a thin thread wrapped around your finger, insert it into the hemorrhoid from above, and pass the other end through the opening of the opposite side beneath the needle, and then wrap the two ends of the thread around the base of the hemorrhoid outside of the needle, and stretch it taut; and close the hemorrhoid with strong pressure, tie the thread tightly, and remove the needle.
And do it thoroughly, leaving none of them untouched, so that the excess of blood flows from that part.
Then place your weight on the cloth soaked in hot oil or wax; press it onto the wound and instruct the patient to rest. Then leave that inside the wound; and when it heals, apply ointment or other treatment until it is completely cured.
And if they are old and no longer respond to that medicine, you will need to open them with a pointed instrument or with your finger, ensuring they remain moist and free from any pus, which prevents their consolidation; then treat them until they are consolidated.
Then you should stop those parts from bleeding more violently than the first, which have been cut and are raw; and promptly tend to those that need healing.
You know that hernias are crucial, and if they appear red according to the color of the skin resembling a thumb, they should be treated immediately throughout the body, especially in the areas around the feet and legs, and through these pains you must address them.
And so it is necessary to incise what is in the area of the hernia, and hold it with forceps or a hook, and eradicate it from its origin; and promptly tend to that.
And if you wish, cauterize according to what is mentioned in the preceding chapter.
May a verrucous growth be a small, rough, round ulceration on the surface of the body, often seen in children.
And the treatment for it is to stretch and incise that, or clean it with a sharp tool inside the wound. And if you wish, cauterize it with fire or acute medicine, as we have said.
May a tick (formica) be a small, hardened or fistulated growth on the body's surface that itches and, when pressed, feels like a ant bite, appearing around the body.
And the treatment for it is to take a needle of goose or wolf feather, strong and sharp, and press it onto the swelling within the circle of the swelling, and then twist your hand around the needle until you have pierced what lies within the circuit of the swelling, and place it into the depth of the flesh, and uproot the swelling from its root.
And if you wish, make this as a needle of iron or bronze in this manner:
The removal of the needle should be subtle, gentle (not perforating), wrapped around itself so that when it is lifted from the swelling, the pressure on it is alleviated and its rotation is controlled.
And if you wish to cauterize the swelling, as mentioned above in the chapter on cautery.
In the form of instruments that are administered to give heat.
Sometimes heat is applied with silver or bronze or iron that has been melted or shaped; and sometimes it is done with small or large instruments according to those used in the treatment of small children, which are small, and of those whose anus are tender or painful, the heat from such instruments should be small.
The form of large and few heat applications:
The end of the tube above which the bag is tied should be wide according to this manner; and it is distinguished where the bag is tied as well.
And the end of it inserted into the anus should be blunt (not pointed), tailored to subtlety; and on one side of its length there are two channels, and on the other side one channel, and the width of the channel is according to the thickness of the rays and more narrow a little.
And let the bag be filled with medicines from a bladder of an animal or sheep's skin, and its opening be a palm.
And it should be punctured with many things as it revolves; and if the space between the parts is the thickness of that thing.
And then insert into those parts strong, raw silk from ten threads, or surround them; adjust the bag to those parts; and when the bag is placed there, it should be tightly wrapped around the patient's thigh between two strong bands, and tie each part: The quality of tying those parts is that you fill the bag with medicine, heated according to the amount of the patient's tolerance, and be careful not to make it too tight or too loose.
Then the patient should be laid on their back, raising their legs and placing a cushion underneath them where the pain is located, or a lance; and apply the pointed cautery with oil or egg albumen or a paste of fenugreek or similar. Then insert it into the anus easily, and let the minister take the bag and squeeze it two times, vigorously, so that everything in the bag is evacuated into the intestine; then remove the bag and the patient should raise their legs to the wall.
And if the medicine forces him to vomit, take as much as you can; and if he sleeps with that for an entire night, it will be more beneficial for healing.
If you believe that applying heat to the pain of intestinal solutions and vomiting eases it, then you repeat the cautery until it is healed.
And if in the anus there are hemorrhoids or festerings, then use a gentle heat and cautery, for the cauteries of which children are made to suffer.
**Curation of Plagues**
You have already said in the division of the cure for plague what is suitable for the body, and you have thus given the cure for those with great pain and according to the abundance of medicines.
Therefore, it says that plagues are diversified according to where they are made by the plague and according to the place where the plague strikes.
And the causes for which plagues occur are also due to the heat of fire, or an incision of space or of skin, or a blow with a lance, or a whip, or an arrow, or similar to those causes that bring on sudden deaths.
Plagues that are in the parts of the body can also be like a plague that strikes the head, or the neck, or the foot, or the belly, or the chest, and similar to those members.
And it is very important to recommend the cure for some plagues, in order to stop that reasoning and regulate concerning other plagues.
And one should begin with the simple plagues of the head, since the remembrance of the composed ones will come at the beginning of the third chapter.
Therefore, it says that when a simple plague occurs on the head without fracture, consider: if it is due to a blow or something similar, and the patient has already bitten their tongue deeply and it is a severe plague with the risk of apostema, then you should immediately perform a cerebral fleebotomy and extract the clot from the sinus according to the amount of virtue (or consistency) of the clot, unless any other cause prohibits the fleebotomy, especially if the clot that has formed from the plague is small.
And the fleebotomy should be performed on the opposite side of the affected plague; and attention should be paid to the patient's rest, diet, and avoiding heavy meals.
If any cause prohibits the use of fleebotomy, then the diet should be restricted and one should avoid meat and wine.
And regarding the plague, if it develops into cautious apostema, apply hot oil or wine with astringent properties to it.
If you are certain of the presence of an abscess, apply pressure to the sore spot, if it is recent and its pus has not yet changed the color or consistency that I will describe below, then press gently.
And if the air has already changed it, apply hot compresses until it is healed.
But if the sore is large or due to a rupture of space and similarity, and the edges of it are not suitable for closing by means of ties, then close them with stitches as I will describe regarding their stitching.
If the sore has already exposed bone and penis, and it is not an enclosure but a small suspension, then incise it and treat the wound with medicines and restore the flesh appropriately in the place of the wound, and order the patient to abstain from foods that are coarse: caps, grains, and similar things, until it is healed.
And if you find putrefaction in the bone that does not adhere to the bone, then you incise all of it and remove it, and then care for it.
If these plagues are an artery or vein from which pus flows and it is not drained by medicines, then you should inquire about the artery, and if you find one that is not incised, you should incisively cut it or tie it; and if cauterization is necessary to prevent the pus from discharging, do so until the pus is drained.
And if these plagues are simple and small, their cause is considered minor; so you sprinkle over them this powder, as it solidifies in front of the air changing those.
And the manner of the powder is this: take oil from crushed herbs, dragon's blood from two parts, and unextinct caus from three parts; mix all thoroughly and grind it fine, and with this fill the plague, and constrain it tightly so that it adheres well to the affected area, and coagulate it with pus.
And then tighten it over the poultice and leave it, without loosening it while it is in that state, for the medicine will not take effect until it is healed.
And at other times, it is treated only with cautery, when there is no acute pain or inflammation.
And this surgical procedure is also performed on large hernias when it is deemed necessary to pause them and tighten them, and they are recent hernias with fresh inflammation, where the air has not yet altered them.
And if the air has altered them, especially during summer, then one cannot understand the position of this poultice, but rather treat them as we have said, either by tightening over the blisters with a paste made from wheat flour and water and honey until they get a crust, or treat them with other remedies as they heal.
If a fracture occurs in the bone of a small plague, then you extract it by gesture.
And you should say the cure for skull fractures, which are deadly.
Of the plague of the colon.
If the plague occurs in the colon, then it is not different in treatment, and between the plague of the head when it is simple.
If the nerves or arteries of the colon are cut, then if it is a nerve, there is no need for immediate treatment, but rather to avoid the cure from causing intense pain, as well as applying and binding something that acts like vitriol and similar substances to prevent damage to the nerves and tighten them. And do not apply any treatment to the pain without understanding its cause, for the substance of the nerves is affected and their continuity leads to the brain, which is the source of all members' functions.
And if it is to be treated with lighter medicines, then it is washed with water twice, sometimes dipped in rose or non-rose oil, and rubbed when washed with water, and other remedies are applied afterward according to this method, and moistened with humidity.
But if the pain is severe, then stitches are administered, or the openings of it are tightened, and afterward, care is taken with powders until it is healed.
But if the pain is deep or an abscess occurs in it due to a severe break, then it should be pierced at the most vulnerable spot.
If in the plague an artery is already incised and blood flow occurs, then separate or dry it, or tie it, or cauterize it if necessity requires it.
If the spine is already incised from the throat down, and the veins of the collar are saved, then you adjust the edges of the wound with sutures over the bone of the throat and do not touch that; first equalize it and return it to its natural shape, then tighten it decently, leave it for a few days, and care for it with ointment in which there is stiffness and excitement until healing occurs.
If the plague has already made an impression in the bone, then probe it, and if there are fragments of decay within it, extract as many as you can; leave what is not suitable for you, until the plague has subsided, and separate it and remove it from the body.
And if the illness is recent, sprinkle on that powder which has been recommended to you. If in the illness a fistula is detected, then treat it with that thing whose memory will come appropriately in its chapter.
If it is a percussion of the lance or the splint, and it feels deep, then consider more if the illness has an outlet when the patient's condition worsens; then you will know that the illness is mortal.
And if there is no depth in it and the illness is recent with its pain, then you should apply to it from the first hour powder, and do not tighten that so that the pain is not held deep within and returns to the heart and worsens the patient's condition; rather, apply to it a soothing ointment, and untie those two times per day.
And if the ointment is not at hand, you should apply a hot compress to the affected area to draw out what it holds from moisture; and make the patient rest on the sore spot so that what is within it flows out properly.
If after three days the sore is healed and no symptoms of spasms, palpitations of the heart, or stiffness in the joints occur, and other good dispositions return to the patient, then you know that the sickness is cured; and afterward, treat those who still have pain with hot and cold applications until they are healed.
If the healing of the patient is accelerated and remains open for a long time, then you know that a fistula has formed; so treat it according to its nature.
And if the sore is due to a cut or wound in the joint or muscle, and it is simple on the surface of the foot or back, then treat it with the method mentioned above for binding, if it is large, or with powder, if it is small.
If a skill has already been gained in the bone and they have already made incisions into it, then you twist the pain and cut to extract those bones, if they are separated. If the bones are not separated, leave them inside so that the pain subsides, as extraction of them is alleviated.
And for other pains that occur in other members, the treatment during healing is similar to what we have said.
Of abdominal pains.
The disposition that occurs in the stomach is either great, or small, or moderate.
And when a small disruption is caused, it is difficult to be rectified by other means, and I know that the reduction of them is much more difficult if you do not take care of their reinsertion into their place immediately, for they open and thicken, making it difficult to insert them.
Therefore, the best disruption is to move it slightly, for in that case the reduction of the hernia is not difficult, as it is in both aforementioned species.
And know that the stitching of the abdomen is done in four ways, but two stitches are common and most suitable for stitching other parts of the body as well.
And the other two stitches communicate with other parts, but nevertheless, they are more suitable for the stitching of the abdomen.
And I recommend to each of you, exposition and declaration.
Therefore, it is said that when the hernia is small and there is no visible cause from within the abdomen, and it is difficult to reduce, then it presents in one of two ways: either due to the fragility of the rupture as we have said, or when the hernia experiences inflammation because of the coldness of the air.
And therefore, when it is in this condition, you should wrap it with a cloth soaked in lukewarm water, or use water containing vinegar, sage, and spices, and apply this to the hernia until the inflammation is resolved.
And in some cases, they use wine, which has a drying effect, and it is better than just water for resolving inflammation.
And therefore, once you have resolved the inflammation, you should moisten the hernia with water containing high amounts of salt and mallows, for this will gently expel the contents from it due to its mild effect.
Maybe if the insertion of this treatment is excused, then you split the disruption with a small, smooth instrument which incises hemorrhoids.
And the first treatment is better when it is appropriate to avoid cutting, and there is no need to secate or drain.
Of the instrument, see its form:
One part of the sharp knife, and another part of the blunt knife, with a fine tip, but not too sharp, should be preferred over a spatula.
And so when the disease is aggravated and the intestine has protruded, it should be reduced according to its natural form in its proper place, if possible over it, as it is better.
When the disruption is extensive, and it occurs in the lower part of the belly, you must have the patient lie on their back, and raise their legs higher than their head; and if it occurs in the upper part of the belly, then you must elevate the patient's head and feet above the openings.
And similarly, if the disruption is in one of the two parts of the belly, you must stop your intention and all consideration in that place so that the opening where the pain is is higher than the other.
And also, you must manage this in great pains and in small pains.
And in small pains, apply what you have prepared, and then make the minister be between your fingers, who has the whole disruption in his hand and adjusts the lips of it, and then gradually uncover from one to another until any cause of the suture is discovered elsewhere.
And this is the common method of suturing: take the needle, or count one needle according to the amount of the width of the wound; then place it near the extremity of the tear in the ring finger, and tighten the needle, so that you do not push through both ends of the cord, but rather push it through the gap left inside, until you have added both ends of the cord and both ends of the phalanx, and thus you make four orders.
Then tighten the thread double around the needle, and in some cases, join both parts together, and add the two lips and the wound through proper addition; then reduce the thickness of the finger and insert another needle into that one, and attach it to the thread as if it were the first needle; do not stop doing this with the needles until you have completed the entire contraction of the wound.
And the needles should be of varying thicknesses, from coarse to fine, as the thin needles penetrate the flesh slightly, while the thick ones are difficult to insert into the cord; therefore, it is necessary that they be both coarse and fine in thickness.
And ensure that the needle is inserted into both ends of the affected leg gently, so as not to sever the flesh excessively and allow the disease to heal before its solidification.
And do not prolong the stitches, so that the disease is not hindered from consolidating.
Then cut the ends of the needles to prevent them from damaging the patient further during their sleep; and place a padding over the stitches, made from anything suitable, which covers the ends of the needles; and leave them there until you know that the disease has consolidated.
These types of stitches with needles are most convenient for small wounds, as they suffice with just one needle or two, or even around those areas.
However, the second type of stitch is as follows: you administer a single stitch to all four ends (of the leg and two ends of the hip), at once, using a needle with thread meticulously and appropriately wrapped around it in terms of fineness and thickness.
And when you have inserted the needle through these four extremities, withdraw the needle from that split middle part from which it began, so that the thread retracts the pus-filled gap from the wound, so that the suture is as secure as a drape with which the drapes are tightened.
And between each suture, leave the thickness of your little finger.
And this suture heals men.
And with this type of suture, I have treated a wound that had occurred in a man's stomach, which was infected by a knife, and it was a rupture of the wound measuring about a palm, and there were disruptions around two palms from the abdominal wound, and then I reduced that part where the abdomen had been wounded for 24 hours.
And the plague, once consolidated in the space of 15 days or so, is cured and considered healed; and it may recur for many years, and is converted into its conditions.
And other physicians had judged that it was not healed; but by a miracle of fire, for the pain did not cease when he applied ointment, since it was in a place where neither salves nor any medicine could penetrate, he continued to apply heat to the plague twice a day and frequently washed it with honey water until it was healed.
But I will tell you two kinds of stitching according to the narration of the word.
And indeed, you begin the stitching of the wound, and insert the needle from outside to inside.
And thus, when the needle penetrates the wound and reaches the middle according to the right and length of the body, and leaves the end of the thread in which you have inserted the needle; then make the other end of the thread penetrate from inside to outside through the other end of the wound.
And when you have made it penetrate, you will make it penetrate another time in that middle part of the wound outward to the wound inward; and leave the extremity of the flap that is on this side, and make the needle penetrate the other extremity of the wound inward to the wound outward.
And make a new penetration with the same penetration that you use to penetrate the flap at the extremity of the wound, so that everything penetrates.
Then begin at this side of the wound and cut through that extremity that is at the other side of the flap, remove the needle from the thread it was penetrated with, return it to the thread and attach the extremity of the flap on the other side of this wound's edge; and remove the thread that belongs to the patient.
Do this a few times and then do it again, continuing in this way until you have closed everything that is outward according to that example.
And the essence of this method of stitching is that you sew with a needle to which the hair is attached, sewing the skin, so you stitch the wound once from the end of the tendon, and then again until it is completely closed.
The second type of stitching, which is peculiarly Italian, and highly recommended for healing, is that you sew with a second-quality thread that some doctors use, adding to the whole a part corresponding to its natural state; then apply one end of it to one extreme of the wound and the other end to the opposite extreme, and this is done according to your discretion.
You should keep the needle at the end of the wound facing towards you on your side, and make it penetrate the skin from inside out, passing through both ends of the wound; then turn around the needle and make it penetrate from outside in, going through both ends of the wound again.
And then carefully turn those edges, causing some of the separated parts to penetrate from within to without at the two extremities of the mirror other than the opposite side.
And this method of sewing is better than the common light sewing, and it is the suture of which we have previously spoken.
This is the speech of Gaul.
And they might say, "The suture of the belly is corrected with two needles; you insert a thread into some of them, and begin the intrusion of this needle from which it is your duty, and make that penetrate within the other side according to the suture of those by which the bodies are joined together.
And you should know that when there is disruption in the middle part of the belly, the suture there is more difficult than in other parts of the belly.
The treatment of one disease should be judged according to other diseases.
The cause of which is that when you perceive the recent disease having a foul smell in front of its wound that the air alters it, and return the intestine to its cavity and sew it up and prepare it properly, then place your hand over that flesh-colored powder.
And if the air has already altered the disease, then place your hand over that ash which is ignited at your presence so that it burns hard and extracts the pus, and becomes hardened and healed; and treat that wound thus as with other diseases until it heals.
If you do not have medications at hand, then apply this treatment as soon as possible when it begins to get hot, cut off the affected part, and change it every two days, just as you have been taught, until it heals, for you should not need other treatments in complex arrangements when the diseases are simple.
If you fear that the plague may spread to the vital parts of the body, then immerse a lion's share in a bath of good quality oil or oil that has been heated, and place it on the circumference of the places that lie between the angles and leave the axillae.
And if pain or putrefaction is felt in their intestines, which symptoms you often see, then fasten a black, stagnating vein-cleansing herb to it, especially if the inflammation has been caused by something that has entered the hernia's cavity.
And know that the one from the large hernia has a lighter chance of healing than the one in the subtle hernias.
And its healing is difficult because the hernia, which is called "gegunu," does not receive healing from any plague that enters it; this is due to the great number of veins in it, and the magnitude of them, and the subtlety of the body of that place, and the nearness of that to the nature of nerves.
If what you process from the illness is the fabric, and you obtain that fresh, reduce it according to your recipe by which you reduce hernias in general.
If it has been left in the space and it is already turned red or black, then tighten the bandage over the affected area to promote blood flow, as there are veins and arteries within the fabric.
And then cut what is another kind of bandage, place two ends of the bandage on either side of the affected area, so that by moving it away from you, the attraction of it shall be removed and the fabric's contraction and emission of the plague's arm shall cease.
Reminder of the plagues that occur in the intestine.
When there is a disruption in the intestine and it is small, it is possible that it can be restored in some people, so that you may see someone who was previously plagued with pain in their belly due to a lance's impact, and the plague was on the right side of the stomach, an old plague with a fistula, and requiring management and ventilation.
Then pursue the treatment for them even if they do not seem to be healing well, rather continue to apply that which brings heat to the affected area and consolidates it.
And if you see the affected area has consolidated, then focus on the illness that engenders these accidents in the stomach of the patient; do not apply any further treatment to this malady and do not cause any more harm by forcing him to eat or drink against his will, and instead immerse him in a bath and exercise him according to his condition.
And certain experienced ones say that when this plague affects the intestine and is small, it should be tied according to this manner: take some large needles; adjust both edges of the affected area and place a needle from those used in the mouth over both edges of the affected area; so when he presses down on them and tightens his mouth, cut off the cap, for it sticks and will not dissolve.
And then apply another poultice near the first one, and do not stop making poultices until all the pain has gone away.
Then return that part and with it the pain; and untie those appendages around the hernia until the hernia is healed; and do not cause any harm to the patient.
And it is also possible that the hernia appears as a thin thread taken from the hernia of an animal, finer than a needle; so take the end of these hernia threads, entirely bare, and draw the end of the thread through the needle, wrap it around, and insert this thread into the hernia, bringing it back to its rupture.
And this method of stitching with poultices is simply a matter of trust and hope.
If the plague is great and widespread, especially if it is in one of the subtle cavities, then it requires a delicate treatment, and not every cure works for it entirely.
On the treatment of ulcers and fistulas.
You know that every plague and abscess, as it ages and hardens, becomes an ulcer, and if it is not healed and discharged, it lasts for a long time and is called a fistula in any part of the body, which we commonly call 'ulcer'.
And fistulas, in truth, are formed by hardened, white tissue, which is painless and has a hollow space similar to the cavity created by pain; for this reason, they are called 'ulcers', that is, pain.
In some ulcers, the tissue is moist, which causes pain, and after a while, the moisture is discharged in a few hours. And in some cases this humidity is moist, and in others it is dry, and thick, and thin.
You have already described all of those causes and the signs of them, as well as treatment with medicine in the previous division.
And so it is that you must know how to treat the fistula made through surgical incision by hand.
You should know that fistulas can occur in all parts of the body; those are fistulas that penetrate large veins and arteries, or nerves, or the skin, or the abdomen, or the bladder, or any of the ribs, or any of the spinal joints formed by the union of the hand and foot, or similar places.
And therefore, among these fistulas, those following this manner are of the most difficult to heal diseases, and do not accept treatment, and occupation with them is work and ignorance.
And if it is any of these fistulas with such depth that it does not reach the places mentioned above, and you hope and trust in its healing, and wish to come to know it, then attempt to clean or cut it, and if the fistula follows the right path, examine it closely.
If the fistula is twisted, examine it with a delicate probe, for the weight of his body's elevation should alleviate and correct the twist.
And if the fistula has an extremely horrible appearance, it is not appropriate to attempt any treatment on it.
Then, you should sterilize the horrendous openings, for the humidity through which you cleanse it should also affect the other openings and heal them.
And you should inquire very carefully, according to which way it is possible for you to know if here there are bones or nerves, and whether the concavity of the fistula is distant or close, or if it's a fistula with only extremely horrible appearance and located over all the extent of your strength, with all your knowledge and questioning about the illness, and the relief from pain due to your compression with your hand on the place, and similar signs and accidental causes in relation to the ulcer.
And when you have carefully considered all those causes, you will see the cure according to your judgment: for you consider whether it is an apparent fistula close by or in a distant place, near a joint, or of a nerve, or an artery, or a vein, or in one of the places that are under your care and which you know.
Then you examine the fistula according to the description given of its location, remove what is in that flow and corrupt flesh, and what has grown in the opening of the flesh, or from hair and similar things, and cure it as soon as it is healed.
If the fistula is of great depth and according to the right method, then you must incise it in the place as far as possible, and clean it of all corrupt flesh; and then cover it with certain bandages soaked in sharp medicines, and insert those into the cavity of the fistula that you have comprehended with the ferrule.
And do this as some observations show that sharp medicine corrodes everything that is fragile in the cavity of the fistula of corruption.
And then restore those that apply ointments which generate healthy flesh until it is healed.
If it is not healed by this, then you cauterize it as we have recommended.
But if the cause of the fistula is bone and it is necessary to be certain about this, then you examine it and dry it as we have recommended; however, do not neglect any cause from veins or nerves or from major limbs, as we have said.
If the bone is exposed and there is no corruption or blackness, then you clean it until the corruption is entirely removed; and then apply care to it as the flesh heals.
And if the disease does not respond and heal as it should, then you will know that you have not achieved complete eradication of the corruption; so then uncover it again, carefully and accurately perform the reason for it and the purification from it with the last strength you have, and then restore it.
And therefore if it is healed, it is good; but if not, you will know that this corruption is in the deep, remote part of the body, which has not been reached, and so for you there is nothing left but to cleanse that.
And if the corrupt bone is small and within your reach, then you can remove it with delicate forceps that are suitable for this.
And if there are many bones, then carefully perform the extraction of all these, and from none of them leave any cause for your weakness.
If any cause of discomfort arises from moisture, and in their dissection there is no fear or error, then incise these ligaments or flesh if they are here, and dissolve the bones.
If you are not prepared to remove the bones from your patient, then place your hands over the area where the pain is most intense, and leave it there until the pain subsides, ensuring that the pain does not spread to nearby bones or tissues, and be careful that the incision you have made in your operation does not become infected.
Previously, if you are afraid, place a cloth soaked in hot oil or Egyptian water or any of the green oils on the area, for when these ligaments are separated and the bones are removed from their attachment, this attraction is alleviated.
If it is a large bone, such as of the leg or thigh or similar, and what is corrupt from it is only the outer part, then carefully cut away this corrupted portion only until the blackness and corruption are removed, and then restore the area.
If the part that is corrupt is a significant portion, and the corruption has already reached the marrow of the bone, then it becomes necessary to close and completely cut out that area where the corruption has set in, and once it is healed, treat it.
And I recommend to you that you enter into the patient's thigh to hold that in place, serving as an example and assistant to your operation.
Focus on a young man around 30 years old who experiences pain in his thigh, and among the symptoms inside are signs of inflammation within the body until the material reaches the thigh, and it is material related to abscesses or great abscesses, and do not focus on external causes for him.
And so the time extends for this condition due to errors of the doctors as the abscess grows larger, and it attracts mobile materials, and its treatment is delayed until the thigh becomes fistulated, causing horrific wounds that result in decay and body humidity.
And thus, after a multitude of physicians spent two years treating it without focusing on the cause but rather on the symptoms, you were called in.
And I saw the hernia and the fluid that was running from it through the large opening; the condition of that man was completely stabilized, and his skin had a citron-like color.
And thus, you inserted the probe into one of those openings and reached the bone with the probe.
Then, you examined all the openings and discovered the cause of their condition from every part of the hernia.
And thus, I carefully examined and incised one of those openings until I discovered a bone fragment, which I found corrupted, hardened, and degenerated; the hernia was already penetrated and corrupted by an impure substance within the mesentery.
And then secure what I have uncovered and prepared from the exposed bone.
And I thought it was not in the bone but that corruption which I had removed and secured, and I had already washed it away.
Then I interrupted the restoration of the plague with consolative medicine for a long time, and it is not consolidated.
And I repeated the uncovering over the bone secondarily according to the initial discovery, and found continued corruption from the bone.
And I secured what appeared to me as that corruption, and then I had made an incision to heal it and restore it, but it is not restored.
And then I uncovered it again and did not incise the bone little by little particularly and perforate its restoration, and it is not restored until I cut around a palm of it, and that one was extracted from its marrow, and then I restored it with medicines, and it is slightly consolidated and healed.
And no further repetition in the operation of cutting it is necessary unless for the arrangement of its fragility and the lack of his tolerance, and fear of his death, as he suffers at all times due to the superfluity of evacuation, a bad syncope.
And therefore health is achieved through complete healing, and nothing is in place of the hard bone; its arrangement within his body is good and restores his virtue; it adjusts to its dispositions and does not cause him opposition in walking or harm for any reason.
But if the bone is prominent in the body, then you must act as follows: take lint and tightly wrap it around the end of that prominent bone, and ask someone to extend that limb; then apply a thicker lint over the first one, and close it onto the flesh left uncovered, extending the end of it so that you can uncover the flesh where you want to make an incision, without damaging the flesh.
And place a fence or table beneath the bone, for when you do this, the saw that cuts through the rotten flesh is not hindered.
And be careful with the cutting at the corrupted place little by little, for if the corruption is in the concave part of the bone and does not appear on its outer surface, it may require another cut.
If the bone is corrupted and not prominent, it often continues in one piece or in parts, and the corruption may be at the middle or in a part of it; then you must remove all the flesh from all sides; and place a fence beneath, and make a saw cut on the first part where the corruption begins until the cut through the other part is continued.
And make the cut according to the location of the corruption, as we have said.
And if the corruption is in a joint, cut through that corrupt joint, and close the bone where it continues from the other side.
And if the corruption is in the continuation of two joints, then it is not in their ratio but must be treated ingeniously.
And if the corruption is in the chest or foot of the hand, it is very difficult; nevertheless, you must inquire about the corruption how it appears to you, and burn that, and remove that according to some disposition possible to you, and in such a way ingeniously rectify it so that no vein or nerve is harmed.
And you should know which saws and chisels are suitable for cutting these bones, depending on the position of the bones, their preparation, thickness, subtlety, size, hardness, and rarity; so it is necessary that you prepare a suitable instrument for every kind of operation.
And you should know that this operation signifies to you regarding the type of instrument of which you are in need; since you have great study and long experience of the methods of this art, and testimony of ways of illness, when you have already seen for yourself what is appropriate for it among instruments for all illnesses.
And in the end of this chapter, you will learn the number of instruments which you will hold with examples as you process to perfect your prohibition which you will experience on others. Form of saw:

And the extremity of it is triangular and of a sharp point.
And it is made of Indian steel, and in a way that all the causes we have mentioned of razors and scissors and saws are covered.
Of the incision of the extremity and of the locking of bones.
The extremities can be caused either intrinsically or extrinsically, or if the treatment you apply to that corruption does not bring relief, and the corruption persists without any external cause, then you must incise that member within which the malady is confined so that it may heal from death or decay that is causing significant damage to the member.
And the sign of that which happens is that the member becomes black where it is covered by a hot burn, or you may find the darkness extending as the inflammation spreads to other parts of the body that are connected to it; and thus you must make an incision on that part.
And similarly, it is caused by the corruption and percussion of certain venomous sources such as those from a marine scorpion or viper or nettle, and similar things.
And if the corruption or percussion is in the tip of the finger, you should incise the finger and not give space to the corruption so that it does not extend to the hand.
And similarly, if it affects the hand, you should incise at the base of the finger and not give space to the corruption until it reaches the joint of the arm.
And if you replace that, then incise the arm inside the joint.
And if another corruption passes and the joint is affected again, then that is the death of the patient; and to administer another cause for healing in this case is a matter of virtue.
And similarly, when there is corruption in the foot, you incise it inside one of the joints.
And if you take hold of the sole of the foot, then you incise the entire foot. If it is possible to enter the toe joint, then you incise the leg inside the toe joint.
And if the corruption has already spread to the toe, then it offers no cure but dismissal, and leaves the patient to their fate.
And the method of cutting or severing a member is that you tighten the ligament in the area you wish to cut, and tighten another ligament over the place; and extend the instrument one ligament beyond the other, and extend the minister another ligament upon it; and you separate the flesh which is between two ligaments without causing a wide gap until all the flesh is exposed; and then it is either cut or severed.
And cover it with cloth from all sides so as not to touch the place itself, and bring the injured patient to a calm and safe state.
If bleeding occurs during the operation, cauterize the place carefully, or apply some powdery substances to constrict the blood; and then return to your medication until it is complete.
And then attach the affected member with suitable ligaments, and treat it until it is healed.
And I advise you to rise this man from his bed, these circumstances that you and I have agreed upon, which has resulted in a dark mark on his foot due to the adjustment that was akin to the burn of fire.
And that corruption, which was initially caused in the deepest part of his foot, tends to spread throughout the entire foot.
And then that man prepares himself for this condition, knowing that the cure is coming to his member with the violence of his pain and the adjustment of it, and he cuts into the foot at the joint, and fire heals.
For a long time, that malady has afflicted him in the big toe as indicated.
And then it left me, and I felt compelled to reflect on the nature of this condition, as if it were a medicine that rests upon the body; I sought purification for his body, and the excess did not resurface, and they began moving to the other toe where they had started in the foot.
And the doctor attempts to cut into the patient's hand, but he does not want to do this hoping for some relief from that excess, and if you must continue the incision of the patient's hand, it is because the virtue of the illness was in its destruction.
And since he has recovered from me, he returned to his land and defeated me by making the man prepare and cut into his hand completely, and he healed.
And this account has not been provided merely to describe this illness, but also to assist those who suffer from it, and to explain its meaning and the way in which it should be treated.
Regarding the treatment of wounds and the quality of enema therapy with medicines.
When an abscess occurs in some fleshy part of the body and the space of the abscess is prolonged as far as a collection of pus, then it ruptures and perforates, and the pus flows out of it, leaving the area hollowed out as if from a vessel, and the skin above it remains intact, and is not subject to further destruction, and does not press on the bone or nerves or ligaments, it is called a sinus, and is not named a fistula.
Although if the space is prolonged such that the corruption fully involves a member, then it is called a fistula and not incurable.
And the cure for it is to cut through that entire cord as it is twisted, especially when it is subtile and made with thread, and ensure that it does not adhere to the location due to its corruption.
If you hope that the cord will adhere and that that corruption will not act through any further consequence, and in the cord has passed through the face, then cure it with a cleansing enema.
And it is that you consider the wound, and if it is large, and the arm that it affects has a foul odor, then cleanse it with an Egyptian medicine made of oil, wine, and honey, received in equal parts, and placed in a vessel, then heated over fire until the medicine becomes hot and reaches the specific quality of good.
And then, take from him what is necessary and dissolve it in water and honey; wash out the affected sinus with this, tighten the openings of the sinuses, and leave the medicine inside for a period of two hours.
And then, extract that foreign body; do this for as many days as it takes to clean the sinus and heal the wound.
In some cases, the sinus is washed out with water from ashes, when this medicine is not available to you; for you take the ash of an oven, mix it with water, and then use this mixture to wash out the sinus until you feel that the sinus has been cleared.
If the patient is intolerant to Egyptian medicine or ash water, then wash out the sinus with a mixture of honey and water, and also mix in some wine and honey; for honey cleanses and washes, while wine causes the sinus to adhere, especially when there has been an excess of stiffness and dryness from the wine.
And after you have done this several times and feel that the swelling has subsided, then cleanse that part with water which causes flesh to grow there.
And indeed, you should take a mixture of dyphencicon and dissolve that oily crust and apply astringent; or cleanse that part with some medicine mixed with ointments which I have already written about in the treatise on ointments.
And if the orifices of the swelling are tight and do not receive the catheter of the clisteri, then gradually widen them with a small iron, and place in it hot water wrapped in Egyptian ointment or basilicon until they are widened.
And if the orifices seem wide, then you should close them with stitches and leave it with enough quantity so that the clisteri can be added.
And if the orifice of the patient from which the arm exits is raised above its usual position, dry that part at the base where it is located in the patient so that the arm runs between them, for when the arm is constrained in the depth of the sinew, flesh will be generated there.
And if it is not possible to dry the sinew within the bone joint at the base as you wish, then pierce and prepare the member so that the arm can run from it lightly according to what you have prepared, without any cause for retention of the arm.
He who is above the sinus opening, whom you massage at all times to prevent what is tight in it from dislocating from the arm. And so that you may know if what flows from the arm is hot or cold, or digested or undigested.
And so consider the location of that sinus, whether the patient feels pain in it or not, and if there is an abscess.
And when your treatment is prolonged in this manner, and you see that the matter that has collected over the sinus opening has adhered, or formed a strong adhesion, on certain days, remove it gently, and on the third day, when you dislodge the affliction, change the bandage and renew the ointment.
Make a small opening in the sinus, if it is infected with a subtle virus; do not be anxious about the adhesion of it, for healing itself belongs to it, for some people take a long time for new flesh to form in their wounds, and others have the opposite effect.
And if from the sinew a hard and indigest bract has separated over time, you will know that the sinew does not adhere; and if the adhesion of the sinew is prolonged, then adjust in the drying of medications, and if the medications are humid in their substance and virtue, they become dry like with a healing unguent when there is too much superfluity added for protection.
And the last method, by which it is cured, is to take a healing unguent and dissolve it in warm oil, and apply it over it as if it were another substance, and then gently massage it into that area.
And it seems to act in the same way when there is no bract, using healing unguent mixed with honey, which should be thick, and apply it; or take myrrh and aloe, mix them, grind them into a powder over fire, wrap that in cloth and press it on the sinew; and use that same honey, which you observed to be thick, grind it into cloth and press it.
And at times, they administer to him long-drawn-out and finely cut lilies of the celestial (i.e., Aloe) plant, and chickpea flour, and centaury, and use these simples either pure or mixed, triturate them and sieve them and sprinkle them over honey which has been refined; and apply it.
And if the vein is prolonged and not healed by this treatment, you will know that the corruption is in the duct of the vein, and it has affected the bones or other hard members or the ligaments; then you treat it with fistular treatment, as is said above.
Regarding the treatment of ulcers, burnt skin, and added finger incisions, and amputation.
Ulcers are a suppuration that does not heal from the fingernail of the hand or foot, and it strongly affects the other fingers, and as it prolongs without treatment, it becomes either a cauterized ulcer or corrupt, and pus flows within that corrodes the root of the nail, and it strongly corrupts the entire nail, and its corruption reaches the bone within, and an offensive odor emanates from it, and the end of the finger is affected, and its color turns dull.
And so when you have that which we have mentioned in the division and do not comply with your treatment, then know that you should scrape off all the superfluity that is stuck to the nail and then apply a hot cautery to the wound near it, for cauterization brings relief to such things.
If the bone is strong and the nail is healthy, but the additions of the nail already penetrate the flesh, and they begin to pierce and hurt it, then know that you should make a subtle cut at the angle of the painful nail, push it away from the flesh, cut the flesh easily, and apply poultices of medicinal, non-corrosive substances until it is completely healed.
If the corruption has already penetrated into the bone, then know that you should scrape out the bone and extract it, for there is no health where the bone is corrupt.
And if you observe corrosion and destruction in the said area, you will incise it into one of the nuts according to its memory, and then treat it until it is healed.
If there is an urgent need for percussion or scraping in the affected area, and if this causes intense pain, then you should begin by applying a flebotomical instrument to the illness, and carefully dry the nail with a sharp spatula, cutting across it from above, but be careful not to penetrate the flesh that remains under the nail; otherwise, you will cause the illness to become more painful and give rise to excessive adhesion of the flesh in the area, and thus create an even greater problem. And treat the affected spot accordingly so that the pain subsides.
However, this adjustment, which is natural in the bodies of many people, is characterized by a large amount of flesh on some and a lot of bones in others, or a significant presence in their nails.
And some of them originate in the formation of joints, or it is their nature to be present in certain nuts of these parts. He who is born in ignorance of this knowledge will not be harmed, but he who is born with strong joints is more susceptible to harm.
And for those who are born with tender flesh, the section is easier, and it is that you insert the blade of a scalpel into their skin gently.
He who is born with the condition affecting the joints, treatment is difficult; therefore, be wary of the excision of them.
In the case of those born with such knowledge, be careful to incise the flesh at the beginning roundly into the bone, and then use a suitable saw to close it, and take care that it heals properly.
In the consolidation that occurs between the joints, whether due to frequent use or by nature in a person who lacks this knowledge, or because of a hernia or fire burn, or similar, then be careful to remove that consolidation so that the joints return to their natural form.
And then place between their sheets, soaked in warm oil, to prevent the joints from becoming stiff, and separate them with a thin lead sheet until they are consolidated as needed.
And similarly, if consolidation occurs in certain areas of the palm, then dry that consolidation according to what is prepared and suitable for the shape of the member.
In the treatment of veins, there are varicose veins.
Veins become varicose, which are thick, twisted veins filled with melancholic surplus fluid that appears in most parts of the body's members, most notably in the legs, especially in those who walk, work, and carry heavy loads.
Therefore, it is necessary for you to administer purgation to the body from black choler sometimes with strong expulsion, and drain the patient's blood from the basil vein.
The treatment for their pain is according to two methods: one is to incise and remove that black blood, and the other method is to raise the vein and extract all of it.
The incision is made according to this method: first, they begin by cutting into the leg with a sharp instrument, while ensuring that the thick blood clot is resolved, which is foul from the leg, and then they firmly grip the patient's thigh at the highest point of pain, below which they make an opening. They cut the vein in one, two, or three places with a wide incision, raise the black blood clot using the upper part of the incision within the leg, and from above, through the opening between the thighs, until all the desired quantity is removed, as much as needed to alleviate the patient's condition.
Then they close that opening, and order the patient to avoid foods that cause black gallstones.
And repeat the treatment through phlebotomy when the veins are full and this marks the patient.
The elevation of the patient should be done in this manner: you who spread the patient's legs, if they are stiff with cold, then immerse them in water and wet the camba (bandage) around their leg with lukewarm water until the veins become prominent; or if due to intense exercise, the member is sore, then rub it with a hot compress.
And then cut the cord at the right of the vein by section, in the middle or at the end, or at the lowest part, you should tie it off.
Then cut the cord with scissors and extract the vein from all parts until it appears healthy, and you should examine the patient, observing if the disease is declining towards blackness.
And so when you have freed it from the chains, you will see that white thing which is the string.
Then take your tools and insert the lever into that space which is raised and freed from the chains, and suspend all heavy objects with them.
Then make another cut, perpendicular to the first, and carefully remove the chains from the vein so that it appears.
Then raise that one and cut it deeply in the rear section, close to the root, and extract it, raising it until it comes out through the second section, and then remove it from the section above it.
And do this until you have removed the one from the highest or most superior section among all of them, ensuring that all are extracted, and then cut it.
And if you do not succeed in extracting and lifting it, insert a strong double-ended needle, tie it there, and extract it, or leave the hook and turn your hand inside where it is stuck. And be careful not to cut it; for if it breaks, it is difficult to lift that part, and it comes back to harm the patient through that wound.
And once that is completely removed, place your attention on the affected area, immersing it in wine and applying both warm and cold oils, and heal it until it is cured.
And if the vein is contracted without torsion or winding, and it is not in the right position as we have said, you must make an opening on that part of its torsion and at the places where it winds, and then suspend it with cuts until you lift it completely.
And be careful not to pierce the vein or harm it, for it will be difficult for you to raise it up; and use your prudence in that regard.
The form of the injury that is dried out:
It should not be too sharp with incisions, nor have an excessively acute point, so as not to harm the vein; rather, it should be of considerable flexibility, for if it is too thin, it will pierce the vein because of its thinness; we say this about its superfluous thickness.
Of the extraction of the vein of the thigh.
This vein is generated in the legs, as it were, in hot regions, just as the hernia occurs in the abdomen of Arabs and in the hindlands and arid lands of India, where there is little moisture or greenery.
And much heat is generated in other parts of the body besides the legs.
And the growth of the hernia is a putrefaction that can be seen when snakes, worms, and maggots emerge from within the body, causing destruction between the hernia and flesh.
A sign of the impending arrival of the hernia is when a severe inflammation occurs in the leg, the area becomes swollen, and the vein begins to protrude from the site of this swelling, resembling a plant's root.
And when the hernia's edge becomes visible, you must then wrap around it a piece of lead as heavy as a dragon's weight. Then take that lead and let it hang suspended from the leg.
And whenever the hernia causes any discomfort or pain due to external factors, wrap it in lead and apply pressure to it. And if the pain persists, you insert a blade into it and wrap the raw area; do not cut the one that is inflamed within until it has come out, for if you cut the latter, it contracts and enters the flesh, causing abscesses and putrefaction at the site and bad ulcers.
For the pain that requires additional treatment and extraction, it is asked to be removed gradually, until it has come out completely from the back of it, without leaving any cause of its presence in the body.
And from this vein, some people have reported that it is of the length of one's palm and fingers, and I myself have seen it come out from a distance of ten palms.
And if it is cut during the time of its treatment, then insert the blade into the channel of it and pierce that long channel through the flesh, until everything in the matter has been evacuated, and apply putrefaction to the site for some days using medicines; and then care for it for the healing of abscesses.
And this vein is sometimes seen to have great swelling, especially when it appears at the joint of the foot or on the foot itself, and it causes much horrifying pain, which arises from each painful branch.
And therefore, treat that thus as we have said in the division and refer to what is mentioned above.
Regarding the section about worms generated under the skin, and it is called bovine inflammation.
This disease is called bovine fever in some countries because it causes great pain and debilitation throughout the body, pushing and weakening the limbs until the tendon ruptures and it is expelled.
And the generation of this disease is due to the putrefaction of certain humors, which cause worms and snakes and roundworms and tapeworms in the belly.
And it is feared by the evil of the hernia, for when it enters the body and rises to the head, it penetrates through the blood vessel and breaks up the blood, and this must be treated with care.
And so when you want to cure and extract it, it should not be done unless you understand its movement and appearance in the body, and then you must grasp what is above it and what remains below it tightly, and then apply pressure over it and extract it.
And if it is embedded in the flesh and does not disturb you, then apply a hot cautery over the place where it resides, and the main cause that is feared is the corruption of the hernia which also corrupts the place as we have said.
If it has reached the head near the blood vessel, then tighten the upper eyelid with strong pressure, and apply pressure over it, and extract it; and take care that the patient undergoes purification of their body with medicines that evacuate corrupt, bad humors, and be cautious of foods causing putrefaction.
On the incision above the disease.
This disease is called nefri in our land, and it is a pain that appears in some members, and then changes from one member to another.
And you have already seen that second one that I recommended. You have been called to a village for a female patient, and upon examining her arm, you discovered a small inflammation in the vein at the wrist. After breaking it open, as one does when looking at pus, you saw that it was filled with living-looking white material as it oozed from place to place.
And then all the pain from that place subsided and you felt it in the muscle, then you compressed it for an hour.
And then correct the other side until you reach the other arm.
And then I realized that I had to turn myself over in the bed, according to what I had seen; and it was too wonderful of the changes in him and of the speed with which he moved from one member to another. And I had already seen this in my feet according to that manner; however, I have seen many which cause terrible pain to be changed from one member to another. I have never seen this in the feet like on women.
And I did not think that this was anything but that it is because the woman was old, with thin body and exposed veins, and in this condition appears the sensation of that changed air.
It is necessary that this retrograde treatment does not appear in those who are delicate and have a moist body with clogged veins.
And if you wish to cure it and the patient feels that pain, do not appear to give aid as we have said, but strengthen over that place and let it rest slightly and dry out on that area where that air is restricted, and cauterize the spot.
If you do not find it in your shoes, then cure that which causes the body's air to be expelled and that which follows, and bind those made with foul pills and serpents and similar things.
From the extraction of arrows.
Arrows vary according to species and according to the parts of the body in which they are caught, for their diversity lies in that some have sharp points, and small, and concave, and dull ones; others have three angles, and some have tongues; and yet others have barbs.
And among the signs of the servant is when an arrow strikes in it, and passes through the bone, and comes out from the base which is over the brain, due to the violent soda, and scotomias, and vertigo, and pain in the legs, and inflammation and pain of the tongue, and spasms and confusion of speech, and raging vomiting, and a strong loss of words, and destruction of voice, and comes out from the place of the affliction white humidity resembling powder, and blisters like the consistency of flesh.
And if these signs appear to you, then abstain from treatment and extraction of the arrow, unless it is protruding.
If the arrow enters the heart, so that it is near the left breast, and you feel a hard impact where it is lodged, not a visible cause; and strongly feel the movement of the arrow similar to the pulse, and the flow of black pus, and there is chilling in the extremities, shortness of breath, and fainting; then know that death is at hand.
And the signs when the arrow has pierced the lung, showing pus from the plague, and the vessels near the collarbone are infected, and the patient's condition changes, and they gasp for air heavily, and seeks attraction of fresh air.
And if the arrow pierces the membrane in the foot, and the pain is close to the small ribs, and there is a great deal of pain with violent sobs, and all the muscles of the body are not at their best.
And if the arrow hits the stomach, one feels strong pain from the eating of undigestible food.
And if the arrow strikes the abdomen and becomes lodged there, it causes a tear from the wound or the membrane or intestine that has burst, and there is no hope of healing from removing the arrow.
And if the arrow hits the bladder and lets urine escape outside, it causes pain from some internal cause, and strong pain is felt by the patient; then you know that it is fatal.
The other members (i.e., parts of the body) such as the face, neck, back, shoulders, hips, spine, and leg joints can also be saved according to the best dispositions when the arrow does not hit a vein or artery and is not a venomous arrow.
And I will tell you about what I have seen regarding the nature of these arrows, so that you understand this in regard to human healing.
The cause of which is that when an arrow pierces the lacrimal duct of a man in the root of his nose, and it is extracted from him on the other side, leaving the grays of his ear unharmed, then he is cured, and there is no harm to his nasal passage.
And another arrow was extracted from a Jew, which had embedded itself in his eye, leaving the eyelid below, and the arrow was hidden and could not be removed from there except for a small tip to which it clung, and it was a large arrow among the sharp arrows of the Turks, capable of piercing a lion without losing its blade.
And the Jew was healed, and there was no further harm to his eye.
And extract another arrow from a Christian man who had been struck in the groin, which was an Arabic arrow, and it is that one with the sharp point; then I incised through it between two guides, and it was already sunk into the patient's groin; so I became subtle with it, and then extracted it, and the Christian is healed.
And I extracted another arrow from a man who had been struck in his belly, and I thought he would die from it; so, after having passed thirty days without any change in his condition due to the disposition of the humors, I incised through the arrow and put pressure on it, and he was healed, and there was no further harm to him.
And I saw a man in whom an arrow had struck his back, and the wound was deeply entrenched within him, and after setting fire nearby, I removed the arrow at the base of the wound.
And I saw a woman in whom an arrow had struck her belly, and the wound was deeply entrenched within her, and it did not change in its disposition over time, and the woman did not experience any great discomfort in any of her natural functions.
And he sees another man to whom an arrow has struck his face and the wound is deep; he removes the arrow, causing little pain, but many similar marks.
And he extracted the arrow from the prince of the king who had been struck in the middle of his nose; it had already inclined to the right side a little, and the entire arrow was hidden.
And you were called for the treatment of him, so that within three days the arrow's entry point would heal.
And then he examined the arrow wound very closely; and then he inquired about that subtle attempt, not feeling it; but he felt a sharp pain behind his right ear, and then he hoped that that pain was due to the tip of the arrow.
And he applied a plaster to the place with an absorbent and digestive effect, trusting that by doing so, the location of the arrow would appear to him, so that it would dry up over that spot.
And do not be concerned about the place where the arrow has struck; continue applying the plaster to it for several days and no further accidents will occur; and, as the plague hardens, break up the swelling from the extraction of the arrow in intervals of several days until one day you feel the arrow inside its socket and I reconnect it.
And then you should apply acute corrosive medicine to the wound for several days until a fire opens up, and you should gently soothe it, and cut away the tip of the arrow, which adheres to the wood.
Then you should adjust the opening of the wound with that acute medicine until I see the tip of the arrow clearly, and I spend time on this for intervals of time over four months.
And when the wound becomes enlarged, I then try to insert scissors into it and hold them there, without moving, until one day I am able, through clever methods, to pull it out with forceps, as will be described in detail at the end of this chapter; and then I restore the wound.
And some doctors believe that the cartilage of the nose cannot be restored, and they restore it so that the disease is consolidated, and the malady is healed entirely, without any pain in it for any reason.
And I recommend to you the quality of extraction of certain arrows in order to give this rule and meaning regarding what I have not said, for the parts of this art and the definitions of those in question are not understood from the narration nor do they comprehend those in the book.
And the skilled artisans compare a little about words; and regarding what is present about what is absent; and they find new operations and new instruments for the descent of strange causes from the art when accidents occur.
And therefore, you say that arrows are not discharged from the members in which they are inserted, but according to two manners: either by attraction of the place into which they enter, or on the contrary side of the other part.
And that which is discharged from the place where it enters, or is shot through a fleshy part, and then thrown out and discharged.
And if you do not observe the time when eating, then know that you must leave it for some days until the flesh around it is healed and the attraction of it and its discharge are alleviated.
And similarly, if it becomes stuck in the bones and you do not observe eating at the right time, leave it for some days, then repeat this process daily, and it will be discharged.
And if you do not observe your diet for some days, then know that you must puncture the path of the arrow at that bone with a delicate journey until the location is enlarged by the arrow, and then extract it.
If the arrow is already embedded in the body and affects a vital area, then examine that part, and if you feel any movement, apply some suitable stimulants to attract it.
And if you cannot reach it due to the constriction of the wound and the length of the arrow, here neither nerves nor veins are involved, then make an incision over the wound until it is enlarged and it becomes possible to extract the arrow.
And if there are auricles attached, which must be removed entirely from the tissue in which they are embedded, using all means at your disposal; and devise a way to do this, if you cannot remove the flesh around the fracture of the auricles and their torsion until it becomes possible.
And when you perform the extraction of the arrow in any place, use a twist of your hand and forceps at all times until it becomes firmly embedded; and with subtlety and great care, so that the arrow is not broken and can be easily removed along with it.
And if you cannot reach it with your own effort, then wait for a few days until the swelling in the path of the arrow subsides, and then try again when it is relieved. If you experience difficulty due to bleeding, then administer what we have said about treatment in its chapter.
And be vigilant for any incision of veins or nerves, or string, and administer remedies in every possible way to facilitate the escape of the arrow; and do this with ease and tranquility, delay and firmness as you would for yourself and as recommended by others.
And therefore, contract the arrow so that the malady is according to the figure by which you should aim the location of the arrow in it, as this is more beneficial. If this is not possible for you, then administer what is possible for you according to the figures.
For the arrows that are discharged in opposition to another part, or that already process some part from outside, or make the extremity of the arrow thin due to the pressure of the part above it and turn it around, then you should focus on that; and cut it according to the quantity in which the forceps hold it; and throw it away, as it is made light for ejection.
If it is held in the bone, then cut with a knife according to the direction of the arrow, and widen the cut until the arrow comes out.
And if this does not help after several days, then repeat the process until it heals.
If the point of the arrow is in that place, then push it towards the affected area.
If the point has fallen and you want to give impulsion, then insert your finger into it, if it is hard, press firmly in the concave part towards the head of the arrow, and push it towards the affected area.
If the arrowhead is concave, then push it strongly towards the point of impact, as the arrow will be pushed away by that.
And if the arrow is embedded, then you should compress all the flesh around it, as much as you can, and tend to that area as best as you can.
If the arrow strikes the foot, or the abdomen, or the bladder, or the side, and it is close to a surface that you can touch without difficulty, and it is possible for you to remove it, then remove it without delay and beware not to cut into veins or nerves, and pull out the arrow, and treat the wound as necessary until it heals.
A device for extracting arrows:
Their ends should be shaped like a hook, made of an appropriate material, and equipped with teeth; when they grasp the arrow, the serrated edges prevent it from slipping.
And these are made in various sizes, large and small, according to the thickness of the arrow, the depth of the wound, and the extent of its constriction.
so that it pushes out the shaft of the arrow from the concave wound and relieves the pressure.
On venipuncture or phlebotomy of veins.
The veins for phlebotomy, of which there are numerous ones, are located in the head, specifically in the area around the temples (two pulsatil veins near the ears, known as the temporal arteries), two on each side of the nose (the lacrimal veins, called "aspicient"), a vein in the middle region of the forehead, one at the tip of the nose, two at the nape of the neck, and two on either side of the lips. These are referred to as the "algelic" veins, and there are also two veins located beneath the tongue. When the veins that are flebotomized in the arms, of which one is a cephalic vein and requires the use of wild garlic, and the people call it "the head vein" and "sordid," and it is the median vein composed of a branch of the basilic and another branch of the cephalic; they commonly name it "the vein of the whole body." The basilic vein is the one that is stopped in the domestic armpit and is called "citellar." They commonly call the popular "ventral vein" those situated between the said auricular and the smaller one at the base. And there are two branches to each.
And on the foot and the leg there are three veins: one of them is left in the curvature of the inner side of the wild garlic; the second is superficial, and its location is left where the domestic legband rests; and the sciatic vein, whose place is left where the wild garlic band rests; and there are other veins similar to these on the band.
The treatment of the veins that are close to the auricles is for cataracts, inflammation, and ulcers of the old evil head.
And the quality of bleeding from these should be as you have observed: it is to shave the patient's head and rub the patient's head on the occiput at the location of both veins with ample friction; then tighten the bandage around the patient's neck so that both appear and their locations near the auricles in two places deeply embedded in the head; and seek as they say, and if you feel the pulse of those as they say, here try this.
Now take the scalpel, and it is one that is sharp, and insert it into the vein in the neck until the incision reaches the bone. Then raise your hand over the vein and bone, and incise the vein with a sharp incision. And the length of the incision should be about two fingers' breadth, or as needed, and make the cut as deep as desired.
Then, apply strong pressure with poultices and leave it until it is healed.
And it has already been mentioned at the beginning of this treatise about the incision and cauterization of these parts.
But regarding the two veins and arteries that are in the thighs, their blockage during phlebotomy is an ancient and serious evil, causing frequent blindness and acute excesses of fluid in the legs.
And the quality of phlebotomy on these parts depends on your judgment: forcing the patient to contract their muscles until two veins appear by direct perception, and demonstrating the pulse of their legs after the procedure; and then you should be careful.
And then, raise the cord over the vein as indicated above, insert the sharp phlebotomy instrument between them, and elevate the vein; cut it thus as you have done in the other two veins; and let the blood flow according to the amount of your need.
And then, carefully tighten the compression around the patient's condition, place the indicated instrument over the vein for an hour, and apply warmth and pressure to that area until it is healed.
And having previously recalled them, and made the incision, attract them toward the beginning of the opening.
And thus, the use of phlebotomy on the vein of the forehead is similar to phlebotomy of the cephalic vein for ancient illnesses of the face, migraines, and painful, foul ulcers.
And the quality of the vein puncture depends on what you have learned; it is to tighten the patient's colon with a bandage so that the vein appears, and then take the instrument called a phlebotomist, which has this shape.
Stop the puncturing at the prominent point of the phlebotomist on that vein and strike it with a lean or other tool in its manner, and let the blood flow according to the amount you wish; then remove the perforation from the patient's body and tighten it until it heals.
Sometimes, the vein is opened with a wide phlebotomy, but it is not known that the phlebotomy of acute extremities is like other phlebotomies, but rather on the lateral extremity, and phlebotomize according to the transversal, because the bone is very close and strong, and the phlebotomy would be damaged in it when it is subtle.
Avoid the jugulation of the two veins that are the tears of two wheels due to the scrape of the wheel by roughness and sebaceous in the wheels, and to the maladies of the face.
And the quality of the phlebotomy is that the illness tightens the vein in a certain place, and you should then make a phlebotomy there, while standing over the patient's head.
And the phlebotomy should be made according to the transverse direction along a short distance, for in that place there is little flesh; and if the phlebotomy is subtle, then only a small part of it should be cut.
Then let the blood flow as much as is necessary, and press upon that area, tighten it for a night, and then release it.
Phlebotomy of the nasal vein is effective for high fever and violent sweating, and for facial illnesses and migraines and redness that occurs on the face, especially when it is long-standing.
And the quality of this phlebotomy is that it tightens the illness's hold and you should then take the patient's nose in your left hand, take a long, subtle phlebotomy, placing it in the middle part of the nose according to its straightness, for the vein does not show itself here, and soon afterward the blood begins to flow.
Ensure you complete the procedure of flebotomy little by little and let the blood flow according to your need; then close it for a night, as it is thus restored more easily.
The application of the flebotomy on both sides should lead to the contraction of vessels, the beginning of healing, and the removal of harmful and destructive diseases and ulcers as well as with potent medicines.
And the quality of the flebotomy on those is that the illness tightens itself in each one in their own cavity; and the expert should be over the head of the patient, and the patient should sit on a stool.
Then, make small flebotomies on the vein deep in the flesh with an ample flebotomy tool; and remove the blood according to season or as much as necessary for that which you consider needed; and do similarly with another vein.
And then tighten the ligature on both veins with a medium-tight grip to prevent the disease from spreading, and leave it within the wrap until the pain is healed.
And regarding the surgical incisions made on the veins, it compares to small apothes and pustules in the mouth, and the corruption of the gums and bad ulcers and cracks, as well as bad ulcers that are found on the nose and around the patient's breath.
And the quality of the surgical incisions for these is that it stops the disease in front of you, tightens the collar around it with a bandage, and then turns the lips inside out, examining each of the two veins, of which one is on the right side of the lip and the second on the left; and the proof of each is by the darkness of either, and this happens more often in the area surrounding them because there are small black veins there; and then you make an incision on each with a sharp knife.
If there is doubt left, and you do not know which one it is, then you begin with the incision of the largest one, and the most obvious pus from among them.
And make it look like the two veins that are on their lips.
When both veins that are on the tongue are left open, then perform phlebotomy of the cephalic vein at its proximal parts that are in the throat, to the malady of the uvula, and to maladies of the mouth.
And the quality of phlebotomy for these is that it follows the disease among your fingers in front of the sun, raises the tongue, and observes under the tongue, from one side the vein and from the other side the vein, and the color of each declines towards blackness.
And then make a small incision on each one; and be careful not to cut off the arteries with your knife, as they are vital.
And your veins, which are usually fleubotomized in the thigh, are the ones through which blood flows in all humans. The fleubotomy of these is performed in two ways: either by applying a mild cauterization with myrtle or olive oil, or by using a cut-edge fleubotomy tool, which is called a "nessil". This is the form of treatment.
its width should be adjusted with the thickness of the veins, and it should open the concave, full veins that appear thick, and those containing large clots.
This flebotomy is of smaller diameter and has more delicate extremities, and it is suitable for the flebotomy of subtle veins that contain thin red blood.
However, the use of flebotomy on the basil vein, one of three veins, is to remove blood from the lower limbs and abdomen, which have become stagnant due to illness.
And it is necessary for the flebotomist, when performing that flebotomy, to be careful and cautious in that area, because if he deviates and misplaces the puncture of the flebotomy, he will cut that artery and cause a flow of blood, so it is important that he does not perform that flebotomy with a sharp instrument, but rather with an arteriotome.
And if the stone does not appear by clear indication, you must know that you should remove it and place another, or seek some ram of it; or incise in the place where it ends in the arm, for it is manifest; and then treat it with flebotomy as we have said.
If you wish to perform flebotomy, note the tightness of the arm at the point where you touch the location, within which you know the place of the pulse; then place your hand over it tightly; and close the arm, and cut the vein with a concave section as we have said; and be careful not to harm the percussion for any space in the area of the artery.
And when you feel, with strength the ligament, an inflammation in the place that you have touched with your hand, then that inflammation is inflammation of the artery, and therefore avoid that one.
And if you feel the flow of blood in flebotomy as with an ear of a child, and the flow is subtile and thin, then know that it is from the artery; and immediately cut and place your finger over it for a long time; and if the flow stops, because the vessel has been severed, tighten the arm and leave it.
And you should observe the patient from the moisture of their body, be very careful with them, and do not cause any harm to them for a few days until they are healed.
If the gangrenous part cannot be severed and you do not have a suitable medicine for it, then you will have to cut into the artery if it appears necessary; for the end of the limb is contracted and the gangrene is detached; or you can use a fistula, make one, take a small portion of it, and stretch that over the place of the vein with stricture using ligatures and poultices within the next day.
And if the gangrene is detached, then it is good; but if not, treat it with the water mentioned earlier, to the remembrance of the place of the detached powder's flow of gangrene.
And the removal of the gangrene from him is difficult due to the small size of the location of the plague and the possibility of limb attachment.
But for the dark vein, phlebotomy is quickly performed to extract the blood from the upper part of the head and leave it from the lower parts of the body; for this reason it is composed of branches of the basilic vein and the cephalica, as we have said.
And be cautious with the phlebotomist if there is excessive fear in performing the phlebotomy, because then it becomes a nerve; and when he finds the nerve, he must carefully avoid it during the phlebotomy, which will cause stupor, and make healing difficult, and often the patient does not recover fully. This nerve shows itself through sensation; if it is hidden in some men and is subtle and not apparent, then you must pause and reconsider performing the phlebotomy with which you are cutting off the vein, and avoid the nerve with all your strength.
And if the vein is between two nerves, then cut the vein along its length.
The immediate effect of phlebotomy on the cephalic vein is that it draws off the blood from the head and provides relief from ailments of the feet.
And in this case, if you want to perform a vein-puncture with an olive or myrtle flebotome, it is the safest of all veins because it does not harm arteries or nerves.
However, in some cases, it is strongly advised that if a patient has an apoplexy (a condition characterized by sudden and severe symptoms) when not performing a flebotomy at the first percussion, do not pay attention to that apoplexy.
The first sentence translated into English is:
And perform a flebotomy, and on the third or first day after the morning, three hours have passed.
Flebotomy should be administered when it proves beneficial and necessary, either at night or during the day, at any time and in every circumstance.
And it is advisable that children under twelve years old not undergo flebotomy, nor should women who are pregnant be bled except in the fourth month of their pregnancy, and the elderly, those who have already passed sixty years, should not be subjected to flebotomy.
And if anyone wishes to undergo flebotomy for some reason, let him purify his bowels with a lion's claw, if there is a great fissure present, so that the veins do not throw off the excess in the flebotomy of the purified bowels, which are clean, and do not affect the main members.
And let the patients not be subjected to cruel bloodletting and gluttony, nor do they escape from illness or drunkenness until this is remedied in them, nor from hydroptic ailments, and more than that, phlebotomy should be fearfully avoided during colic, vomiting, abdominal pain, multiplication of farting and burping, and all causes that dissolve vitality, whether it be physical or animal.
And consider carefully the subtlety of humors in this regard; if the swelling is due to excessive food and drink, then medications may help if they are at hand.
And it is appropriate to take a bath if any cause does not prohibit it, or some exercise for the purpose of making the swelling subtle.
And perform the phlebotomy on the patient's foot at the third hour of the day, as we have said.
And therefore, it is necessary to guard that foot of the patient from all animal misfortunes, such as pain, anger, fear, and from all bodily accidents, such as work and superfluous effort, and heat and things similar to them.
And to his benefit, let the causes be made known of which kind, according to custom, men use herbs for their aroma, fragrance and as balms and similar things according to the amount of possibility.
And then follow the flebotomist over a cushion that is pus or the cushion of the one who was to be flebotomized.
And then extract the patient's arm, and with the flebotomist's hand, press it two or three times; and then tighten the bandage with a strap and wrap it twice.
And the tightness should be tempered, for where the tightness is not equal, or the tightness is superfluous, then it prohibits the flow of the sanie; or if it is towards mollification, and then it prohibits the movement of the sanie in the body.
And then apply compression, ensuring that the area which was suspected to be fluid-filled is rubbed together repeatedly until the veins are inflated and their sensation is revealed.
And then the flebotomist applies his flebotomy tool with a small amount of ancient oil; he places his left hand's finger on the vein, leaving the spot where the flebotomy is to be performed, so that the vein protrudes slightly and the percussion is reduced; the aim is to target the veins full of gas and, when the flebotomist pauses the flebotomy on those, they contract during the flebotomy and the flebotomist withdraws; if he cuts the vein, it becomes narrow.
Therefore, for all these reasons, the flebotomist must be stopped and fully focused on these tasks.
And after completing the flebotomy, if the vein is swollen in one attempt, it is good; otherwise, repeat this another time, leaving that spot slightly or applying heat to it, if the location is not too sensitive.
If the area is inflamed or the pain intensifies, leave it uncovered for a day or two and do not strain the ligament, as this may cause further inflammation or lead to a severe infection, nor immerse it in water.
And if bleeding persists, repeat the phlebotomy if necessary.
And if the vessel is small and the flow subtle, and you fear that it does not draw out enough blood, repeat the phlebotomy on that part according to its rectitude, and adjust the aperture a little, making it a feast for the spot, because in many cases the spot becomes inflamed due to excessive drawing of blood.
If the area has become inflamed previously, do not repeat phlebotomy there, as it serves no purpose; instead, apply some oil to that part, as it eases the flow of blood. And it is better at this location than other locations.
And it seems that in every flap surgery, the surgeon applies oil to the incision, which is a wise and skilled practice when the flap is taken from one of those areas, as the blood vessel constriction is relaxed and the clot is removed when it becomes thick.
And if a significant abscess is formed at the site of flap surgery, as it often happens due to various accidents, especially when it concerns a small vein or the appearance of blood vessels, then you should compress it and place a sponge soaked in water and salt on the area, slightly heating it for an hour, as it will dissolve.
And be sure to do this immediately after the clotting of that vein with the help of ice or another vein.
And if after some days a blackness or green color appears in the area, do not pay attention to it; and if you wish, apply a mixture of aloe and myrrh, or a solution of mint juice or warm water, or something similar.
And sometimes, after repeated accidents, abscesses and bumps appear, requiring phlebotomy of the affected area.
So therefore place your hand over that area, and if you feel hardness there, you should apply compression to it, for that bump is a sign of ill health; and thus be careful not to apply pressure from any of the causes we have mentioned, as strong blood flow can result from a blocked artery.
And apply plaster to the area of tightness so that the location is hardened, and then take care of the other treatment until it heals.
And be aware that you should extract the blood from everyone according to the amount of their strength and according to the color appearing on the skin, as it appears.
If the wound is deep, let it heal until it scabs; and if it seems thick, let it heal until it thins; and if it appears sharp, let it heal until its sharpness subsides.
For those who are in great pain and require the extraction of a wound all at once, the phlebotomy of the vein should be enlarged and the phlebotomies should be lateral.
And for those who are feverish, the opposite should be done, and one should extract it in multiple attempts, and the wound should be narrow.
The best method for phlebotomy of a vein is to make a transverse section, not a puncture.
This method of phlebotomy prevents the flow of blood and nerve injury, and is most effective and safe than phlebotomy according to latitude and length.
And to which it is accustomed for fainting to occur, you should perform flebotomy, and apply a small piece of cloth soaked in milk or simple mead to the wound; and extract the blood from it in three or four drawings.
And if there is a complication of congestion, take a drink before the flebotomy with an infusion of myrrh or honey-based elixir scented with pepper, cinnamon, ginger and similar spices, or an aromatic and highly perfumed elixir.
And if fainting occurs after flebotomy and it is due to the extraction of a large amount of blood, take a drink of beef blood mixed with slightly fragrant elixir; and apply aromatics such as alyssum, and rest your feet at that point.
And use the other causes we have mentioned in the division in the chapter of fainting for evacuation.
And here, he wishes to extend his arm and dissolve his gangrened limb a second time, choosing the part from which the flebotomy is performed for rapid evacuation, and the virtue of it is warm, which evacuates the small blood slowly, according to the quantity of virtue in the continuous days.
He who wishes to extend his arm and remove his gangrened limb a second time, and whose body is strong, should do this after approximately seven or nine hours from the first flebotomy.
He who wishes to expel the blood from his body contrary to the direction in which it flows, should have it extended on the second or third day after the first extension.
He should treat the body in which there is much blood, already cauterized and acute, causing fever; it should be emptied of its blood once, and a large amount taken out, and the perception intensified until syncope occurs, since you will have preserved all the conditions for flebotomy; and you must place your hand on the pulse of the body to control the flow of blood, so that death does not occur from syncope, as this should be done repeatedly when the flebotomist is ignorant or negligent.
And be careful when you want to loosen the arm and evacuate the blood a second time, if the orifices of the vein are already closed and it is difficult to extract the blood, press down on it with great force and gently bend it slightly, as this causes too much harm.
Habanz the cloth inside where it has become a flebotomiat secondarily; or maintain this with the sharpness of the flebotomy that is coagulated with blood in the orifice of the vein; or place a hot compress on the area of turpeth or sage, and make light compression until the blood has drained out.
If the vein is infected, leave it alone until the infection has subsided.
If it becomes necessary to evacuate the blood a second time, and there is no other option, you may bleed the patient on that area or on the other arm in another vein.
And the vein called the "funnel of the arm" is punctured in place of the fistula or basilica when they are not found or are concealed, as it is composed of those parts.
And the quality of the fistula is that the patient inserts their hand into the water until the wound becomes inflamed and the vein appears clearly.
Then it is tightened over that weakened ligament with a stricture; and a fistula is made according to the transverse cut, not longitudinally or according to width.
And it should be an ample opening, and your fistula should be made such that you make the fistula over the joint of the hand with a small cut.
And if the flow of blood is blocked, then you insert your hand into the water again and prevent the blood from flowing in the water until you achieve your purpose.
If you were in the summer days, then you are excused from the movement of your hand in the cold water, and in winter, the body of the sun is most relaxed in cold water.
And the surgery on this vein is far safer than on all other veins, because it has neither pulsating blood nor nerves.
And the phlebotomy of the saphenous vein on the right hand is indicated for liver diseases.
And the advantage of this phlebotomy is that you stretch your hand strongly or with your other hand, since you have immersed it in cold water, so that the vein becomes inflated and well visible to the eye; then make a transverse incision on it; and if you do not pierce it completely at first attempt, try again.
And be careful not to finish the phlebotomy with your hand, because it contains the nerves of the digit exposed by the skin.
And then repeat the hand in the warm water and let the sanch flow through that, for if you do not repeat that in the warm water, the sanch will clot in the opening of the vein, and it is forbidden to flow.
And once the sanch is extracted according to the amount needed, you should place your hand on the vein with oil and salt, so that it is not tightly closed; and similarly attend to everything in a straight manner.
But the healing of the flebotomy of that with the left hand, it is appropriate for the illnesses of the chest.
And do similarly in the flebotomy of him as you have done in the other.
And the treatment of the venous vein in the flebotomy is for illnesses that are at the edges of the body, just as there are illnesses of the mother, and to prevent menstruation, and for illnesses of the veins and ulcers of parts and old garments, and similar conditions to those of illnesses.
And the procedure for a flebotomy is that the patient immerses their foot in water and friction is applied until the veins become visible; then it is tied over the joint of the foot with a strap; and the location of the vein, after being clearly observed, divides into numerous branches on the surface of the foot.
And therefore the broad vein is cut or the leg is elevated after the patient's position has been adjusted, as this is better and more salutary.
And if you perform a flebotomy on the foot, be careful of the nerves that are left beneath the surface of the skin, and place your hand over it when performing the flebotomy, passing along its length, as if you were going to incise it.
And the flebotomy should be successful.
If it is forbidden to raise the leg, then immerse the foot in water and let the blood flow out until it is evacuated.
And if the flebotomist misses on the first attempt, repeat the flebotomy on another small part, since the area is sensitive; and do not fear any harm as long as you protect the nerves as we have said.
And it seems to be done with the same care on the other foot equally.
And for the sciatic vein, the same area as we have said is where the foot should be placed, leaving the calf in the wild branch position.
And the wound of the flebotomy on him is at the hip joint when it is done with a hot cautery.
And the quality of the flebotomy on him is that the patient relaxes in the bath, and quickly and gently pulls the flesh of his leg from the inside of his ankle to above his foot with a thin, long instrument, so that only this is visible.
And so when it appears, you perform a surgical incision on that part according to each skill that is within your ability and according to the direction, which is best; either make an incision through dissection or sever it through secation, since the location of it is exposed.
It is not uncommon; and if you find it, and it does not appear in the sensation of all, perform a surgical incision on one of its branches, and it is that which appears at the back of the foot instead of the aforementioned great toe and little finger.
And be mindful of the nerves, and allow the blood to flow from the wound as much as you wish.
Then tighten the bandage around the incision site and gently hold it in place, as rest is beneficial for healing.
Of ventilation and the qualities of use of those.
Ventozas are made of horns, or iron, or glass.
And the treatment of ventozas (blisters) is done through two methods: one involves the incision and extraction of pus, and the other involves the application of a blister.
And this blister treatment, which is through incision, is done in two ways: either with fire or without fire.
And the blisters that are treated by incision and extraction of pus are in twelve locations on the body: one where blisters are paused, which is at the nape of the neck; two on each side of the spine; blisters under the jaw, below the mouth; two on each shoulder blade; blisters on the loins, just above the tailbone; two on either arm, near the elbow; and blisters on two fingers or toes.
And the extraction of the sancus should not be from the small veins scattered in the flesh, and for this reason, one does not catch the virtue through them, as it happens with phlebotomy; nor should one cover that the ventozacio is made with fire or heat in any illness caused by swelling until the body is entirely evacuated.
If it is necessary to provoke a ventozacio (venesection) for illness or continuously, we should do so at the beginning and end of the month, and in the middle part of the day and at any other time.
And therefore when it occurs in any cause of those conditions, and especially if it is in the third or middle of the month, they command ventilation to be done rather than waiting for two or three hours past the day.
And the immediate relief from ventilation of the neck is that when it confers gravity on the head and what collapses in the ears, it becomes clear that this is an appropriate evacuation of all the body.
And this ventilation is done at the site of phlebotomy of the head.
And it is not advisable to use that which is of foul composition or in which catarrh exists, as it causes great harm to that.
And for that reason, the use of those vessels is not advisable, especially in the heads where frail conditions exist.
Make known to him who is lying on it that relief is granted; and for this reason you must order the ventilator to place his hand slightly on the parts where the suction cups are, lest there be generation of pain.
The application of suction cups (ventozacio) is instead of phlebotomy of the deep vein and basilic: and for this reason it confers relief from asthma, constriction of the air passages, division of the air muscles, cough, and congestion.
And it is necessary that the suction cup be applied to the alkhel (foot) slightly, for if it is left in place too long, it generates weakness in the body and stomach.
And the application of suction cups (ventozacio) to the head confers relief from accidental pain in the head, ophthalmia (eye inflammation), migraine, and toothache; and it is instead of phlebotomy of the basilic vein.
And instruct the fan to not press their hand during the incision so as not to pierce the artery and cause bleeding.
After the incision, apply alcohol to the mouth and to the corruption of the gums, resembling other diseases in the mouth, and it takes the place of phlebotomy from the veins on both lips.
But the incision made on both cheeks provides a cure, which is done by applying heat.
And the incision made within the fissures provides immediate relief from phlebotomy of three veins, namely the basilic, superficial, and cephalic, as those draw the blood from all the smaller, deeper veins in the flesh, as well as the finer veins from the larger ones until they reach the three mentioned veins.
And command the bellows man not to blow too strongly in the incision, for the place is stripped of flesh, and leaves its nerves and arteries exposed.
And it is a bellows which is blown over others and confers treatment to hemorrhoids in the buttocks and to pus ulcers left behind.
And you must command the bellows man to be a strong bellows, and of iron, for the place needs a strong section; and it tolerates only powerful but gentle blowings and is incised with a sharp knife.
The gentle bellows from the legs cause a minimal manifestation, for they draw the blood from all parts of the body, and confer relief to ancient pains from gout and kidney stones; they induce menstruation and bring comfort to pain in the bowels and bladder; and serve as an alternative to lancing of two veins, and to strangulation with rope, and two pins.
However, these weaknesses exhaust the entire body and cause fainting in many men.
And from the openings (ventosas) of the loin, the healing is proper to the healing of the vents of both legs.
And the quality of the position of the openings is that it stops the opening at the beginning of the evacuation and sucks through a gentle suction, and does not prolong the position of the openings, rather it slightly lifts some, and presses others firmly, and causes the humors to come to the area by chance. And do not cease to repeat this until you see the area turn red and swollen, and the pain of the inflammation appears.
Then cut and repeat the suction little by little, and consider the condition of the body.
For that man who has thin, delicate skin, be sure to make an incision once and not repeat it, so the place is not ulcerated.
And order the fan to amplify the scarification and apply some pressure, and facilitate the suction with ease.
And if the swelling in the vein is great, be sure to scarify twice, for the first incision opens the way for the absorption of the vein and its contents. In the second, apply the scrutiny acquired from the extraction of the large vein.
And if the vein is very foul-smelling, make a third scarification so that you can achieve the last (result/process).
Lastly, when we want to extract the vein little by little or a small one, it is enough for us to make a single scarification.
And if we wish to extract a solid stone, we perform a thorough incision; and if we know that the stone is large, then we must make an extensive incision.
And the term "scarification" refers solely to the depth of the incision.
And if the incision is deep, hard, rough, and its edges are very close together, then the places for the suction cups should be smeared with a softer, wider, resolute opening; if it is in summer, with aloe oil or violet oil or crushed almond oil or henna seed oil; and if it is in winter, then with birch oil or larch oil or chamomile oil or st John's wort oil, similar substances.
And if the excess [tissue] is thick, fibrous, then use oil of amber, or balsam oil, or aloe oil, or anise oil, and similar substances.
If the leech is of ample size and has tender flesh, then it should be prohibited from oil, and at these places where leeches are applied, the leeching should be with watery solutions, or with water fortified with solatrum, or with water from a cucumber, or with water from a grapevine, and similar substances.
And that one whose leech has a very moist sanitarium, washes its leeches in wine or in water of myrtle and sumac and similar substances.
And for those whose secretions are excessive, wash their leeches in old wine or in water of fennel, which is marjoram, or of decoction of anise, or chamomile, and similar substances.
And be it known that leeching should be protected from baths; it is advisable to administer the leech immediately before or after a bath for about an hour or two, and ensure it sleeps near the wound.
What is it that must be done to regulate the flow of blood after phlebotomy before ventilation?
When beginning the treatment: if the phlebotomist or the one who has undergone flebotomy is irritable and has severe pain and inflammation, then you should take measures to cool down, such as using milky herbs, fennel, aniseed, dill, and similar plants.
And they should abstain from their meals as well, including light meats, and foods seasoned with herbs, and similar things.
And for those whose condition is severe, they should take in plenty of cold water, or water from the plant althaeas with seeds, and sumac, and a drink with a strong scent between wine and honey; and it is recommended that he limit his drinking and eating, abstain from meals containing chicken, cabbage, and wine.
And it is important that on days of ventilation and phlebotomy, drinking should be greater than food intake.
It is important to give alcoholic drinks to some people, such as hyssop or musk, which are muscaty, or alcelite before ventilation or phlebotomy, or afterwards, so that the principal members are comforted and the pain is alleviated; and one should not allow them to take that scalding.
One should not perform ventilation on parts that are subject to scarification, such as the liver, and over the navel, in the places of the joints, and the opening of the anus, because these members do not tolerate scarification.
And it is not desired for those with a strong attraction of pus from a member, thus pausing ventilation over the breast in flux of pus from the pus of the nose; and they use that to dissolve the trapped ventilation within the member, similarly pausing over the abdomen and navel; for it rarifies the member and scalds it and removes pain as it resolves ventilation.
And now rests on the wounds when it occurs in their compression or pressure, for by virtue of strong attraction, it improves the compression and eradicates the pressure from its place.
And it seems to happen when it rests on the liver and gallbladder, requiring ventilation in those enclosed areas.
And these ventilations are administered using suction, sometimes only; and in some cases, they are administered over fire.
And sometimes, they are administered full of heated water in the patient's gallbladder ailments.
And this is so that the ventilation be filled and form pus, it is only heated water or water in which suitable herbs have been infused.
Form of an ampule administered by fire: the size of the orifice should be two fingers in diameter, as we have formed it; and the quantity of the liquid should be the amount that fits into a palm; and in its width, at the place where it is in the circuit, it should be half, the opening should be small according to the quantity that goes into it with an needle.
Use erbs, roo or citrus, with thick slices of onion, lemon, ginger and parsley so that they do not damage the member in its position over it.
And at the middle of it, a transverse slice of erb or iron, where the candle is stopped over the fire.
And this ampule is much larger than the one we have previously used; and its quantity is less, according to the illness and the state of the one who uses it.
And the cups used for children and the weak are different from the cups used for young and robust individuals.
And the method of applying this cup is to use fire from a piece of wood gently over it, and place it on the middle of the transverse ligament in the exact spot of the cup, so that the fire is lit around the edge, preventing it from burning the patient's body.
Once applied to the patient's member, and with the position as we have described it, within a short time, when the cups are in place and do not require any further aid, the heat causes the vapor to form over that area, and the cup will soon dissolve.
And adjust the cup according to your liking, and repeat if further aid is needed.
It is also possible to use a cup on patients with pleurisy, without the presence of a transverse ligament or a point, and it should only be filled with water and applied to the member.
And this is the form of it: And this bellows, the larger it is, the better, because it can receive a great quantity of water.
**Chapter LXXVII**
Bloodletting is not administered in all members but only in those where it is not possible to place bellows, due to their smallness, as well as the nose and similar parts; or in a member devoid of flesh, as in the case of the nose and its surroundings.
And the quality of using those that you have found bloodletting instruments in the infected water of wounds.
Then it is appropriate to immerse the day and night in infected water, as long as they are not harmful, and do not cause any pain in the belly of those affected; and then evacuate the body at the beginning with flebotomy and bellows; and rub the patient's member until it becomes red; and place a cushion on them.
And when they are filled and closed.
And if it is possible to drain the area with a ventosa, it is more effective in youth.
If not, wash the area with wine mixed with vinegar and then apply a lot of hot water; it should be rubbed and pressed.
And if the duration of the bandage prevents the draining of blood vessels, and it is necessary to absorb the sweat, then place a cloth soaked in cold water on top and secure it so that the sweating stops.
And if the bandage becomes multiplied, then sprinkle over it powdered vitriol mixed with gall and similar substances to the stiptics, as long as the bandage is absorbed; or place pauses on the area with crushed fava beans, and lay them down until the beans adhere to the area, and the bandage is absorbed.
And if, it is necessary, apply bloodletting, when possible change those.
And if bloodletting is contraindicated, then the place should be rubbed with a hot compress or left with a needle in the spot until it bleeds; and when they are stopped, since those who feel any pain will soon release it.
And when you want them to open, sprinkle over those a little aloe tristrate, or salt, or ash, and it will soon open.
Thus begins the process of recovery from the third stage: restoration. This chapter is often necessary in the art of medicine; it is the restoration of fractures and dislocations in bones.
Oh, son, know that those who boast of this chapter are foolish doctors and the common people, and those who do not study or read the books of the Ancients even for a little while.
And for this reason, it happens that this way of thinking among scientists in our land is lacking; and you should never forget this at all; I have not dedicated myself to this task except for a long time studying the books of the Ancients and reflecting on their understanding, so as to extract science from them.
And I have dedicated my life to experimentation and study.
And I have here described in this chapter everything that relates to my science and upon which I have conducted my experiments; so that those who are busy with lengthening may shorten it for themselves and be relieved of its occupation; and I have shortened it at the end of explanation; and I have demonstrated it at the end of declaration; and I have formed in it motifs from the tools that are administered there, as is done by addition of declaration, just as I have done in the two preceding chapters.
First chapter.
In summary, and as a collection of fractures of the bones, those whose previous mention is necessary before we begin the remembrance of fractured limbs and various conditions of each. Therefore, let us begin with the summary of this chapter, outlining the essence of the discourse; and the chapters that follow, which are for the understanding of the artificer, at leisure and focused on the truth of these matters; to you and those who are eager to learn this noble art from you.
And therefore, it is said that when you encounter a fracture or dislocation or twisting or injury, you should immediately consider starting with fleubotomy or separating it, or sometimes, if no other cause prohibits, by the elimination of virtue, or as the case may be, whether it is in a state of decay, or there is a time of intense heat, or intense friction.
And then I am content with food consisting of herbs, veal and crab meat; I forbid fatty meats and filling myself with foods that clog the veins with lye, as long as you are careful to avoid gangrene, and if you do not fear the emission of matter into the member.
And then return the patient to their original condition, from which they usually recover.
And so when the bone has begun to heal, you must ensure that the patient is fed nourishing foods with plenty of moisture, such as cooked wheat with water, rice, bread, meat, veal, fresh fish, and similar foods, and at this stage the goal is to promote the coagulation of the fracture more gently and slowly.
And you should know that the bones break when they are in the hands of men, both in the first violence and in the decrepit, it is not possible for them to continue and be consolidated according to their nature due to the drying out of their members.
However, nature itself adjusts and amends the broken bone from any cause similar to gout, in which there is swelling that adheres and strengthens that part which is always glued and joined together, until the end of strength and firmness, just as fire at the beginning, nor does any cause forbid it from its works.
And for this reason, it is necessary to restrict the patient's food, food in which there is gravity and viscosity and thickness, as we have said.
And you should know that the species of fractures are diverse according to the diversity of members, for the fracture of a bone in the leg is different from the fracture of a bone in the head; and the fracture of a bone in the foot is diverse from the fracture of a bone in the arm; and similarly, all other members are diverse among themselves.
And now let us recall all kinds of fractures, exposed in their separate chapters.
A great variety of fractures, indeed. And there are diverse species of bone fractures in their nature; for some are arcoated fractures or those that occur in them like stars; and sometimes they are fractured according to the length of the bone: these are the sagittal, stellate, and other fractures, both occurring and not occurring from a blow, as is done when preparing to write, and the fracture by plague and dislocation in the skull, and the small fissure fracture.
And each species has its own peculiar pain and torment in restoration according to the distinct memory of its place.
A clear sign of bone fracture. And this is how it is known to be a broken bone: its twisting, and that prominence and sensation of it in the touch, only when you compress it with your hand.
And therefore if there is no appearance of twisting in the location and there is no great pain felt when touching the bone due to its agitation, then it is not a fracture here.
It is possible that it is a twist or small fracture, where you do not feel pain when pressing with your hand and there is no great compression; then apply over it the medicines of which you have recollection appropriate to that moment which convenes to the location; and then make it very tight due to subtle tightness.
And you know that the location when it is arched and does not split into two or another thing that does not happen in it gradually, as soon as the whole part of its comparison is torn, then you must begin from your hour to rectify it before it becomes infected.
And if it becomes infected with gangrene, leave it for a few days until the gangrene disappears; then apply it in any way that seems appropriate and effective.
And you know that the restoration of the flesh and the stitching of it is easier than the treatment of bone where damage has occurred.
Then strengthen it according to the recall of the flesh.
If there are severe fractures in the bones, it is necessary to extend this broken member from two parts, whether it is the hand or the foot; or use your hand if the member is small; or tie two strings or one string and the hand.
And position the member in a way that is similar to its natural state while maintaining the stretched parts of the broken member; then perforate to ensure those additions return to their places, using any means and methods you can.
And be careful, according to your strength, that you do not act on the patient through your painful operation or injury; and pierce yourself according to your ability, applying one tool to another in its best form.
And be sure to touch with your hand at the right time, and if you notice any other cause, correct it and heal it with the amount of your virtue.
Avoid severe stretching and compression, as foolish doctors often cause gangrene with their operations, or they cause contraction in the member, as we have seen this happening through the operations of their fanciful motions.
And the quality of the constriction of the member at rest is what you should consider, because you must know that the members broken are diversified in their smallness and greatness and in the shape of those.
And of those that are small like the arm and the elbow and similar to those, you must understand that the envelopment should be of very fine cloth.
For those that are thick like the skin or the leg, you must understand that in these there should be a complete and hard envelopment, because the tightness around each part connects the large member and makes it strong from every side, so that nothing enters inside.
And then begin, carefully discharge your feces, place a suitable poultice on it, over the place of that fracture with three or four layers according to the member, and tighten your hand slightly on the poultice.
And then carefully remove the splint from the most dominant part of the fracture site, and stretch it gently so as not to tighten your restriction, which you have strengthened at the fracture site. And then gradually lengthen the wrap around the fracture site, and gently ease the restriction little by little, until you achieve a considerable opening at the site.
Then take another bandage and wrap it around the twisted area, covering it with the previous bandage as far as possible beyond the fracture; and now your operation is on the restriction of the bandages and their gentle easing according to what we have said about the first bandage.
Then place a stopple or cloth between the bandages to support the curvature of the fracture if it is curved; otherwise, do not place anything in it for no reason.
And then place your hand over the other area, and cover these sterile bandages made properly around it, if there is no inflammation or abscess present, and apply pressure to where the abscess is and where you feel the inflammation; leave it for a few days, and then tighten the bandages.
And the bandages should be of different types of canvas, carefully made; or of wood; or of palm leaves; and their width should be according to this form and figure.
However, it is necessary that the bandage placed over the fracture be thicker and longer than the others, and its length according to the measurement of the member in magnitude and smallness; then tighten the bandages over the other area according to your initial tension; and wrap them closely around with a thread decently as we have said about tension, and it should be your tension according to the location of the fracture more, and the longer it extends from the fracture, the tighter the tension.
And take care that the threads are stronger in thickness and fineness, and that they be many; and if the threads are thick, as you have seen in the operation of some tissues that pause the threads of their cords from the twist, it is a great error when the tightness becomes equal.
Indeed, very fine threads are not suitable, because you will not be able to achieve the desired tightness with them, and you will not realize that between one thread and another there is less than a finger's width.
And if the disease is located at the ends of the bones, then tighten them in these places without applying excessive pressure, so that it does not cause harm to the soft tissues or a bruise.
Sometimes, fracture is the plague, and it causes disruption in the ligament, leading to a recurrence in that area as specified in the second chapter due to its particular nature.
And you should know that a completely severed member is not immediately bound with steels on the first day; this is because when the member is large, it cannot be pinned down by steels until several days later, or perhaps seven or fifteen, depending on your confidence in preventing gangrene from setting in.
And this is the manner of splints used by the ancients to restore, which are placed over fractures and dislocations and twists.
Method of splinting as an accelerated means of restoring a fracture, most suitable for complex cases and especially for women and children, where heat or friction should not be applied: take flour from the mill, which is the heart of the grain that prevents the movement of the millstones against the walls.
And if that does not work as such, then take a thin and soft cloth, and prepare it not too thick or thin, and apply it accordingly.
Another method of plastering to restore fractures and dislocations and twists: prepare assafetida, labdanum, acacia, enula, and migra, which is grated from milker's salvage, from all parts of the dragon. 5; myrrh and aloe from the dragon. 2; alcohol from the dragon. 10; all these are triturated and mixed with alichil water or egg albumen if the patient's condition is scorched; then apply this plaster, as it is of good composition and restores broken bones slightly, and confers benefit to many men.
Another plaster method that confers benefit to fractures and twists: prepare migra and add white alder, from the dragon 10 times; myrrh and aloe, each from the dragon 5 times; acacia, from the dragon 6 times; and Armenian bole, from the dragon 20 times.
All these are triturated in a mortar with strong pressure, and then sieved, mixed with water or egg albumen and administered.
A method of plastering joints and bones to separate them from their places, causing accidental pain in those and in cracks and fractures; take fine wool and submerge it in a mixture of wine and oil, and place it over the area.
This plaster is not merely for restoration, it prevents abscesses cautiously and expels pain itself.
Another method of plastering that restores closed bones: take leaves of the fig tree and poppy flowers, mix them all together to make a plaster.
A method of quick-acting plaster applied for the restoration of broken bones and when you desire a resolution from an abscess: take roots of althae, chamomile flowers, violet flowers, whole wheat flour, all finely ground; mix them together with wine, if the member is not scorched.
If it is scalded, then apply that with cool water from parsley or with water and use it.
Another method of applying a strong poultice for resolution after the initial one, when there is a hard apothema, is to prepare a mixture of fennel seeds and licorice root, and also of balm, melilot, marjoram, violet flowers, chamomile flowers, any other herbs, all finely chopped and mixed with either savory water, or diluted water, or wine, according to the quality of the member and the rest of its color.
But Hippocrates does not specify in his work that it should be placed over the affected member before its restoration, unless certain preparations of wax and oil are made, and not otherwise; he recommends that it should be applied with a balance between thickness and thinness.
Galen also states that poultices should be applied to the broken member after its restoration, and the causes for their drying require heat, such as with myrrh, onions, and similar herbs, in the same way as for those causes that we have recommended.
A method of applying a plaster for injury and pain: take half a pound of lint, horsehair from an animal's mane or feathers from a bird, and other materials, mix them together, grind them, sift them, and prepare the plaster.
The amount should be adjusted according to the size of the wound and if it is completely separated, consider whether there is no pain or discomfort or if the bone is not broken; in this case, do not attempt to separate the bones immediately. If, at the site of pain, there is a violent or intense sensation of pressure or swelling, immediately cut or separate the plaster from that area and prevent further application.
Take a piece of linen and sponge from the sea, soak it in hot water, and apply this to the area until the pressure and pain cease; then allow the member to rest for an hour. Next, cover it with woolen cloth soaked in vinegar or rose oil, and wrap it up; leave it in this state for the night, ensuring there is no risk of infection and that the swelling subsides, alleviating the pain in the member.
And then repeat that precise procedure, applying a thin restraint with a small plaster and not tightening it too much with your initial constraint, but gently apply it to whatever needs healing.
And if the abscess, inflammation, pain, and all other symptoms have already subsided, and you find yourself in need of a plaster and restraints, then repeat that same procedure as you began with the initial treatment.
And if no cause for these symptoms (as we have mentioned) occurs in the member, then do not drain it unless after three or four or five or seven days; and sometimes everything is left for twenty days, as you see fit from the loosening of the member, as we have said, until the fracture adheres and approaches the coagulation of the flesh on that spot.
And then adjust the restraints more than your initial restraints, and also adjust the diet of the patient according to their condition's improvement.
If you examine the site of the fracture and find it already dried and weakened but not covered, then know that nourishment is prohibited from reaching it; so you should immerse it in hot water every time you take care of it; and do this for three days; and little by little relieve the tightness, and through this operation direct the nourishment to the member, and heal it gently.
But what the ignorant restorers of a member fracture do another time when it is not restored at the beginning, according to how it is covered, and is restored according to its twists, is an error according to their operation, and causes great fear, and if it were a skilled surgeon, he would enlarge the ancient wounds in their free spaces and heal them toward this.
And you have not seen any of them do this, so it is all the more reasonable that this should not be done.
**Section: On Fractures When They Occur in the Head.**
The fragments of fractures are diverse, and their shapes vary, and the causes are distinct, for some fractures are caused by the impact of a blow, which arrests all the bone within the flesh, leaving the bone thus as it was in the fist, and that is why this type is called simple; or the space cuts through a portion of the bone, cuts the flesh thereof, and does not permit the incision to pass through the rear part of the bone; and this type of fracture is called complete.
And the affliction of these two types of fractures is either great or slight, and it can be caused by pressure or impact upon a bone; their appearance is similar.
And this fracture is either penetrating, approaching the tissue that surrounds the bone, or it is on the surface of the bone; and the affliction of these two types of fractures can be great or slight.
And this fracture is confined to the bone in the delicate part of the hair follicle, and that is why this type of fracture is called capillary.
And if a fracture is caused either by an accident or by the impact of a stone and appears similar, causing some lamina of bone to enter the space inside, it is experienced in the concavity of the location just as it happens with the ribs when they are struck and it is the exit of their entrance into the internal space.
And it is primarily caused in the bones of the joints, just as it is in the heads of infants.
And all these types of fractures, being separated, are painful just like stars dispersed. And one should return to memory of all this in its place.
And I would recognize all these types of fractures by detecting them and through the inquiry of their attempts and the evident corruption of flesh upon them.
And a special capillary is known for what is discovered over the bone, it is washed, and cleaned upon it with tenet, because the fracture appears black.
In the treatment of fractures, one must consider from the beginning the accidents of the illness, and if you examine the accidents by their signs that manifest themselves as pain, vomiting of colic, extension, loss of understanding, absence of voice, fainting, acute fever, and the appearance of ulcers and bleeding from those, and similar to them in the major dispositions, then it is clear that one is not healed.
And if you observe unusual accidents, you hope for health, then you begin the treatment of it.
Which causes, because if the plague comes to you at the beginning as it comes and this happens during the winter, then know that you must study the skeleton of the bone from the 13th day according to all dispositions.
And if it is during the summer days, you must ensure that you cover the bone against direct sunlight after six days, as what remains of the skin will be corrupted by fat, and accidents that we have mentioned may occur.
And if the fracture has already penetrated into the fatty tissue, covering the brain, and it is in small pieces and inflammation, you must then cut out the damaged and inflamed part, as I have mentioned before.
And it is that you must examine the patient's head for the plague, and discover over the bone according to custom and method, as possible according to the figure of the plague, and it should be lighter on the patient.
And if you encounter a bone infection, pus or abscess, you must oppose it with what is appropriate, and it is that you fill the area with bandages soaked in vinegar and rose oil, and let the plague rest until the abscess subsides, and be certain of the flow of pus; and then begin at the circumference of the bone and in the removal of it.
And this is according to one of two methods of operation.
And one method is that you insert the bone knife at an angle, and this is the shape of it: Then apply another knife to this, slightly wider than the first; and this is the shape of it:
Then apply the knife more widely than the second one.
And you must choose the number of knives according to need, some being wider than others; and some shorter, the latter having a sharper point at their tip, made of iron or steel.
And use them with ease in percussion over the knife to avoid damaging its tip and that of the patient.
And if the bone is strong, hard, you must perforate in a circular motion around it before administering the scissors to the incisions, which are called non-penetrating incisions.
And they are not called thus, but rather because they do not allow the term of the bone in the testis to be placed to it, so that at the edge or margin of the incision is a round extreme or edge over which the head of the bone does not protrude, resembling a small margin or circle, which prevents submersion and passing through the thickness of the bone.
And it is convenient that you take from these incisions a great number of which each one corresponds to the specificity of each bone, as long as you are present in all parts of the skull, the end of which is acute, the amount in length and brevity is according to the quantity of specificity of this test.
This is the method for three types of incisions: The quality of perforating in the circle around the broken bone is to place the incision over the bone and turn it with your fingers until you know that the bone is penetrated; then, change the incision to another location and stop when the amount of thickness of the ray or surrounding area is passed.
And then cut with scissors what is between any two bones, and make that small hole over it in a levitative manner, as we have said, so as to remove the bone, or with your hand, or with any other cause using some tools you have prepared for this purpose, with forceps and other delicate instruments.
And beware that you handle with all caution so that the scissors do not touch any part of the patient's body.
And so when you have pierced the bone and it is separated from the tissue if it continues to be attached, take that extract, beware of scratching and biting it on the roughness of the bone with some instrument resembling scissors, but nevertheless ensure it is more gentle and subtler than the other scissors.
And if you notice any movement of the small and fragile bones, then take advantage of this with the instruments at your disposal, and apply it to cure the wound with liniment and ointment as we have mentioned.
And another method of operation is light, free from pain, which dissects bone and flesh with great praise; this is the speech of it: It is necessary for you at the beginning that you begin to uncover the part of the bone in the place where the fracture is most violent and evident, until when you have uncovered that part and paused, leave there the extreme of this slow and gentle incision from which this form comes.
And the slow part is round and does not cut any cause, but the sharp part is in two cuts ahead in length, so when you have opened the slow part, adjust it to the shape of the sharp incision facing it on the bone.
Then strike the incision of one part with a small hammer until it cuts through the bone entirely, thus making it easier to turn, and be sure of the position of the panniculus so that no accident occurs in any way, and if the medicant14 was the most foolish of all men and the most ignorant of their conditions; certainly, he was asleep.
When a bone breaks due to some cause attached to the panniculus (fatty tissue) in certain places of the bone, it should be cut with a scalpel at that part closest to the blade, and easily separated, as it is freed from its discomfort and pain.
If the bone fracture does not penetrate into the panniculus, and what is detached or left attached to the bone is the fascia, which has roughness and subtle fibers, you should shave off that roughness and eliminate those fibers with finely sharpened razors that you have prepared in various quantities, so that it is possible for you to apply them in all areas as most appropriate during your operation on the fractured bone and according to the shape it has assumed.
And you should be mindful in your reasoning as to which razors to use at the beginning, applying the thinnest ones first and then using thicker ones as needed, without stopping until you have administered the most suitable and thinnest ones to all areas.
Place a small capillary and delicate fracture into each of the other breaks, ensuring you administer treatment according to what you find in correcting them.
And it is because not all those who have studied this art practice it fully. And we have shown, regarding what he writes, the application in great fractures.
And if the pannus (or skin) is stretched when you dislocate a bone, then take cloth from it according to the extent of the damage, immerse that in warm oil and place it over the affected area; then take another piece of cloth, either folded twice or thrice, immerse that in vinegar and water, and place it on top of the first cloth, gently pressing it so as not to aggravate the wound; and finally, apply a dressing of lard, not tightening it, but allowing it to cover the affected area.
And leave this treatment for a day or two until you are sure of the fever's abatement; then remove that and administer medications as needed, such as raisin juice, flour of eggs, powder of herbs and aristology, and similar things.
And you should make this medicine into a powder that is sprinkled on the affected area, when it is dry; and generally, administer to that person all medicines of the right kind from which he or she abstains and does not bite.
And be mindful according to your virtue that the plague in your treatment be clean; and do not use ointments or other things; nor should you add virulence to it; for when it is placed on the membranous covering of the brain, it corrupts that and destroys it, and brings about a malicious malignancy over the disease.
And it happens in the brain, when due to its purification the bones are affected and even more so when the treatment of it is delayed, and it becomes black on its surface; and therefore consider whether, in the case of the disease, such accidents occur as we have mentioned, knowing that these are harmful to all skills.
And if you do not experience the dark color (gout) only from the medicine placed upon it, but it is due to that very medicine, then take some honey and crushed olive oil in equal parts, and wrap them around the affected area; then apply a poultice with appropriate remedies for healing until it is cured.
**Capitol III.**
On the restoration of the nose when it is broken.
You know that the nose is not broken in one place but rather in two superior parts or sometimes in one of those small bones, so that it has two bones in it, because the fracture leaves it cartilaginous, not broken and it does not occur to it but rather atrophy, tortuosity and sinusitis.
If one of the two parts is broken, then you must insert a small piece into his nose, and hold that fracture inside with your finger, and also push it from outside, so that the nose returns to its natural shape. And do this for your convenience, and be careful not to cause pain during your operation on the patient's illness.
And if the fracture is in the superior part of the nose and does not reach that part, then you must equalize the end of the ray where the thickening has occurred.
And if the fracture is in two parts, then you do the same to it.
And on the first day of the fracture, attempt to restore it if possible; otherwise, return to the original position cautiously after seven or eight days of rest.
And insert a piece of cloth from the linen into the nostril, if the fracture is in one part, or use two pieces, if the fracture is in two parts, making them as thick as possible to fill the nasal cavity.
And some of the ancient healers would insert the pieces in a moistened border, and change them daily, which I have not seen; instead, they would place the piece in raw egg albumen with flour powder; and leave it until the bone is healed and the cartilage hardened.
And in some cases, it becomes entangled in the nose, in place of any cold, causing severe pain because it is wrapped in lion's cloth; and if you have already broken the nose severely and the pain does not prevent inspiration.
And this cause is not necessary; and if you wish, do it, and if you wish, use cold applications.
And if, after another application of the cautery, gangrene occurs, apply a paste to the nose made of beeswax and honey mixed with vinegar or distilled water.
If gangrene does not occur after the cautery, cover it with a paste made of sesame flour and powdered hen's eggs mixed with egg white, and place your hand over it to prevent any further infection.
But if the bones of the nose are broken or fractured in any way or there is a crack, then you must carefully extract them using suitable instruments; and then close the wound with stitches, and treat it with what is appropriate to heal and consolidate it, and apply suitable plasters.
And if a plague occurs within the nose, then you must treat it with caution and insert silver tubes until it is completely healed.
**Capitol IV**
**On the Restoration of the Mandible When Broken**
When the jawbone is broken and the fracture is not accompanied by severe pain, observe whether the fracture is only on one side, and not split into two parts, but curved at the site of the break. In such cases, its healing is slight.
And therefore, if the fracture is on the right side, you must insert your little finger of the left hand into the patient's mouth to support it; and conversely, if the fracture is on the left mandible, then insert your right little finger from the outside, pushing gently to facilitate the alignment of the broken parts from within, while maintaining an even pressure with your other hand from the outside.
And if the fracture of the jaw is already separated into two parts, then you must administer extension to both parts according to their correct alignment so that its equilibrium can be achieved.
And if there is a concussion of the teeth due to displacement, then tighten those which you hope will remain attached with threads of gold or silver or silk; and apply pressure over the broken mandible with wax, and place a doubled cloth over it, and a large star-shaped piece of cloth cut appropriately, or a single piece matching the length of the mandible; and fasten it to her according to your equipment for the ligation, as long as it is not destroyed.
And order the patient to rest and be at ease, and refrain from eating heavy or spicy foods.
And if you estimate that the shape has already been altered in some way, then after three days, re-align what has been distorted and apply a powder from a mill, or white of an egg, or flour of chamomile, since you will have kept the bandage on it, and place a warm compress over it.
And then, once this annex and the application are in place and the arrangement of the bone is not altered, leave it until it heals and strengthens the fracture; for usually this fracture tightens in three weeks.
And if another apotheosis (infection) occurs after the application, then administer what we have said concerning its treatment until it heals, and heal that infection.
And if the fracture is a serious one, consider whether it is a separation of bone or dislocation, then you must carefully hold those dislocations with what seems appropriate in the removal of those from the tools.
And if the orifice of the fracture is narrow, then you should widen it through fléubotomy according to your need.
And then, once you have held those dislocations and it is not healed again, open the orifice of the fracture if it is narrow; otherwise, place a padding over it with one of the applications that seem appropriate until it heals.
Chapter Five.
On the restoration of the fork when it is broken.
When the fork (or bone) breaks due to a strike, it can occur in one of three ways.
Depending on whether it is broken, separated, or broken into two parts that do not accidentally cause additional damage; it is harder to restore it; or it occurs with complications, making restoration difficult; or the fracture is like a plague.
And for that operation, when the fracture is with complications, you should have two assistants; one should hold the broken fork and assist, while another extends the leg to stabilize it.
And then apply a splint to the fracture, keeping it straight and forming it according to its shape, without any prominence or concave areas.
If you need a larger extension, notice where the patient's discomfort begins and place a roll of linen or woolen cloth there, as large as necessary; then extend and raise the splint and secure it with your hand while applying the splint to the fracture according to its shape.
And if you cannot reach the end of the splint to secure it outside, because it has reached its limit, then place the patient's discomfort on their neck and rest it upon a half-sized cushion over the affected muscle.
The assistant should massage the affected muscle while holding the splint in place until the bone of the fracture is raised and secure; then correct the fracture and apply a splint to it with your hands.
If you feel stiffness in the furcula (hyoid bone) and it is painful, then know that you must cut into it and extract those stiffened parts with ease.
And if it is retained in the bone, then use your surgical knife from among those you have prepared for this purpose, since you had left the furcula with the instrument that serves to cut; and this is the form of the instrument: a saw or a steel blade.
And it is similar to a chisel, of which this is the concave part; and its size according to what you need it for, according to the size of the bone or the thickness of it.
You can adjust the length of it according to what is possible for the operation; it should have two ends, with one wide and the other narrow.
And if the disruption of the wound which you have incised when extracting the sagacity from the bone is wide, and it is assuredly safe from infection, then you adjust both lips of the wound to close it with suture.
And if the disruption is slight, or you fear a dangerous infection, then you employ the wound with drapes and powders according to the extent of the wound's incision.
And if an abscess forms, then insert cloth soaked in hot oil and vinegar, and place it over that area.
And as long as the star (cast) above the broken bone is not damaged; and so that you may see the malady each day, when the ligament softens or you notice the star already damaged, then correct it and tighten the bandage.
Then suspend the patient's sleep on their side, and place a small cushion under them to keep the pressure off their sleep at night; so that by that means the supporters of their body from that side are raised, and thus the fracture of the furcula is elevated from the muscle; or, alternatively, their arm is bent at the elbow.
And do not loosen the ligament unless it occurs at the site of the fracture or abscess within twelve days.
Then renew the bandage if you see that it is falling off, tighten the compression and restore it, and leave it until it is healed and the fracture of the furcula is coagulated.
And it is tightened and supported according to its healing stage in 28 days, and sometimes in certain cases it is cured in less time for some people.
**Chapter VI**
**On the Restoration of Shoulder Fractures**
The blade of the spatula is broken in its lateral part, but not the entire bone, only its margins.
And therefore, when the bone is broken, and it is broken in the middle part of itself, and it is not known except by touch, then according to how the fracture's figure protrudes, you shall prepare it and reduce it back to its natural shape in every way with the aid of your skill.
Then, place a thin sheet of cloth over the area, and apply powdered chalk from a mortar; also, use a small amount of stop (a medicinal substance) or a duplicate cloth bandage; and finally, place a side table cloth subtly beneath it according to the size of the spatula.
If the sheet is concave in any part of the spatula, then you should fill that concavity with a thick substance to even out the surface.
And then tighten it strongly with the tongue, using constriction and the firmness of the sheet until it does not move from its place.
And consider the moisture daily; whenever it becomes softened, apply again and tighten or equalize the sheet if it moves from its place.
And keep the patient on their side.
And the spatula should be restored in X days or in 25th (part of a day, indicating a period of time).
And therefore when this number of days is completed, you will dissolve the bandage, and be sure that it is from the bones whose beginning was not feared nor their dissolution.
And if you proceed from the location of the infected bone and place a chain there, then split it open and hold it fast, and act as we have said about the fracture of the tailbone cautery if this happens here.
**Chapter VII**
**On the Restoration of a Broken Foot**
A broken foot sometimes snaps in the middle, and it takes time to heal; more often, its ends are fractured and bruised.
And one of the accidents when the middle part breaks is that it bends inward and causes great pain, difficulty in moving, coughing, and severe vomiting; it is evident in the hollow of the broken bone and is not hidden from sensation.
And the restoration of it is that the patient be placed on their back, and a cushion be placed between their shoulders; then press upon their muscles, adjust their ribs to the two ribs, and be delicate in the operation of it and in the placement according to every manner that is possible and suitable for it, so that the shape of the bone returns as it was.
Then apply a plaster and stopgap using a thin sheet of cotton or linen, similar in texture to cloth; carefully wrap this around the broken bone, gently applying pressure as needed; occasionally adjust the bandage to maintain its curve along the spine, and tighten it with moderate tension; constantly assess the bandage, and when softened, tighten it.
If it becomes necessary to cause the displacement of any corrosion, inflammation, pain, or abscess that occurs in the area, then you should loosen and remove the bandage, eradicate the plaster, and correct what has occurred through the cure of it; reduce the bandage if you made it too tight; adjust its tension until healing is achieved.
Chapter VIII.
On the restoration of broken ribs.
You know that a fracture of the ribs does not occur lightly but in severe blows to the back; and the ends of their joints, when separated, do not cause immediate pain to those parts, since they are cartilaginous. And the knowledge of him is not obscured from feeling, you must inquire about his pain in these parts.
And the restoration is such that it heals the fracture in these parts according to the manner possible, as it is swallowed according to what fits, and then apply a plaster and tighten the broken bone with a splint, if necessary for that.
If the fracture of the ribs is inclined towards the inner parts, it causes the patient severe pain and stabbing, just as much as the stabbing that occurs in those who have pleurisy, and because of this the bone presses upon the viscera; and it causes difficulty in breathing, coughing, and vomiting of foul-smelling sputum; and this is a difficult cure.
And ancient remedies are ingeniously designed for that strange disease.
And about these things they say: cover that which prevents food from the illness that generates inflammation and swelling, so that the belly is inflated and extended, and the rupture is forced out of place.
We would advise this to prevent any light-hearted cause generating a severe abscess, if it does not occur; and if it does occur, then aid should be given immediately.
They also said that certain remedies should be applied to the affected area to reduce swelling and then suck out the excess fluid; it seems reasonable, yet there is fear that the swelling may push the excess fluid back into the affected area due to weakness.
They also said: cover the affected area with cloth that has been soaked in hot oil cauterization, and place powders between the ribs until it is filled, making sure the bandage conforms to the shape; and it is thus treated for illness through pleurisy of food and medicine.
And if the disease causes severe constriction that cannot be endured, and the bone is pierced with a sharp point, then fear for the disease, cover it with a bandage, uncover the broken rib, and apply pressure over that instrument that preserves the integrity, the memory of which is preceded, and cut the bone to facilitate extraction.
And it is appropriate to adjust the two lips of the wound if it is large, using surgery, and treat it with dressings until it heals.
And if there is an abscess inside, you cut it open and insert powders in olive oil and apply it over the area, so that the disease is cured from within the abscess.
And it is advisable to raise the side on which he sleeps, until it is healed.
Chapter IX.
On the restoration of the fractured spine of the back and neck.
Sometimes, the bones of the neck can be fractured and their cartilage damaged, resembling the fractures of the spine in the back. And if this happens to anyone and you want to know if it will heal or not, consider that if their muscles are already softened, stunned, and dead, and they cannot move them nor stretch them or tighten them, and when you press on them with your fingers or pierce them with a needle, they do not hurt, then you know that it will not heal, and in the same conditions, it is deadly.
And if you feel pain in the area of the fracture and pressure or piercing, then know that the inner part of the bone is safe, and the injury will heal with treatment.
And if you see the spine in the neck resembling this and want to know if it will heal, consider its weight.
When you notice that the stiffness has already been reduced, pay attention to those affected parts, and when you lie on your side, they gain flexibility and mobility according to their will; sometimes they rise up on their sides and want to urinate but cannot, then you know it is a serious condition, and therefore do not attempt to treat them.
If no cause of those occurs, the cause is better and more easily resolved.
And the treatment for it is to make incisions at the relaxation of the spine with a hot cautery or oil, or use poultices of vinegar; place that on the affected area several times a day until the pain in the cautery is relieved.
And then place a comforting and effective bandage, tighten it around that area; and order the patient to rest and maintain tranquility, and not sleep on the side where they feel pain until it is healed.
If a fracture of the leg bone or any other cause already separated from it occurs, you must cover it with a dry dressing and support that bone; and then adjust the two edges of the wound, either by suturing if it is large; and treat it with care to avoid inflammation of the wound, as long as it heals.
If the last part of the leg bone is broken and it is the end of the limb, you must then insert your left hand's thumb into the gap between the broken bones and bite down on the broken bone with your other hand as gently as possible; then apply a plaster and bandage over it if needed, and tighten it securely.
And if you feel bones broken within it, then bind them securely and support that area, and treat the wound with the appropriate treatment until it heals.
**Chapter X.**
On the restoration of the wide [or perhaps: open].
The bones of the thighs are often broken, and when they break, the fracture is nothing but communication in the extremities of those parts and are sharp at the ends and decline inward; and it causes pain to the patient at the site and piercing, and the limb is stunned when a fracture occurs.
And the restoration of it is that you place your hand over that area which is above the fracture, as the figure of it.
And if the fracture is at the extremity of it, then you should wrap that according to what you have been taught by equal experience, just as it is assembled to its natural shape.
If the fracture is in the long bone or that it already declines inward towards the parts, then you should make the patient lie on their stomach, so that you can prepare for the restoration of that fracture. And so when you have enveloped it, apply the plaster and then place a strip of wood or canvas over it, tightening firmly without fear of fracture or removal of the stitch.
And envelop the concavity with something that fills it equally as it takes on the stricture, and instruct the patient to sleep on their back or side.
If an abscess occurs cautiously, stop the extension of it and its restoration until the abscess cauterization is sedated, and apply over it what was previously mentioned; then return to the restoration of it, and tighten that thus with a cover.
And if it happens in the bones or they are broken, then you treat them.
Chapter XI.
On the restoration of the fracture of the assistant (or, possibly, 'helper').
The adjutori is what is between the thigh and the head of the shoulder.
And if it is fractured, the restoration of it is in one of two ways, of which one is to take a plane of moderate roughness as follows:
And both ends of the ligament are seen, and then it is suspended from an elevated position.
Then attend to the patient on one side; and subsequently, cast out his broken arm over a splint until it reaches the thickest part of the bone where the curvature of the bone is attached.
And subsequently, it is suspended over some heavy cause, or the doctor extends it to the parts below; and then the surgeon places his hands on the fracture, until it returns as it should.
And another method is to have the patient lie on their back and raise their head with their hands; then command two ministers: one of them holds what is above the fracture with his hands, and the other collects the pus from below; each of them extends themselves accordingly.
If you wish to increase the extent of the traction, then tighten it over the fracture with ligatures and over another ligament; each of the two ministers extends themselves in two directions.
And therefore, if the fracture is close to the extremity of the muscle, you should place the middle of the ligature on the tendon and leave the other end behind the fracture towards the elbow.
And similarly, if the fracture is near the elbow, you should place the ligature at that point and over the elbow.
Immerse that in easy water and facilitate the work, and then, when it is soaked according to its nature and applied properly, tighten it carefully if blistering does not occur.
If blistering does occur, loosen the tightness after the seventh day and place a cloth dipped in vinegar and rose oil over it to soothe the abscess, and then tighten it again.
The method of tightening is to place a plaster over the fracture, then wrap it with clean cloth, adjust the arm upon the support, and hold your hand open over its muscle.
And unfold the cloth and tighten upon the arm support to keep the arm in place, unless some other cause prevents it from moving.
And then use splints.
And it is that it rests on the fracture that steel which is placed and firm among the other steels; it rests between each steel the width of the finger, and its length according to the break plus three parts from the whole.
And then tighten the steels with the strapping mentioned at the beginning of this chapter.
And it is that the strapping on the place of the fracture should be tighter. And the further away from each other the fracture is, the less the strapping should be.
And therefore, depending on the position of the steels and the strapping as we have said in the time when you restore the member to its position, so do you act.
And if you fear gangrene, leave off the tightness and take away the bandages on the seventh day as we have said.
And thereafter, consider the dressing on all wounds for three days to prevent any further damage or inflammation; it is forbidden to eat foods that reach the member due to excessive tightness; and thus, rectify everything as we have said.
If you are certain that nothing further will occur from it, do not loosen the ligature but instead wait for three days or more.
And the patient's rest should be on their back, and their hands over their stomach.
And place a warm, woolen compress over the injured member, and consider at all times during night or day that the bandage not be loosened or dissolved, or the dressing become soft; thus, rectify it entirely with your skill.
And hold the patient's food according to the order we have mentioned before, so that the food is delicate at first until it begins to tighten; and now you will notice that the food becomes thicker in them.
The custom of the assistant and the leg support is to tighten them in 40 days, and you will notice that they loosen and should be bathed and treated with ointments that rectify this condition.
And if the fracture is slight and fresh, you will not loosen the bandage and splints for one to two months.
**Chapter XII**
**On the Restoration of Broken Arms**
The arm is composed of two bones, which are called the humerus and the radius; of these, one is smaller, and is said to be the elbow bone, while the other is larger and is placed below the small bone, extending upward.
And if the main or secondary fissure is only slightly broken, or both at once, they are seldom torn completely.
And when the small fissure above is broken, its restoration is easy, and its healing is even easier.
And when the fissure of it below is broken, its fracture is severe, and its healing is difficult.
And worse is when two bones are broken at the same time.
Therefore, if the bone that is broken is the small fissure above, it is advantageous for the doctor, as its restoration should be easy, allowing for a quick recovery before it becomes engorged.
If the large fissure is what is broken, then it must be handled with more urgency as its extension becomes more violent.
And if the two incisions are simultaneously lacerated, then be sure to press the most powerful extraction.
And be sure to place your hand in the position of restoration and extension over one cushion, with the wrist of your hand parted from it, more so than all other positions, and the tactile sense of your ear should be lower than all other senses, and the patient should be centring on a comfortable bed.
And place a cushion before them at an elevated or upright position, so that the patient does not have to exert themselves.
Then the assistant should extend their arm fully on one side with their hand free or tied, and another assistant extends theirs similarly above.
Then the doctor should align the bone within as it reduces according to the best position possible.
And if in the treatment of the bone there are obstacles, you must reduce all the pain to its place using your virtue.
And if there appears to be a separate problem that threatens the cord and does not seem hopeful for restoration, then you must perform an operation on it and preserve it according to the method we have described above.
If the fracture is severe, you have already reached this particular chapter, and therefore take care of that one.
And if an abscess occurs at the beginning of your restoration, you must line it with a cloth made of olive oil and white wax, with greater care between caution and subtlety, and tighten the cloth over that slight gap until the abscess yields; then remove the bandage and apply a plaster prepared from powdered chalk, and place stars; and let the star be placed on that fracture both more and more firmly.
And you should know that the names of the bones in the arm are visible in their proper arrangements, either in one fracture or in two fragments at the same time.
Then apply your pressure over the site of the fracture with greater force and intensity, and as the tightness around the fragments above or below the fracture increases, reduce the pressure slightly according to how much pain the patient experiences at the beginning of the chapter.
And the bandages that are wrapped around the fracture should be soft and moist, not hard or rough, and the thread used to secure them should be medium in thickness, as we have recommended.
And consider the member and its ligament over several days. And if any cause arises that requires correction, as soon as you notice a problem with the member, you should apply cold water to it until the pain subsides.
And allow the member to relax until it rests, then return the tightness.
And if the tightness is already relaxed and the bones have healed and resemble those before, then correct everything with your virtue.
And consider whether the nourishment is prevented from reaching the member due to excessive tightness, for then you must soften that slightly and allow it a few days until the nourishment reaches it, and then strengthen it.
If the patient does not experience any of the causes we have mentioned, then it is not necessary to loosen it within a few days or around those times.
And hold the patient's hand with the power of their virtue to prevent excessive movement, and make them sleep on their back.
And you know that this fracture is restored in XXX days or in XXXII days, or quickly restored in 28 days, and all of this depends on the condition of the complications and the disposition of virtue.
Chapter XIII
On the restoration of fractures of the spine and ribs.
You know that in the spine and ribs, fractures often occur along with dislocation, and these do not heal properly unless the movement is reduced.
And when there is a fracture or dislocation of the spine, you will find that the patient's condition worsens and lies in pain, and then support the spine over the affected area.
And the physician should extend the broken bones and align them in a proper position.
And then cover it with a plaster and stoppers, if you do not want to risk gangrene; and place the bandage from above according to the extent of the wound, and you have already wrapped it in linen cloth.
If the fracture is in the joints of the hand, and it appears like a thread of cloth, and you make the patient press on that fractured joint, then wrap a long strip of cloth around it tightly.
And the bandage of cloth should be in such a way that it supports the body, so that the hand is aligned with the palm; and tighten it according to need.
If the fracture is in the exterior parts, then you should place a bandage on it and another bandage on the side left in the palm, so that the hand is covered and straightened; and tighten it, as the hand is rotated to its natural position between the joints.
If a fracture occurs in one of the joints of the fingers, if it is the thumb, it should be immobilized according to its position and then tightly bound with the palm turned slightly upwards, if desired, using a small right splint to elevate the fracture and prevent further damage.
If the fracture is in other joints of the hand, just as in the middle finger, or index, or little finger, it should be immobilized with a splint on the affected digit; or all fingers can be bound together in sequence, which is better; or a small splint can be placed over it, as we have said for the thumb.
And consider, in your restoration, the order of setting bones and opposing them - with great caution during your operation - regarding what covers when any cause of those occurs, as described iteratively.
Chapter XIV.
On the restoration of the broken bone in the thigh.
The bone in the thigh moves and breaks, presenting itself in the form of swelling according to its position and the pus that forms around it.
And the restoration of it is done thus: the ligament is tightened over the fracture and another ligament is placed around the fracture, and the patient is laid on their stomach and face down.
Then the physician extends the ligament to its full length according to its quality, when the fracture is in the middle part of the bone.
If it is indicated to operate on the thigh, then the ligament should be tightened from the opposite side towards the knee joint, allowing for its extension, and another ligament placed around the fracture.
And if the fracture seems to be deeply embedded, then make the ligament proper to the joint, and extend it to the detached parts.
Then the doctor should align the bones with both hands, reducing them according to their natural appearance, and the bone is joined by a good joint; then it is necessary to cover with plaster and tension, so as not to cause necrosis of the member. If necrosis occurs in the member, then leave it for a few days until the infection has subsided, and then return to your treatment.
The tension should be done thus: it is necessary to wrap around the fracture a hard bandage, folding it two or three times, and removing the excess; then wrap the leg until it reaches the thigh and the root of the limb.
And insert a long strip of cloth between the thigh and leg close to the joint, bringing the ends of the cloth from the sides of the joint, making them superior to both parts, and then turn over the leg and thigh what is superfluous of the bandage.
And then place your hand over the thigh at the site of that fracture as well, and place one stick on the bone of the leg.
And then fill the vacuum between the thigh and leg with soft drapes, so that the constriction is coagulated.
And then commence with a strong constriction of the middle layer over the site of the fracture using three or four folds, and as you distance yourself more from the site of the fracture, your constriction should be weaker and lighter and wetter.
And then extend the two ends of the cloth to the sides until they reach the foot's ankle, and tighten both ends of the sticks from the other part so that the bandage does not move from its place.
And then apply the compression over it in such a way that it does not cause damage or gangrene or inflammation and similar conditions; and if any cause of those arises, then it is necessary to remove it from you, and correct what happens immediately, as we have mentioned previously.
If there is pain in the bone itself, then cover it with what you can obtain; if not, wrap it and remove the cause, and treat that from which the memory of the pain arises until it is healed.
And in some cases, this fracture of the thigh is so severe that it cannot be adjusted with the help of bandages, as we have mentioned regarding the aid and treatment of the arm.
However, in the restoration of it in such a manner, one should not cause the patient's disability; and if it is restored alone, then another method should be applied to the other leg, because it is necessary that the disabled leg become strong again.
And you should know that the condition is severe in 40 days or a little more or a little less, and all of this depends on the variety of complications and other dispositions.
**Chapter XV**
**On the Restoration of the Broken Rib of the Right Side**
You should know that the fracture of the rib on the right side often ends in lasting pain, frequently resulting from inflammation and stiffness.
If the fracture happens, it is not uncommon for there to be only a crack or break in the bones, which is a great cause of pain and suffering.
And the restoration is such that it should be equal to what was broken in its joints, so that it can be put together and joined as much as possible through calculation and ease of fabrication.
And then apply a plaster and press it onto that round spot, if you need to; tighten around it with a strap as appropriate.
And then consider all the dispositions that we have recommended for other fractures; take great care and act as if it were any other similar case, addressing everything that is appropriate to ensure its healing.
Chapter XVI.
On the Restoration of the Broken Leg.
Know that in the leg there are two bones, of which one is thick and is called the femur; and the other is thin and is called the tibia.
And it happens in some cases of fracture that the two bones of the arm are affected; for this reason, its restoration is similar to the restoration of the whole arm, and the operation is the same.
If two bones are broken together, the leg is completely shattered.
And if the bone is broken with a subtle crack, the leg is shattered in several places.
And if the bone is broken with a severe crack, it leaves a mark, and it's one of those causes that are not easily healed.
Then apply extensions, tension, and ligation to the stitches according to that agreement.
However, if the leg fracture is severe without any signs of improvement, the extension should be less and more gentle, and you should trust in your skill.
In the leg, there is also a cause for surgery on the arm, and when you stitch the stitches and complete the entire surgical procedure, you will take wooden splints from which the causes are removed, which are placed in places where they are left alone, and are made entirely of palm leaves; tie those to the ones that require small roughness, and be careful not to interfere with the hands, and the length of those should be according to the length of the leg, and from the inner part to the outer part.
And then wrap each drape in two layers according to its length, placing one over the leg's joint from one side and the other from the other side, ensuring they are tightly wrapped around the foot's base.
Then attach the two splints at three points on each extremity and in the middle, as this structure prevents the leg from bending at the joints, keeping it in a stable position.
And now a splint of wood should be applied according to the length of the leg, holding it in place so that it remains still and does not move.
Especially ensure that this is done in the case of a fracture, and when it is truly painful.
And then consider the leg daily, examining it closely and studying its condition through further observation; and you should keep an eye on it for any signs of separation or inflammation or other similar causes. And when any such cause arises, be prepared to treat it as necessary until healing occurs.
Chapter XVII.
On the fracture of the talus bone and the bones of the foot, and on their treatment.
The talus bone does not suffer a fracture entirely; rather, it is the bones of the foot that sometimes experience fractures; and the joints of the foot rarely suffer fractures but instead undergo deterioration due to poor condition.
If the bones of the foot do indeed fracture and those bones become dislocated from one another, then the patient should lie on their side with their foot prepared in that position as they wait.
Then place one foot over that which is elevated due to the dislocated bones, and press down on those, and squeeze them, and reduce those into their proper places.
And then apply a plaster and bandage over it, and place the foot's belly on a small table with two legs.
Then tighten that on the foot with a proper stretch, since you have wrapped it with cloths and other reasons of which you are in need.
And as the condition passes three or four days, then you loosen the ligature, since you will find the bones entwined, or broken or dislocated, and the operation on those is just as knowledgeable.
But if it is that some are broken, then restore those, and entwine those just as you have learned and repeat the restoration of said bones in your hands. And then place this broken bone straight according to the length of the finger, and slightly on one side; and place the foot on this table which is properly arranged for you, and tighten that with a proper stretch.
If the fragment torn from the bone is two or three pieces, then place your hand over each piece, wrapped in a cloth, and press the table firmly on the bottom of the foot, standing on one of the table's ends to make an incision into the sole of the foot so that it has a good grip.
And it is important that you do not forget to consider all the causes mentioned above in other fractures from accidents we have discussed; and pay attention to any accident that presents itself.
**Capitol .xviii.** (Capital XVIII) - This appears to be a reference to a chapter or section heading in the treatise, indicating a specific topic or set of instructions. Without further context from the text, it is not possible to provide a direct translation.
**On Fracture of the Condylar Femoral, Tibial, and Malean Bones** - This appears to be a heading or classification for a section discussing fractures in specific bones of the human body: the condyle of the femur (hip joint), tibial bone (shin), and malean bone (lower leg).
When the hymen of a woman is torn, then quickly place her in a sitting position with her legs slightly apart, and have someone hold her from behind.
Then the midwife will gently fill the hymen with a certain amount and make it firm in the opening of the woman's vagina as carefully as possible; then the woman is made to cough, and slowly the child's two legs are raised, so that everything comes out until the head is before the vaginal opening, and the broken bone returns into place.
Then place pillows on the back of the patient, and when they want to urinate, facilitate the process by gently pressing on the hymen, collect the urine, empty it, and return the child to their pillow in the same manner as before, then return them to their original position.
And do this for seven days or around those times, because that is when it is restored.
And if you wish, take a bladder of a sheep and stretch over the throat of the patient a cane tube; then insert the entire bladder into the cavity, and blow air through the tube until the bladder is inflated within the cavity, so that the fracture returns.
Then it should be filled with a suitable dressing and left for some days as recommended, until it is healed.
And when the bone of the thigh of a man or woman is cracked, then administer in the restoration and healing of it the same water that we have recommended for the hip bone.
And what is right should not be overlooked in these close fractures and should involve little risk, especially for those who have some knowledge and understanding of this my written work; for that fracture shows you in the best dispositions for restoring and tightening it, and therefore understand well.
When a fracture occurs in a man's leg, take a guargamela (a kind of splint) from above and place the leg in it; then wrap it with cloth, and have it wrapped and laid for three days or around that time, and it will be healed.
Chapter XIX
On the restoration of bone fractures when they are injured.
It is convenient for him who suffers a fracture, especially if the bone is large, as is the bone of the thigh or of the helper, or similar to these, that you clean and amputate it as soon as possible, if the conditions for amputation at your disposal or witnessed by others dictate it, as we have said above.
And if the infection spreads to the bone, then you must clean it with care in such a way that you retain the pus in it while you cover it with a clean cloth for three days, unless another cause prevents you from doing so.
And then begins to restore the fracture in that limb during the day, and do not prolong it, or you risk gangrene.
If gangrene should occur, be careful not to resume the restoration of it within the ninth day, until it has subsided, and do not approach it on the third, seventh, or tenth day after, for you would otherwise cause further harm.
If the bone breaks off at an exposed joint, cover it by perforating and reducing it with your hands as easily and quickly as possible.
If the extent of the fracture is beyond your own skill and the condition of it requires larger instruments, then reduce it with the tools at hand; and those tools should be made of metal, with a length of seven or eight fingers, and a width according to the amount of the injury; and for this reason, it is necessary that a doctor take several of these, depending on the amount required for the treatment in all kinds of fractures.
And it should be done with a slight roughness so that it is not easily bent during the operation.
And it should have an extremely sharp edge at its margin, and the upper part of it should be slightly curved, extending from the inside to the outside.
And this is the shape of it:
It is named in Greek as "a voluntary split lip", hence the term for a small pallet.
So that the sharp end of it is held at an elevated angle above the prominent edge of the bone.
And it should be done at once, returning the bone to its place, and secured with no further adjustments.
And so try to envelop the ends of the fracture between them, and if the end of the broken bone is thin, and you do not take the instrument with good grasp, then you must insert the end of that bone into the instrument's power.
If you are unable to reduce the bone to this point that we have recommended, then cut into it with the instrument that you have at hand from among the incision tools that we have mentioned; or saw through that with one of the saws in any way that is possible to you.
Then take hold of the one that is embedded in the bone with roughness and small splinters.
And when the bone is reduced and the patient feels intense pain, then you know that the bone has not returned to its natural place; and so do this in order to bring great relief to the patient.
When your restoration of the bone is complete and you submerse it in a black stippling vinegar, especially in summer, do not place any wax or other substance on the wound, so as to prevent putrefaction and corruption.
And then you administer staples during the final stage of bone restoration and leave the wound uncovered so that you can incise the tissue with scissors and use bandages according to the size of the wound.
And be very careful not to strain the wound towards the fracture, as you have seen foolish doctors cause this, leading to death or corrupt and putrid ailments, which is unsanitary. And if the tightness is light, soft, different from the tightness of other fractures.
And if the illness is severe or a bad one, and you are concerned about further complications that we have described, and there is pain in the area, do not press down on it; rather, wrap it with a hard cloth instead of bandages and tighten it around those parts.
And when, after one or two days, the illness begins to manifest in the legs, remove the cloth you had placed over them, and then administer something—we usually use a mixture of four ingredients that is known to be effective against such ailments, similar to this.
It is also necessary for you to cleanse the wound and assess the illness each morning and evening until it is consolidated and healed, ensuring that the member is prepared in such a way that the pus can drain from it easily.
If the illness persists for many days and is not consolidated or the pus does not drain from the leg, then you should know that here are only temporary remedies to prevent the illness from spreading further. And from those remedies, separate those that are removed and extracted, those that are not separated and place the member, causing pain to occur, pierce yourself to incise those according to what is possible for you.
If you encounter a wound that is infected or gangrenous, it is stenosed, or another type of corruption and putrefaction, then know that you must apply to each of these what suits them for the cure, which is preceded by a narration in its chapter.
And regarding what I should say and you present your case: when the flesh is broken, protrudes over the member along with the bones of the thigh and its helpers, resembling those of the larger members, and do not attempt to attract it or extract it, as you may cause death through these attempts; leave it be until it can heal on its own, for strong decay may occur within 2-3 days; and treat the wound if you have seen it, but leave it be if not.
**Capital .xx.**
Regarding the treatment of a hernia that occurs in the aftermath of a fracture.
Various complications can occur with this hernia following the healing of a fracture, especially near the joints, and it distorts the shape of the affected member; thus, it hinders the member from performing its natural functions.
If the hernia is recent, consider administering those medicines that have been proven effective, such as aloes, senna, and other similar ones; take some or all of these, and apply those with a stinging quality, or white honey, or bitter vinegar, and press them onto the hernia in a moist state, and constrict it firmly.
And do not remove the pressure for several days; then loosen it and apply another treatment, as long as the hernia remains; or wrap a thin sheet of lead around it, because lead has the property of reducing any swelling in the members.
If it is already agreed upon and the necessity requires cutting that away from its original position, then split it by the most superior part, cut off the superfluous and prominent, or quickly remove that until it is healed again; and tend to that as long as it is cured.
It appears you've provided a chapter title or identifier, "Capitol .xxi." Without the actual text following this header, I cannot offer a translation or interpretation. Please provide the text that follows "Capitol .xxi." for me to assist you further.
On the restoration of fractures: Once healed, and appropriate attention given to the delicate and frail member, it returns to its natural state.
When a bone fracture is healed, and the delicate member restored to its natural state, it should not be subjected to any harmful causes: among which one is excessive solution of the ligaments and bindings, or excessive tightness of the ligaments preventing proper nutrition to the member; or an excessive accumulation of impurities; or excessive movement at inappropriate times; or weakness of the blood vessels in the affected area due to the illness, and its overall debility.
And the treatment for this is to restrict the patient's diet and make their heart tender while the pain multiplies within them; administer baths; and apply heat and pleasure to them.
Then apply pressure over the member, so that the pressure draws the mot nutritious fluid to it, or continue washing with lukewarm water until the nutrition flows and returns to its natural form.
Chapter XXII.
Regarding the healing of broken bones when they are restored crookedly and surgery is forbidden from them, covering.
When an accident occurs with a member already restored, the healing of it from crookedness and misalignment of the broken bone should be prioritized; the shape of the member is corrected, but nevertheless, the member is not prohibited from its natural operation, as long as you receive the opinion of someone who knows that member has been newly fractured.
Many times, one sees foolish doctors and healers who have practiced this in our land; and this operation is most shameful, causing great fear of the sign of which it is mortal.
If the recent weakness and stiffness are due to inflammation in water containing soothing herbs, such as alder bark and roots, and melilot, similar to those used in traditional medicine, then apply a compress with a mollifying plaster mixed with good oil; or take a thick mucilage of alder bark and apply it in layers with a gauze made from pigeon droppings or olive oil, and cover it with the plaster; or use fig leaves that have been dried and twisted into threads, similar to those used in certain medical treatments known as consolidants.
Sometimes, it is dissolved with gentle friction against the most moist parts, and the affected member should be moved regularly throughout the day.
When deformity has already advanced and it is strong and curved into a stone-like state, requiring treatment with iron, then it should be noted that the pus on top has disappeared and the continuation of the bone has been dissolved, and it is incised where superfluous matter from this joint meets the bone using delicate bone scissors, and ease is administered to that which is excessively stressed by this condition.
Chapter XXIII.
On Dislocation.
Dislocation is the displacement of one of the body's joints, preventing movement and distorting the shape of the limb, causing severe pain and significant damage to the patient.
Therefore, when a dislocation occurs, it should be reduced as soon as possible, and not delayed, for if it is tardy, the location becomes stiff and the reduction of the dislocation becomes difficult.
And for this reason, one should not be stretched or moved excessively during the appointment, as sudden movements cause spasms and pain in the joints.
If this occurs, you will notice that you need to perform a flabotomy on the patient, and then place something warm between their thighs to relax the aperture; and then immerse the affected member in warm water and oil, and reduce it gently.
And all members should be treated with the water, and then the memory of it will return to its proper place.
And you have already arranged the caps of displacement as previously mentioned in the fracture; from the departure of the upper body to the lower part.
Chapter .XXIIII.
On the treatment of mandible dislocation, let us speak.
When both mandibles are dislocated due to inadequate treatment or slight movement, they may be slightly displaced and softened; or they may be completely dislocated with a complete tear of the joint, resulting in excessive salivation from the injury, preventing them from opening their mouth, and their tongue is wrapped around itself.
If the dislocation is slight, it may return to its proper position on its own with minimal cause.
If the dislocation is complete and severe, it is necessary to immediately administer a reduction of the dislocated bone without delay.
And the practitioner should have a firm grasp of the patient's condition, and the doctor should insert his thumb into the dislocation of the jaw within the patient's mouth if the dislocation is on one side; or he should insert both thumbs simultaneously if the dislocation is on both sides, and all other fingers should be outside, which engage each other; and he commands the patient to cease moving their jaws and to relax them so that they return to their proper position.
And if the reduction is difficult, especially when both mandibles are dislocated, then apply evaporation with hot water and oil until a gentle reduction of both is achieved without delay, as we have said.
And therefore when they are returned and positioned correctly, and the opening of the hernia is closed and not relaxed, then apply a layer of gauze soaked in rosin and wax; and soon the ligaments will become easier.
And have the patient lie on their back, with their head positioned between two pillows, so that they do not tilt to either side; and do not force them to eat anything; give them a mild diet, until the pains subside and the mandibles are relaxed, then let them eat what they wish.
And have them drink and eat easily, without forcing their jaws open, as long as the mandibles are relaxed and healed.
And if the reduction of two jaws is difficult when they are dislocated and not restored to their places, then fever and continuous vomiting occur, and the patient's belly is severely strained and he vomits pure cholera.
And when you see this, you will know that it is a loss; and often times, the patient dies within a few days of this occurrence.
Chapter XXV
On the reduction of the dislocation of the fork (clavicle) and the extremity of the muscle.
The fork (clavicle) is not displaced from the shoulder inward due to its connection with the leg; however, sometimes it is displaced outward, and this is indicated by sensation.
And the restoration of it is that the patient seeks relief on their legs and extends their arms. And then constrict the area with your palm strongly, so it returns.
And then press upon that compress and poultice, strengthening it.
Place the end of that which is dried on the thigh, and continue it to that, so it is not dislocated in any day; then cover that it be reduced and enveloped as we have said, and according to what your equipment allows.
And then press upon that compress, and poultice, and restraint, and command the patient to adhere to tranquility and rest until it is healed.
And with this treatment, cure is achieved when the end of the muscle is reduced and returned to its place.
Chapter .XXVI.
On the reduction of a dislocated muscle.
You know that a muscle is not dislocated except in three ways, of which one is when it is detached from its attachment on one side.
And the second is that it is dislocated from its attachment above the muscle, and this is done carefully; it is not dislocated from behind by the shoulder; and it is not dislocated in front by the nerves.
And it is most commonly dislocated and comes out from its attachment on the inner side after the tendon, especially in those where there is little flesh, it is slightly dislocated; but in those where there is much flesh, it comes out with difficulty.
And often it happens to certain men through a blow or fall that the muscle becomes inflamed and swollen from the sudden spasm, and is dislocated by what has already been displaced.
Now, as you realize this while you are overexerted from it, you will proceed with the treatment for its cure.
And the dislocation of the muscle is known when it occurs in places where you should not touch; so that you distinguish between the dislocated muscle and the healthy one, as you find different manifestations between them; and you find in the head of the muscle a hollow place and leave the titillic after touching the head of the muscle just like a finger, and the patient cannot return his hand to its normal position nor move it without pain.
If it is dislocated in the foot or ankle, and you find obvious touch sensitivity, and it is not covered.
And from this dislocation, light reduction is made when it is fresh and the injury is recent.
And the reduction of it is that the attending physician raises the patient's hand over their head; then he places ties beneath the patient, holding the joint firm in its place, and the physician raises the patient's hand and extends it; then he leaves it there so that it returns more lightly.
If, however, what we have said does not lead to a return to health, and considering the onset of the dislocation, several days later it is necessary to wash the malady in hot water and administer remedies that soften and relax the affected parts as if they were cut with fennel, fenugreek, and melilot in water, and these should be administered.
Then the patient should be placed on their back and rested with the affected area between levitation and tension; the physician then places his hand over the area of hope, raises the head of the muscle vertically, and pulls the patient's hand away so that it is no longer painful to move the joints; another assistant holds the patient's head to prevent pain in the joints, as soon as it returns to its place.
And if you wish, reduce the second in this manner: so that you cause a man who is taller than the hernia to be present, and he stands on the opposite side of the hernia, and inserts his muscle between the hernia's tickle and lifts the tickle of it upwards towards the openings above, until the hernia is suspended in the air, and another assists in pulling the hernia from the openings below his abdomen. If the hernia is small, then find what else might be causing it to protrude, so that you correct that, for otherwise the displacement will return soon enough.
And it can also be reduced in this other manner: take a long stick with the head of it shaped like a mortar, neither too thick nor too thin, and place it below the hernia; so that as you drape lions' hair over the top of the stick, the hernia rests according to the length of the stick, and stretch your hand towards the other side, extending it to the other part with strength, for the joint will return to its place at great speed.
And if the reduction is difficult due to all the causes we have mentioned, use this treatment: take a stick, its length should be about two arms' span wide and four fingers thick, and shape it according to this form:
Then, cover the head with linen cloths to prevent the stick from causing further harm.
Then, pause and place the stick under the patient's chest, extending your hand or arm over it, and wrap the stick around the helper's arm and the end of your hand.
Then, pause your arm on a scale at the appropriate width, extending your hand towards the opening, and suspend the other side from the opposite end, so that the joint is stretched slightly.
And when the treatment of the patient is completed according to any manner that is within your power, and you perceive that you have stopped the titillating sensation of itching with an adequate amount of wool; then apply a paste prepared from powder of wheat and egg albumen over all the muscle, so that it is thoroughly mixed, and tighten the titillating sensation by gentle compression; let the dressing be placed over the paste, and attach the patient's hand to the collar of the bandage, and leave it for seven days.
And be sure to restrict the patient's diet to light foods, as long as the affected member is comfortable, as it aids in the healing process.
Then provide more substantial food after seven or five days, and ensure the patient moves around; if there is no pain or discomfort, then healing has occurred.
If the joint is dislocated due to humidity or any other cause, be sure to administer a cautery with three parts, as described in the chapter on cauteries.
And if all this is done and after five days the ligament and joint are not healed, and the plaster and compression are reduced on him several times, but it does not heal and he cannot raise that arm to its original position, then know that the nerves of it, which are at the head of the muscle, are already damaged or stretched or softened, and know that the joint will never remain in its place.
In the case of dislocation, you must first reduce the foot and ankle or the joints behind, using pressure and extension to the muscles, until it returns to its natural position.
And the same compression should be applied to the other affected area, treating it until it is healed.
And if the healing process becomes critical in the affected member and there is delay in its movement, then the disease uses numerous baths several times until that gravity is alleviated and returns to its original state.
Chapter .xxvii.
On the treatment of dislocated hips.
You know that the hip joint is dislocated with difficulty and seemingly returns to its place with difficulty; it is dislocated completely, particularly at the front part as opposed to the rear part, and the dislocation of it does not hide itself from your view or touch, according to the figure by which it is dislocated. When you adjust the dislocated hip joint back in place, this becomes clearly evident, because the joint is concave and cannot bend the arm or touch its muscle.
And be aware that you should carefully reduce the dislocation as soon as it reaches an aposteme (a stage of inflammation), because if you allow it to reach this state, it is difficult to cure it, and strong remedies are needed. Especially when it occurs at the rear parts, for it is worse than all other kinds of dislocations, causing great pain and sometimes even death.
And for the restoration of it, when it is possible to reduce, his hand should be extended towards two more, and his arms expanded, and the rest of the doctor's attention should be on the thigh and knee, pushing the joint with the thumbs of both hands until it returns to its place.
If the dislocation is in the front parts, then return it by bending his hand with his other hand, striking the knee with the thumb of his palm.
And if the dislocation does not obey to reduction, then apply violent extension and strong motion.
And it is that two assistants extend the arm, and they hold this view of two assistants each, so that the extension is not hindered.
Then turn the arm completely around, as it is wrapped with a long folded cloth over his hand, or ligament.
And when the doctor touches the joint with his hand, he applies some oil to it in order that it may remove those causes which help in the lubrication of the joint and facilitate its return.
And then the reduction of the hernia should be placed over the paste in which there is tightness and the application of white of egg, it should be extracted with relaxation and the arm should be suspended from the collarbone and left for a few days.
And it should be loosened; and therefore if the joint is formed in its place, you loosen the ligament of it and leave that.
And if you see that the joint is not being stretched, you should reapply the plaster and ligament, and leave it for a few days until it is extracted; and then you should loosen it.
If it occurs due to gravity during the reduction of a joint, and its disposition is in movement, then administer moisture in a bath and gentle friction, and compression, as long as it alleviates; or rest on the affected joint, if it's a case of excessive motion; and apply binding, keeping that over the bone by day and night. And then bind that and immerse it in a bath; when it becomes loose, rub the joint with warm friction, repeating over it as many times as necessary, until it stops being painful due to motion. in the immersion of water, until it is calm.
And if you wish, place a hot, moist compress on the split of the cow and press firmly over it; do this several times, as that part is wet and returns to its position.
Chapter .xxviii.
On the treatment of dislocation of the shoulder, which is at the joint between the arm and hand.
In cases where the hand's joint is dislocated, its reduction is delicate, unlike other joints, but it is essential to act swiftly during the reduction when the joint is dislocated, ensuring that the location is not exposed to further damage or inflammation.
And the reduction of the dislocated joint involves placing the patient's hand on a table and extending their arm, while the doctor applies pressure with their hand or palm over the joint, pushing it back to its place.
However, it is important to consider whether the palm has already been applied to the patient's stomach, in which case the patient should place their back on a table for extension and reduction; if the dislocation occurred before the palm was applied to the back of the hand, then the patient's arm should be positioned intrinsically on the table, allowing the doctor's hand to act upon the joint's proximity.
And so if it returns quickly, that is good; otherwise, tighten the bandage around the hernia and leave it be; do not delay, for if you do, the pain will increase and you will not be able to reduce it as the days go by.
However, the joint may be bent according to its natural curvature; it does not indicate any illness, but rather that the hand is relaxed and cannot grasp anything; then you will know that the nerves are crushed or stretched, and in this case, only a cautery near the affected area can reduce it, and it provides great relief.
Therefore, when the pain returns, apply the bandage we have readjusted and leave it in place for several days; then loosen and reapply it and exercise your hand on it.
If the movement of it is stopped and a severe pain occurs, then apply water to the affected area and friction several times until it is relieved.
Chapter .xxix.
On the treatment of dislocated joints.
Sometimes, joints are completely dislocated.
And when a finger is dislocated, either at the base of the thumb or on the palm or abdomen, you must pull the finger and apply pressure to reduce it, until it returns to its place.
Then support the end of the finger, suspend the affected part, and leave it for two days.
Then suspend it and extend it until it is completely healed on that day.
And when night comes, following that second account, do not stop disengaging it during the day and practicing movements, and apply it at night; do this for several days until it is tight.
And if it is displaced in the mother's womb, hold it as such and apply this to the first operation of tying it, until it is healed.
And similarly, apply this when it is displaced in other parts.
**Chapter XXX.**
**On the Treatment of Dislocated Spinal Vertebrae.**
When a dislocation occurs in any of the spinal vertebrae of the back or neck, and they are reduced to their proper places, but remain somewhat shaken, then it is not a complete cure, for death may result from the injury.
And the sign of this is that the expulsion of the malady is against their will, and they cannot retain it; often certain members of the body become mollified, or both legs, or both arms, or one of these; or a spine is dislocated from its place, often times it is dislocated and often times removal of these to four parts is accomplished.
Therefore, when it is dislocated at the rear parts, it is called stiffening.
The treatment for it is that you consider whether the stiffening occurs from childhood, because in such cases there is neither cure nor complete healing for it.
In cases where you see it from accident or impact or similar causes, the ancients have described lengthy methods of treatment, some of which are beneficial; however, I have already been brief about that from which little excuse can be made due to its extreme nature, through my proximity to understanding, to which I have exposed and formed myself using various instruments for this purpose, which I will now demonstrate and spread widely.
And for those, it is not cured but what occurs in the back itself due to that which you have mentioned.
And it is that the patient's condition has spread across their face, pressing equally against the wall, and has extended below them causing great pain so that their foot cannot be moved.
Then place a straight stick directly beneath them, pressing into the ground at the foot's end around their head, and another stick on the other side of their foot.
The minister holds the stick, but it is not fixed in a pit; and another minister holds the other according to that form.
And then cover the patient's head and let the thick limbs lie firmly; extend the end of the limb to the foot which is the head of it, and tie that to it; tighten the other ligament over the hips of the patient, covering their buttocks, and make the legs fit into the stocks; and adjust all the ligaments and tie those to the other foot which is beneath the patient's feet.
Then the minister should stretch the limb at the joint of the foot, and the limbs and ligaments in their places where they are attached, but not so tightly as we have said.
And the doctor places his palms on the spine with strength while he waits for it to return, or he may rest on a table, and then adjusts the patient's feet on the table until recovery.
If recovery does not come about in this way, then take a table whose width or length is three arms' lengths, and dig into the wall of which we said that it is closest to where the patient's affliction lies. And then place the weight of the table on the spine, and the doctor places his feet on the other extremity, pressing firmly until the spine is compressed and returns to its place.
And if you wish, open it again with your hand; and since you stand on the ground, hold the patient's head in the back of each fist, their length being about a arm's length, and hold their head firmly in the back of each fist, too, so that there is no further harm.
And make another fist where the turn is, and twist it in both directions of the two fists.
And at the end of each fist is a notch where the turn is made, the length of which is equal to a palm where it is twisted; and in both other fists it is similar to that one.
And then tighten the ligaments that you have straightened on the foot of the patient in the wound from which he suffers most, and the ligaments that you have strained on his thighs in the turn where they are attached to his feet.
Then apply to each turn and place a minister who twists the turn with his hand, and the doctor bends the spine as we have said.
Then, having returned the spine to its place and secured it, apply a dry poultice of flour over it, and cover; then place on top of the poultice a lint-covered board whose width is about three times the affected area and its length covers the part of the spine.
And then use the ligaments as we have said, and employ subtle nutrition to aid in healing.
And if any signs of recurrence appear in the area at the end of treatment, it is necessary to administer medicines that soften and cleanse the application of the table for a long time, which we have recommended; and this is already being administered in that place a layer of lead.
And in some cases, there occurs imminence at the end of the spine of the back, and it is caused by that dislocation; and it is this bone which you should be particularly careful about, because if medicine is not administered to it promptly, it will cause certain death.
Chapter XXXI.
On the treatment of a dislocated hip.
You know that the joint of the hip and the joint of the muscle should not be dislocated so much, and it does not happen to those who suffer from other joints with small removal and curvature.
And the joint of the hip is dislocated in four manners, for it can be dislocated inwardly, outwardly, forwardly, or backwardly.
And it is most commonly dislocated inwardly, and rarely forwardly or backwardly.
The sign of the dislocation inwards is when, upon adjusting the patient's leg to the healthy side, the diseased side becomes longer and more prominent than the healthy one, and the patient cannot bend their foot towards the diseased side, and this is the location where the post-traumatic cautery becomes inflamed, so that the head of the bone has already been damaged here.
The sign of the condition in which dislocation occurs outwardly is that the accidents of the leg are opposed to this accident.
And when dislocation occurs in the joints in front, it expands its leg according to its full extent, but nevertheless does not bend the pain that is in the knee, and if it pierces to go and cannot return to the joints in front; then the urine of the patient is retained and the swelling of the knee is inflamed, and you must move the patient's leg on the bed.
And the sign of one who experiences dislocation in the joints behind is that they do not expand the affected leg, nor can they bend it where it doubles over; and the patient's leg becomes shorter than the other, the swelling softens, and the top of the joint turns to that location.
However, the reduction of this dislocation is that you consider, when the dislocation is old and ancient, it has already been reduced by itself or through your treatment according to its position, then it is not in need of further cure; and thus it is not appropriate to make any additional projections.
Place in that case where the dislocation is recent, and it is one of the four types of dislocation, then cut to this that you return the joint and extend it within and without, and turn it to the right and left, for thus it returns strongly and does not need other care.
If it does not return in this manner, then prepare a strong support and extend the patient's leg from the joint below, or use a bandage, or a tightening device placed over the leg; another minister should extend your hand from above onto the patient's thigh; and yet another should hold the end of the bandage.
And extend the leg or the inner part to angle the joint of the fork, or the back part to the front of the spine.
And make the extension of all these at once, as long as the patient's illness is raised to their upper body and the legs hang down.
And this specific type of extension is particularly suitable for all four (body parts).
And so if the dislocation returns to what we have said, it will be good; otherwise, it will be necessary to use all sorts of things for its treatment.
In the reduction of the hernia, when it is dislocated and the dislocation is within the folds, the patient should be placed on their side; then, one should pull the intestines back to their original position in the area between the root of the fold and the place where the hernia protrudes; and finally, extend the ligament from the part that angers (or narrows) up to the highest point of the fork (of the bones).
Then apply another strong pressure on the hernia, press the thick part of the affected area, and extend it outside with a forceful extension, so that it returns to its place.
And this specific type of treatment is for the lighter cure by which this member is returned to its original state compared to other types.
If it is excised from you and you do not follow the treatment of this specific type of cure at all, then know that both feet of the patient must be bound together with a strong, light ligature on both the toes and both the heels.
And the length of each part should be such that it is four times the thickness of one, and the patient's leg should be extended more than the other by a difference of two times its thickness.
Then the hernia should be suspended over the top of the leg, and it should be in the lower part; and the length of it should be from the ground two arms' lengths.
Then command a strong young person to cut off the top of the hernia, and suspend it from another young person, while another young person reduces the hernia with firm pressure, so that the joint returns to its place at speed.
During the proper reduction, when there is a dislocation in the joint that has come out, it is necessary to keep the patient immobile on their side according to what we have recommended regarding the immobility of the affected limb; and tighten the ligament on the injured thigh specifically and on their leg.
And then two sticks should be placed as supports, one on the patient's feet and the other on their head; and the sticks should be properly adjusted at the midpoint of the affected leg, over which damp cloths are wrapped, so that the hernia is not damaged by the stick between the thighs, so you must prevent any stretching to the parts left open.
And then each minister should extend their part, and the doctor with his hand completes the reduction according to the art (or method).
And when the dislocation is in the front parts, you should ensure that the leg is extended slightly, and according to this method, the doctor places the palm of his right hand on the affected limb, then with his other hand, he applies pressure to that extension, and maintains that position until the dislocated part returns to its place.
And if the dislocation is in the back parts, you should not extend the patient on their side, but elevate them slightly above the ground; once you have ensured that they are resting on a firm surface, just as we said about the placement of the body on two parts, and that their face and limbs are extended, as we mentioned previously, there is no further harm.
And it is necessary to apply compression with a splint on the area where the joint is dislocated.
Therefore, when the reduction is complete according to need — and the sign of the reduction of the hernia is not hidden from you, since you extend two legs from the patient and when you see those folds and the patient extrudes their leg and expands that as an excuse, then you know that the member according to need has returned — and then you adjust two things and place a plaster and external bandage so that the opening is not widened in any of the parts; and keep the patient at rest for three days or four.
Then carefully remove the ligature and plaster, and compare one leg to the other.
Now, if you see those folds in appearance, then you will know that the dislocation is already healed, and therefore release the patient from rest.
And if you see any cause for softening, then return and plaster that, and remove that according to your original stretch, and release that in three days.
And then gradually dislodge it, causing the patient to walk slowly on some surface for a few days, until it is healed.
**Capitol .xxxii.**
On the treatment of a dislocated joint.
The joint is dislocated in three ways: when it is displaced outwardly, inwardly, or to the sides, and not forward.
And the sign of a dislocated joint is that you command the patient to apply pressure with their leg on the affected area; then you will know that the joint is dislocated.
And the restoration of the joint in all ways is to make the patient cease pressure, if possible; place their back against something, and rest their foot between their legs; then grasp the dislocated joint with your palms, and press them together over the joint until it returns to its place.
And the sign of its healing is that its leg adheres to the thigh in a non-painful manner.
Then apply a plaster to the leg so that it sticks to the thigh, and then bind those parts with a bandage for three days or four, and then remove the bandage.
And do not use the patient's mobility for a few days, as long as they are healed and comfortable.
If the reduction of the hernia at hand is not possible, then administer a strong extension to the treatments mentioned in the preceding description of cure.
**Chapter .XXXIII.**
**On the Treatment of Ankle Dislocation**
The foot, at times, is dislocated either entirely within or entirely outside the joint, and this dislocation can be treated internally or externally.
And the sign of the dislocation is that the foot appears swollen, proceeding towards the joint where it is dislocated.
The treatment for the dislocation is of gentle reduction, and it should be extended to facilitate the joint's movement and then gently pulled back into place.
However, in the case of a complete dislocation, you must immediately cease the patient's movement and have them hold a strong and steady position behind their back at the middle of the affected joint.
Then with your right hand, gently lift the foot from the dominant side, and with your left hand, support the lower part of the foot in the area of the ankle.
And then pull the foot towards you with your right hand, and with your left, for two movements, extend it; and push the toe of the foot with your right hand against the bed frame as you work.
And do this twice as we have counted.
And on the third movement, push the toe of the foot towards the bed frame, and you are at the ankle.
So if you return in one movement or two according to this manner, and turn the foot inside out, that is good; otherwise, continue the operation over it again, as that returns.
If you are unable to reduce it in this way that we have recommended, then make the patient lie on their back on the ground, and stretch a piece of cloth firmly over them, and compress between their thighs, and you have already wrapped them in a blanket so that they do not become cold.
And then the surgeon should take hold of the patient's legs, and another minister extend the foot according to its joints or ligatures that lie on the collar of the foot; and another minister should extend each of these ministers against the extension of his part, and the padding between the space of the sick person should retain this, so that the work of him is not pulled from the parts left beyond his extension.
Then the doctor should dislocate it with his hands, and another minister should hold the healthy part on the opposite side, so that the dislocation returns to its ease.
And when the dislocation returns and it is declared that the reduction is healthy, then apply a plaster and reinforce those ligatures strongly, and tie the foot with ligature to the leg.
And be careful of the nerves that are behind on the sole, so that the ligature on that is not tense and does not hurt it strongly.
And then leave it for two days or three; and if the inflammation subsides, remove that.
And on the third day or the fourth, remove that; and forbid the patient from moving for ten days. If, against the rules, one has to move before that space is completely healed, it's not without risk that the dislocation will be worsened and left untreated, which can lead to permanent damage.
And if the infection occurs through a cut, then apply that which we have previously mentioned regarding treatment and dressing, in place of healing and moisture, until it is completely healed.
Chapter .xxxiiii. (Note: The missing content seems to be a continuation of the medical treatise, given the context.)
On the treatment of dislocation of foot joints.
For those who have a dislocation, it should be pulled with a little extension; and for one that is not difficult, it should be quickly reduced.
If the dislocation is in any of the three joints of the foot, you should then make the patient lie down with their foot elevated either on the ground or on a table, and keep it that way as if they were walking.
And then you should place your foot on it, and press the sole of your foot on the affected area to prevent any further dislocation, and apply pressure until the joint returns to its original position, ensuring that it is no longer out of place in the prominent area.
Then place a board under the patient's foot that supports the entire sole, which has two ends, and tighten it with a suitable and firm structure for three days; afterward, remove it and allow the patient to walk normally for several days until healing is complete and assured.
Chapter .xxxv.
On the types of dislocations that occur due to disease, fracture, or any other cause.
When any of those causes occurs, and you take up the task of healing it and restoring it, you may often see instances of complications leading to death.
And for this, it is not enough to presume over the healing of it, but rather he who is skilled in the art, with great experience, mercy, and compassion, slowly, neither hasty nor presumptuous; and that he uses only gentle medicines that do not cause side effects, leaving the diagnosis to divine judgment, except for those cases where you hope for salvation from destruction, alleviation of suffering, and in which there appears some hope. And therefore, strive as much as possible to reduce it from the beginning of the cause, before resorting to side effects.
And then, if the member returns to its proper place, administer treatment with a gentle cautery and care for the wound using appropriate drying poultices.
And if dislocation occurs as a fracture and the bones are separated, then you should perforate their joints, and do as we have said in simple ailments of this kind that come before in these places.
And be vigilant and avoid, according to your virtue, the instrument in the ways of fear as it is preceded by my instruction; for this is better for you to your Creator, more permanent to your glory, and brings greater health to your true body in its proper time. Thus ends the words of Albucasim perfectly, of which God be blessed. Amen.
