Chapter 6:
Restoration of a shoulder fracture.
The shoulder blade is broken in its central part and not in the margins but the edges.
So, when the fracture is in the middle of the blade and is only detectable by touch, you must prepare and reduce it according to the natural shape in every way possible.
Then, place on the area powdered flour with egg white and wool; then place a folded cloth; and then place a thin wooden splint according to the size of the shoulder blade or slightly more.
But if there is a concavity under the splint in any part of the shoulder blade, then fill that concavity with wool and adjust the splint accordingly.
Then tighten with a long bandage with appropriate constriction and firmness of the splint so it does not move from its place.
Check the bandaging every day; whenever it becomes loose, re-bandage and tighten it and adjust the splint if it has moved.
Make the patient lie on their healthy side.
The shoulder blade will be restored in 20 or 25 days.
When this time is completed, then remove the bandaging, knowing that the shoulder blade is one of those bones whose healing is not feared nor its dissolution.
And if any piece of bone protrudes and pricks under the skin, then cut over it, remove it, and treat as we have mentioned in the fracture of the collarbone if this condition occurs.
