After I have completed for you, my Sons, this book, which is the last in science of medicine with its complement, and have brought to an end therein according to his exposition and his own declarations, it has seemed meet to me to complete it for you together with this Treatise which is a part of operation, that is, surgery with the hand.
Since the operation with the hand lies in our region and time, completely private until perhaps the science of it perished and its trace was cut off, leaving nothing but precise descriptions in ancient books, which were altered by hands; and errors and hesitation occurred until his intentions were closed and his course extended. It has seemed meet to me to vivify it with the arrangement of this Treatise concerning it according to the position and declaration and abbreviation. And to obtain forgiveness with the forms of the cautery and other instruments of the operation: which is done by addition from the declaration and by hastening what is necessary.
The cause why a good artisan with his hand is not found in our time is: because the art of medicine is long, and it is necessary for the author thereof to exercise himself before that in the science of anatomy, as Galen narrates, until he knows the supports of the members, their forms, their conjunctions, and separations, and has knowledge of bones, nerves, sinews, and their number, and their emergence, and veins, their pulsatile and quiet states, and the places of their exit.
And for that reason Hippocrates said, "Name without knowledge is much, and name without work is little, especially in the art of the hand.
We have indeed already spoken of that in the introduction to this book.
Since he who is not aware of what we have said concerning anatomy will not profit, but will rather fall into error, which leads to the harm of men: as I have seen many among those who are trained in this science and boast of it without knowledge and without experience.
For I have seen a stupid physician cut into a scrofulous abscess on a woman's neck, and he incised certain arteries in the neck: wherefore the woman's blood flowed until she died in his hands.
And I have seen another physician who attempted to extract a stone from a man who had one form the age of stones were large.
He therefore approached him and extracted the stone along with a piece of the bladder.
Wherefore the man died on the third day.
And I myself had indeed been called to extract the stone: and I saw from the size of the stone and the condition of the patient that he would die.
And I have seen another physician who received a fee from one of our Dukes for his medical services: and it happened to the black eunuch who was with him that he suffered a fracture near the heel in his thigh bone: and the physician, with his ignorance, hastened and bound the fracture over the wound with bandages and strong splints, and did not release the wound from its constriction.
Then he discharged him according to his desires.
Afterwards he discharged him after a few days, and commanded him not to loosen the bandage: and he stood thus until the abscess on his thigh and foot burst, and he came to destruction.
I was therefore called to him, and hastened to untie the ligament; and there ensued tranquility, and he escaped from his pains.
Truly, the corruption was now confirmed in the member, and I could not arrest it.
Therefore, the corruption ceased to wander through the member, until it perished.
And I saw another physician who pierced the cancerous abscess: and it became ulcerated after a few days, until the wickedness of it increased with its lord.
Which is because when a cancer is pure from melancholic humour, then it should not be reached with iron at all, unless it is in a part that can tolerate it, so that the entire thing may be cut off.
And for this reason, my Son, you must know that the operation with the hand is divided into two parts: namely, the operation associated with safety; and the operation with which danger is present in many dispositions. And I have already excited in every place of this book where an operation is performed that involves terror and fear.
Therefore, you must beware of this and dismiss it, so that the foolish may not find a way to speak about it and dishonor it.
Therefore, receive the measure with solicitude and protection, and your sick with facility and firmness, and use the better way leading through the grace of God to salvation and a worthy succession: and dismiss terrible diseases that are difficult to cure: and lift your souls from what makes you fear, that hesitation may not enter upon you in your faith and well-being. For it is more enduring for your glory, and higher in this world, and finally for your quantities.
Galenus has already said this in some of his admonitions. You shall not treat evil disease: lest you be called a physician of evil.

Albucasis's Surgical Treatise.
Part I.
On the Use and Harm of the Cautery: for which complexions it is suitable, and at what time: whether with iron or gold.
Head I.
But First Before I recall the operation with him, I must say of the quality of his horses, and of its injuries: and in what complexion it is presented.
I say that the discourse concerning the quality of Cauterius' horse and its injuries is a lengthy and subtle science, and a hidden secret.
And a multitude of wise men spoke on this matter, and disagreed. And I find their words insufficient for me, fearing the length.
I say that Cauterius applies his remedy universally to all complexions, which are either with matter or without matter: except for two complexions, which are the hot complexion without matter, and the dry complexion without matter.
In the hot and dry complexion with matter, they disagreed.
For some said that Cauterius is beneficial in the hot and dry complexion with matter.
And others said the opposite, namely that Cauterius is not appropriate in illness arising from heat and dryness: for the nature of fire is heat, and it is inappropriate to heal with something hot and dry when the condition is already hot and dry.
And he who says the opposite said: that through Cauterius, benefit is derived in every hot and dry illness that occurs in human bodies: for when you compare the human body and its humours to the complexion of fire, you find the human body to be cold.
And I say through his words: for by experience I have often detected this.
Verumtamen non oportet, ut ueniat super illud, nisi qui iam probatus est, et exercitatus in capitulo Cauterii exercitio ultimo, et cognouit diuersitatem complexionum hominum, et dispositionem aegritudinum in seipsis, et caussas earum, et accidentia ipsarum, et spacium temporis earum.
Ex reliquis autem complexionibus non est super uos timor: et praecipue in aegritudinibus frigidis et humidis. Iam enim conuenerunt omnes medici super eas: et non dissenserunt in iuuamento cum Cauterio in eis.
Et scitote filii, quod ex secreto curationis per Cauterium cum igne, et bonitate eius super Cauterium cum medicina comburente est: quoniam ignis est simplex, cuius actio non peruenit, nisi ad membrum quod cauterizatur: et non nocet membro alio coniuncto cum eo, nisi nocumento paruo.
Medicinae uero comburentis actio peruenit ad illud quod elongatur ex membris: et fortasse facit accidere in membro aegritudinem difficilis sanationis, et fortasse interficit.
Ignis autem propter subtilitatem suam et bonitatem substantiae suae, non facit illud, nisi superfluat.
Iam uero innotuit nobis illud per experimentum, propter longitudinem seruitutis et studii cum arte, et stationem super veritatem rerum: et propter illud excusor a longitudine sermonis.
And you shall know, O sons, that they disagree on the time when it is fitting to make the cautery and prefer a better time.
And I say that the cautery is fitting at all times; for harm that occurs due to timing is overcome by the benefit drawn from using the cautery.
And especially if the cautery is due to pains from necessary, strong, and rapid pains that do not tolerate delay: for fear is had that some greater harm might occur, which would be more detrimental than the minor harm caused by the delay.
And let it not enter your minds, O sons, that which they do not consider, except the common and stupid physicians, namely, that the condition cured by the cautery is not always subject to a relapse: and they add what follows, and the matter is not as they imagine. For the cautery is not used unless in place of medicine, which alters the complexion and dries up the humors that are the causes of pain.
Yet the cautery often surpasses medicine through its velocity of action, strength of operation, and vigor of dominion: and it is possible that the condition returns at some hour according to the complexion of the patient, the location of the disease, and its own virtue: and what is prepared in his body from the aggregation of superfluous elements within him: and what reaches him in acquisition from foods and similar causes, unless a condition arises where the cautery is administered. A disease of subtlety in a member with few superfluities and humours, such as the cautery of a tooth, on account of pain, and similar to that, it is possible for that pain not to return therein.
But this happens in few cases.
But the speech of the common people again is that the cautery is the last remedy of medicine, and it is a correct speech: not at what they intend in that: for they believe that it is not a cure that can compare with medicine nor with other remedies after the occasion of the cautery.
But the truth is contrary to that and their intent, for the cautery being the last remedy of medicine is not [used] unless when after administering means of cure in some disease they do not effect a cure; then at the end we administer the cautery and it does effect a cure: thus falls away the idea that the cautery is the last remedy of medicine, not according to the intent which the common people and many credulous physicians understand.
The ancients said that the cautery with gold is better than the cautery with iron: and they did not say this except on account of the equality of gold and the sublimity of its substance: and they said that the place of the cautery does not produce pus. Indeed this is not absolutely true: for I have already tested it and found that it does not do this in some bodies without others.
And the cautery with gold is good, and better than that with iron, as they said.
Indeed, when you apply the cautery of fire to gold, you do not see clearly when it is burned according to the quantity you wish, because of the rust of the gold: and when it approaches the cold, and if you add ignition to it again, it liquefies in the fire and turns into sheets.
Why the craftsman falls into occupation and thereby a cauterization with iron is made more swiftly and closely to us by reason of this straightness for operation.
And I have indeed arranged this Chapter on Cauterization according to chapters, and have ordered it from head to foot, so that the寻求者 may find what he wishes from it. ¶ On the Method of Cauterizing at the Coronal Suture.
Chapter II.
This cauterization is applied to the dominion of moisture and cold over the brain. These two causes lead to excess fluidity, and an abundance of fluid flow from the head to the eye and ear regions, as well as an increase in sleepiness, toothache, throat pain, and universally all diseases resulting from cold, such as paralysis, hydrocephalus, epilepsy, apoplexy, and similar conditions.
The method of cauterization is to apply it to the patient: let the head be treated with medicinal leeches for three nights or four, according to the strength of the patient, their age, and their habit.
Then order him to shave his head with a razor.
Then make him sit between your hands in a square position, so that his hands are placed on his chest.
Then place the root of your palm on the root of his nose between his eyes. Whenever therefore your middle finger passes over it, mark that place with the cauterization. Then the Olive Cautery with Fire: of which this is the form. Then place it over the marked spot with the incised mark, using a descent by which your hand may be gradually guided, and you shall rotate it.
Then lift your hand quickly, and observe the spot.
If you see already revealed the quantity of the head of alkali or the quantity of zeburbi, then lift your hand.
And if not, repeat the operation with the iron itself, or with another one if this has been cooled: until you see the bones, which I have told you.
Then take something from the salt, and dissolve it in water, and apply it to the cloth, and place it over the spot: and leave it there for three days.
Then place the cloth soaked in oil over it, and leave it there until the burn eschar is destroyed. Then treat it with fourfold ointment until it heals.
They have said that the more an injury remains open, the more pus it emits; therefore, it is better and more beneficial.
And some of them have said that the skin should be cauterized down to the bone: and the cauterization should be maintained until something of thickness of bone is burned.
Then the burnt area on the bone is scraped away, and then it is treated.
And others say that with the cautery one must proceed to the very end until it impresses a mark like a crest in the os, so that the os falls, which is as if formed like kirate: or an instrument which women put into the infused little alphabet: and they think that vapors of the head are exhaling from this place and the wound will be let out open for a long time.
Then it should be cared for until it is consolidated.
But to me these two species of cautery do not seem entirely different except in some people according to the way of fear.
And let it come out, for me it is better with the health of itself.
For the head is weakened by the disruption of its natural continuity: as we have testified in other limbs. And especially when the head is naturally weak and feeble. And indeed, the first species of cautery is more safe and better with me, and I use it. Therefore, I operate with it for the sake of health.
¶ Concerning the manner of cauterizing the head when there is pain throughout the head.
Head III.
When there is chronic pain throughout the head, and this condition persists in the patient, he uses hellebore, colocynth, head purgatives, oils, and plasters.
And especially if it has already been cauterized with the cautery we have described, and none of those things are applied to it: then consider.
For if the head of the patient is strong by nature and not weak, and he finds intense cold: then cauterize with another cautery beneath it lightly.
Then cauterize it over every horn of the head with a cauterization, nor let the skin pass through, and let the quantity covered be as we have narrated.
And cauterize it with one cauterization at the back of its head, at a place called vas: and this is the place where the suction device is placed: raise your mature tool here, and do not uncover the bone.
For it found the sick one suffering from a severe pain, different from the pain of other cauterizations of the heads of all.
And I will say this cauterization in its place: and it must be a cauterization with which the horns of the head are cauterized, and its back more finely with a cauterization with which the middle of the head is cauterized.
And this is its form.
¶ Concerning the manner of cauterizing in headache, both with burned medicine and with iron.
Chapter IV.
When pain occurs in part of the head with soda, or extends to the eye, and is evacuated with cleansing medicines for the head, and the remaining treatment is administered as I said in the divisions of diseases, and it does not include all that: then cauterization in this is according to two modes: either cauterization with burning sharp medicine: or with iron. The cauterization with burning sharp medicine is as follows: take one tooth of garlic, peel it, and cut off the ends from both sides.
Then cut the place of pain at the time of phlebotomy with a broad lancet until a spot under the skin is made where the garlic tooth is taken.
Therefore insert it beneath the skin until it is hidden; then tie it with a suitable ligature and remove it after fifteen hours, and take out the garlic and let the ligature off for two or three days. Afterwards place it beneath the fat until the area produces pus, and then care for it with ointment until it heals.
And if you wish to do this with certain burning medicines, which I have written about in the twelfth treatise, On Burning Medicines.
Cauterization of it with iron is to be done in this manner.
Cauterization by Fire, whose form is as follows.
And it is called Clavilis: for the shape of its head is like that of a nail, in which there is a slight curve, and in its middle there is a small prominence.
Then place it over the area and hold your hand there: and turn the iron slowly with speed, and let the amount that is burned be according to the thickness of the skin, as its half.
And lift your hand so that the artery below is not burned, and no bleeding occurs.
Then immerse the garlic in salty water, and place it over the area, and leave it for three days. Then place the garlic with butter. Afterwards care for it with ointment until it heals. And if you wish, cauterize this hemi-craniac with the secondary extremity of the Cauterius.
And beware of making an incision in the artery in this headache, not one that is properly old.
¶ Concerning the manner of cauterizing in ancient headache.
Chapter V.
When you treat a headache, follow what we said in the previous cure and what we said in the divisions of diseases. And if the treatment is not effective: and you see from the disease that what we said with the first cautery and medicine, or with cautery by fire, is insufficient for him, then you must brand the cautery knife until it whitens after you mark the place of pain with a line, whose length is the half of a finger, or as much as that. And withdraw your hand once, and press it until you incise the artery, and proceed until you reach the opening. You must, however, beware of the continuity of the jawbone, which moves during chewing, so that the side or the nerve that moves it is not burned, lest a spasm occur.
And be mindful of the care and caution regarding the flow of blood in the artery that has been severed.
For there is a fear in its severance, and particularly for one who does not know what he is doing and is neither studious nor experienced: and he should desist from the operation at once.
And I shall proceed with the reminder of the regulation of the flow of blood occurring from the artery according to its proper mode and place in this book.
And if you see from the disease that this cautery is insufficient for him, and you observe that the patient's body can tolerate the cautery in the middle of the head, as we have described, care for the wound until it heals.
And if you wish, administer the Cautery, which we have said in the chapter on the extraction of an artery with a Cautery having two knives.
For the cautery is better and more effective than this. ¶ Concerning the method of cauterizing for pain in the ear.
Chapter VI. When pain in the ear occurs from cold, and is treated with dissolution and the other treatment we have said in the division, and the pain does not cease, then use the Cautery with fire: and it is that which is called Punctum, whose form is this.
Then prick the ear after its cauterization around the entire circumference of the ear as it is turned; or around both sides if the pain is in both ears.
And move the Cautery from the root of the ear slightly after marking the places with infused oil: and let the quantity of the Cautery be ten pricks in each ear, and about that.
Then treat those places until they heal.
¶ Concerning the method of cauterizing for Tortura.
Chapter VII.
Tortura, which is treated with cauterization, is not anything other than conditions that arise from phlegm, as we have said in the divisions of diseases. And apply the appropriate cauterization for the species that arises from drying out and nerve spasm.
When you treat this species of torture with fumigations, and head purges, and gargles, and if your treatment does not bring about recovery, then it is necessary to cauterize the patient three times with Cauterias: one at the root of the ear, and the second slightly below its proper place, and the third at the junction of the two lips.
And place your cauterium on the opposite side of the sick part.
For softening does not occur except in the part which appears healthy.
And the form of cauterization is to cauterize the upper end of the ear directly at the base of the horn of the head: and at another time, whose length shall be according to the length of the thumb.
And withdraw your hand with the cauterium until it burns a quantity of skin half its thickness.
And this is the form of the cauterium, and it is a species from the surgical knife, whose form was previously mentioned; yet it should not be too thin, as you can see: and it should be a knife of somewhat excessive thickness. Then treat the area with what preceded until it is healed.
On the manner of cauterizing in Ancient Apoplexy.
Chapter VIII.
When ancient apoplexy is confirmed, and you treat it with what we have said, and if your treatment does not bring about recovery, and the patient does not have a fever, then cauterize him four times over each horn of his head, and with one cauterium in the middle of his head, as we have said, and with one at the back of his head, according to what has been previously mentioned: and the manner of cauterization should be according to what has been previously stated.
And it is also cauterized with a Cautery over the mouth of the stomach: and it is more ultimate.
Then it is to be treated with what has preceded.
¶ Concerning the manner of cauterizing in Obliuione.
Head 9.
It is necessary to give first great hen eggs in broth, and brain-purifying pills.
Then shave the whole head of the sick person, and apply the plaster described in the treatise on plasters to the back of his head: and apply it several times. This is the measure of the Cautery: and do it according to the same order that I said there. If therefore he is cured by it, it is good.
If not, then apply three cauterizations on the back part of his head, which should descend from the upper part of the head to the lower part of the eye: and place between all cauterizations the thickness of a finger.
Then treat with the Cautery as what has preceded.
If, however, you wish to add and the patient is able to tolerate it, then apply the Cautery in the middle.
If you wish to add, then cauterize it over both horns.
Then treat it until it is cured: and apply the Cautery with oil in the form described earlier.
On the manner of cauterizing in paralysis and softening.
Chapter X.
It is necessary to proceed with the purification of the head using hyssop, and with what we have said before.
Then scrape the patient's head: afterwards cauterize it with a cauterization in the middle of the head, and with a cauterization over all the horns of the head, and three times over the occipital bones.
If, however, you need to apply a cauterization for the softening of the body in multiple places, and the patient is weak but the illness is strong: then cauterize it four times over the vertebral columns, and the last time with a stronger cauterization until the skin burns as much as possible from it, and raise your hand.
Then care for it until it is healed: and thus perform the Oleation cauterization.
On the manner of cauterizing in epilepsy.
Chapter XI.
An epileptic is not cauterized, except for one whose epilepsy is caused by phlegm. Therefore, you must purify his brain first using hyssop, and with the other treatment we have said in the division: when the patient is severe or tolerates the administration of medicines well.
If, however, it is a child who does not tolerate medicines, then a gargling solution and chewing substances for brain purification are administered, before all that over many days with the improvement of food.
Then shave his head, thereafter cauterize it with one cautery in the middle of the head, according to what preceded in manner: and cauterize his occiput with another cautery, and over all the horns of his head cauterize.
If the patient is strong and tolerable, then cauterize it with the cauteries which I said in one having paralysis, and softening of the body over the vertebrae of the neck and the vertebrae of the back: and let the cautery be oleata according to the manner which preceded. If the patient is a child, then apply a fine cautery according to this manner.
On the manner of cauterizing in Melancholia.
Chapter 12.
When the cause of melancholia is corrupted humours and thick phlegm, then cauterize it with the cauteries which I said in one having paralysis.
And if the cause of melancholia is excess decliviating into melancholia, and the body of the patient is moist, then give him in drink what will purify his brain, according to what preceded in division: then shave the patient's head, and make thereafter a tortellam properly made from linen, like a circle.
Then place it in the middle of the head: and the patient sitting square be held from all sides.
Then present the ointment. And it is preferable with old sheep butter.
And heat it over a fire with a temperate heating to the measure that a finger can tolerate when introduced into it.
Then evacuate it in the middle of his head in a circle, and let it remain until it cools.
Make him take this remedy once every week until he is cured, with the remainder of his regimen being good.
Or if you wish, cauterize it by making small punctures in it, and keep your hand with the cauterizer: let it smell.
For this kind of cauterization moistens the brain with its quality.
Then place over it a cloth soaked in butter or chicken fat.
¶ Concerning the method of cauterizing when water is flowing into the eye.
XIII.
When the source of the water in the eye is revealed to you by the signs, which I described in the division, then begin and make him take this remedy, together with what will cleanse his head.
And keep him from all humidity, and make him sit in a bath for several days of fasting.
Then order him to shave his head and cauterize it in the middle of his head. Then cauterize it twice on each temple with two cauterizations, if the onset of water descending into both eyes occurs simultaneously: or from one side, if the onset of water into one eye occurs: and cut all veins and arteries beneath the skin with the cauterizer: and let the cauterization be long in width across the temples: and beware of the flow of blood.
If you see anything from it, then cut it immediately with whatever medicine is possible: and I pardon with wisdom, which is in the extraction of arteries, and cutting them, and precaution against the flow of blood.
And when it is cauterized in the neck, under two bones, with two cauteries brought to a conclusion.
¶ Concerning the manner of cauterizing in ancient tears.
Chapter XIV.
When the tears of the eyes are ancient and frequent, and are over the veins and arteries which are visible on the exterior of the head, it is verified that this is from excess of cold and phlegmatic humors: then cauterize with a cautery as I described at the beginning of the descent of water, in the middle of the head, and with two cauteries over the temples, and with two cauteries in the neck under two bones.
And if you find it necessary to add, then cauterize the same on the entire side of the eye, over the extremity of the eyebrow with a small cautery.
¶ Concerning the manner of cauterizing in nasal fetor.
Chapter XV.
When you treat it, with what we have said in division and not complete in the medication: then hasten, and give him infirmocochias in drink for three nights. Then shave his head, and cauterize it with a middle cautery, using an olive oil cautery.
Then cauterize it with a small cautery and two cauteries, over the eyebrows below the hair.
And beware of the artery, lest you cut it.
And this is the form of cauterization of Clauilis.
¶ Concerning the manner of cauterizing in the treatment of palpebral mollification.
Head XVI.
When the eyelid is affected by an illness or humidity, then cauterize the eyelid with one cauterization, using this lunar cauterization.
And if you wish, cauterize it above both eyebrows with two cauterizations in every part: and let them be distant from both temporal regions: and let the length of all cauterization be according to the lengths of the eyebrows: and do not bring your hand with the cauterization to the very end, but rather according to the quantity that is burnt on the second eyelid.
And this is the form of cauterization according to this lunar cauterization.
¶ Concerning the manner of cauterizing the eyelid when hair grows inward and irritates the eye. Head XVII.
Cauterization in this case is according to two methods: either with fire: or with a burning medicine.
In cauterization with fire, first instruct the patient to remove their own hair, if it is from those that clean themselves, until they grow out and become equal in length. If they irritate him at their point of growth, then bind his eyes with strips, so that they do not move, until they grow out.
When therefore they are born and equalized, then set the head of the sick person on your lap; subsequently make signs over the eyelids of his eyes with a medicated wax, the sign being in the shape of the figure of a myrtle leaf: and let the beginning of the sign be near the hair.
Then apply a soaked cloth in egg white: or in psyllium mucilage over the eye.
Then the cautery, the form of which is as follows.
Then cauterize according to the figure you have marked in turns many times until the skin surface burns, which is like the shape of a myrtle leaf, entirely visible.
And the sign of your work's success is: that if you see the eyelid of the eye begin to contract, and hairs raise up near the puncture of the eye.
Raise then your hand: and let it go free for three days.
Then place over it a cloth with butter until the eschar is eradicated.
Then care for it with ointment until it is healed.
If any hair returns within an hour and the eyelid softens, then cauterize that place again as you did at first.
If however the hairs are on the lower part, then cauterize it until they rise to their natural place and are equalized so that the hairs do not irritate the eye.
¶ Regarding the method of cauterizing with burning medicine in the same case.
Chapter XVIII.
You should instruct the sick person to let their hair grow until it is prolonged and equalized.
Make from paper the shape of a myrtle leaf.
Then take from known soap and from unabsorbed ash of each kind a weight of an ounce or nearly that: then rub these together with good crushing, and make them quickly, so that they do not cool.
Then spread it out on the paper you made as the shape of a myrtle leaf, and place it over the eyelid of one eye, or both.
And place under the eye a cloth soaked in white wine: and the sick person's head be near your body.
And place your index finger on the medicine, and press it slightly.
And you should move it whenever the sick person feels the bite of the medicine: for he finds its bite like fire.
While therefore the sick person continues to feel the bite of the medicine as he found it, then dismiss the medicine, and move it with your finger.
When therefore the bite ceases, then remove the medicine, and wash the eye with water.
And consider then, if you see the eyelid lift, as it lifts during contraction with fire or with incision, it is well: and if not, then apply the medicine again to the same place, where the medicine does not impress itself nor darken, until your operation equals and contracts the eye.
Then apply over it a mixture of cotum with butter until the burned skin is eradicated.
Then treat it with diaphinicon ointment or another, until it is cured.
And you must carefully guard against anything from the medicine falling into the eye during the operation.
If the eyelid softens after a few days and something from the hair fights against it in the eye, then apply the medicine to that place which softens from the eyelid, as you did at first.
Then treat it until it is cured.
And this is the form of the myrtle leaf.
And know that human eyes vary in size and shape.
Therefore, according to this, consider it: and the way of the straight path is not hidden from him who has a study in this art.
¶ Concerning the method of cauterizing in lacrimal fistula.
Head XVIX.
When you treat a fistula, as we have said in the divisions of diseases, and your treatment is not见效: then, you must cauterize it according to this method.
Instruct the patient to place his head in your lap, and hold his head with a servant between your hands in such a way that it is not moved nor shaken with his head.
Then apply Infused Cotum in a cloudy solution or in a mucilaginous psyllium preparation to his eye: then heat the Cauterium, whose form is as follows.
Let it be a concavity, like the form of a bird's wing cane from one end, with which the Cautery is made: and if you wish it to penetrate to the other end, and if you wish it to go up so, try.
Verumtamen hoc concauum est melius ad opus tuum.
Deinde pone tunc super eam Cauterium, quod fit ignitum valde.
Et tene cum eo manum tuam parumper apud Cauterium ab oculo, ad partem nasi, ut non erret manus tua, aut inquietetur infirmus: et ponas Cauterium in adipe oculi, et corrumpas ipsum.
Si ergo peruenis in principio Cauterii tui usque ad os, erit bene.
Et si non: tunc itera Cauterium semel, aut bis, si indiges illo: et dimitte illud tribus diebus.
Deinde pone Cotum cum butyro, et cura ipsum cum unguento exiccatiuo, donec sanetur. Quod si praeterierint ei quadraginta dies, et non sanatur: tunc pone super ipsum medicinam acutam corrosivam, donec detegatur os: et rade ipsum secundum quod venit in capitulo suo.
And there is another method of Cauterization for fistula, which some of the first ones said.
Direct to the place of the fistula, and cut it: then place in the fissure camahan subtile, i.e., a fine cannula, whose form is this.
And pour into it a quantity of a drachm of melted lead, and hold your hand with a good Cannula for retention, and let the patient not move at all, so that the melted lead does not run or reach his eye.
And it is necessary to place over the patient's eye a cloth浸湿的蛋清，或者水。
For the lead will burn the place of the fistula and heal it with a marvelous healing.
For if the fistula is healed by what we have said from Cauterization and cure, it is good.
And if it is not healed, then it is necessary to make a hole in the nose and reduce the fistula to the course of the nose, according to where it will come to its proper place.
¶ On the method of cauterizing in fissures of the Lips.
Head XX.
Fissures called Pili often occur in the lips, and particularly in children's lips.
When therefore you treat these fissures, as we said in the division of diseases, and if the treatment is not effective, then prepare a small surgical cautery with fire, according to this form.
And let its concavity be according to the subtlety of the knife.
Then treat it with causticSubstance until it is healed.
¶ Concerning the Method of Cauterizing in Fistula of the Mouth.
Head XXI.
When an abscess occurs at the root of the tooth, in the palate, or at the roots of the teeth: it then produces pus and breaks open. Afterwards, it heals over, but the pus returns and forms a fistula. Then treat it, and do not apply any treatment inside it; then it is necessary to cauterize with fire according to the size that it takes in the fistula.
Then insert the ignited one into the opening of the fistula, and hold your hand there until the heated iron reaches the depth and the end of it. Do this once or twice.
Then treat it after that, using the method we have said until it is cured.
If therefore the pus is removed and it heals, that will be good.
And if not, then it is necessary to uncover the place and remove the root of the decayed tissue according to what comes to its head.
¶ Concerning the Method of Cauterizing on Softened Gums and Teeth.
Head XXII.
When the gums are softened due to humors, and the teeth are moved, and you treat it with medicines without success, then place the patient's head in your lap.
Then apply cauterization with a form to be used after this, so that you place the Cannula over the tooth and insert the burning Cauterium quickly. And hold your hand slightly until the patient feels the heat of the fire has reached the root of the tooth.
And raise your hand: then iterate the Cauterium several times, as you wish.
Then let the patient fill his mouth with saline water and hold it for one moment: then spit it out.
For the moved tooth is fortified, and the softened gums are tightened, and the corrupted moisture is dried up.
Chapter XXIII.
When the toothache is due to cold, either the tooth itself is cold, or worms, and treatment with medicines does not help: then cauterization should be applied in two ways: either with butter, or with fire.
The cauterization with butter is as follows: take aged butter, and boil it in a iron cup or a earthenware vessel.
Then take cotton and wrap it around the tip of the probe.
Then immerse it in the boiled butter: and place it quickly over the painful tooth. Hold it until it cools down, then repeat several times until the heat of the fire reaches the root of the tooth.
And if you wish, immerse wool or cotton in cold butter, and place it over the painful tooth: and place over it a heated iron until the heat reaches the depth of the tooth's cavity.
Cauterization of it with fire is done so that you may direct the air tube or the iron tube. And there shall be something of great thickness in its body so that the sharpness of the fire does not reach the sick person's mouth.
Then apply the cautery with its sharp end: place it over the tooth: and hold your hand until the cautery cools down.
Do this several times, for the pain will be relieved either on the same day or the next day.
And the patient should fill his mouth with good butter at the spot of the cautery and hold it for one hour: then he should spit out the butter.
And this is the form of the cautery.
Cauterize with whichever end you wish, according to what is possible: and this is the form of the air tube.
¶ Regarding the method of cauterizing in Strophulis.
Head XXIV.
When Strophulae are caused by phlegm and cold humors, and are not responding to medical treatments for digestion, and you wish to speed up their digestion, then use a concave cautery with its form as follows.
It has two open ends, so that smoke may escape from the other end of the cautery: and place the heated one over the abscess once, and a second time if needed, until the heat reaches the depth of the abscess.
If the abscess is small: then apply a cautery according to the size of the abscess.
Then let it alone for three days, and apply a wet cloth soaked in butter over it until what the fire burned is removed.
Then treat it with tooth ointment until the form of the cannula is healed.
¶ Concerning the manner of cauterizing in hoarseness and constriction of breathing.
Head XXV.
When the humors overcome the pulmonary canal, and especially when this is accompanied by a cold constitutional condition, then it is necessary to evacuate the patient first with medicinal purgatives.
Then cauterize it on the nodule at the root of the throat in the depressed place: and beware, do not apply the cautery to the throat or the skin unless there is something of it.
Then cauterize it with another cautery at the junction of the neck at the last vertebra by burning it out: and let the cautery be hot iron according to the manner that preceded.
Then treat it with what preceded until it is healed.
¶ Concerning the manner of cauterizing in diseases of the lung and cough.
Head XXVI.
When cough and lung disease are caused by cold humors, and the patient does not have a fever, nor consumption, nor an old illness: then cauterize it with two cauterizations above the furcifer in the depressed, gentle, and hollow places.
And with another cautery in the middle of the chest between two mammary glands: let the cautery be in the shape of a cannula as previously described.
And if you wish your cautery to be applied by puncturing with a cautery called Punctum, whose form was previously described in the puncturing of ear pain: let the points be thirty, diminishing as before.
Then care for it with what preceded, until it is cured. And let the cautery have three branches: according to this form.
Wherefore the cautery should be applied with ease when you use it once with three cauteries.
¶ Concerning the manner of cauterizing for Titillus, in humerus dislocation.
Chapter XXVII.
When the head of the auxiliary bone is dislocated due to humidity and does not return within an hour of its displacement until it becomes habitual for it to return, and then it is dislocated again by a slight movement, as we have already testified to this, then it is necessary to reduce the dislocation first.
Then the patient is turned over onto his back or onto the healthy side.
Then lift the skin which is on the inner side of the titillus with your left hand fingers: and if the joint is dislocated to the inner side.
Then apply a cautery with two prongs using fire. Its form is as follows.
Then cauterize the skin until it penetrates to the other side, and let the shape of the cauterization be with four cauterizations.
And when a cauterization is made with a cauterium having three reeds, why then the shape of the cauterization becomes that of six cauteria: and the reeds are according to the subtlety of the probe.
And this is the form of the cauterium having three reeds.
And sometimes one is added to this number, whence there are eight cauteria.
Then place over the cauterium crushed blades of grass with salt.
Then cause the patient to be in a calm state, so that the limb does not move for some time until it is strengthened.
And if the dislocation is upwards, and this happens rarely, then cauterize it over the shoulder with a clavus cauterium, or with many puncturing cauterizations.
For the joint is strengthened, and the humidity is removed: and the patient is cured.
¶ On the Method of Cauterizing the Stomach.
Head XXVIII.
When cold and many humors occur in the Stomach, until they are extracted from his complexion, and catarrhs multiply to him, and frequent modes of cure do not help: then it must be that the patient is laid supine on his back, and extends his legs, and his hands.
Then cauterize with three cauteria: with one cauterium of the size of a finger's breadth below the scapula and a clavus cauterium, and two cauteria below from both sides by one cauterium, until the shape of triangular cauterizations comes.
And lengthen between both so that they do not join when they putrefy. And the depth of the cautery be the width of twothirds of the skin.
And let the shape of the cautery conform to this form without addition: and if you wish to use a larger cautery in the middle of the stomach according to this form: and let the cautery that makes this cautery be one according to the shape of a circle according to this form.
And the stomach is cauterized by puncturing it with a needle for him who is afflicted by this cautery: and let it be such that you mark a point on the stomach according to the quantity you wish with encaustic: then cauterize it with the puncture cautery: then care for it with the cure that preceded until it is healed.
¶ The manner of cauterizing Epar frigidum.
Chapter XXIX.
When a pain in the Epar (hypochondrium) occurs from cold and humidity, or from thick wind, until it has passed away through its natural excretion, and the patient is not helped by what we have said: then the patient should be placed face down on his neck, and mark three cauteries with encaustic according to this form and quantity below the Epar (hypochondrium), where the cubit of a man reaches. And let the space between each cautery be according to the width of a finger: and let the cautery be according to the length of the body, straight: and do not press your hand with the cautery much.
And let the quantity be such that it is burned according to the thickness of the skin, half its width: and let the patient stand on his feet.
If he is not standing, then let him lie down, who has already extended his legs and raised his arms. This is the form of cauterization.
And it is possible for you to perform this cauterization with a surgical cautery when you have subtlety and prudence in your art.
And beware that you do not proceed last in cauterization, and the thickness of the skin is burned entirely, which causes the body to be burned altogether and it may reach the intestines, for the skin is thin there. Therefore, know this.
On the manner of cauterizing epistematic apostemas.
Chapter XXX.
When suppuration occurs, and you wish to know whether that apostema is in the flesh of the epistaxis or in its covering: then if it is in the flesh of the epistaxis, it causes a dull pain and heaviness without sharpness. And if it is in the covering of the epistaxis, with the pain there is a violent sharpness. You now see that his treatment has tired out the physicians.
Therefore, the patient should lie supine on his neck.
Then mark the location of the apostema with wax: then kindle the cautery which resembles a ray.
And this is its form.
And cauterize with that cautery until the entire skin is burned and it reaches the root, until all the pus emerges: then treat it with the treatment for suppurations until it heals.
And it ought not to be used in this cauterization manner except by one whose study of the art of medicine is prolonged, and whose hands have often encountered these illnesses with experience; then only shall he dare to undertake such an operation.
Therefore, let her depart from here, for it is better that she do so.
¶ On the Method of Cauterizing in Pleurisy.
Head XXXI.
The ancients said that the cauterization with the roots of aristolochia should be used for cold pleurisy in this manner.
And take from the dried roots of long aristolochia, one longer root, which is found there, and let it be as thick as a finger.
Then immerse it in oil: and ignite it on fire.
Then cauterize with one cautery in the area between the fork and the neck, and with two small cauteries slightly inclined downward toward the area under the chin.
And cauterize with two cauteries also in the area between the fifth and sixth ribs, slightly inclined backward: and with another cautery in the middle of the chest, and another above the stomach.
And cauterize with three cauteries from the back: one in the area between two spatulas, and two from both sides of the chest, the lower one between the two spatulas.
And it ought not to be that you compress your hand with the cautery; rather, let it be evident by the smell on the skin. And some of the ancients have said that there are men who use a cautery made of iron similar to a bow: they ignite it and put it inside what is between the ribs until they come upon the apostema and discharge pus: as we have said in the case of the apostema of the Epatis.
But in this perforation with the cautery it is from fear, that either the sick man dies immediately, or a fistula occurs at the place, which has no cure.
¶ On the Method of Cauterizing the Spleen Head XXXII.
When you treat the illness of the spleen, following what we have said in the cure for diseases divided by types, and if your treatment does not bring about a cure, then the cautery should be applied in three ways, all of which are correct.
One of them is to make three or four cauterizations by drawing lines along the length of the spleen according to the shape of the cauteria used for the Epatis, whose figure has already been given.
And let the size of each cauterization be that of a finger's breadth, or somewhat more or less.
And let the method of cauterization be as we have said for the cauterization of the Epatis equally.
And do not press your hand with the cautery: and let the sick person lie supine on his back.
And another method of cauterization is: ignite the cautery having two quires, as we have said in the chapter on dislocation of the humerus: and lift the skin which is in the direction of the spleen, where the elbow of the left side of the sick person reaches. And let your lifting be such that it corresponds to the width of the body, so that the cauterizations fall along the length of the body.
Then insert two live coals deeply, until you penetrate the skin from the other side: then withdraw the cautery: thus four cauterizations are made. And if you wish to cauterize with another cautery having three coals.
Then care for the cautery after you have released it to discharge pus over many days: for it is more effective than all that came before in the cure.
¶ Concerning the Method of Cauterizing in Hydrops.
Chapter XXXIII.
The cautery does not apply to hydrops unless it is applied properly.
When you treat hydrops with the methods of cure that we have discussed in the division, and if the treatment does not yield results, then you should cauterize it with four cauterizations around the umbilicus, and one cauterization over the stomach, and another over the flank, and one over the spleen, and two cauterizations along the back between the vertebrae, and one directly on the chest, and another directly on the stomach. The depth of the cauterization should be close to the thickness of the skin.
Then release the cautery to discharge pus over a long period.
And do not evacuate the patient from the treatment after cauterization: for it is necessary to combine two intentions. And with the help of God, recovery will speed up.
The form of the cautery used for the abdomen should be claw-like, as its form has been described: and the one used for the back should be olive-shaped, as its form has been described.
On the Method of Cauterizing Feet and Thighs. Head XXXIV.
When blisters are caused by a disease of the watery type and are filled with yellowish fluid: you must cauterize over the dorsum of the foot at the nocrati, which is between the tarsal and annular regions. Then raise your hand with the cautery, and do not twist it: then raise your hand: and do not repeat this entirely.
For the yellowish fluid will exude, and the cautery should be in this form.
Then make two cauterizations on each thigh, and let the cautery be made with the extremity of the surgical cautery: and let the cautery be according to the length of the thigh, one below the knee, and the other below it, about midway through the thigh: and make two cauterizations over the entire thigh: and leave the cautery open without treatment for a long time: so that some fluid exudes from it: then treat it with the rest as we have said.
On the Method of Cauterizing in the Solution of the Belly. Head XXXV.
When the solution of the belly is from cold and humidity, until it weakens the retentive and digestive virtues, which are in the stomach and intestines: and it is treated with methods of treatment, and does not heal: and you see the sick person tolerating the cauterization of the exuberant virtue, then cauterize him with a large cautery over his stomach, according to what preceded in the cauterization of the stomach with the circular cautery, and four thin cauterizations around the umbilicus, with a fine clavate cautery: and with a large cautery above the alcatin over the alhosos, or with two cauterizations.
And if you see excessive moisture, and the patient tolerates it, then cauterize it with a cauterization over a comb, and cauterize all of it: and perhaps you will add two small cauterizations to the stomach near the large one.
For it is a beneficial cure whose assistance never errs.
¶ On the Method of Cauterizing Hemorrhoids.
Chapter XXXVI.
When in the anus are old hemorrhoids, many or one, and they are filled with thick, cold, or corrupted moistures, and the cure is not effective when treated as we have said in division, then cauterize three times over the lower spine below the iliac bones somewhat triangularly, and with a cauterization just below the navel as if by two fingers.
And if you think that his stomach is chilled and his food is not digested, and you see his face ulcerating, then cauterize him with a large cauterization over the stomach according to what has preceded: and with a cauterization over his Epar, and another over his Spleen with a clavil cauterization: and let the open cauterization remain for some time. Then treat him until he is healed.
¶ On the Method of Cauterizing Althel After Their Excision.
Chapter XXXVII.
When you excise the althel, then ignite the cauterization that is similar to a spoke.
Then insert the ignited cauterization into the excised althel: and with your last hand, until the cauterization reaches the opening of the vein from which the blood flows: do this once or twice. If therefore there are many warts, then cauterize each one with a cautery according to what we have narrated.
Then care for it, together with what is applied to them from ointments, until they are cured.
And if you cauterize it with a great cautery over aloeswood, it is more effective in healing.
¶ On the Method of Cauterizing an Anal Fistula.
Head XXXVIII.
When the patient does not respond to sectioning and the operation as narrated in its place, and is terrified by it, perhaps he will be cured with cauterization.
When therefore a Fistula occurs and becomes old, pus flows from it, and腐败的湿气排出。
Therefore, what is more important is that you probe it carefully with a fine instrument.
Then determine the depth of it by probing.
Then use the cautery, which is similar to a hot poker.
Then insert the heated instrument into the fistula and determine the depth at which it has entered. And repeat the cauterization over it until all the腐败的组织被烧灼干净，一次、两次或三次，根据你所需的程度。
And guard against burning the nerves if they are there, or large veins: or if the fistula goes to the bladder or to the intestinal wall, then guard against these areas in particular.
And do not do that unless the fistula is in a fleshy place: and you think because it is not penetrating.
Then care for the place until it is wholly healed.
If the place is sealed, and materials are removed from it, and remains thus for a long time: then know that it is now wholly healed.
And if materials are not removed from it, then know that it is penetrating, or that the mouth of it is corrupted deep within, or something like that: of which remember will come to its place.
¶ Concerning the Method of Cauterizing the Kidneys.
Head 39.
When pain occurs in the kidneys from cold or from windy swelling, and is diminished because of that sick person's diet, then it must be that you cauterize it over almathen over the kidneys, cauterizing each kidney with a cauterization of the key, of which there was a previous mention.
And perhaps we cauterize it a second time within the same almeidatu.
Wherefore three lines will come.
Therefore they will be more effective in healing.
¶ Concerning the Method of Cauterizing the Bladder.
Head 40. When there is weakness and softening in the bladder due to cold and humidity, until the sick person no longer retains urine, then cauterize it in the lower part of the left side over the bladder, where the hairs begin like combs, with a cauterization from the right side, and another from the opposite side: and let the length of that cauterization be according to the width of the space between the thumb and forefinger. And cauterize it with a lower dorsal cauterization, or with two cauterizations if needed: and let it be according to the previous cauterization with the key-shaped instrument.
On the manner of cauterizing the matrix. Chapter XLI.
When cold and humidity occur in the matrix, and are prevented from impregnation, and corrupt the menstruation, and delay their appearance, and pain occurs to her upon their coming, then it must be cauterized with three cauterizations around the circumference of the navel, as we said in cauterizing the bladder, and a cauterization over the lower part of the spine, or with two cauterizations: let the cauterization be with a heated iron.
On the manner of cauterizing the ankle in dislocation.
Chapter XLII.
When mucous humidities effuse to the back of the ankle, and become a cause of its exit from its place: and the sign of this is that the leg extends beyond the other when compared side by side: and the location of the dislocation is found to be vacuous.
Therefore, it must be cauterized with a similar circle over the back of the ankle. After you mark with cauterization around the back of the ankle as it is turned, let the skin fall into the middle of the circle.
And let the cauterization be of the form that preceded in cauterizing the stomach.
And if you do not have this cauterization present, then cauterize it with three cauterizations, using a large olive oil cauterization. The depth of the cauterization should be according to the thickness of the skin in total.
Then care for it until it is healed.
On the manner of cauterizing in sciatica. Chapter XXXIII.
When pain occurs in the buttock, and the cause of this is cold and humidities: and the patient is treated as we said in division, and no new treatment is applied, and that old condition persists: then it must be that you relieve the patient of gross humors with foul pills or with artificial pills and similar treatments.
Then cauterize him.
And the manner of cauterization in this case is according to two methods: either cauterization with irritating medicines, or cauterization with fire.
Cauterization with fire is according to many methods.
One of which is to cauterize over the buttock in question with three triangular cauterizations, according to this form.
And give them a good or bad depth.
And let the space between each cauterization be of the thickness of a finger's breadth: and let the cauterization be olive-sized.
Sometimes cauterization is done in the middle over the head of the buttock.
Hence there are four cauterizations.
And if you wish to cauterize with a circle, as the form preceding this in cauterization of dislocation of the buttock, do it with one cauterization: let the circle contain the entire groove.
And burn the thickness of the skin entirely.
This is the method of cauterization for sciatica, when the pain adheres to the spine itself and does not extend to the thigh and leg.
If it extends to the thigh and leg, then cauterize that place with two cauterizations over the thigh, on the spot where the patient indicates pain, and a fourth cauterization with your instrument over the heel for a little while towards the outer side: let the cauterization be surgical. And the depth of the cauterization according to the thickness of the skin.
And if the patient indicates that the pain extends nearly to the toes, then cauterize that place where he indicates it with three or four cauterizations, or more if needed.
And if the patient indicates that the pain is below the knee in the direction of the leg, then cauterize that place with one surgical cauterization.
And be careful in every cauterization that you do not conclude with the cauterization to the extent that you burn the nerve or the large artery, and thereby bring harm or contraction to the patient.
And I myself have indeed seen one and another case among those who cauterized the heel and concluded with the cauterization, where the leg swelled until a tumor followed to the foot, and the entire foot became perforated and腐烂了：随后发生肠穿孔，之后死亡。
And if the pain is in two parts at the same time, cauterize both according to this method.
And some wise men have said that in the cauterization of the spine, this is the method of the cauterization.
Make a similar needle of iron, whose diameter shall be the half of a palm: and let its end be according to the thickness of a finger核，或略小一些：且在其内应放一个更细的针。
And let the space between every needle be according to the quantity of a node of the thumb: and let the needles be open from two parts: and their height shall be as one node, or two nodes: and make for them a handle of iron fitted centrally in the needles.
And this is its form.
Then let it be heated in fire until it becomes red and casts sparks: then let it be placed on the surface of the back of the sick person lying on the healthy side.
Therefore cauterize him with three round cautery irons in one pass.
Then let it remain for three days.
Then plaster it with butter: and let the wound remain open for many days.
Then care for it with ointment until it heals.
Albucasis says, "Of this kind of cautery, my son, we have not used it much, because of the fear inspired by its appearance: and therefore, because few wait upon it.
Yet it is one of the good cauteries for those who bear it, and finds its place there.
The cautery with medicinal substances is as follows: you shall make two needles having a perforated armilla through which the cardo of its gate, made of bronze or iron, descends, whose length is that of the wall. The height of these needles shall be two nodes, or like those themselves.
And let there be a space that is between the two quantities of the thickness of a digit, and may they be open below and above: and let them contain each other according to this form.
Then place it on the spine of the fish, lying on the healthy side.
And compress your hand on the spine of the fish strongly.
Then immerse two circles in warm water, which has been heated slightly with fire, and hold it for the quantity of an hour: and the sick person should tolerate its bite, and its burning, for he found the bite like fire until the biting ceases.
Then lift your hand with the instrument, and wipe away the warm water from the fish completely with sweet water: then release it for three days.
And place butter over it until the blackness from the burning is removed. Then release it for several days, and drain the pus from it.
For this is the last in the healing process.
Then treat it with ointments until it heals.
If the pain extends to the hip or thigh, make for him a plaster as you did for the fish equally.
And this is the measure of the warm water: and I have already written it in the treatise on the correction of medicines.
Take alkali and unslaked lime, each half of one part: grind them, and put both in a new pot, whose lower part is pierced by a small hole, according to the quantity that the radius can enter: then put another untreated pot under the bottom of the pot: and cast over the alkali and lime from sweet water, which will submerge both up to the digit: after which you should compress them with your hand with good compression: and release the pot until the sharp water descends to the lower part of the treated pot.
Then aggregate that water completely, and throw it over another lime: and stir until it is renewed.
It will then be very sharp and strong in its acuteness, which is administered in many medical operations and in cauterizing other members.
Because it makes the operation of fire effective.
And from the medicines, they are those with which the anchor is cauterized, even as terebinthine gum, and honey of acanthus, and lime with soap, so that both be mixed together.
And Galen, in narrating, reported the cure of a certain man from the ancients, by which he was cured of pain in the anchor and sciatica: and he praised it highly.
And he said that he did not require any other cure, and that he was cured from but one application, until he reported that perhaps he had entered the bath carried, and emerged from it already healed. And it is to be taken from green wormwood: and if green wormwood cannot be found, use dry, recent wormwood, and rub it much with a little oil, and place it over the anchor where the pain is, or the thigh, or in the hip: and bind it, and let it remain for a quantity of three hours, or until the patient feels the soothing of the burn.
Then insert it into the bath.
When therefore his body becomes moist, insert him into the bath seat.
For the pain diminishes, and he is cured.
And know that it is not proper for anyone to use cautery with these medicines, unless after the evacuation of the body.
And Dioscorides, who said that the dung of goats, when used with cautery on sciatic veins, benefits it: and the cautery is performed in this manner.
A quantity of wool is taken and soaked in old oil, and placed over the deep place, which is between the great toe and the second toe, and is nearer to the second toe.
Then take the dry goat dung and ignite it on fire until it becomes charcoal.
Then place it over the wool and remove it while it is still burning.
Then repeat this.
Therefore, do not cease to perform this until sensation returns beyond the point of the spine, and the pain subsides.
And this method of cautery is called the Vaccinium cautery.
¶ Concerning the cauterization of back pain.
Chapter 44.
Sometimes back pain occurs from multiple causes, such as a fall, a blow, excessive evacuation, and similar conditions, due to the infusion of cold and wet matter. Indeed, cauterization does not apply in any of these cases except for that which results from the infusion of cold matter.
Therefore, after an evacuation of the patient with foul pills and similar substances, three lines should be marked on the back where the pain is, according to the width of the patient's palm. After marking these lines with encaustic wax, make five cauterizations or more per line depending on the strength of the patient's tolerance: and the cauterization should be performed with a cauteriopuncti.
And if you wish, cauterize with three cauteries or four, using a medial key-shaped cautery, according to this form.
¶ Concerning the manner of cauterizing for newly acquired hemorrhoids.
Head XLV.
This illness often occurs in small infants.
And the sign of its onset in children is: a constriction that occurs during breathing, especially during raising and movement, and you find on the last vertebra of the spine and its nodes, which have begun to protrude above the other vertebrae.
And when you see this and wish to treat it, then cauterize it with a circular cautery according to this form.
And let the cautery take effect on all parts of the vertebra equally: and if you wish to cauterize around the vertebra with a point cautery using two or three lines, and let the points be close to each other.
Then care for the area until it heals, using what we have said.
And beware, do not apply the cautery to the hernia that occurs during nerve spasm.
¶ Concerning the manner of cauterizing for Gout and joint pains. Head XLVI.
When joint pains are caused by cold humors that flow into any part of the body, and particularly when these pains occur in the feet, according to the custom of physicians, they call this condition Gout.
When therefore the treatment of cold gout is conducted with the methods of cure, and the pains do not disappear, then cautery will remove them.
And it is that you cauterize him after evacuation around the circumference of the ankle joint with many cauteries: let the cautery be olive.
This is its form.
And if you need to prick the face of the foot, then do so with cautery punctures.
And if the pains ascend to the knees or other joints, and this happens often, then cauterize it over each knee with three or four cauteries from all sides, using this cautery of Clauvil. And if more cauteries with this instrument are necessary, then cauterize it. And do not immerse your hand with the cautery, but let it be about the thickness of the skin only.
And if the pains ascend to the knees and the back, then administer what we have said from the cautery in its chapter.
And if the pains are only in the hands, then prick around the circumference of the fingers, as two lines are drawn.
And if pains remain in the digits, then prick them, over each knot with a point, and over the palm of the hand.
And if the pains ascend after days to the elbows or shoulders, then cauterize both from all sides.
And do not evacuate the patient with good regimen or through medication intake.
For if a good regimen is established and the phlegm is discharged, he will be healed by the help of God with this cautery.
¶ Concerning the Method of Cauterizing in Wounds.
Head 47.
When a rupture occurs in the groin and the intestine descends or circles around to the testicle, and it is close and beginning: then you must order the patient to abstain from food on his day.
And let him use something mild so that the feces may descend from his abdomen.
Then let him sit between your hands on his back: and order him to hold his breath until he passes it, or until the intestine appears around or descends.
Then reduce it with your fingers and apply signs with a cauterization over the opening of the hernia, using a sign whose extremity is similar to the middle of a circle above the upper part of the body.
Then apply the cautery, which has this form, until it turns white and discharges pus.
Then reduce the intestine or herniated tissue to its natural position.
Then place your hand on the location to prevent the intestine from protruding: and you have now opened between the legs of the patient, placed a pad beneath him, and another assistant stands over his thighs and another over his chest holding the hands.
Then place the cautery over the sign, holding it straight with your hand while the cautery is upright.
And hold it until you reach the mouth with it: or use an alternative method if you have not reached the mouth with the first one.
And carefully observe from the exit of the intestine up to the time of your cautery, so as not to burn it, and let it happen through that to the sick person either death or great harm.
And know that when you do not reach the mouth with the cautery, your operation does not succeed.
And the cautery for infants should be fine, according to their size.
Then care for it with other ointments until it is healed.
And let the sick person lie on their back for forty days until the wound heals.
And you should provide nourishment for the duration of its cure that will soothe its stomach: so that it does not pass intestine during effort and evacuation.
Then when it desires to rise after forty days, then administer a well-made bandage, and let it wear it for forty more days.
For when it follows this regimen, it is cured with complete healing.
And when Ruptures occur in the rest of the abdomen and are beginning to develop, and the strength is such that they should not increase, then cauterize the rupture with a round cautery according to its size: and let that which is burned out from then on be as one-third of it.
Then care for it itself, with what we have said, and nothing more will be added.
And some of the first have said: Let the rupture be cauterized with a triangular cautery, according to this form.
After it is marked with cauterization, and a line is placed through the width on the upper side of the rupture, and another line below. And place your hand in the middle with the pronged cautery.
But the cautery should be applied more easily and more effectively first. ¶ Concerning the method of cauterizing for pain due to injury or percussion.
Head 48.
When pain occurs in certain limbs due to an accident or percussion, and that pain persists for a long time and does not respond to medicinal treatment, then it should be cauterized with the Puncti cautery.
And the cautery should be of the size and proportion of the member, considering its weakness, strength, and functionality, as well as any twisting or pain from it.
If therefore it is cured with the cautery first, that is good.
If not: then apply the cautery again to it.
For it is the custom of these pains to be transferred from one limb to what is nearest to it.
Therefore, you should apply the cautery to them until the sick person is cured.
On the manner of cauterizing in Leprosy.
Head XLIX.
Lepers are sometimes benefited by cauterization with maximum intensity.
And especially the species of Leprosy which results from the putrefaction of phlegm and melanchole: therefore, when you wish to cauterize it, consider.
If therefore the Leprosy is incomplete, and you have treated it as we said in the division, and it does not descend nor remain stationary: then fear that corruption may spread over his entire complexion: then cauterize him on the head with five cauteries: one in the middle of the head, and a second below it toward the forehead near the end of the hair, and two above the horns [of the skull], and one behind on the neck bones.
And at the end, apply your hand with the cautery slightly, until it makes a small impression in the mouth, and let the outer layers peel off from it: so that the expiration of gross vapors from there may be alleviated, and cauterize even the spleen with the cautery according as it preceded.
If however the Leprosy is already spread over the patient and appears manifestly: then you must cauterize with these cauteries which we said in the head, and a cautery over the end of the nose, and two cauteries over the two jaws, and two cauteries over the vertebrae of the neck, and six over the vertebrae of the back, and one large one over the hips near the buttock and one above it, on the almeidati: and two over the flanks: namely one over each flank, and two over the knees: one over every knee, and two over the shoulders, and two over the elbows, and two over the armpits: and cauterize him over all joints, from the joints of his hands and feet: and cauterize over all heels of his feet, and the tendons of his hands.
And beware of the nerves that are above the very heel, so as not to burn them. And sometimes the throat is cauterized with one cautery, and another on the mouth of the stomach, and another on the ileum.
And know that the more cautery you apply, the greater the benefit, and the more it confers.
And know that the sick do not find pain from the cautery as those who are healthy do: for their body is already numbed.
And the cautery should be of appropriate size and thickness according to the limbs and joints, as specified by the types of instruments.
Head I.
When some limb is in stupor and is treated with medicines, oils, and plasters, and yet does not heal, then cauterize the stunned limb with cautery, according to the size or thickness of the limb.
And let your cautery penetrate slightly into the thickness of the skin.
Then care for it with ointment until it heals.
And sometimes the cautery is applied to a certain stupor that occurs in the hand and foot, at the vertebrae of the back near the exit of the nerves that move that limb: and the stupor is removed.
Verum non praesumat super illud, nisi qui est sapiens in anatomia membrorum, et egressione nervorum mouentium corpus.
¶ Of the Method of Cauterizing in Ulcers.
Head 51.
When an ulcer is old and nothing useful from the practices of medicine is found in it: then cauterize over it with a deeper cautery slightly, according to the thickness of the skin, until the whiteness is removed and the color thereof is changed.
Then care for it with a powder of herb, and lentils with rose oil, and leaves of arnoglossa, and pigeon blood, and hawk blood: take one part of each. Mix all these together, apply them to a cloth, and adhere them to the place until it is healed.
¶ Of the Method of Cauterizing in Cancer.
Head 52.
When cancer is beginning and the growth can be stopped: then cauterize it with a circular cautery around its circumference, as it revolves.
Wise men have said that it should be cauterized with the last cautery in the middle.
But I do not find that to be wise, for I fear it might become infected, and I have seen it happen many times. And it is more appropriate to cauterize around its circumference with a circle, as we have said, or with multiple cautery applications. ¶ Of the Method of Cauterizing in Abscesses.
Head III.
When anyone has Adubelati and its maturity is delayed, either due to excess causing it, or because of the weakness of the invalid, when there is only a small amount of blood, or due to time and urgency to hasten its maturity, then cauterize around it with many small cauterizing points.
Then release it.
For it will hasten its maturity.
If you wish to make a perforation with a cauterizing tool, then use a cauterizing tool, the form of which is as follows.
And place it in the middle of the Adubelati until it penetrates the skin: and let the cauterizing tool be from what follows for the invalid, that the course may be aided by pure matters.
Then care for it until it is cured.
¶ Concerning the method of cauterizing in a malign corruption. Head IV.
A malign corruption is nothing but decay in a walking member, and it eats into it: just as fire consumes dry wood.
If therefore you see a malign corruption in a place that can bear cauterization with fire, then use many cauterizing tools with small and large points of steel, according to what is suitable for the place where the corruption is.
Then cauterize it from every side until you eradicate the entire corruption, and nothing remains thereof at all. Then let it be released for three days, and place upon the cauterized areas sulfur ground with oil until all eschars are eradicated and all corruption is gone.
Then attend to it with ointments promoting flesh growth.
If therefore you find that after three days healthy flesh is growing, where there is no corruption, it is good.
And if not: then reapply the cautery to what remains from the corrupted areas.
And when necessary, treat by corroding with a sharp medicine.
It rises then in the place cauterized.
However, the cautery with fire is quicker in healing: and I have indeed already said that cauterization with sharp medicine in division: take it there when you find it appropriate.
¶ On the Method of Cauterizing the Wrists and Knuckles. Head 55.
This illness often occurs in the lower parts of the feet and is a thick, filtered substance that damages the foot. And the cautery for these areas is according to two methods: cautery with fire, and cautery with warm water.
As for the cautery with fire, you should use a cauterium concavum similar to an eagle's feather: it should be made of iron, according to its size, leaving no part whole and having fine edges.
Then place the heated object on the tongs. Then turn the hand with the cautery around the circumference of the tongs until the cautery reaches the depth of the tongs: and let it remain for three days until pus begins to discharge. Then plaster the area with bad celestial herbs, crushed with salt, and let the plaster remain on it at night. It will be uprooted from its roots.
Then care for the wound with flesh-generating ointment until it heals.
If they do not turn red and often occur on the surface of the body, particularly on the hands and feet, then apply cauterization with warm water: and take a cannula made of copper, iron, or vulture's feather, and place it on the tongs or aloes.
Then throw a small quantity of water from the warm cannula onto the area: hold your hand and gently turn it with the compression of your hand slightly, so that the edge of the cannula presses into the base of the tongs, and allows the warm water to find its way to the depth, to the base of the tongs: and let the patient wait for about an hour after the mordication of the warm water.
Then remove it, for the tongs will be uprooted along with its base.
Do this one after another until you have treated all those affected on the body.
Then care for them after they are uprooted with flesh-generating ointments.
On the manner of cauterizing in Tremor.
Head 56.
When a person experiences Tremor from cold on the nerve, or from quartan fever, or from another cause: then it must be that you cauterize it with four or five cauterizations over the vertebrae of the back, and between each vertebra with one cauterization, and in his chest with one cauterization, and over his stomach with one cauterization.
Tremor indeed ceases with cauterization using olive oil, and recovery from the cold illness speeds up. On the manner of cauterizing Albathir.
Head 57.
Sometimes Albathir, which is a term for foul pustules formed from corrupted fatty materials, are expelled from the body.
Therefore, when they appear, it must be that the heads of the pustules are cauterized with a fine cautery using myrtle wood, whose end is ignited with fire.
Or with the root of long aristolochia.
Or with a lentil-shaped cautery. And sometimes they are cauterized with ademenul at the beginning of their expulsion according to this manner: and do not increase: and the excess is broken, making them heal from it.
Indeed, it must be done after evacuation with bloodletting.
On the method of cauterizing in a blood flow from an artery in a wound.
Chapter LVIII. Many times a blood flow from an artery occurs, which has been cut near the wound, either externally or near the incision of an abscess, or cautery of the member, and similar cases: and it becomes difficult to separate it.
When therefore this occurs to someone, then hasten with your hand to the opening of the artery, and place your index finger over it: and press it strongly until the blood is obliged to remain under your finger and nothing escapes from it. Then place on the fire small olive oil cauters in great number: and blow upon them until they are thoroughly ignited.
Then take one of them, whether small or large, according to the wound and place where the artery is cut, and place the cautery over the vein. After that, remove your finger quickly. And hold the cautery until the blood is separated.
And if the blood is expelled as you raise your finger from the opening of the artery and you extinguish the cautery, then quickly take another cautery from those prepared on the fire. Therefore, do not cease to do this with one after another until the blood is separated.
And beware that you do not burn the nerve there, and other evils befall the weak. And know that when blood flows from an artery, it is not possible to separate it; especially when the artery is large, unless with one of four methods.
Or with a cautery, as we have said.
Or with extraction, when it has not been extracted. For when it is extracted, the extremities thereof are drawn together, and the blood is cut off.
For when it is extracted, the extremities thereof are drawn together, and the blood is cut off. Or it may be ligatured with a strong ligature.
Or let medicines with the property of cutting off blood be placed upon it, and let it be bound with a suitable constrictive bandage.
Those who perform the amputation with a ligature and stricture using a bandage, or by placing combustible materials, do not provide it thoroughly, except rarely.
If, however, such a thing happens to someone, and there is no physician or medicine at hand: then he should begin by placing his index finger over the opening of the vein itself, as we have described, and by stricking it strongly until the blood is blocked from the upper part of the wound, and above the artery.
And the finger should not be removed until the blood is cooled and congealed, and thickened, and then cut off. And meanwhile, let him consider what is needed from the cautery or from medicine.
¶ End of the First Part.
Liber Chirurgici Albucasis Pars II. ¶ On Incision, Puncture, and Phlebotomy in Wounds and Similar Cases.
We have already said in Chapter One that every disease wherein it is appropriate to use the cautery and burning medicine, and the occasions of its use, and its causes, and the instruments thereof, and the forms of cauterization. And I have placed there chapters from the head to the foot.
And I will proceed in this chapter the same way: that which alleviates what is sought for the seeker. And before I begin with this, you must learn, my sons, that which is here in this chapter regarding the fear that is mentioned in the first chapter on cauterization.
And because of this, it must be a warning more severe, for in the operation which is in this chapter, frequently evacuation with blood occurs, from which life stands at the opening of the vein, or incision over an abscess, or opening of the sinus, or healing of the wound, or removal of an arrow, or incision over a stone, and similar things: from all of which there arises trembling, fear, and death falls upon many of them.
And I warn you, lest that which causes hesitation fall upon you, for sometimes such people with conditions of illness fall into your art.
For among them are those who are angry with their illness, and death is light to him because of the intensity of what he finds from his illness and the length of his wickedness.
And when the illness is from fear, which signifies death.
And among them is one who gives his beneficence and enriches you with it, hoping for health, yet his illness is harmful. Therefore, you ought not to agree to him who comes to you from those whose method is such.
And let your caution be greater than your cupidity and your rapacity.
And do not presume upon anything from it unless after certain knowledge, which is verified among you by a succession of events that leads to a worthy outcome.
And use your skill in the cure of all your sick, prognosis, and direction concerning what is conducive to their health.
In that, indeed, you have assistance in the attainment of fame and glory, and memory and praise.
May God inspire you, my sons, with his wisdom, and may he not take away your direction and inspiration: for that is in his hand.
And I have indeed arranged this Chapter by dividing it into sections, as it preceded in the Chapter on Cauterization from the neck to the feet: so that you may find what you seek and what you need from it.
¶ On the cure of water that aggregates in children's heads.
Chapter I.
Know that this illness often occurs in children after birth: or when the midwife tightens the child's head without delicacy.
And it also occurs from a hidden cause which is unknown.
And I have indeed not seen this illness in anyone other than children, and death came to every one of them whom I saw. Therefore, it seemed to me fitting to refrain from operating on it.
And I indeed saw a boy whose head was filled with water, and his head enlarged every day until he could not sit upon himself because of the greatness of his head: and the moisture increased until he died.
And this moisture aggregates either between the skin and the mouth: or beneath the bone above the jaw.
And the operation in such a case, if there is moisture between the skin and the mouth, and the abscess is small, then it is necessary to make a single fissure in the middle of the head with a width of about two nodes, until the moisture flows.
And this is the form of spatumils.
If therefore the moisture is more increased, and the abscess is larger, then place two fissures according to this form.
And if the moisture is beneath the bone, and the sign of it is that you see the openings of the skull widely separated from all sides: and when you compress it with your hand on the inside, water is pressed down and does not hide itself from you: then it is necessary to make three fissures in the middle of the head according to this manner.
And after the incision, extract all the moisture.
Then embrocate it from above with wine and oil until the fifth day.
Then remove the bandage, and care for the wound with dressings and ointments.
And do not allow the head to be bound with equality.
And food for the sick should be of such kind as is slightly moist, until the member is strengthened and cured.
And another mode of incision is that you consider where the magnitude of the abscess and the collection of water are apparent.
For sometimes there is more in the occiput, or in the forehead, or on the right side, or on the left side.
Therefore ascend with the incision where you see the abscess and collection of water, and cut it according to what is possible for you.
And observe, lest you cut the artery, and a blood flow occurs, and the sick person dies from that flow along with the evacuation of moisture.
¶ Concerning the Incision of Arteries Behind the Ears.
Head II.
When catarrhs affect someone's eyes or chest, and the condition worsens without improvement from medical treatment, then incision of these two arteries is the more serious remedy.
Therefore, when you wish to incise them, the sick person should shave their head.
Then rub the area with a rough cloth to make the arteries apparent.
Then the sick person should tie their neck with any cloth they have.
Then consider where the vein pulses.
And the locations are those areas behind the ears that are depressed: and they are rarely hidden, except in some people.
Then mark with cauterization on both sides: and cut both with a scalpel on either side sharply, the incision arriving at the mouth: and let it be done through the breadth of the head.
And if you wish, introduce the scalpel under the artery, and cut it upwards with an incision.
And let the length of the incision be about two joined fingers.
For when the vein is cut, blood issues forth with pulsating flow, which leaps to the interior in frequent jumps.
If the artery does not appear by touch, then one must measure from the ear the width of three fingers.
Then mark with cauterization, and cut until you reach the mouth.
And that which ought to be drawn from the blood is six ounces, and perhaps you will draw more or less. Do this entire procedure according to the quantity which appears to you from the condition of the patient and the filling of his artery.
Then consider the wound.
Then if anything remains up to the mouth, cut that away, so that a hot abscess does not occur: then ligate the wound with sutures from linen cloth.
Then care for it with ointment until it heals.
¶ Concerning the extraction of arteries, which are in the temples.
Chapter III.
When it happens to a man that he has ancient hemicrania, or acute cataracts due to humid acrid mists, and the heat of seasons, or soda ancient and violent, and similar to these: and is treated with methods of medical cure, and does not yield to such: then in these diseases we have experienced extraction of arteries from the seasons, or cauterization of them, as we have narrated.
And the method of operation in extracting them is that the sick man shaves the hairs that are on the seasons, and directs himself to the apparent artery in the season.
It is shown to you from his pulse, and rarely hides itself except in a few men or frenzy of cold.
If it hides itself from you, then the sick man should tie his head with any of his clothes: then rub the place with a rough cloth.
Or use vapor from hot water until it appears to you in a clear manifestation. Then take the spatumiles, which I formed for you before. Then scrape the skin with it easily until you reach the artery.
Then thrust the hook into it, and draw it upward until you extract it from the skin, and make it emerge through the tunics beneath it from all sides.
If the artery is fine, then wrap it with the hook's extremity.
Then cut from it according to the length of its extremities when they are extended and contracted, so as not to cause a flow of blood.
For if it is not incised and not cut, the blood does not rise completely. Then evacuate from the blood ana 6 unciae, until .3.
If the artery is large: then you must tie it in two places with a double, strong thread of silk or from alhoahod, so that putrefaction does not occur before the wound is consolidated and there is a flux of blood.
Then incise the excess, which is between the two ligatures.
Do that at that hour, or after another hour. And if you wish, cauterize it with a cautery until the ends of it are incised, and let it remain in its place for the completion of the work.
And it is better to do this work, unless the patient has a fever, or a heated complexion.
Since the cautery is used to help dry up humidities.
Therefore it is better aid.
And it is necessary after the extraction of the arteries to fill the place with old cloth, and to place there poultices properly made.
And after the poultice is removed, treat with dry medicines that cause flesh to grow, and with linens, until it is healed.
If meanwhile, while you are working, there is a flux of blood from the artery, then rush to cut it off with a cautery, or to fill the place with grease, and hold your hand tight until the blood is stopped.
If none of those are present for you, then place your finger over the spot, until the blood congeals.
And apply the embrocation to the place with water of great coldness, until the sharpness subsides and is drawn according to what is required.
And because it is lighter and easier for the extraction of the artery, cauterize the vein with this cauterium having two knives: let the sharpness of the two knives be similar to alum.
Yet they have much less sharpness than two knives.
For if they are as sharp as two knives, the cold will affect both of them quickly: and they do not strike the flesh with speed.
For when there is a certain thickness in them, the heat of the fire is sustained in them, and the flesh is cut quickly: therefore this is better for every work, lighter, and easier.
And let the space between the two knives be the width of a finger, after you mark two places with cauterization: and extinguish both fires greatly until they reach the surface and strike the vein in two places: so that it is extended between its extremities.
For they do not become completely consolidated with this cauterization.
And this is the form of the cauterization.
¶ On the care for chronic sharp tears from the eyes.
Head IV.
When there are frequent tears, and the course of their flow is from the veins that are above the skull externally: and medicine does not confer any cure upon them with medicines, and you see the face of the sick person already reddening, and he feels a movement on his forehead, as it were ants moving: and his eyes are attenuated, wet, so that now the hairs on them have been corroded by corrosion: and his eyelids are heated from the acuteness of the tears: then in their cure, the ancients required this operation, and they called it a cure with the Knife.
And you shall order the sick person to shave the hair that is on his forehead.
Then make three incisions on the forehead at equal distances according to the length of the forehead: and let the length of each incision be about two fingers wide. One incision should be equidistant from the length of the nose in the middle of the forehead, the second slightly according to the length between the eyebrows, and the third from the other side: and take care to avoid cutting the arteries that are on both sides: and extend your hand away from the continuity of the lower jaws, and let the length of every incision be three finger-widths. Have prepared for you a slice of sponge or many dried cloths with which you may dry the blood.
Then insert two sharp-pointed probes, the form of which follows shortly.
From the incision which is on the side of the temple, to the second incision: and scrape off with it the entire skin which is between the two incisions, together with the sebaceous matter that is above the mouth. Then do the same from the middle incision to the second incision.
Then withdraw this spatula, and introduce into the first incision again another instrument, which is called the sharp knife, gently from one side, not sharply from the other.
And this is its form.
And place its sharp side toward the flesh attached with skin, and its blunt side toward the mouth: and thrust it until it reaches the middle fissure: and cut with it all vessels that descend from the head to the eyes: provided that the incision is continued until that which appears from the skin.
Then do this in the middle fissure until it reaches the other fissure.
And after an equal quantity of blood runs out, express the places from the fragments of coagulated blood. Then place lint from old cloth into all the fissures, and place little sponges soaked in wine, oil, or vinegar over them.
And see that no hot abscess occurs.
And on the third day, loosen the ligature, and administer a large infusion with warm water.
Then care for it with basilicon ointment and other ointments used for wounds until it is healed.
¶ Concerning the care of acute lachrymal and catarrhal conditions affecting the eyes from internal parts of the head.
Chapter V.
When acute, severe, and frequent catarrhs occur to someone, and you see his eyes thin, small, and already weakened in their appearance: and the eyelids are ulcerated, and hair falls from them, and there is a sharp, painful pain deep in the head, accompanied by sneezing: then take from these occurrences what those materials and catarrhs do not come, unless from many veins.
And better treatment for them is this.
And you should shave the patient's forehead.
Then make one incision in the fissure on the middle of the forehead, or on the other slightly by breadth, and begin with the incision from the left side to the right side: let the cut extend to the mouth: and keep your hand away from the temporal bones, which move near chewing: until when the mouth is uncovered: and dry all the blood with a sponge.
Then separate between the two lips of the incision with an old probe, or with linen forceps.
Then suture from above with stitches: and soak the needles in wine and oil, so that no hot abscess occurs.
And when you dissolve that and see that the hot abscess is diminishing, then you should foment the mouth until flesh begins to grow there.
Then care for it with an exsiccative regimen that causes flesh to grow: as, for example, if you take two parts of wheat flour and four parts of colophony: prepare an ointment from these, and apply it to the growth of flesh in these wounds.
¶ Concerning the care of what falls into the Ear. Head VI. Everything that falls into the ear is one of four species: either a mineral stone, or similar to a stone, such as iron and glass: or it is from a plant, such as beans and peas: or it is a fluid substance, such as water and vinegar and things similar to them: or some animal.
When therefore a stone or kind of stone that does not grow in the ear falls into the ear, expose the ear to the sun: if therefore you see the stone, then drop something from violet oil or sesame oil into the ear.
Then administer the extraction of it, and make him sneeze when you place [the remedy] in, and plug the nostrils at the approach of sneezing. After you put fragments from cloths or wool in the surroundings of the ear, and extend the ear向上.
For it often emerges with this care.
If it does not emerge, then administer the extraction with Gesti, i.e.,细密甘草:其形状是这样的。
If it emerges with Gesti, it is good.
And if not, then administer the extraction with a fine hook of few doublings. If it does not emerge through that, then make a tube of metal, and introduce the end of the tube into the ear canal much, and plug what is in the surroundings of the tube with softened wax and oil, so that there is no passage except through the tube: then extract it with your strong suction. For it often emerges with what we have described.
If it does not emerge this way, then take from helkalimbat or from uisco, i.e., prepared gluten with which birds are caught, a small quantity: and place it at the end of the radius after you envelop it with a cloth properly placed: then introduce it into the ear canal with ease, after you dry the ear from moisture.
If therefore it does not emerge with all that we have narrated, then hasten to incise before a hot abscess or spasm occurs.
And the measure of the incision is that the phlebotomist should first bleed the weak in the cephalic region: and draw from him blood according to the measure of his strength.
Then make the patient sit between your hands, and turn his ear upward, and make a small incision at the root of the ear beside the fat in a depressed place: and let the incision be crescent-shaped until you reach the stone; then remove it along with whatever is possible for you with your instruments.
Then attend to the incision according to your hour with speed and care until it heals.
If what falls into the ear is from one of those grains that grow and swell: then administer its extraction.
If it does not yield to you for removal, then take a thin spoon-like instrument, fine and according to this form.
And administer with it the excision of that kind from the grains which fall into the ear, and do not do this when you think that grain is already moistened by the vapor of the ear until you place many fragments thereof: then remove them with forceps, or with a fine hook, or with suction, as we have said, for its extraction should be facilitated.
In water that enters the ear, the patient should use a sneeze when first placed there: and now it has filled his ear with a bit of old decoction: and he is lying on that ear where the water is.
If therefore it emerges through that, it is good.
And if not: then take many small stones, according to the length of a finger, thin and soft, and heat them slightly with fire, and let the patient take one from those and insert it into the hole in his ear: and let one stone fall from his foot on that side, and strike it with another stone on the stone that is in the ear.
Therefore do not cease with the stone and the stone until all the water emerges.
And now water is emerging such that you may take one end of a piece of cotton or a splint and insert it into the ear: and ignite the other end with fire until most of it burns.
Then iterate with another splint, and do this many times until all the water emerges: and extract it using a tube according to what was previously mentioned on the stone.
In the extraction of an animal entering there, if it is a small creature such as a louse or similar, care for it as I said in the division.
But if it is a large creature, which is apparent by sense: then administer its extraction with forceps and hooks: and this is easier than all that is held within the ear.
In the extraction of a worm generated in the ear, when you treat it as we said in the division and in the discussion of distillations, and if your treatment does not见效： then you should examine the ear in the sunlight.
If therefore something from the worms is apparent there, then extract it with forceps or with thin hooks.
If, however, nothing appears there, then take a cannula, whose form is thus, narrow below, wide above: and introduce the fine end according to the quantity which the sick person tolerates: then suck with a strong suction.
Perform this many times until all the worms emerge.
If, however, they do not obey you to go out, then surround the wound with the point of a knife as I said on the stone.
If they do not emerge with what we have said: then administer the distillations which the ancients used for the destruction of worms, and you will find this in the treatise on distillations.
And let your application be with the oil and medicines you pour into the ear using this instrument, whose form is depicted here.
As you see, make it from silver or bronze, narrow below with a small hole, and wide above.
Let it be such that the part of the cannula that is pressed, which is in its concavity, be made from bronze off-centered.
And if you wish, take a ray, and wrap it at the end with cotton in a suitable winding: then project oil, or juice, or what you wish from these medicines into the cannula: and let it be in the ear: then introduce the ray with the cotton above, and express it with your hand using gentle compression until the oil is pushed into the concavity of the ear, and the sick person feels it internally: and that which is poured into the ear may now be heated slightly with fire: and beware lest what is distilled into it be very cold: for medicines do not tolerate that.
On the care of complications of the ear.
Head VII.
Sometimes infants emerge from their mothers' wombs unperforated.
And it has also happened to some individuals that perforation of the ear occurred either through a wound or as flesh growing there.
And this perforation sometimes occurs in the deep part of the ear canal, which does not affect hearing: and sometimes it happens to the outer part of the ear canal only, and affects that hearing.
That which occurs in the deep part of the ear and which the appearance does not reveal is in many cases difficult to cure.
And for that which affects hearing, you should place the ear of the patient in the sun and examine it: then if you see a perforation appearing, open it with a probe that is very fine, whose shape is as follows—the end has a small width and one part is sharp, while the rest of the probe has two gentle sides so as not to damage the ear.
If the perforation is caused by flesh growing in the ear canal, then hold it with a fine forceps and cut it with vigorous ease until all the flesh is removed.
If the perforation is in the deep part of the ear, then take a fine, gentle probe and heat it slightly with fire: then insert it into the ear canal.
If therefore you sense the perforation along with the great hearing loss that the patient has, try to open it with ease: and beware, lest you injure the nerves of the ear.
Then place a wick in the ear according to the width of the opening, which you have enclosed in Egyptian ointment: do this for several days until you are assured of the healing of the wound.
Or take a wick, and infuse it in rosewater, and powder over it ground zegi, and use it.
If you see the ear already suppurating: then it is necessary to remove the wick, and let it be with another wick which you enclose in cerate made with rose oil until the hot abscess settles: then care for it until it is healed.
If, however, there is a bleeding: then submerge a sponge or cloth in cold water and place it over the ear: and continue with the remaining treatment which stops the flow of blood as described in the treatise on distillations.
¶ Concerning the care of eyelids.
Head VIII. These eyelid ailments (Althelil) sometimes are humid and sometimes dry.
Therefore, you should hold them with forceps or with forceps, and incise them from their roots with a spatula.
Then place ground zegi over the affected areas.
If, however, blood flows from them, then cauterize them with a thin lens-shaped cautery.
And cauterizing them is better after incision.
For they often return when something remains from their roots.
And when they are cauterized with fire, those roots are burned, and they do not return.
¶ Concerning the Care of Granulations of the Eyelids.
Head IX.
Often something occurs on the eyelids that is similar to granules in its strength and hardness, and for this reason it is called granulation: it is an aggregation of thick moisture on the upper eyelid and the lower eyelid.
Therefore, the operation on them is this: consider whether the granulation is spreading from something apparent on the eyelid and moving to all parts, and its nature is easy.
Make therefore an incision over it lengthwise.
Then scrape it off from all sides with ease until it comes out.
Then suspend it with a forceps, and cut it out.
If the excision of it is not prepared for you, so that you can cut it out only after you penetrate the eyelid with a slight incision, then it may harm the patient in some way.
If the incision is large, then suture it and care for it until it heals.
And if it is small, no harm will come to you from it.
For ointment restores it and causes it to heal.
And if a stone is turned inward toward the inner ear surface, then turn back the eyelid, and hang the stone with a hook: besides which you need an incision, and press it from every part.
And if the eyelid is drawn out by an incision, it will not harm that in any way.
Then wash the eye after the incision with the stone and salted water: and take care of the area as it heals until the sick person is cured.
¶ Concerning the care of eyelids.
Chapter X.
Axirnath is the fat that forms in the upper eyelid tissues: and it happens most frequently with children. This fat burdens their eyes, and causes them to have cataracts in the mornings, and they cannot look at the sun's light because the tears rush to their eyes. Because of this, you see them always lying on their faces and sleeping on them, and their eyelids beneath their eyebrows are wet, which is now covered by inflammation: and the appearance of Axirnath is evident to the eye, and when you press the area with your fingers, you feel Axirnath between them.
And the method of its treatment is that the sick person places his head in your lap.
Then take a linen cloth, and prepare lint on it, and make from that lint a circle according to the size of the Axirnath around all parts.
Then place it over the affected area, and press it with your fingers from all sides, so that the Axirnath collects in the center of the circle.
Then find in the middle of that humidity with a probe incident and note the fissures running laterally, and let not that larger fissure be which is made in phlebotomy in depth.
Or you must find the skin wholly until you reach Axirnath, for Axirnath proceeds from the fissure according to the form of a fragment of white fat.
Therefore, extract it with a cloth which you have moistened between your fingers and bring it to the exterior: and you turn your hand to the right and left until it is dispersed: and beware, lest you add to the fissure, so that you do not reach with the probe the eye and injure it.
If, however, Axirnath does not appear to you at the beginning of the fissure, you must add to the fissure a little with facility until Axirnath proceeds.
Therefore, extract it as we have said.
Therefore, immerse the cloths in vinegar and water, and place them over the area, and bind it with wicks.
And there are some who grind salt and place it in the depression of the fissure, so that what remained from that humidity may liquefy.
Therefore, take care of it until it is healed.
If, however, an热乎的脓肿出现在该处，那么用镇热的药膏护理它，直到痊愈。
¶ Concerning the treatment of Ataxmira of the eye, that is, when the eyelid becomes softened and causes wrinkling as it should not.
Head XI.
When hairs grow on the eyelids in addition to the natural course of hair and become thickened: then they harm the eye, and cause diseases such as frequent tears, softening of the eyelids, and cloudiness, until it leads to the destruction of the eye.
And Ataxmir's eye is cured according to four methods. Or by cauterization with fire.
Or with sharp medicine, as prescribed in the chapter on cauterization.
Or Ataxmir is cured by incision and suturing.
Or with a catheter, as I will say.
You must place the patient's head in your lap.
Then turn the eyelid of the eye with your left hand.
If it turns, it is good.
And if it does not turn, insert the needle into that part which contains the thread from the lower part of the eyelid, and let the needle penetrate with the thread from above, and be close to the hairs, that is, near the margin of the eyelid where the hairs grow. Then pull the thread up with the eyelid and turn it with a pin.
Then puncture the inner part of the eyelid under the additional hairs with a spatula gradually moving from the larger lacrimal gland to the smaller one.
Then extract the thread, and place a small lint of cotton or cloth under the eyelid: then mark the eyelid with wax, which should be like the figure of a myrtle leaf.
True enough, the figure must be made according to the size and elevation of the eyelid: for this varies among people.
For there are those who require that a large quantity be incised from the eyelid, according to the amount that is softened by the eyelid. Then, using the spatula, cut between the two lines you have marked, and begin from the larger lacrimal gland to the smaller one, and let the incision be near the natural eyelashes, as is the thickness of a radius.
Then insert the hook into one of the angles of the skin. Then strip away the entire layer. Then sew the two lips together with a needle and fine wool thread. Dry the blood, and make what flows from the threads above the two eyebrows adhere, along with some viscous substances if you wish to do so: if not, you need not worry about it.
Then remove the stitches and thread until three days or four have passed: then care for it. And if you wish, leave the wound without stitches and care for it along with what dries and constricts it.
For the eyelid will be elevated at the sealing of the wound and its sewing: but it will be better in the future.
This method of treating Ataxmir the ancients have taught.
True indeed is concern for the patient, and this is from good practice, and there is no fear in it.
And another method is for Ataxmir as well: and it is that you mark a figure on the eyelid, which should be like the shape of a myrtle leaf, as we have described.
Then lift the eyelid with three separated or aggregated hooks, according to the following shape, and then cut away what is superfluous with small pincers, according to this form, with equality in the incision.
If, however, it is not possible for you to hold the hook and it is not equal: then take a needle with thread and introduce it into the middle of the figure. And introduce another thread near the larger lacrimal duct, and another thread near the smaller lacrimal duct. Hold the threads between your fingers with equality.
Then lift your hand with an equal lifting motion, and lift the skin upon which the mark is made, as we have described.
Then suture the two edges of the wound together: and care for it until it heals.
If, however, an abscess occurs at your incision or fissure, treat the abscess with a cautery and similar substances from soothing ointments.
And sometimes it happens that the eyelashes also turn inward.
Of the care of Ataxmires with canes.
And it is, as the eyelid is turned and the fissure inside is incised, as I have narrated.
Then make two canes or two thin sticks, whose length be according to the length of the eyelid, and their width be less than the width of a spasmus: and you have already cut at the extremities from both sides where you hold the threads.
Then join both with a fine needle to what surplus remains from the eyelid, and tightly tie the two canes from both sides with a strong ligature, and remove it after a few days. For the skin tightened will die, and become darkened and putrefied until it falls off by itself.
If therefore it is delayed, then cut it with pincers.
Then care for it until it heals.
When therefore it is consolidated, lift the eyelid: and the hairs will not irritate.
And this is the form of the two canes, which you should make according to this shape and size in length and width.
Of the removal of irritating hairs from the eye with a needle.
Head XII.
The operation is this: take a fine needle and insert a thread of fine, soft silk into it. Then join its ends together, and tie them with a very fine knot: and let the length of the threads be one hand's breadth.
Then compose another fine thread under it in brief, and knot the ends thereof if you wish.
Then the patient should place his head in your lap, and let it be near the sun to determine the operation: for it is a subtle or minor operation.
Then insert the awl with the linen thread into the root of the eyelid, and make it penetrate the eyelid quickly, until you pull it out from above the natural hair.
Then pull the hair until it is above the linen thread: and insert that hair into the linen thread: if there is one, or two, or three, not more.
Then pull your hand with it until the hair comes out with the linen thread from the eyelid along with the natural hair.
If, however, the linen thread is pulled out and no hair comes out with it: pull the linen thread to the inside, using the thread that you inserted into it, until the linen thread comes out from the upper opening, and you see it with your eye: then you pull the linen thread and the thread that you composed in it, and extract both, and close the eye: and leave it closed for two or three days until the hair adheres to its place and grows above the same flesh.
If the hair is short, then either associate it with a longer hair from the natural hairs, and it will be pulled out with it: or leave it alone until it lengthens over time, and then pull it out.
¶ Concerning the care of Alxatrati which occurs in the upper eyelid.
Chapter XIII.
When this happens to the eye according to Alxatrati, it is called Leporina.
And this according to Alxatrati is either natural or accidental.
Therefore, it is accidental through the consolidation of a wound, or a section, or a cautery, and similar conditions.
And the method of treatment is this: you must find that consolidation, and separate its margins, and place something licit from linen between them, and bind it until it heals.
And you must not use things that dry and constrict in its treatment. For if you do that, it becomes worse than it was according to Alxatrati: rather, use things that soften, such as hay, and a compress with water in which althea has been boiled, flaxseed, and dyaquilon ointment, melted with some oil. Wrap something licit around it and care for it accordingly.
And your store of treatment is to use every means possible so that it does not consolidate according to the original form.
And this operation that we have described is nothing more than a correction of Alxatrati so that it does not return to the original form of the place. ¶ Concerning the treatment of Alxatrati that occurs in the lower eyelid, which is a wrinkling or contraction upwards to the right and left.
Chapter XIV.
This according to Alxatrati that occurs below is truly called Alxatrati.
And it is natural, and it is accidental.
And it is accidental, arising from a wound, or crack, or cautery, and things similar to these.
And the way of operation therein is, that you take a needle with a double thread, and dye it in flesh, and make it penetrate from the left lacrimal to the right lacrimal until the thread reaches the two extremities of the flesh.
Then extend the flesh upwards with a needle, and cut it with a broad spatula.
If therefore the shape of the eyelid returns as it should, it is good.
And if it does not return to its shape as it should, take a needle, place it in the crack, and turn with it the eyelid: and make two cracks on the inner side of the eyelid, and let the ends of the two cracks be from the two angles of the incision until they meet and form an angle: until they come together, let this shape be formed, and it is the letter lambda in Greek.
Then remove that flesh in the amount of its acute lower side, from what follows the eyelid.
Then unite the separated parts: suture them with wool thread.
Then care for them with what we have said about medicaments that soften and are harmless until they are healed.
And if Alxatrati occurs from a crack, and suture, or cautery: then you must make a flat crack beneath the eyelashes, even according to what preceded.
Then separate between the two lips with a ligature, as we have said.
And the summary of Alxatrati's care, whether above or below, is that the operation should run through it, according to how it is prepared from the form of Alxatrati.
For it is of many diverse forms. And the skilled artisan prepares the instrument in any possible way until it returns to or approaches the natural form, and the patient himself, according to what is appropriate for him from the operation and instruments in many dispositions.
On the adhesion of the eyelid to the conjunctiva or cornea.
Head XV.
Sometimes this consolidation occurs in many people, such that the upper eyelid fuses with the whitish part of the eye, and thereby prevents it from performing its natural functions.
Therefore, you must introduce the extremity of the needle under the eyelid and lift it upwards: or extend it with a hook: then incise the adhesion with a thin spatula, which should not be sharp but slightly obtuse: so that the patient is not disturbed during the operation, and the spatula be removed without damaging the eye with its sharpness: and your incision should be such that you dissolve the adhesion easily until when the eyelid returns to its natural form and the entire adhesion is healed.
Then pour saline water into the eye and wash it with water: or distill into it from a sieve made from zinc dissolved in water.
Then separate between the eyelid and the eye with a thread: and place over the eye wool steeped in a mixture of alum: and after three days use the syringe, and with catgut sutures until it is healed.
¶ Incision of the nail and prominence of tear-carving flesh.
Head XVI.
Know that the nail is in two modes. Or it is nervous and is similar to a hard, fine strand.
Or it is not nervous and is similar to white moisture that when touched by iron, or you try to grasp it with a hook, it breaks off and the hook does not stick in it.
And neither type begins unless from the larger tear duct, gradually flowing until it covers the vision and obstructs both the light and the movement of the eye.
And the method of incising it is this: the sick person should place his head in your lap.
Then open his eyes and lift the eyelid with your hand.
Then gather the nail with a hook of few doublings and extend it upwards.
Then take a needle and insert a thread from the hairs of a horse, cow, or goat. Let it be strong and double the end of the needle slightly, and fix it in the middle of the nail. Pierce it with the needle and ligate the nail with the thread, extending it upwards. Remove the outer layer of hair of the nail that follows the pupil as if you were sewing it with the hair until its root.
Then cut the remainder at the root of the lacrimal gland with a sharp spoon or with small forceps: and let the natural lacrimal flesh be removed, so that there does not occur an incessant flow of tears from incision of it.
And sometimes the nail is extended with a single hook: or with a thread, as we have said.
Then it is scraped with a gentle spoon, whose form is as follows.
And be careful that the spoon does not touch the corneal tunic, and there is no rupture therein, and the pupil is perforated.
Then after the incision, cast something of crushed salt or sifted zinc into the eye, and let it remain until another day.
Then care for it with what is necessary until it is healed. If the nail is not nerveous, and you cannot introduce a needle into it, nor can a hook be fixed in it, then this species of nail is treated multiple times with medications, and is healed as I have described in the division.
If you wish to cut it, then open the eye of the sick person, and take a gentle, thin spoon with a slight edge, as follows in form.
And scrape the nail from above with reason and subtlety.
If you see that it becomes rarefied and fragmented, and reason presses against it, then distill into the eye from your hour with a sieve made of zinc or a red sieve, or crushed salt: and treat the eye until another day.
Then repeat the operation upon itself until everything is removed.
Unless there be contrary in the eye, an hot boil; then let the boil alone, and care for the boil until it is healed. Then repeat the operation upon itself with reason until it is healed.
The prominence of the tear gland, if it harms the eye greatly, is to be suspended with a hook, and cut from that part: but not the last incision, so that the course of tears does not occur.
Then drop a red dye or one made from zinc into the tear gland until it is healed. ¶ Incision of Alguardenic, and flesh that appears in the eye.
Chapter XVII.
It occurs sometimes in some eyes of humans a red flesh composed of or superposed upon tissue, until it covers the pupil, or approaches, or strings over the eyelids, and perhaps turns the eyelids outward: and it is similar to the rose balloon flower.
And the operation for this condition is such that the sick person places his head in your lap.
Then open his eyes, and remove that flesh entirely with hooks suitable for this purpose: and hold it with one forceps or claw.
Then cut the flesh first until all of it is removed with forceps.
And be careful around the eye so as not to harm it during the operation: and let your incision be such that you cut it, or with a spatula as we described in the cutting of the nail: or with small forceps, with which abscesses are removed, according to what form it takes after this chapter.
When therefore your incision is completed and the whole alguardenici is removed, then fill the eye with pulverized salt: or distill into it red powder, and similar things from medicinals corrosive: and place outside the eye a cloth with white ointment upon it: that it may be secured from a hot aposteme.
If however something remains of the alguardenici and hot blood dominates you, and you fear a hot aposteme, then let the eye alone, and treat it with whatever calms the aposteme.
Then iterate over it with the operation until it is healed.
And similarly treat it with flesh added which occurs in the eye of this kind.
However, it is necessary to keep the cure of any weak eye from either the natural or accidental way, by operating with iron: and do not insert your hand into any of these operations until you see that that member can bear that operation.
¶ Concerning the Collection of Sebil from the Eye.
Chapter XVIII. Sebil are red veins that weave over the eye, and obstruct the natural function of vision: and weaken the eye over a length of days.
It is therefore necessary for you first to consider whether the eye in which there is sebil is strong, and has no other illness besides the sebil: then collect the sebil from it.
And you must direct the patient to place his head on your lap.
Then suspend those veins with one hook or two according to your discretion: and let the hook be thin of double thickness, according to this form, or let there be two hooks graduated in one body, according to this form.
Then collect those veins with thin forceps and remove the blood hour by hour until you see those veins removed from the eye and resolved: and beware not to injure the eye with the sharp ends.
And let your operation be in the middle of the day before the sun, and be very firm in your operation: so that you do not cut anything but those veins.
And when you have completed, then drop in the eye a green or red solution: so that it may refine with its sharpness what remained from the scab.
If, however, it is not possible for you to collect all of that in that hour, then apply a poultice to the eye with what soothes the eye pain: and let it remain for a few days until the pain is settled: and be secured from hot suppuration: then repeat over it according to the same method until it is cured.
And this is the form of the forceps.
¶ For reducing a fracture from the root of the nose to the nostril.
Chapter XVII.
The physicians call this condition "Arissati Fistula," which is treated with a cautery or with sharp burning medicine, according to what has been previously described.
And if it is not cured, then there is no hope in it: unless you find a hot suppuration at the site of birth and extract all the moisture and pus until the opening is revealed.
When therefore the mouth is discovered and you see therein corruption or blackness, then shave it with an instrument whose form is this.
And it is called Asperi capitis.
Let it be made of iron, and let its head be round like a zeir, which should be punctated with the prick of a file, or with a very fine prick of aliskilferi: and place it over the place of corruption of the bone. Then roll it between your fingers, and press your hand slightly until you know that the corruption has been shaved away: and do this several times.
Then roll it between your fingers, and press your hand slightly until you know that the corruption has been shaved away: and do this several times. Then restore the place with medicines effluvial and styptic.
If therefore the place is consolidated, and flesh grows therein, and the course of healthy discharge is cut off: and remains for forty days, and does not recur, and does not become an abscess, and no accident happens therein: then know that it is now healed.
And if not, then there is no natural healing process, except to reduce the fistula to the nostril opening, according to this form.
And you do this by discovering the bone with iron or with a sharp medicine: and when the mouth is discovered, then take a trepan according to this form, let its iron end be triangular: and its wood be a pyramid reduced in width to the end, as you see.
Then place it over the mouth: and let it be close to the lacrimal: and extend your hand from the eye a little.
Then roll your hand with the trepan until the mouth penetrates, and let the patient feel it: by which he finds air escaping from it when he holds his hand over his nose.
Therefore then restore the place with drying astringent medicines as I have taught you.
Therefore when flesh is generated and the place becomes hardened: then the material which was flowing to the exterior returns to the nose; therefore it is lighter for the patient.
¶ On the Reduction of Protrusion of the Eye. Head XX.
When the Eye protrudes completely and no harm or diminution occurs in its use, then it is necessary to relieve the patient: thereafter bleed him: afterwards place cups on the neck without incision, but with suction.
Then place on the Eye a liniment made from acacia, aloe, incense, and gum resin.
Then bind the Eye from above with a bandage over the paste with many powder particles.
And the measure of the powder particles is: take soft cloths, many of them, and each cloth should be folded four times. Make many from them, then place them one over another according to the quantity that the Eye needs: then bind them with a strong bandage over them using a firm bandage.
And repeat the placement of cups with suction without incision.
Then remove the cups, and release the bound eye day and night.
If the ligament softens again, then it is necessary to bind it tightly: thereafter remove the ligament after a day and night, as we have said.
If therefore you see the eye already returned to the fibrous membrane, it is good: and if not, then repeat the plaster, and ointments, and stricture, and suction cups until it is cured.
¶ Of the Incision of the Fibrous Membrane.
Head XXI.
When a rupture occurs in the fibrous membrane, then it protrudes and proceeds outside the eyelid as if it were a grain of sand, and disfigures the form of a man because of it, and one wishes to remove that: then an operation on it is necessary, according to what I narrate: and it is, that you introduce a needle in the root of the sand of the eye from the lower part to the upper part.
Then introduce another needle with a double thread from the lacrimal part, and make it penetrate: and release the first needle according to its position.
Then incise the place of the double thread, and ligate with it a part of the fibrous membrane around the needle: and tighten it much.
Then withdraw the needle and place over the eye wool soaked in a preparation for the eye: and leave it until the thread falls with the fibrous membrane.
Then care for the eye with it, which strengthens it, until the wound is cured.
And when the fibrous membrane is tightened from all sides with a circle of cloth until the eye protrudes greatly.
Then perforate with a sharp needle that reaches the depth of the eye, and let the watery preparation pass, and let the eye descend, and immediately insert it: then tighten it until it is cured.
On the cure of Alcomnati.
Chapter XXII.
This Aegritudo which is called Alcomnati is not anything else than sanies that aggregates in the eye, similar to water descending, and it is not itself.
And the method of treatment is, that you cause the patient to sit on a prepared seat, or to stand upright.
Then take his head with your hands from two sides, and move it until you see the sanies descend to the lower parts of the eyes.
Then fix it so that the sanies does not descend, and the vision is cleared: and the patient should see as he saw before. And if it does not descend to the lower parts, know that it is water.
If the descent of the sanies does not occur as we have said, then cause the patient to sit between your hands. Then take a fine spatula, and scrape it above the corneal membrane slightly at the point of attachment with the sclera in a circular manner until the sanies comes out.
When the sanies comes out, then let warm honey water drop into the eye, or warm water in which you have boiled fennel and honey: then treat with the remaining treatment until it is cured.
On the care of water that descends into the eye, or cataract.
Chapter XXIII.
We have already mentioned the types of water in division and what is suitable for piercing by explaining it in words. Then take that same thing according to health.
Then thou must cause the sick person to sit between thy hands square, opposite the light, near the sun: and bind his sound eye, and tightly press him: then with thy right hand take hold of the eyelid of his eye wherein is the water, if the eye be the left: or with thy left hand, if the eye be the right.
Then take with thy right hand the almug wood, if the eye be the left: or with thy left hand, if the eye be the right.
Then place the extremity of the almug wood near the crown through the thickness of the radius in the white part of the eye appearing at the lesser lacrimal gland: then drive in the almug wood with force, and thou revolveth thy hand with it until it penetrates into the whitish part of the eye: and thou shalt feel that the almug wood has now reached the empty space.
And the measure of the journey of the almug wood should be deep, measuring the space from the pupil to the end of the blackness: and this is the crown of the eye.
For thou shalt see those things in the pupil of the eye due to the clarity of the cornea.
Then place the almug wood until it reaches the place where the water is.
Then press it below with force one after another.
If therefore the water descends immediately, then the sick person will see it above what he opens his vision at once, and the almug wood in his eye.
Then rest for a moment.
If therefore water descends, then lay it down secondly, except that it goes out through the magdah.
When therefore it is applied and does not rise: then withdraw the magdah with facility: and thou turnest thy hand slowly. Then dissolve something from clear gemstone salt in water: and wash the eye internally with it.
Then place over the eye the entire mass of stuffed wool or infused linen in rose oil and albuminous matter: and bind the healthy eye with it.
We and those who are of our time place over it fine crushed barley with albuminous matter.
If the magdah does not obey you for its hardness in entering the eye, since it is from a person whose eye is exceedingly hard: then you must take a spoonile, which is called Alberid, of which this is the form.
Therefore insert with it the conjoint spoonile only, and do not put your hand into the opening: and you must do this merely to make a subtle passage for the magdah.
Then insert the magdah, as we have said.
And at the completion of your work, prepare for the sick person a bed properly made, on which he may lie on his back in a dark room: and restrain him from all movements, and from coughing: and place his food that which alleviates his nature: and let him not move his head to the right or to the left at all.
And let the bandage be kept in place according to its position until the third day. Then solve that in that dark house, and try its vision: and make it see things.
Then reduce the ligament until the seventh day.
And it should not be done at the hour of cure, or immediately after incision: rather, it should be done away with because water rises quickly through a strong appearance.
If, however, a hot abscess occurs: then you should solve the eye before the seventh day, and rectify it with that which cools the abscess until it is cooled. Then release its vision and place it over his face orally so that his vision may be regulated for a few days, himself being in that dark house.
Then he should leave the house gradually, and turn about in his chambers.
And know that in saline solutions, the student is not excused from vision oftentimes: for then he dare to look upon the operation.
And indeed one has come to us from those who are from Alairach, who said that in Alairach a magdan was perforated so that water might be suctioned through it.
Therefore, truly I have not seen anyone in your land who has done this, nor have I read of it in any of the ancient books: and it is possible that it is new.
And these are the forms of species from the magdan, so that they may stand above it for those who do not know them.
Let them be made of proper copper: and let their extremities be with the same subtlety triangular, and let the end be sharp.
Forms madga.
Of the care of flesh that is born in the nose.
Chapter XXIV.
Sometimes flesh of various kinds is born in the nose, from which something is akin to a scorpion with many feet: and from this there arises cancerous flesh, stony, of dark color; and from this there arises flesh that is soft, not of dark color.
In that which is soft from these flesh growths, neither deceitful nor cancerous, you should place the patient with his hand against the sun, and open his nostril, and thrust a hook into those flesh growths. Then draw them outward, and cut what you have grasped with a sharp, thin spatula from one side until you know that all the flesh has been completely removed.
If anything should remain from that which cannot be removed, then shave it off with one of your fine instruments, carefully, until nothing remains.
If, however, blood dominates you, or a hot abscess occurs, then apply it with what is appropriate: if it is from evil abscesses, then cauterize it until the blood ceases to flow and all the flesh is removed.
Then pour vinegar, or water, or wine into the nose after incision.
If, however, the nose is opened and moisture proceeds from it to the palate, then know that he is now cured.
If, however, the moisture does not proceed as it should, then know that there is flesh grown in the upper nasal bones, which was not reached by the instrument during the incision.
Then thou shalt introduce a thread of linen which hath some thickness, and knots in it many. And place between every knot the quantity of a finger, or less: and let the sick man send one extremity of the thread into the nose with the rod, or with that which is possible to him after he hath made himself similar azer: and draw forth his odour until it come unto the caisson, and go out above his throat.
And oftentimes similar is done to this Attomus puer in schools: and it is an easy thing for him who wishes.
Then place two extremities of the thread, one which goes out above the nose, and the other which remains in the nose.
Then apply the flesh saw with the knots that are on the thread. Do this until you know that the flesh is now with the knots of the thread.
Then withdraw the thread: and place in the nose after the bleeding has stopped a mild substance soaked in Egyptian ointment: do this for three days, or more, until the ointment consumes all that remains of the flesh.
Then place at the end of the procedure a tube made of lead in the nose for several days until it heals.
If it needs treatment that dries it out, use that.
For the head purge, with which oils and other medicines are distilled into the nose, make it of silver or copper: let it be similar to a lantern frame, open like a shell: and its aperture likewise.
And if you wish to make a closed tube, like a reed.
And the shell of the instrument for head purgation should be full, opened: which should have a handle at its end, with which you hold it when you heat oil or what you wish from juices and fluid substances.
And this is the form of the instrument. ¶ Concerning the care of the turbinate bone of the nose.
Chapter XXV.
Again and again, the turbinate bone of the nose appears at the end of the nostril, enlarges, and grows with days until an unsightly appearance is formed.
And because of this, it is necessary to treat it with cauterization at the beginning of its appearance and to eradicate the entire thing.
Then place on the area either cauterization or a burning medicine that takes the place of it.
If therefore the incision is delayed until it enlarges, then consider if it is hard, dark-colored, and has few senses: then do not touch it with iron, for it is a cancerous abscess.
Again and again, I have seen an abscess form in a person, and great harm ensued to the one who had it.
And if the abscess is soft to the touch, not dark-colored, and you see that an incision is possible throughout it, then evacuate the diseased part, and cut into it without fear or cowardice: and take care of the area with something that dries and constricts until it is healed.
On suturing the nose, lips, and ears.
Chapter XXVI.
Know that when there is a disruption of continuity in one of these cartilages, the operation yields little benefit, except in certain individuals.
Therefore, when something of that kind happens to someone, you should consider whether the wound is recent with its own blood: and then join the edges of the wound with suturing, and thereafter care for it until it heals.
And if the continuity has been disrupted and the lips are already separated, and each part is healthy: then it is necessary to remove all the edges visible from the skin, until they bleed.
Then join the two lips with suturing, and tighten them. Dust the wound with dragon's blood powder and incense powder ground together, and place above the powder a piece of diaphonic emplaster, and another piece of consolidated emplaster. Leave it bound for two days, or three.
Then解开它，更换药物，并让它保持原状，直到缝线自行吸收。 Then care for it with ointment until it heals.
The method of suturing is to join the disrupted continuity either with needles, as we have described in suturing the abdomen: or join the disruption with thread, as I have shown you.
On the Extraction of Nodes from the Lips.
Chapter XXVII. Many persons are afflicted with hardnesses in their inner lips similar to small herb grains, some smaller, and some larger.
Therefore, it is necessary to turn the lip and find over every knot of it, and hang it with a hook, and cut it from all sides.
Then fill the place after the incision with something to stop the blood until it is stopped.
Then wash it with vinegar, and treat the area with it as long as the wounds are healing.
§ On the Incision of Flesh Arising on the Gums.
Head XXVIII. Many times flesh grows over the gums, which the ancients call abuluss.
Therefore, it is necessary to hang it with a hook: or hold it with forceps, and cut it at its root, and allow the pus to flow, or the blood.
Then place on the area something pounded and dried, or other astringent powders, drying agents.
If that flesh returns after treatment, for it often does return, then cut it a second time and cauterize it: for it will not return after cauterization.
§ On the Reason for Teeth with Iron.
Head XXIX.
Sometimes deposits aggregate on the surfaces of teeth from the inner and outer parts, and between the gums, becoming rough, unpleasant. Sometimes they are stained yellow, green, until the corruption reaches the gums, and the teeth become foul due to this.
Therefore you must cause the sick person to sit between your hands, and his head in your bosom, and scrape the powder and tooth in which you see bark, and something like sand: until nothing remains of them, and similarly do for blackness, greenness, and yellowity, and others until they are cleansed.
Therefore if that which is at the beginning in them is removed from reason, it is good: and if not, then iterate over them the reason on another, second, and third day until the ultimate study arrives at what you wish.
And know that the tooth requires razors of various forms, many shapes: according to how it is prepared for your operation. Therefore, the razor used to scrape the tooth from the inferior part is different from the one used between the teeth, according to other forms.
And these forms of razors be prepared for you, which you shall see.
¶ On the Extraction of Tooth Pain.
Chapter XXX.
You must cure the tooth from its pain with every skill and be slow in removing it.
For it is not replaced by anything when it is removed, since it is a noble substance: until, when there is no excuse for removing it, then you must remove it when the sick person is forced to do so, that it may be firmly established and you may be certain among your patients of a painful tooth.
For many times pain deceives the sick person, who thinks that it is due to a cavity and removes the tooth: then the pain does not cease until the unhealthy tooth is removed.
We have now seen that from the operation of phlebotomy.
When therefore the painful tooth is certified to you itself, then you must incise around the tooth with a scalpel, in which there is some virtue, until the gum is loosened from all sides: then move it with your fingers, or with fine forceps first gradually, until you shake it.
Then place large forceps in those locations with good positioning, and hold the patient's head between your knees: which you have now gripped well, so that it does not move: then pull the tooth straight, so as not to break it.
If therefore it does not come out, then take one of those instruments, and insert it under it from all sides with facility, and try its movement, as you did first.
If the tooth is perforated or corroded, then you must fill that hole with a cloth: and grip it with the extremity of a fine radius bone so that it does not break during your constriction over it with forceps.
And you must act carefully with the incision around the gum from all sides thoroughly.
And preserve your strength, so as not to break it, and let part of it remain, and return to the patient from that evil which is greater than his initial pain.
And beware, lest you do what ignorant phlebotomists do in their haste and through the boldness of their efforts beyond what we have narrated.
Many times they cause great diseases in patients, of which the more difficult to break and from which all or some of its roots remain: or they extract it along with certain bones of the jaw, as we have often testified. Then it shall be washed after its removal with wine, or with vinegar and salt. If there should be a flow of blood from the place (this often happens), then take something from zegi and fill the place with it. And if you do not have zegi, cauterize it.
The forms of fine forceps with which one manipulates the tooth first should be long at their extremities, short handles, thick, so that they do not bend when pressed on a tooth: let them be as you see thick handles, until when you grip them, they do not pierce themselves nor bend: short extremities, and let them be made of iron wire, or of brass properly fashioned, straight extremities: and in their extremities there should be teeth, some of which should enter into certain ones and tighten with a suitable constriction, strongly.
And sometimes the extremities are made like the form of a bird's mouth which is called stork, and they are strong in constriction.
¶ Concerning the removal of teeth and the extraction of fractured jawbones.
Chapter XXXI.
When something remains after the removal of a fractured tooth, then it is necessary to place butter over the area for one or two days until the site becomes softened. Then insert an algastium or forceps, whose extremities are similar to the mouth of a bird called a stork.
The form of this is a forceps.
Let their extremities be made like a rasp inside: or like aliskilfegi.
If therefore it does not yield to you for the exit with these forceps, then you must be careful over the root, and discover all the flesh, and introduce an instrument named Little Palance, whose form is this.
Let it be brief at the extremity, somewhat thick: and let it not be soaked, that it may not break.
If therefore the root exits through that, it is good: and if not, it must be aided with these other instruments whose forms are these.
The form of the first triangular extremity, in which there is some thickness.
The form of the thin triangular extremity.
And it must also be aided with this instrument having two branches, whose form is this. And with the other instruments and tools that preceded in proportion to the teeth.
And it must be aided with this instrument that is similar to a large hook, whose form is that of a twisted triangular extremity, in which there is some thickness, that it may not break: and let it not be soaked.
And know that the instruments for the teeth are many: and similarly, other instruments are not counted, and a skillful artisan, subtle in his art, finds an instrument by himself, according to what operations and diseases signify to him.
Since from various diseases there are conditions to which the ancients did not refer an instrument due to the diversity of their species.
If the mouth is broken from the jawbone, or from other bones of the face, or putrefies: then examine it in its place with what is appropriate for it from the instruments and forceps which I said in the extraction of roots, and aid it with this gesture, whose form is this.
Let it be somewhat thick in that manner, so that it may be tightened or held with the mouth, and not escape and go away until the mouth emerges: and restore the place with medicines suitable for this.
If, however, there is a small decay in the bone, then scrape it from its decay, and treat it until it is cured.
On the Extraction of Prominent Teeth Over Others.
Chapter XXXII.
When teeth are prominent and not in their natural alignment, it becomes ugly through this form: and especially when this happens in women and girls, that is, virgins.
For if a tooth is born after another tooth and is not placed, or its extraction is not possible neither by pulling nor by filing: then extract it. And if it is attached to another tooth, then cut it off with this instrument, the form of which is as follows.
It is similar to a small beak, and is made of iron, with its extremity greatly sharpened.
And let your cut be such that you cut it over many days, and because of the hardness of the tooth, so that no other tooth is disturbed.
If, however, it is prominent and exposed to filing: then file it with a file made of iron, the form of which is as follows.
Let it be entirely of iron, and its handle made of fine punctured work, as with a file used for making needles: with this, the tooth can be filed gradually over many days with ease, so that the tooth is not disturbed and falls out; then finish it gently, and scrape it off at the end with some razors.
If a tooth breaks and injures the tongue, then it is necessary to file it until the roughness of that break is removed and it is made even. It should be smoothed so as not to injure the tongue nor corrupt speech.
On the Treatment of Teeth with Golden Strings.
Chapter XXXIII.
When the anterior teeth are shaken and moved by a blow or accident, and the patient cannot hold food above that which has been injured so that it does not fall: and you have treated them with styptic medicines but the treatment was not successful, then ingenuity is needed to bind them with a golden string, for silver turns green and decays after a few days, but gold never changes.
And let the string be of moderate thickness and size according to the quantity that can fit between the teeth.
And the form of the treatment is this: take a string, and insert twice its length between two healthy teeth. Then weave it with both ends of the string among the moved teeth, whether one or more, until you reach the thread to the healthy tooth on the other side.
Then repeat the weaving back to the part from which you started. And use your hand with subtlety and wisdom so that the string does not completely come loose. Ensure that the binding at the roots of the teeth is tight, so that it does not slip out.
Then cut the excess ends of the string with pincers and join both ends, and hold them together. Place them inconspicuously between the healthy tooth and the moved tooth so as not to injure the tongue. Then let it remain tightly bound until it stays in place.
If it is cut through or incised, tie them with another thread, and let it heal in this manner for the entire time.
And this is the form of the Teeth, and the figure of the retention of two healthy teeth, and two moving teeth, as you see.
And sometimes it happens that a tooth or two returns to its proper place after falling out and is retained as we have described, and remains there: and this is done only by a skilled and experienced craftsman.
And sometimes a piece from the jawbone is fitted: and it is made from this like the form of a tooth, and is placed in its place, from which the tooth was secured and tied as we said: and remains there, and serves with it for a long time.
¶ Concerning the incision of the ligament that occurs under the tongue and prevents speech.
Chapter XXXIV.
And if there is something hard and knotted in it, and that is due to the healing of a wound, then probe it with a hooked instrument and cut it widthwise until you cut through the ligament and the knot is released.
If, however, bleeding occurs, then place ground cress over the bleeding spot. If the bleeding overcomes you, then cauterize the spot with a lentiginous cautery, which is suitable for this: then care for it with the remaining treatment until it is cured. ¶ Concerning the extraction of a ranula that occurs under the tongue.
Head 35.
Sometimes an apstema occurs under the tongue that resembles a ranula, hindering the tongue from its natural function: and perhaps it enlarges so much as to fill the mouth.
If, therefore, you see it of a dark or black color, hard, and the patient does not feel it: then do not touch it, for it is cancer.
And if it inclines towards a whitish color, in which there is moisture, then apply a hooked instrument to it, and cut it off with a sharp and fine scalpel, and liberate it from all sides.
And if bleeding overcomes you during your operation, then place ground cress over it until the bleeding stops: then return to your operation until you remove it with its entirety.
Then it is to be washed with vinegar and salt, and the rest treated with suitable care until it is cured.
On the treatment of an abscess of both tonsils.
Chapter XXXVI.
And then you may puncture it: or it will break open on its own.
And if it is of a white color, round, and its base is thin: then you must cut into it.
And the operation on it is as follows: you should consider before the operation whether the abscess has quieted and is completely healed by heat, or has decreased in some way. Therefore, make the patient sit in the sun, and let his head be on your side: open his mouth, and have a servant hold it with both hands, and press his tongue downward with an instrument, the form of which is as follows. Let it be made of silver or copper, and let it be thin like a scalpel.
When therefore you press with it on the tongue, and a carbuncle is shown to you, and your weight falls upon it: then take a forceps, and fix it into the tonsil, and draw it out as far as you can, besides which draw something from the surrounding tissue.
Then cut it with an instrument, the form of which is as follows.
It is similar to tongs; however, its ends should be curved, so that the opening of each is acutely at right angles to the other. Therefore, take care that it is made of iron tempered or soaked in alum.
If, however, this instrument is not present, then cut it with a spoon-shaped implement, the form of which is as follows.
Let it be pointed on one side, not on the other.
And after you have cut the one tonsil, cut the other according to the same species of incision.
Then after the incision, the patient should gargle with cold water, or with vinegar and water.
If, however, there is a hemorrhage, the patient should gargle with water in which pomegranate peels have been boiled, or with myrtle leaves and similar astringents until the bleeding stops. Then take care of it until it is healed.
And sometimes carbuncles appear in the throat other than on the two tonsils.
Cut those accordingly as I said for the incision of the two tonsils equally.
And I indeed had a woman cured from an apostate, which was born between her throat, which drew towards blackness, with few senses, which had nearly closed her throat: and the woman breathed through a narrow opening, and had already forbidden her ingestion of food and drink: and she had already arrived at death if she had remained one day, or two days.
And the apstemat had risen so high that it had emitted two branches until they emerged over two nostrils.
I therefore hastened and hooked one of them with a hook.
Then I pulled it out, and from it came a large portion.
Then I cut it off where I grasped it from the nostril opening.
Then I treated her with what had proceeded from the other nostril opening.
Then I opened her mouth, and pressed her tongue: thereafter I hooked a hook into the apostema: then I cut off a part of it, and it did not flow from it except a little blood: thus the throat of the woman was cleared, and she began to drink water immediately, then she received nourishment from food.
Therefore I did not cease to cut from that apostema many times over a long period: and the apostema kept recurring in place of what I was cutting until it grew excessively large and affected her.
I therefore devised, and cauterized the apostema between the throat.
It therefore stood without further addition: then I walked away from the case, and did not know what God had done for her after me.
On the incision of an abscess of the vagina.
Head XXVII.
When the catarrh descends to the vagina and becomes an abscess and is long, then it is called a perpendicular abscess: and if it is in the lower part thick and round, then it is called a vaginal abscess.
When it is treated as we have said in the division, and the treatment does not improve the condition: and you see that the hot abscess has settled away from it and is thin: then you should incise it.
And that which is aggregated around it in a round shape and does not have length, and is bloody or of a dark color or black, and has no sensation: then you should make a suitable incision of it.
For there is a risk to the patient in it.
Therefore, when you see it according to the manner as I have said from albedo and its length, you should make the patient sit in front of the sun: and press its tongue with the instrument, of which the narration has preceded: then fix a hook in the vagina, and draw it downward: and incise it with one or two instruments as I said in the incision of two tonsils.
And you should not incise it from that part unless what is added exceeds the natural limit without addition.
For if you incise beyond that, you will damage the voice and speech.
Then after the incision, use what we have narrated in the incision of two tonsils: and care for it until it is healed.
If the sick person is terrified by the incision: then you must use your skill in cauterizing him without fear and poverty.
And the measure of cauterization in this is not without, unless with sharp water: and it is such that you place the sick person's head in your lap.
Then press his tongue with the instrument we have mentioned.
Then take from the water which I said to you in the chapter on cauterizing, and make a hot coal from it, neither thick nor thin, and fill the cavity of this instrument with it, which has this form.
Place it at the extremity where the medicine cavity is placed, as in the cavity of a cochlear's radius.
And place the instrument with the medicine over the wound itself: and the sick person should lie on his side, so that the saliva flows from his mouth out of the internal medicine, and does not descend from there to his throat and harm him.
Then hold your hand with the medicine.
And you apply half of it to the wound for a quantity of half an hour, until you see it blackened and the biting pain subdued by the medicine.
And if you wish to take cotto and wrap it around the extremity of the radius, and pour cotto with the medicine into the canal from above, until the cotto adheres over the wound. Do this repeatedly until you achieve what you wish concerning the cauterization of the wound.
Then release her: for she heals of herself and falls off after three days, or four.
If you need to apply the medicine again, apply it itself: and after cauterization, cleanse around the wound with a cloth soaked in butter, and wash around its circumference with what is prepared from medicine: and let it be washed with cold water.
And let it be treated externally with fomentations, and internally with gargles until it is healed.
Therefore, this method of treatment is more healthful than incision and more distant from fear.
And sometimes the wound is treated even with something finer than cauterization and incision: it is treated with inhalation, according to this method.
Take a reed, and hyssop, and origanum, and rue, and safflower, and chamomile, and abrotanum, and similar herbs: and gather all these together, or some of them in a pot, and submerge them with vinegar, and let them boil: and the pot should be lined with plaster on the inside: and there should be a hole in the middle of the pot, over which an inclined tray should be placed according to this method.
Let it be made of silver or brass, and insert the end, which has a pomegranate, into the patient's mouth until the vapor rises to the wound above the tube, until the wound is well covered.
Then apply it repeatedly to the same area until it heals.
And beware, do not perform this treatment at the onset of the abscess.
For he often adds in gangrene: and you should not do this except at the declination of its heat.
If however this instrument is not at hand for you, then take a reed, and bind bark of oak at its end: so that the mouth of the sick man does not burn: for the bark of oak prevents the vapor from burning the mouth: and this is for good cure with safety.
On the Extraction of Thorns and Bones from the Throat.
Chapter XXXVIII.
Many times a mouth, or a fish spine, or something else adheres in the throat.
Therefore, you must extract what is apparent above that which the patient has fallen upon, after you press the tongue with the instrument at the solar plexus, and it becomes clear to you what is in the throat.
And what does not appear to you and is hidden in the throat, you must make the sick person vomit before the food is digested in the stomach.
For indeed, something attached may come out through vomiting.
Or the sick person should swallow a fragment of a nut, or a radish root, or a piece of dry bread: or he should take a fragment of a sponge dried and soft, wrap it in a thread, and then swallow it.
When therefore it arrives at the place where the thorns or mouth are, and they are extracted, then it comes out. If therefore it does not come out with what we have said, then use the instrument made of lead in this form.
Let it be thicker than the radius slightly, and at its extremity there should be a curvature, which it should introduce into its throat with ease: and he himself should have his head raised upwards.
And let him beware of the touch of his epiglottis, so that he does not suffer coughing, and push with it the mouth, or a needle, or the physician should introduce it by hand.
What the patient introduces is better: on account of his knowledge of the place related to the matter: and push downwards, or draw his hand with the instrument upwards, all this according to the quantity which is prepared for him, until he exits.
Of the Extraction of the Bloodsucker.
Chapter XXXIX.
When the bloodsucker is treated as I said in the division of treatment with medicines, and it does not adhere, then examine the throat of the patient in the sunlight or near the sun after you press his tongue with the instrument I have told you about.
If therefore your usage falls on the bloodsucker, remove it with a small hook, or with slender tongs.
If this is not possible with them, then take a concave cannula and introduce it into the patient's throat near the throat. Then introduce into the concavity of the cannula a heated iron rod with fire.
Do this many times: and let the patient abstain from water for the whole day.
Then let him take the treated substance mixed with cold water, and open his mouth in it: and wet his mouth with it, and do not swallow anything from it: and move the water one hour after another with his hand.
For the leech immediately upon sensing water falls.
If it does not come out as we have narrated, then fumigate the patient with lice, or with a wing with the instrument that I narrated in the fumigation of the vine.
Do this many times, for it will fall by itself.
And the method of operation in fumigation is this: take a pot containing live prunes with fire, and cover the pot with a lid having a hole in its middle. Place the end of the instrument in that hole.
Then project the fumigation, and place the patient's mouth at the end of the tube, and close his mouth so that the fumigation does not escape until you know that the fumigation has reached the leech.
For the leech will fall immediately.
If it does not fall, then repeat the fumigation many times.
And let the patient endure thirst, and eat salted food and garlic, and not drink water. It is therefore necessary that it come out with this regimen.
And this is the form of the instrument with which the leech is extracted from the throat when it falls upon itself by chance.
It is similar to forceps, as you can see: except for this curvature that enters the throat.
And its end is similar to the beak of a bird called a stork, where there is the roughness of a file: when it grasps something, it does not release it entirely.
On the Incision of Abscesses, and Their Section and General Care.
Chapter XL.
Species apostematum multae sunt et modorum diversarum plurimarum secundum quod rememoratio eorum uenit, scilicet unius et unius in hoc libro; et sunt diversae in perforatione eorum et sectione ipsorum ex duobus modis.
One of which is from the species of abscess within itself, and because it includes moisture.
And the second mode is due to the locations where it occurs in the body.
For an abscess occurring in the head is different from one occurring in the anus: and an abscess occurring in a fleshy place is different from one occurring at joints: and each has its own judgment according to its nature.
And among abscesses there are some that should not be incised unless after the maturation of the sanious fluid in them and its completion: and among these are some that should be incised while they are raw and do not mature according to their completion.
As with abscesses that are near joints.
For an abscess that occurs near a joint and prolongs its existence until it putsrefies what is in its vicinity, perhaps the ligaments or nerves of that joint are corrupted: wherefore it is a cause nearer to the contraction of that limb.
Or it is an abscess near the principal limb: for if you delay the incision until it matures, it will harm either that limb or through that limb the whole body.
It is near the anus, so perforate it, being immature: and it is not necessary to perforate a raw abscess, unless it is near the anus, lest it putrefy deeply, and extend to the interior of the anus, and become a fistula, or remain unhealed at its termination. You must know the time of perforation of the abscess, which has matured to completion: and it is when there is alleviation of pain, subsidence of fever, diminution of redness, swelling, and acuteness of headache from the abscess: and other signs. And you must make the same perforation in the lower part of the abscess and in the more prominent area: and the perforation should be longitudinal, if the abscesses are in parts of the hands and feet, and in the regions of the muscles, tendons, nerves, and arteries, and finally in all areas where there is no reflection.
In those that reflect, proceed with the perforation according to that limb.
When the abscess is in fleshy parts: then it is better to postpone the perforation until its digestion is confirmed, as we have said according to completion.
For if you perforate it before that, the course of the virus will be prolonged from there, and there will be much foulness and putrefaction, and perhaps its lips will become hardened, and its depth will increase.
And some abscesses are perforated according to the breadth of the body out of necessity: or according to what the limb requires.
And you must administer a small perforation in small abscesses, and a large perforation in large abscesses: or multiple sections similar in size to the abscess.
And they are from abscesses, in which it is necessary to cut the skin: and cut when it has become like a film, and formed in a term, which is now dead: as that which happens in many, whether or not, and buboes.
And there are those which are cut with a section having three angles.
And there is that from which it is cut like the figure of a myrtle leaf.
Like an abscess in the groin.
And there are those in which a circular cut and a lunar cut are administered: and similar to these from cuts.
That, however, which does not have a head, as are mild superficial abscesses, should be pierced with a superficial puncture, or a plain one only.
And it is necessary, when the abscess is large and has already collected much脓液, to pierce it, so as not to hurry and extract all the pus at that time: rather, extract from that part.
Then lance the abscess until another day.
Then extract some of the pus again.
Perform this many times according to the degree of the abscess until it gives way: especially if the patient is weak in strength, or a pregnant woman, or a small boy, or an old man decayed with illness: for the animal spirit often dissipates with the discharge of the foul matter: and perhaps the weak patient dies, and you do not notice.
Therefore beware in this chapter, it is a great caution.
And after your perforation, by which you perforate abscesses, you must clean the wound: and consider.
If therefore the wound of the abscess is small, or the incision flat, then administer licorice from linen, or old honey.
And if the abscess is large, and there are many openings from the perforations, then you must introduce licorice into every opening until they meet in the center.
And if you have excised a part of the skin in the abscess, or depressed it around the edges: then you must fill it with old honey, or as when a cloth is woven, or combed with linen fiber without moisture: and bind it until the third day.
Then apply it and care for it with what is necessary from the ointment until it heals.
And if blood flows during your operation, then administer cold water and vinegar. After the cloth absorbs them, place it over the place where the blood is flowing many times.
And if the bleeding persists, then you must administer treatment and care, as well as the powders which I have described in many places of this our book, and by division.
And if it is in the winter time and the location of the abscess contains many nerves, then you must pour warm powders with wine and oil over the areas.
And if it is in the summer and the areas are fleshy, then you must place wet powders in water and oil, or in wine and oil, and make all of that cold.
When the third day comes, as we have said, then you should drain the abscess, and cleanse it, and administer to its care what he needs until it is healed.
This is therefore what is necessary to be known universally for the cure of abscesses.
According to the division however, I have already spoken of every abscess, how the way to its cure must be considered separately.
§ On the incision of abscesses that occur on the skin of the head.
Chapter XLI.
Small abscesses occur on the skin of the head, and they are of the species Nodora, which contain sacs covered by a membrane: as if they were infected chicken eggs.
And these species are many.
Some of them are pus-filled: some contain a moisture similar to mud: some contain a moisture similar to watery food gruel: and similar to these, some are hard and stony.
And in the incision of all of them, and their extraction, there is no fear, as long as the incision does not cause any opposition to the arteries.
And the procedure in incising them is to use the instrument whose form will come after these remarks, which is called Intromissum, until you know what it contains.
For if what it contains is moisture, then dry it by incising it along its length superficially: according to this form.
And begin with the section from line b to line g. For when the humidity is evacuated, then peel off the skin which contains that humidity, and let nothing remain therein completely.
For it will return if anything remains from it. Then immerse it in Egyptian ointment, if it is present; and if not, in water and salt. Fill the wound with it and leave it until another day.
For it will corrode what remains from the skin. Then apply the Egyptian ointment a second time and a third time, and if needed, continue until you are confident that nothing remains from the skin. Then care for the wound with ointment until it heals.
If it contains a fatty nodule: then dry it according to this form, with the section having the shape of a cross: and insert hooks between the limbs of the section, and peel off the skin from all parts: and try your skill in extracting the tunic which contains it.
If, however, the artery resists you, then do what I will tell you about afterward.
And similarly do this in a stone nodule, if it exists, with the same section and care as we have said. And the section for a stone nodule is easier: for it contains little blood and humidity.
And sometimes there are cases of these nodules on the head in some people where there is no humidity at all.
Or make a perforation of them always from the lower part, so that the flow of healing may be directed to the lower parts.
Then care for it with what is appropriate for them according to the cure.
¶ Incision of Stropharia on the neck.
Chapter XLII.
These boils often occur on the neck, and under the坐席 (assels), and in the groin: and sometimes they occur in other parts of the body.
And above those that occur on the neck from these, there is one, and many, which are generated from each other: and every Stropharia from them is within its own proper sheath, just as in the nodes and boils of the head, as we have described.
And there are many species of these Stropharia.
And from these there are those like stones: and from them there are those that contain fluids: and from them there are malignant ones, which do not respond to treatment.
For that one which you see from them to be well disposed upon touch, whose color is clearly near the skin's hue, and which moves to every part, and is not attached with the neck muscles, nor with the glands, nor with the artery, and is not deep: it must be incised superficially from the upper part of the body to the lower part along a line from b to g. Remove it from all sides by scraping. Spread two flaps of skin with a hook, or with multiple hooks if needed, as we said in the case of head boils, and extract it gradually.
And it is a precaution that one does not incur a vein or nerve.
And let the spatium be not very acute: that it do not add to your hand in incision, or trouble the patient, and cut what is not necessary.
If, however, you cut a vein or artery, or are prevented from performing the operation, then place in the wound pounded zegi, or certain powders that cause the blood to be absorbed and the wound to constrict, and leave it until the sharpness of the abscess subsides and the wound becomes softened: or begins and wants to putrefy.
For the blood is absorbed and the wound heals, so return to your operation until you complete it.
Then care for it.
If the entire Strophula is cut, then you must bring together the two lips of the wound and immediately suture it after you see that no excess fluid remains.
If, however, you see that excess fluid remains because of the size of the Strophula, then you must proceed to cut its root and extract it: and administer the suture as we have said.
And whatever contains humors from Strophulis, make a superficial perforation of it: so that the place of its maturity will be apparent to you: and place the perforation below what follows the body, as we have said.
Then administer after the perforation licor with ointment and similar things, so that it may corrode what remains from corruption, until when you see the wound already cleansed: then care for it with generative flesh ointment until it heals.
¶ Section of the Epiglottis from an Abscess Occurring in the Throat.
Chapter XLIII.
The ancients performed this section of the epiglottis, and I have not seen anyone in our land who has done so: and this is the text of their speech.
In those who have synanchia, it is necessary to avoid the section of the epiglottis: since no benefit is achieved through it, because all the veins and lung are weak.
In those who have a hot abscess in the mouth, or throat, or in both tonsils, when there is no illness in the canal, it is necessary to use the section of the epiglottis to avoid the danger that occurs from preoccupation. Therefore, when we wish to cut the epiglottis under three rings of the epiglottis, or four, with a small section in breadth, at the place between two rings in quantity, such that the section is in sifac and not in cartilage: and this very place is suitable for the section, because it is devoid of flesh, and the blood vessels are far from it.
If the physician is timid, then it is necessary for him to extend the skin of the throat with a forceps.
Then find the skin, until he comes to the canal: let the blood vessel be distinct, if he sees anything from it.
Then cut as we have described: and it is indicated above the section of the canal from the phlegm that emerges from it when what is ruptured, and from the cutting of the voice box.
And leave the wound open for some time.
When therefore the wound is removed from the hour when combustion is feared, join the two lips of the skin wound, and the latter alone without the cartilage.
Then administer medicines that cause flesh to grow until it is healed.
Albucasis says.
In summa, what we have narrated, this exposition is not made unless they see that some of these abscesses have already inflamed the throat of the sick: and the sick has been elevated above death, and it is desired to cut his breathing so that the sick may breathe through a certain breathing place and be saved from death: and for this reason they ordered leaving the wound open until the malice of the disease is consumed, and the malice of it lasts three days, and almost as long. Therefore, they commanded to close the wound and cure it until it is healed.
And that which I saw with my own eyes is this: one servant girl took a knife and inserted it into her throat, and it hit a part of the pulmonary canal.
And I was called upon to cure him, and found her mourning, as is the moaning of the dead.
I therefore examined the wound, and found blood that had emerged from the wound.
I therefore concluded that she herself had neither drawn the vein nor the jugular: and air was emerging from the wound.
I therefore treated her wound and cured it until it was healed: and nothing happened to the maid except a hoarseness in her voice: and she returned after days to a better state of health.
Therefore, I say: there is no danger in the operation of the Epiglottis.
¶ Concerning the Operation for Hernia of the Throat.
Head XLIV.
This is called an hernia of the throat, which is a large abscess according to the color of the body, and it occurs very frequently in women.
And it is according to two modes: either it is natural, or it is accidental. In the natural case, certainly there is no skill required.
Accidental, however, is according to two modes: of which one is similar to fatty knots.
And the other mode is similar to an abscess that is formed from the concretion of an artery.
And there is danger in it, and it is not appropriate to apply the knife to it unless it is a small area. And you should probe it and investigate it with forceps.
If therefore you find it similar to a knot in fat, and it is not suspended with any veins: then cut it, as knots are cut: and extract it along with what it contains from the cyst, if it is in the cyst: and if not, then examine its entire substance.
Then care for the place with what is necessary from the cure until it is healed.
¶ On the Section Regarding the Species of Knots.
Head XLV. There are many species of knots, and I have already mentioned all the species in the division. It is necessary to explain here the difference between a Knot and an Exitura, which creates doubt. I say that when an Exitura is associated with heat, fever, and severe pain, until the eruption of excess is settled and putrefaction is complete, then the fever and heat will cease.
When a Knot, however, does not have heat, nor fever, nor severe pain, and contains them within cysts sifachin, which is their own pouch, and is according to the color of the body: and their beginning is like chickpeas, and becomes like a batter, and can be larger or smaller.
And they are of two species: either fatty, or contain moisture.
And the colors of moisture are many, as I have said in the division. Therefore, when you arrive at the cure for a Knot, you must examine it and inquire about it first with an instrument called Intromissum, according to the form it takes as described in the chapter that follows.
And the method of inquiring into abscesses and all nodules is this: take this instrument and introduce it into the more humid place which you find in the abscess: and you rotate your fingers with it gradually until you know that the instrument has now penetrated the skin.
Then place your hand last according to the measure of the size of the abscess.
Then withdraw what has been introduced, and consider what comes out in its wake.
If therefore the humidity flows out, whatever its color may be: then dry it with a superficial incision, as I said in the cases of other abscesses.
And if the humidity does not flow out in the wake of what has been introduced, then know that it is fatty: therefore dry it with a superficial incision having the form of a cross, as I have shown you: and hang it with hooks, and peel the skin from all parts with facility: and keep a cloth over it if possible, so that you may withdraw the healthy part with the nodule.
And if the cyst is ruptured during the operation, and it is not possible to withdraw the healthy part, since this often happens, then withdraw it bit by bit until nothing remains of it.
For if anything remains from it, whether little or much, the nodule will return according to the greatest extent.
And if it overcomes you and something remains from it little: then fill the wound at the end of your operation with certain corrosive sharp powders, and bind the wound, and place above what is seated in the abscess a warm poultice, and care for it with the rest of the treatment until it heals.
If therefore there is a great Knot, then treat its two lips thereof, and care for that which it incarnerates. If however there are contrary veins pulsatile or non-pulsatile: then hasten, and fill the place set aside trito, and let it be bound for two days, or three, until the wound putrefies and the ebullition of blood subsides: then return to cutting that which remains from the Knot.
¶ Concerning instruments from the outside for cutting and perforating.
Head XLVI.
These are the forms of Intromissorum, and there are three species of them.
From these, there is the great, and from these is the medium, and from these is the small.
Let them be made of iron with square extremities centered, so that they quickly enter the aposteme.
And these are the forms of Perforating instruments, and one of them is called beris, that is, perforating: and there are three species of them.
From these, there is the great, and the medium, and the small.
They are suitable to investigate through such as apostemas, abscesses, and fistulas, from what is between them arising from the bones.
And others are made round, smooth, soft, like large needles with which saddles are sewn, made of yellow stuff, or brass, or iron, or silver. And better are those things which are made from citron.
And experience is also made with black lead, which are suitable for testing fistulas, whose concavity causes reflections, so that they are reflected with their gentle reflections.
And there are again three species. Since there are the long ones from these, the medium ones from these, and the short ones from these, according to the width and constriction of the fistula. The Form of Valves, and there are many species. Since there are the simple ones, that is, those with a single curvature, and they are of three species as you can see: Large, Medium, and Small.
And there are blind valves from these: and they are of three species.
And there are valves having two curvatures from these, and they are of three species: and there are valves having three curvatures from these, and they are of three species: and all these are necessary in their place.
And these are the forms of Knives, with which nodules and abscesses are cut and incised: and they are of three species: since there is the large, the medium, and the small.
Their extremities with which the cut is made are acute, while other extremities are not acute: and they are not placed thus unless to provide assistance in incising nodules out of fear of cutting a vein or nerve: and so that the sick may be healed through them and find some tranquility from the burning sensation he finds during the incision of an abscess.
These are Magda, and they are of three species.
They are made of copper, and they are similar to Radius, with which alcohol is made. At the wide end, there are hidden points of Spatiumilis: and it flows to the interior and to the exterior when you wish, as you see.
The form of Spatiumilium which are hidden between the fingers at the aperture for abscesses: and the sick do not perceive them. They are of three species: large, medium, and small.
The form of Ventosars used to cut off the flow of blood: and they are of three species, large, medium, and small.
They should be made of copper or yellow metal, round, somewhat lengthwise as you see: and they should be very fine.
And these species of Ventosars should be large and small with you: so that you can use them to cut off the blood quickly when necessary, and then when medical assistance is not immediately available.
Indeed, you should not use them for the cutting off of blood in every part of the body, but only in fleshy areas: such as the thighs, the hips, the arms, the breasts, the abdomen, the groin, and similar fleshy areas.
And sometimes they are made of small instruments similar to the grips of boxing gloves, according to their shape: with which blood is cut off when it flows from the site of phlebotomy, or at the incision of a vein or artery. Sometimes they are made round according to this form.
On the care of male breasts which resemble those of women.
Head XLVII.
Sometimes the breasts of certain men swell when they reach the point of dreaming (that is, when they begin to emit fluids during sleep) until they resemble those of women: and remain foul sores.
Therefore, whoever wishes to avoid this should cut with a lunar blade along the line from b to g. Then, remove all the fatty tissue.
Then fill the wound with incarnate medicine.
Then close the two edges of the wound with stitches, and care for it until it heals.
If the breast tilts downward and softens due to its size, as happens in women, then it should be cut on its two upper sides with two lunar-shaped incisions, each of which includes the other at the ends until a larger line contains a smaller one, as shown by this form from line b to line g. Then remove the skin between the two edges and extract the fatty tissue, and apply what was said about stitching and powders necessary for the cure until it heals.
If, however, you do not close the incision because of the patient's restlessness or due to bleeding: then fill the wound with a saturated corrosive ointment and leave it until it consumes what remains from the fatty tissue.
Then care for it until it heals.
On the perforation of an abscess, which occurs under the titillicum.
Chapter XLVIII. These abscesses which occur under the titillicum are of the species of Stropharia hard ones, which contain cysts, and among them are those that contain humors.
Those which contain humors ought to be treated by a lunar section according to this form: from line b to line g. When all the pus in the abscess is evacuated, then fill it with the old dressing and leave it until another day.
Then remove the dressing, and treat with an appropriate ointment until it is healed.
If the abscess is of the species of Stropharia nodules, then incise over it as we have said in the section on equally divided Stropharia.
If the wound extends such that pus is emitted, then apply a cautery to it, as we have said in what was previously mentioned.
On the section of an abscess that occurs due to the Artery and Vein.
Chapter XLIX.
When the artery is ruptured and the skin above it becomes consolidated, abscesses often occur thereby: similarly, abscesses and swelling also occur in veins.
And the signs by which it is known that the abscess and swelling are due to the artery and vein are these: for when an abscess is due to the artery, it is long and aggregated deeply in the body. And when you press on the abscess with your fingers, you feel as if there were a stridor within it.
And that which is for the sake of the Vein, is round manifestly in the body.
And the section on this abscess is an error, and particularly that which is under the armpits, and groin, and neck, and in many places of the body: and it is very great.
Therefore, the treatment with iron should be avoided for it, and what is also outside its limits, or on the head, should be avoided.
Therefore, for that which is due to the dilation of the arterial opening, make a cut in the skin incision lengthwise.
Then open the incision with forceps, then the artery: and free it from the tunics until it is visible.
Then insert a needle under it and make it penetrate until the other side, and tie the artery with a double thread at two places, as I have taught you in the extraction of the two arteries that are in the temples.
Then probe the place, which is between the two ligaments with a spatula, until all the blood in it comes out, and the abscess is resolved.
Then administer the treatment that produces pus until the ligaments fall off: afterwards treat it with ointments suitable for it until it is cured.
If it is an abscess due to the cutting of a vein, then you should hold with your hand as much as possible of the abscess along with the skin.
Then insert the needle under the place you have held with your hand, and make it penetrate: and put a double thread there, until you extract it from the other side.
Then bind the abscess with a good ligature as I told you in the case of a wound from two parts with two extremities of thread. If you fear that the thread will be drawn out, then insert another needle with another thread under the entire abscess at the incision. Press and tighten your threads in four places.
Then dry the abscess from its middle until what is within it comes out. Then cut away the excess skin, and release what has been bound from there.
Then place on it the poultice which has been soaked in wine and oil.
Then administer the care, which is done with herbs and ointments, until it is healed.
¶ Of the abscess that occurs from nerve compression.
Head L.
Just as an abscess occurs in Arteria and Vena, similarly an abscess occurs in Nerves: what happens to them is a blow, or it occurs from excessive labor and similar causes: and they occur most frequently at helpful places, or at the calcaneus, and in every place where joints are moved: and it is a serious abscess. Its color resembles that of the rest of the body, and it is in many dispositions without pain: and when it is tightened with vehemence, the sick person feels it similarly to a state of stupor.
And it is not an aggregated abscess within the depth of the body, but it is under the skin, and it moves to every part, and does not go forward or in front, nor backward or behind.
That which is concerning joints from them, should not be attacked with iron.
For perhaps it will result in contraction.
In that which is from them concerning the head or the forehead, incise the skin with a spatula.
If therefore it is an abscess small, then hold it with forceps, and cut it from the root.
And if it is large, then suspend it with a clamp, and strip it: then remove it, and suture the wound: and care for it until it is healed.
¶ Concerning the incision of an abscess that occurs in the abdomen.
Chapter LI. Often in some persons, fungal growths occur in their abdomens and in other parts of their bodies, which they call fungalia, by reason of their resemblance to fungi.
Their root is thin, and their head is thick, and the lips of them are reversed.
And it is small from them: and there is from them something that grows greatly.
And I indeed have already seen a man, and in his abdomen were two fungalia which were more similar to fungi than other things: there was no difference between them, white, with fine roots, and their lips were reversed, and they were found, and a moisture always flowed from them.
I incised them, and found in one of them a weight of about 18 ounces, and in the other about 6 ounces. The operation in incising them is this: consider then, if the patient is humid, and the color of the fungalia is white, moist, with fine roots: then incise it with a broad spatula, and have cauteria at hand in fire.
For many times blood is expelled during its section: therefore, if the blood overcomes you, then cauterize it.
If you see a weak and timid patient from incision with iron, then take a thread made properly from lead, and apply it to it: the measure of which is what we have said, and let it remain for two days.
Then add to the tension of the lead.
Therefore, do not cease to tension the lead until it is cut and falls off by itself without effort.
If, however, the incision is from a large vein, then there is a fear and weakness in it: especially in the abdomen.
Yet it is possible to incise its median part.
Then cauterize it, so that it does not return.
Then care for it until the wound is healed.
And beware not to assume that a vein of a dark color, with few sensations, and a foul appearance, is diseased: for it is a malignant tumor. And I will mention Cancer after this.
¶ Concerning the care of the prominence of the navel.
Head LVII.
The prominence of the navel arises from many causes.
Or from fissures above the abdomen, and it exits therefrom through altib, or intestine, according to what happens in other ruptures.
Either from blood that flows from the Vein, or from the Artery, according to what has been stated.
Or from the congestion compressed therein.
If, however, it is due to a fissure and the exit of purulent matter: then its color is similar to the color of the body: and it is soft, without pain: and it appears to have a different site.
And if it is due to the exit of intestinal matter, then its site is more distinct from what we have described.
When therefore you press it with your fingers, it disappears; then it returns, and perhaps there is a sound with it: and it enlarges greatly at the entrance of the bath, and causes intense pain.
If, however, it is due to humidity, it is soft; then it does not disappear when you press it with your hand, nor does it become constricted or enlarged.
If it is due to blood, then it appears as an abscess turning black from the edge.
If, however, it is due to flesh that has grown: then the abscess is heavy, large, hard, and its shape corresponds to the size of the growth.
If, however, it is due to congestion, then its touch is soft. And the treatment for this is such that you should consider whether the prominence of the navel is due to blood from the Artery, or the Vein, or congestion: then you must refrain from treating it.
For there is fear and caution involved, as I taught you in the chapter where I discussed abscesses due to the Artery and Vein.
If the umbilicus is prominent because of the intestine or circumference, then you must instruct the patient that he should hold his breath and stand stretched out.
Then mark with cauterization around the circumference of the entire umbilicus.
Then instruct him to lie supine on your hands over his back.
Then spread the wide spatula around the circumference of the umbilicus over the place you marked with cauterization.
Then extend the middle piece of the apostema to the upper part, using a large hook.
Then tie it firmly around the circumference with a strong thread, or with a silk ligature: and make the knot of the ligature tight.
Then open the extended middle piece of the apostema above the ligament.
If you have already grasped it with the ligament, then remove the tight knot, and insert your index finger into it, and push the intestine towards the interior of the abdomen: and if you find the circumference, then grasp it with a hook, and cut its excess.
If, however, it is an artery or vein, then mark it around it extensively.
Then return to your operation.
And take two needles and insert two strong threads into them: and insert two needles around the circumference you made around the apostema in the manner of a cross, causing them to penetrate.
Then tie the apostema in four places over the needles: and if you wish, remove the needles and leave the area until the flesh becomes gangrenous: and it will fall off by itself: or cut it when it is reduced and gangrenous.
Then care for it together with what must be used from ointments until it is cured.
If the protrusion of the umbilicus is from flesh growing therein, or from moisture: then it must be incised to form a cavity, as we have said.
And extract the blood or moisture that you find therein.
Then care for it with what will harden the place.
¶ Of the care of CANCER. Head III.
For I have not been able to cure anyone from it: and I have never seen anyone before me who survived it.
And the operation in such cases is this: as we have said before, you should precede and release the sick from black bile several times.
Then perform phlebotomy if you find it with obvious distension.
Then prepare the patient with a preparation in which he will be placed during the operation.
Then project into the Cancer those hooks that suit him.
Then concave it from every part with the skin, according to examination, until nothing remains of its roots: and permit the blood to flow, and do not cut it quickly, but express the places, and wipe away all gross blood with your hand or with whatever is available there using instruments.
If, however, the blood flows grossly from an incision of an artery or vein, then cauterize the vein until the blood stops.
Then care for it with the rest of the treatment until it is healed.
¶ On the Care of Hydrocele.
Head IV.
We have already described the division of species of hydrocele, and how the aggregation of water occurs in each species: and the signs of each species, and the treatment thereof with medicines.
And that which is treated with iron is none other than the asclitid species alone: and iron is not brought close to the tympanic or hypogastric species, for that is fatal.
When you have treated this species of hydrocele tympanic with medicines and the treatment has not been effective, then consider.
For if the patient has already suffered weakness, or there is another illness in addition to hydrocele, such as coughing or abdominal discharge, and similar conditions, then be careful not to treat him with iron, for that is feared.
If you see a patient exhibiting an excess of strength and there is no other illness except hydrops: and the patient is neither a child nor an old person, then the measure of operation in such a case is that you lift the patient standing between your hands, and the attendant follow behind him to express his abdomen by pushing water to the lower part with the blade of a knife.
Then take thorn probes according to this form.
Let it be of the shape of two sharp parts, long, with acute extremities like thorn probes.
Yet in it there should be some briefness, so that you do not pass through with it during the operation to the intestine and wound it.
Then consider.
For if the generation of hydrops is from the part of the intestines, then you must extend the incision from the navel by three fingers' breadth, downward along its length above the ribs.
If the generation of hydrops is due to an illness of the liver, then your incision should be on the left side from the navel by three fingers' breadth.
And if its generation is due to the spleen, then the incision should be on the right side. And it is not advisable for the incision to be on the side on which the patient intends to lie, so that excess fluids do not flow to that weak spot.
Then pierce the entire skin with the instrument.
Then introduce the probe into that incision, and lift your hand with the thorn probe between the skin, and scrape as if you were scraping it off. The amount to be scraped should be about the size of a nail or approximately that.
Then perforate the sinew until the space behind it reaches the vacuum place: and this is the place of water.
Then extract it, and introduce into the opening an instrument, the form of which is as follows.
And it is similar to a tube. It is made of silver, or brass, or golden brass, and is soft and polished. At the lower part of it, there is a small opening, and on its sides are three openings, two from one side and one from the other side. Its end is cut in the manner of a reed's cut end, as you see. At its upper end, there is a bracelet.
For when the instrument reaches the water, then it immediately descends above the instrument, so evacuating half a measure of water in an hour.
For if you evacuate from it more than is required, perhaps the sick person will die in an hour from the depletion of his vital spirits, or it may result in a fainting that approaches death.
Indeed, evacuate from it according to the quantity of its virtue, and according to how the disposition of the sick person is indicated to you by the strength and goodness of his pulse.
Then extract the instrument, and retain the water.
This is because the water is retained immediately due to the skin which retains the opening above the sinew: about which I have spoken, so that you perforate it in this manner.
Then repeat the procedure with the instrument on the following day, if you see the sick person tolerate it; and extract a small quantity of water as well. Perform this for some days without fear, and guard yourself from error: until there remains in the water only a little.
If, however, you fear for the sick person and allow much sediment to remain in the water, then take care of it with burial in hot sand, and with much sweat in a bath and sun, and let it wait on thirst: and take care of it with drying medicines until it is cured: and cauterize over the stomach, spleen, and heart after the extraction of the water, according to what I have narrated in what preceded.
Concerning the care of infants born in places where their urine passages have not been perforated.
Chapter LV. When one of the infants emerges from its mother's womb, and the membrane covering its head is not perforated, or the opening is narrow, or in an incorrect position.
Therefore, it is necessary to provide assistance with the immediate perforation using a sharp spatula very finely, according to this form.
Then place a fine pin made of lead in the opening and tie it up. Keep it tied for three days, or four.
When therefore it wants to emit urine, remove the pin and let it flow.
Then replace it.
And if you do not place the lead, it is possible that the urine, which flows over the place, will prevent it from being closed.
That one whose opening is narrow is treated with lead, as we have said, for many days until it is enlarged.
Those, however, in which there is a hole in an inappropriate place, are injured.
Which is because, among those who are born, the hole is located at the end of the spinal column: hence it cannot insert until he elevates the rod with his hand to the upper parts. Neither is there generation, for the sperm cannot reach the matrix in a straight line: and this is a very foul disease.
And the method of operation in this case is to have the patient lie on his back with his head raised.
Then extend the head of the spinal column with your left hand by a vigorous stretch, and cut the head of the spinal column from the priapic location with a sharp needle or a sharp spoon: just as you would cut a reed, or as you would scrape something, so that its middle becomes similar to the head of the spinal column: and let the hole fall in the middle as it should.
And beware to you during the operation from the flow of blood.
For it has happened many times.
Therefore oppose it with what cuts the blood, and take care of the wound until it is healed.
¶ Concerning Albathe, which occur in the prepuce and head of the penis, and corruption, blackening, and adherences.
Head LVII.
These Albathe often occur in the spinal column, and are an ugly prominence of flesh.
And from it there is a malignant one, and another that is not malignant.
Therefore, the non-malignant one should be suspended with a fine hook and cut it until you cleanse it entirely.
Then place it under the surface in a layer of Egyptian ointment. Then treat it with dyafinicon ointment afterward until it is cured.
If it is malignant, of a foul color, then you should apply cauterization after making the incision and explain the reason for doing so.
If, however, the malignant tissue is within the foreskin of an uncircumcised person, and part of it is inside, and part outside, then you should remove the internal malignant tissue until it is secure, then treat the external part: for if you treat both parts simultaneously, the foreskin may become inflamed.
And even afflictions occur in the testicles, with the foreskin turning black and decaying.
Therefore, you should cauterize the entire area that has already turned black, is about to decay, or is already decaying.
Then cover it with honey that has been dissolved in water and wheat flour, as well as powdered herbs sieved through a fine sieve.
Then treat it with the remaining treatment until it is cured.
If, however, there is bleeding, then apply cauterization with lunar caustic in this manner.
Cauterium enim est iuvariuum ad duas dispositiones simul, scilicet ad fluxum sanguinis, et vulnus quando corrumpitur.
Quod si corroditur caput virgae, et destruitur totum in hora: tunc oportet ut intromittas in meatum priapi cannulam ex libero, ut minuat infirmus super eam.
In adhaerentia vero praeputii cum capite virgae, et haec quidem adhaerentia non accidit, nisi in eo cuius praeputium est sanum, et non exigitur super ipsum circumcisio: et quandoque accidit adhaerentia propter vulnus, aut apostema: oportet ergo ut excories eam cum Spatumili obtuso, donec soluatur ligamentum, et liberetur caput virgae ab omni parte.
Quod si est difficile discernere ea exquisite, tunc oportet ut excories aliquid ex capite virgae, et ex praeputio.
Because when the prepuce is delicate, it perhaps gets perforated quickly due to its delicacy.
Then separate the prepuce from the head of the penis with a fine linen cloth that has been moistened in cold water, so that they do not adhere again.
Then treat with styptic wine until it heals. ¶ Concerning the cleansing of infants and the cure of an error that may occur in them.
Chapter LVII.
Circumcision is not a continuation of the tissue, as with other wounds; although it is due to our operation, our will, and its use is proper for children, it is necessary that we signify in this operation a better method and a gentler way leading to health.
Therefore I say that the ancients did not mention circumcision in any of their books, for they do not use it in their laws, and it is merely what we have acquired through experience.
Because I have found a greater part of the artisans and phlebotomists use cauterization, by cutting with a razor and with forceps: they also use burned irons, and ligatures with thread, and incisions with a knife.
And I have indeed tested all these methods and did not find any better method of cauterization with forceps and ligature with thread.
For in cauterization with a razor, the skin often gets burned.
For the skin of the prepuce has two layers: therefore perhaps the upper layer is burned, while the lower layer remains intact. This necessitates an incision to burn the other layer, and will cause future pain.
And with the cauterization done through burned irons, that is, by digitation, which surgeons use, the incision at the extremity of the male member is not secured: for it might enter the opening of the urethra.
In cauterization with a knife, the iron might escape, and ruin your operation: and the child's skin is naturally short, and often they are born like this, in which case they do not need cauterization: and I have seen this.
In cauterization with forceps and ligature with thread, good experience has shown me: for the forceps are of equal cutting power: because the sharpness above is like the sharpness below.
When therefore you press your hand, two sharpnesses are proportioned, and strike according to one operation at one time: and a compression of similar figure is made, containing the skin of the rod from all parts, with which no error at all falls.
And the proper method of operation is to make the boy understand, especially if one of those who can understand a little, that you do not do anything except tie a thread on his rod: and release him until another day.
Then make him rejoice and be exceedingly glad as much as possible to him, from what his intelligence receives.
Then insert your hand into his rod, and blow on the skin, and pull it up until the head of the rod emerges.
Then cleanse it from what dirt adheres to it.
Then tie the marked place with double thread.
Then tie below it somewhat with a ligament according to. Then hold it with your index finger and thumb to maintain the position of the lower ligament, and cut between the two ligaments.
Then lift the skin up quickly, and extract the head of the rod.
Then let the blood flow slowly (for this is better) and place powder above: and on the powder, a cloth spread with decoction of rose water and well-mixed with fresh good rose oil: and leave him with it until another day: and care for the rest with other treatments until he is healed.
The form of the forceps for purification is this.
Let the two extremities be curved, and let them incline inward: that a branch of the claw may not emerge therein. And let the length of the two acutes be as the length of two handles equally.
An error however occurring in purification is: for perhaps the intrinsic skin wholly or part thereof escapes at the incision. Therefore, you must extend it from the time of your visit with your nail before the abscess forms, and incise it according to equality.
If you cannot hold it with your nail, then extract it with a hook, and incise it.
If however three days have passed and that which remains under the rod swollen is an abscess, then leave it until the hot abscess settles, and scrape it off with ease, and incise it according to preparation for you: and beware of the part under the head of the instrument.
For it will not harm him.
Therefore take care of that with what we have described to consolidate the wound from the powders, which we narrated in the treatise on powders: and if it is incised above the measure from the skin and escapes to the upper parts, it will not harm him either.
Therefore take care of that with what we have said until it is cured.
¶ On the extraction of Vesicaria retained in the bladder.
Chapter LVIII.
Retention of urine in the bladder is caused by obstruction from stone, or frozen blood, or pus, or flesh grown from them, and similar things arising from what we have said regarding methods of cure in division.
And if it is not relieved by urine, and you see the retention to be caused by a stone which is already in the neck of the bladder: then the patient should be laid on his knees for treatment.
Then the patient's feet should be placed on his back, and he should stretch his belly from the upper part of his back, and the straining patient should breathe as deeply as possible.
Therefore, it is pressed against the neck of the bladder for the expulsion of the stone: hence the urine is relieved.
And if it is not relieved by what we have said, and the patient becomes faint from the effort: then you should administer its extraction with an instrument called a syringe, which has this form: It should be made of silver, and be fine, soft, concave like the radius of a bird's feather in fineness, long in the likeness of the length of one and a half fingers: it should have a fine tube at its head.
And the method of the urine's exit through it is this: take a doubled thread, and tie at its end wool or cotton, good thread: and insert the end of the thread into the lower part of the syringe. And cut with pincers if any excess from the wool remains, but insert it into the tube with effort, as you lift it.
Then anoint the syringe with oil, or butter, and flour of alum: and make the patient sit on a seat, and foment the bladder, and its stick with oily substances, and olive oil, and warm water.
Then introduce the syringe into the urethra with ease until it reaches the root of the urethra.
Then double it over from the umbilical part above. Then push the syringe inside it until it reaches the bladder, and let the patient feel that it has now reached the empty place. And this does not happen in this order unless the channel through which it passes is tortuous.
Then extend the thread with wool gradually.
For the string will follow the wool.
Then withdraw it, and let the string run through the urethra: and repeatedly use the syringe, and do not cease doing this until the bladder is emptied, and the patient feels relief. ¶ On the quality of clistherization of the bladder with Clepshydra.
Head LXIX.
For it is closed, or surda.
And there are three apertures in it, two on one side and one on the other side, as you can see.
And the place is concave, in which that which drives it is situated according to the quantity of what it administers without addition, until when drawn with it something else is attracted by its moisture: and when pushed, it expels it to a distance, according to how clepshydra works, which projects naptha, i.e., Greek fire in battles.
When therefore you wish to expel humors from the vesica, insert the end of the clepsydra into the humor, and draw it out carrying with it what is pushed toward the upper parts, for the humor is drawn into the concavity of the clepsydra. Then insert the end of it into the rod, as we have described in the syringe.
Then push the humor along with what is pushed by it, for the humor then reaches the vesica immediately, so that the patient feels it. The form of the clister is thin, through which the vesica is irrigated.
Then insert the strong thread into those openings as they are turned. Then aggregate a circle, as an aggrement of alsofratu: after you place therein what you wish from humidities, and oils, and waters.
Then ligate it on the instrument: and do so with it as you did with the vesica from manual expression, until the humidity reaches the vesica.
¶ De extractione Lapidis.
Caput LX. We have already discussed the classification of kidney stones and their treatment with medicines: and I described the difference between a stone generated in the kidneys, bladder, and its signs: and I mentioned the stone for which operative intervention is performed either by manual means or through surgery: and there is the stone generated properly in the bladder: and the one fixed in the shaft: and I am narrating these with a clear and abbreviated exposition.
I say, therefore, that the stone generated in the bladder occurs most frequently in children.
And from its signs, the urine that is discharged from the bladder is similar to water in its fineness: and white sand appears in it, and the sick person rubs his shaft, and labors with it, and often hangs on it. Then it rises, and they discharge it along with it from the anus in many cases.
And the cure for children is easy as long as they are under fourteen years of age.
And it is difficult in elderly people.
In youths, however, the treatment is intermediate, being between the two extremes: and for those with a larger stone, the cure is easier; and if it is small, the situation is reversed.
When therefore we have come to the cure, it is necessary first to cleanse the sick person with a clyster, which will expel all feces that are in his intestines: for sometimes it hinders the finding of the Stone in inquiry. Then let the sick person be taken by his feet and shaken, and be moved to the lower parts: that the Stone may descend to the depths of the bladder, or may rise from a high place several times.
Then make him sit between your prepared hands, and his hands be under his hips, so that the bladder may become totally inclined to the lower parts.
Then inquire about him, and touch him externally.
If therefore you feel the Stone in the space, then hurry immediately with the operation above it.
If it does not fall under your touch at all, then you must wipe the index finger with oil from your left hand, if the patient is a boy; or the middle finger if he is a full-grown man. And insert this into his anus and inquire about the Stone until it lies beneath your finger: and turn it gradually toward the neck of the bladder.
Then press upon it with your finger and urge it toward the exterior against the place where you wish to make the incision. And command your assistant to press the bladder with his hand, and command another assistant to extend the scrotum with his right hand upward: and with his other hand, remove the skin which is beneath the scrotum in the part near the place where the incision is to be made.
Then insert the spatium ile, the form of which is as follows.
And find what is between the anus and the testicles, not in the middle, but to the left side of the birth canal: and let the section be above the stone, and your finger be in the anus: and let the section be transverse, so that the external section be wide, and internally strict, according to the quantity, so that the exit of the stone from there be not greater.
For perhaps the finger in the anus compresses the stone at the section, and it exits without difficulty.
And know that for the stone which has angles and margins, the exit is difficult on account of that.
And it is soft, like a gland, and round: and its exit is easy.
Therefore for the one that has angles and margins, add in the fissure.
And if it does not exit in such a manner, then you must force it above: either tighten above it with your hand so that the extremity is like the moon, tightening over the stone and not forcing it from there; or insert a thin, curved instrument underneath.
And if you cannot force it from above, then enlarge the opening slightly.
And if something overcomes you from blood, cut it away with your scissors.
And if the stone is more than one, then push the largest first to the opening of the bladder.
Then cut above it.
Then push the smaller one after that: and similarly do if there are more than two.
If it is very large, then ignorance is such that you should cut beyond the great section.
Since it happens to the sick person either that he dies, or there occurs in him a continuous dribbling of urine: therefore, because the place does not become completely consolidated.
Truly, administer the expulsion of it until it emerges: or use ingenuity in breaking it with forceps until you extract it bit by bit.
When therefore you have completed your operation, then fill the wound with resin, and balsam, and dragon's blood: and bind it up, and place over it a cloth soaked in oil and wine, or rose oil and cold water, so that the hot abscess may be seated.
Then raise the sick person's head on his collarbone, and do not release the ligature until the third day.
When therefore you release it, embrocate the area with water and much oil.
Then care for it with Dyafinicon ointment and Basilicon ointment until it is healed.
If, however, a hot abscess is added to the wound and corrupted, and similar things occur: for example, if the blood congeals in the bladder and prevents urine from being excreted, and this is recognized by the exit of blood with urine.
Therefore insert your finger into the wound, and draw out the blood.
For if it remains, it provokes corruption of the bladder and its putrefaction.
Then wash the wound with vinegar, and water, and salt: and apply whatever is suitable for each kind from the cure until it heals.
And it is necessary for the entire course of treatment that you bind two thighs and apply, caused by the medicines placed over the area.
If the stone is small and is in the head of the urethra, and is fixed there, and prevents the passage of urine: then treat it with what I describe before you reach the operation.
For you will often be excused from the operation through this treatment, for I have already tested it. And you shall take the Perforator made of steel, whose form is that of a triangle with a sharp, fixed point on wood.
Then take a thread and tie it with a rod so that it does not return to the bladder.
Then insert the perforating steel into the rod with ease until the Perforator reaches the stone: and turn the Perforator slowly with your hand in the stone: and ensure the perforation, until you make it penetrate from the other side.
For urine is immediately discharged.
Then press your hand on that which remains of the stone from the outer part of the urethra.
For it breaks by itself and exits with the urine, and the patient is cured.
If this treatment is not prepared for you due to something that prevents it, then tie the thread under the stone, and another thread above the stone. Then dry over a stone on the rod between two ligatures.
Then extract it.
Afterward untie the ligature and cleanse the frozen blood, which forms in the wound.
And it is not necessary to place a thread ligature under the stone, except that it prevents the stone from returning to the bladder: and another ligature above, unless it is so placed that when the thread is untied after the removal of the stone, the skin returns to its place and closes the wound: and for this reason it is necessary for you when you tie the upper thread to lift the skin upward so that it returns at your completion and closes the wound, as we have said.
¶ On the Extraction of Women's Stones.
Head LXI.
The stone is not generated much in women.
If, however, a stone occurs in any of them, then the cure is difficult, and it is prohibited because of many complications.
Their womb is: that the woman perhaps is a virgin. And secondly, because you do not find a woman who will reveal herself to a physician when she is chaste, or among those who are married.
Thirdly, because you do not find a woman who knows this art well, particularly the operation with her hand.
And fourthly, because of the distance from the location of the stone, which requires a deep incision, and there is fear in that.
If necessity prompts you to do this, then you must take a woman physician, well knowing: and it is rarely found.
If you are deprived of that, then seek a chaste, subtle physician, and present a woman midwife well instructed in women's affairs, or a woman who appears to have part of the art: therefore make her present, and especially instruct her that she do all which you command her from inquiry over the stone. First of all, that is, whether the woman is a virgin: then you must insert a finger into her anus and seek the stone.
If therefore she finds it, she must constrict it with her finger, and then command the midwife to insert her finger into the infirm woman's vagina and inquire about the stone after placing her left hand on the bladder and pressing it with good compression. If therefore she finds the stone, then you must gradually move it from the bladder开口处 to lower areas with great strength, until it reaches the base of the thigh.
Then cut above it opposite the middle of the vagina at the base of the thigh, from whichever side it is prepared for her and she feels the stone in that part: and her finger should not be removed from the stone, pressing it below: and let the incision be small first.
Then insert the forceps above that incision.
If therefore she feels the stone, then extend the incision according to the proportionate amount that the stone exits from her.
And know that the species of stones are many. And from this, it is small and large, soft and rough, long, and round with branches.
Therefore, know its species, so that it may be shown to you through this regarding what you wish.
If therefore the blood overcomes you, then add to the place spoken of ground marble and hold it for one hour until the blood is absorbed.
If the flow of blood overcomes you, and you know that the expulsion of the blood is from the artery that was cut, then place powder on the spot and press it with a suitable ligature. And do not remove that; and release the stone, and do not pull it.
For the weak woman may die.
Then care for the wound.
When therefore the sharpness of the blood is quieted after a few days, and the area begins to腐化, then return to your operation until the stone is expelled.
¶ Of the section for hydrocele.
Chapter LXII.
A hydrocele is not a ramus, unless it is an aggregation of humidity in the tunica alba, which is beneath the skin containing the testicle: and it is named sac. And sometimes there is in its own pannicle, which nature has prepared for it in the part of the eye, until it is thought to be: which is an egg otherwise, and is the skin of the testicle between the white, which we have said, and that does not occur except rarely.
And the generation of this from the branches is due to weakness which happens to the testicles: wherefore this material is poured out for them.
And sometimes it happens from percussion on the testicles.
And this moisture has many colors. Or its color is gradually yellowish, or it is reddish blood-colored, or foul and black, or it is watery and white, and that is the predominant one.
For if it is in the white part which we have said, then the abscess is round about as long as the figure of the eye: and the testicle does not appear, for the moisture contains it from every side.
And if the moisture is in its own pannicle, then the abscess is round with a part of the eye, and for this reason the man suspects that it is an egg otherwise.
And if the moisture is between the skin of the testicles and the white part, then it falls under sensation.
Therefore, when you wish to know the color of the moisture, then test the color of the moisture in the abscess with the help of an inserted square, whose form preceded.
According to that which emerges in the trace of the Intromissi, judge concerning that which is between it.
When therefore we come to treatment with the iron, then it must be ordered of the patient that if possible he be phlebotomized, and thou wilt see his body full.
Then it is laid down upon its back upon a high support, and place many cloths beneath it.
Then sit thou on its left side, and command thy servant to seat himself on its right side, who shall extend the rod to one of the two sides of the skin of the testicles and to the part of the flank.
Then take a broad spatula and cut the skin of the testicles lengthwise from the middle almost to the spermatic cord: and let the incision be made straight according to the distance of the line which divides the skin of the testicles, until it reaches the white spermatic cord: and remove the excised part and observe, or beware in cutting it so as not to cut too deeply: and let your excision be such that the part you excise is from the side that hangs more when suspended with an egg: and carefully examine it with the excised part according to its quantity as much as possible.
Then puncture the spermatic cord filled with fluid with a wide perforation, and extract all the water. Then separate the section with forceps between the two labia, and extend the spermatic cord upward, and do not touch the skin enclosing the testicle: and cut the spermatic cord as fully or partially as is possible for you to cut it, particularly its fine side.
For if thou dost not carefully examine it, there will be no security in the incision, lest water return.
If the wound proceeds outward from its skin in the hour of your operation: then when you have completed the section so far, reduce it.
Then aggregate the two skin folds of the testicles with suture.
Then care for it as for other wounds until it is healed.
If you find the wound corrupted by blackish discoloration, then you must ligate the suspensory vessels, fearing a flow of blood.
Then divide the testicle with the suspensory ligament, and extract the wound: thereafter care for it as we have said.
If the water is aggregated in two parts, then know that they are two branches: dry the other part equally as you did the other.
And if you equalize it so that the operation is one, then do so: thereafter, remove the blood.
And insert into the sections wool submerged in oil, or in rose oil: and place outside other wool which was immersed in wine and oil, and spread it over both testicles and the abdomen: and place above two folded cloths, and these are poultices: and ligate them above with a ligature having six turns.
Then take two cloths, steep them in ointment, and fill with medicated wool according to this likeness: and let the ends be such as are pressed from a cask or wet wool: and attach them to the stricture at the waist: and one end may take over the anus up to the back, and the second end to the rib area: and two ends above the two thighs below, and two other ends above the two inguinal areas, and attach the entire stricture to the waist.
And, when artificially treated, this branch is sectioned with a cautery in place of cutting with iron: and it is such that you take the surgical cautery thin, and cut the skin of the testicles with it: and it is heated, as we have narrated: until when the white substance containing water is discovered: then take the cautery, according to this form.
The Greek letter is assimilated.
Then pierce with it that white substance, and let it be heated until all the moisture has emerged.
Then extend the white substance with forceps, and scrape it with a thin heated cautery, and cut it as much as possible for you, until you eradicate all of it.
And be careful with the egg, lest the fire touch it.
And know that this operation is safer, and farther from blood flow, and better than the operation with cutting.
If, however, it gives you a contrary effect at the time of cutting, or at the time of cauterization—such as a hot abscess, or blood flow, or something else—then you must treat the contrary effect with the treatment that is suitable for it, according to what has been previously stated.
If the patient is timid and does not expect this operation due to its horror: then administer the perforation as I describe it: and it is.
When you are convinced that the branch is watery as we have said regarding the signs: then it is necessary to make the patient sit on an elevated seat.
Then pierce the abscess on the lower part of it with a spatula-shaped instrument: and place the puncture according to the length of the body, and let the opening be wide until all the water runs out.
Then place over the wound, and ligate it, and let it be until the remaining water runs out: then care for it until the wound is healed.
If, however, there is a contrariety to the efflux of water at the hour when you pierce it: and this is so only because the white flap causes contrariety at the wound's opening and prevents the exit of water: then you must introduce a feather into the wound, or an instrument with which the efflux of dropsy water is drawn out, whose form preceded this: or add slightly in the operation for the wound.
And know that the water returns and aggregates after six months, or about that time.
When therefore it aggregates, then it should be treated according to the same method, and the sick person will pass his days.
On the care of ramicis carnosa.
Chapter LXIII.
Know that in the section on this ramicis, it is due to fear leading to harm in many dispositions.
Therefore, I believe its removal to be beneficial from fear.
And I recall the operation performed and the type of abscess.
I say that many abscesses occur in the bodies from which the testicles are composed, and this happens for multiple causes, namely. From acute excess or intense flux that flows to the testicles.
From percussion.
And it is the color of an abscess according to the color of the body, and no pain is found in it: and it is a heavy abscess.
And perhaps it is a stony abscess, whose color is dark, and no sensation is found in it.
And sometimes it happens from the nodulation of arteries and their inflation: as its previous mention has already come: or from the inflation of veins.
What is therefore from them, namely from the inflation of arteries, is recognized by the location of the abscess when you compress it with your fingers.
And it is not necessary to touch it entirely.
That which is caused by the inflation of veins, however, does not disperse when compressed with fingers. And it is now possible that the incision be made over this species and over the remaining flesh: and you will cut the skin of the testicles.
Then extend the blade upward and extract it with the white forceps: and free the suspensory ligament from the testicle, and tie the testicular vessels: and cut the suspensory ligament after you have freed it from all parts of the testicle.
If therefore the blade is consolidated with those flesh masses, then it must be drawn out, and cut. And if there is adhesion between something from the siphat, or in what is between the vessels: then it must be freed entirely, and cut with a round incision.
If there is a birth of flesh at a place of adhesion which is behind, then you must cut the entire thing, and extract the egg, as we have said. When therefore your operation is completed, then fill the wound with wool soaked in rose oil and wine: then care for it along with the rest of the care until it heals.
Of the care of Ramicis, which is concerning the vitreous body.
Chapter LXIV.
Itis is an abscess wrapped in a wrapping similar to that of the testicles: and it becomes difficult for the weak due to lack of motion and exercise, and walking.
And in the care of this illness there is fear due to the recollection of what preceded it.
Truly we must say that the operation for this should be done according to what the first ones did. I say that you must make the patient sit on an elevated seat.
Then cut with a broad sharp spatula transversely across the vessels until the vessels are exposed.
Then scrape from all sides, as we have told you in the extraction of arteries in the temples.
Then cut them along the middle section straight according to the length of the body, and extract what is aggregated from the foul and corrupted humors.
Then care for the wound with the treatment of other wounds in which there is a tendency to generate pus, so that the vessels which nourish one testicle fall.
For it is not bad through that.
If the veins occur in all the vessels, then it is necessary to extract the testicles with the vessels because otherwise the womb may be deprived of nourishment due to the incision and may waste away or become inflamed, and there will be no use for them.
On the care of the Ramus Intestinalis. Head LXV.
Therefore, the intestines descend to one testicle from that rupture.
And this rupture is either from the siffac or its extension.
And these two species occur from many causes: either from a blow, or from jumping, or from shouting, or from lifting a heavy object, and similar incidents.
And the sign, when it is from the extension of the siffac.
This is something that happens gradually over a long period of time and does not occur suddenly: and it is an apostema equal in width to its depth: therefore, because the mass compresses the intestine.
And its sign when it is from the sectioning of the mass, because it causes a sudden intense pain at the beginning: and it is an apostema different, appearing beneath the skin and nearby: and that is due to the intestine's discharge and the course of its passage through the mass.
And sometimes it emerges with the intestine surrounding it: and this is called the Intestinal Ramus, or Zirbia: and sometimes it occurs with the wind.
And sometimes it causes feces to run into the intestine and is retained there: and this brings harm to the patient, for it causes severe pain, especially when it is compressed.
And in the treatment of cases of this illness with a steel instrument, there is fear; therefore, one must be careful in such cases.
And the method of operation is to direct the patient so that the intestine, by its own return, is brought by hand into the inner concavity of the mass, if it yields to the return.
Then it is turned upside down over its own neck between your hands: and lift its legs.
Then extend the skin that follows the upper skin, and cut the entire length of the scrotal skin.
Then fix hooks in the two lips of the incision according to what you need to widen the incision with them: and the incision should be made as much as possible so that the egg can emerge.
Then excise the siphak, and what is beneath the skin of the testicles, until when the white siphak is disclosed, hard from all parts: then insert your index finger into that which follows the testicle, that which is between the white siphak, which is beneath the skin of the eye, and between the second siphak, and completely separate the adhesion which is in the posterior part of the eye.
Then probe with your right hand into the skin of the testicles: and with this, elevate the white siphak upwards with your left hand: and lift the eye with the siphak to the section part: and direct your assistant, that he extend the eye upwards: and you separate the adhesion, which is behind after complete elevation.
And seek with your fingers that there be nothing therein from the intestine involuted in the hard white siphak.
If you find anything from it: then push it downward toward the abdomen.
Then take a needle with thick thread, made of ten strands of linen: and insert it at the last siphak, that is, the tunica, which is beneath the skin of the testicle following the section: then cut the ends that project from the thread until there are four strands.
Then join some of them over those with the figure which is in the shape of a cross: and ligate them with the siphak, about which we have said, because it is beneath the skin of the testicle with a strong ligature, until no part from the vessels, which nourish them, can send anything to them: so that no hot abscess may occur.
And place the ligature again outside the first ligature, at a distance of less than two digits from it.
And after these two ligaments are released from the skin under the testicles, take a quantity equal to the size of a finger: and cut the rest according to its roundness, and remove the owl.
Then dry the lower part of the skin incision of the testicles from which the blood and pus flow, as we have described earlier.
Then apply wool soaked in oil, and place it on the wound: and apply the ligament as we have described.
And when the white skin which we have mentioned is cauterized after the incision, be wary of the blood flow.
For it often happens.
And release the ligament until it falls by itself.
If, however, its fall is delayed, then wet it with warm water and place it over what we have said until it falls.
Then care for the wound with the rest of wound care until it is healed.
¶ Of Ramie Ventosa.
Head LXVI.
In This Chapter on Ramie Ventosa, I have not seen anyone who dared to use iron in its treatment.
And first they said that it occurs as we have described in Ramie which is associated with Vine.
That is, you should ligate the vessels after the incision, doing so with ease below: then dry in the middle, and care for it lastly along with what opens it until the vessels fall: and care for the wound as we have said until it is healed.
Of the disruption that occurs in the groin.
Head LXVII.
When a Rupture occurs in the groin, as we have said, and the wound discharges, and nothing from the intestines descends to the testicles: and if it does descend, it is only a little, and returns in all hours. Verily, if this persists for a long time, an addition is made to the fissure until the intestines descend into the fissure.
And this occurs from the extension of the fissure, which is in the groin, as we have said.
Because the fissure extends: then it becomes softened, and an abscess forms, and discharges.
And the treatment is with cauterization, as the preceding narration indicated.
And sometimes it is treated with iron, according to this method: and the patient lies on his back between your hands.
Then dry the wound from the rupture, abscessed, and discharging, by making a cut transversely, according to the width of three fingers.
Then tie the ligature and those beneath the skin until the white fissure is revealed, which is beneath the skin that follows it.
Then take a probe and place it over the discharging area from the fissure, and press it deeply into the abdomen.
Then apply two ligatures over the discharging areas at the end of the probe from the fissure, and connect one with another using a suture: then withdraw the end of the probe.
And do not penetrate entirely with the alsifach, nor stretch the vein, nor anything else, as I have made you know in the cure of intestinal ramification. Then care for that wound with this method of curing wounds.
When therefore you incise the thread, cleanse that, and restore the wound until it is consolidated.
The sisach is contracted, and no prominence of rupture is added.
And cauterization is better in this place, because it is nearer to health.
¶ For the softening of the skin of the testicles.
Head LXVIII.
The skin of the testicles is often softened in some individuals, because the flesh between them is also softened, and the appearance is spoiled.
Therefore, it is necessary for the one who is asked to cure this to make the patient lie on his back and incise the entire softened skin over the natural skin. Then join the two lips with a suture: and if you wish, first remove the excess of the softened skin with three or four stitches, and make a firm suture.
Then care for the other wounds until it is healed, and let the stitches fall out.
¶ For Castration.
Head LXIX.
You should know that Castration is forbidden in our law: and on account of this it would be permissible for me not to remember it in my book: and its mention is not necessary except for two reasons.
One reason is that it may be included in the knowledge of the physician when questioned about it: and so that he may know the cure for him who suffers from it.
And the other reason is that we often require castration of certain animals for the benefit of our livestock, such as rams, hyenas, and leopards, and similar animals.
I say that Castration is performed according to two methods. Or through friction.
Or through a incision and sectioning.
In that which is performed through friction, the procedure is: we make the animal sit in warm water until its testicles become soft and relaxed and hang down. Then, we apply them with your hand until they become completely softened and no longer apparent upon touch.
In castration through incision and sectioning, you must hold the animal, and press the skin of its testicles with your left hand.
And this method of castration is better than that which is performed through friction: for friction might leave something from the testicles, which would cause the animal to seek copulation.
Then care for the wound until it is healed.
¶ Concerning the care of Hermafrodite of two forms.
Chapter LXX.
Hermafrodite is of two forms according to males.
Their penis is because it appears in what follows the space, or on the skin of the testicles, between the two testicles, where there is a figure resembling a woman's vulva, with hair: and sometimes urine runs from what is on the skin of the testicles.
In women, however, there is but one species, and it is a woman's vulva above the pubis, like very small testicles entirely protruding to the outside: of which one is like a priapismus of a man, and two like two testicles.
And the care for three species, two of males, and one of a female, is: because it is necessary to cut away the added flesh until the impression of them is removed.
Then care for them with the treatment of other wounds.
In the second species of males, from which urine emerges on the skin of the testicles, there is no operation, and its care is not complete.
¶ Concerning the incision of Tentigo and protruding flesh in women's vulvas.
Chapter LXXI.
Tentigo is perhaps added to the natural condition until it spoils and becomes ugly: and sometimes it enlarges in some women so much that it extends like in men, and reaches up to intercourse.
Therefore you must hold the exudation of the taint with your hand or with forceps and cut: and not the last parts in the cut, especially at the deep root: so that there does not occur a flow of blood.
Then care for the wound with the cure until it is healed.
Flesh has arisen, which is flesh that grows in the opening of the womb until it fills it: and perhaps it emerges to the exterior according to the likeness of a tail: and because of this some call the condition a caudate illness.
Therefore you must cut it as you cut the taint, and care for it until it is healed.
¶ Concerning the care of Alraca, which is a wound of the woman not perforated.
Chapter 72.
Alraca is a wound of the woman that is not perforated, or it is a small aperture.
And it can be either natural or accidental.
Accidental is from an illness that preceded: and itself can arise either from flesh added and grown, or from a fine thread, or from something thick: and it can occur in the deep part of the womb, or on its sides, or on its upper part, or on its lower part: and it prevents intercourse and pregnancy, and childbirth, and perhaps it prevents menstruation.
And its identification is made through the observation of the midwife if the obstruction is apparent and close.
If it is not apparent, then examine it with your fingers, or using a speculum.
If the abscess is from a fine sinus and is close to two lips, then act quickly and cut it.
And place simples over the two lips.
Then place your fingers of both hands simultaneously, and the woman should lie on her back with her legs spread.
Then extend the two lips with force until the fine sinus is cut and the abscess is opened.
Then take a cloth and soak it in oil, and place it over the area. Let the woman apply this every day to ensure the site does not heal over with new tissue.
If the sinus is thick and wide, then you should cut it using a broad blade similar to a spoon and a leaf of myrtle.
If the abscess is from flesh that has become infected, then suspend it with forceps and cut it. Have with you medicines that control blood flow without causing pain, such as acacia, dragon's blood, and myrrh combined with alum.
Then administer a large cannula made of lead, so that the wound does not heal quickly. Keep it for a few days, and then apply a lint of dry linen. Continue the treatment until it is healed.
And when other flesh wounds are born in the matrix, they must be cut according to this method: while there is no abscess, an apostematous cancerous abscess in the matrix will not cause opposition with iron entirely.
**On the care of hemorrhoids, Athelil, and Bothor rubra in women's vulva.**
Chapter Seventy-Three.
Hemorrhoids are, indeed, the dilation of veins, until much blood flows continuously from them.
When therefore hemorrhoids are long-standing, they become thrombosed: and I have already spoken of the division of their species and the signs thereof: and I will say here which of them receive cure and which do not.
I say that hemorrhoids which are located at the outlet of the uterus and do not appear by touch: then there is no cure for them with iron.
Those, however, which are located at the outlet of the uterus upon which sensation falls, are those which can be cured.
Therefore, you should introduce the woman into a cold room.
Then extend the hemorrhoids with forceps or with a rough cloth and cut them from their roots.
Then powder them near the flow of blood from one of the cut areas without mixing them: as with acacia, and dragon's blood, and turmeric, and similar substances.
Then press her feet against the wall for one hour.
Then place her in cold water.
If the flow of blood persists, then make her sit in a decoction of sumac, pomegranate peel, and gooseberry, and similar substances.
Then take barley flour, mix it with honey and vinegar, and make a poultice with it for her back.
If therefore blood is cut with it, that is good; and if not, cause the back cups and nipples to adhere, without scarification.
Then take wool and immerse it in the juice of tamarisk, or juice of arnoglossa, or juice of branches of alaula, that is, aglanthus, and let it adhere.
When therefore the abscess has settled, then care for the area with ointments until it is healed.
Albarth is red and similar to the heads of alhasse, and has a rough appearance.
Therefore you must incise what is apparent from it, according to what I said about thethil equally: and care for it until it is healed.
¶ On the perforation of the exiture that occurs in the matrix.
Head LXXXIV.
Many types of abscesses occur in the matrix, such as cancer, and lithaneous abscess, and ulcers, and adubelati, and alekilati, that is, herpes, aestiomemus, and fistulas, and hemorrhoids, and ragadiae, and thethil, and hot abscess.
And I have indeed already said all these illnesses and their types, and their signs, and their cures in the division: it is necessary for me to say in this treatise the hot abscess that occurs in the matrix, when it is from abscesses which gather pus, and you must know how its opening is made with a iron.
Therefore you must consider.
Then if the pain of an abscess at its onset is acute with percussion and flame and fever: and you see it redden; if sensation falls upon it, then do not hasten with perforation of it: and care for it along with it as may help toward maturation until the acuteness of the accident subsides.
Then you must cause the woman to sit on a seat which admits two seats, and recline or foment her back, and she should draw her feet toward her lower abdomen: and let her thighs be spread, and place her arms beneath her knees, and bind both with a bandage fitting for that.
Then the midwife should sit on the right side, and administer the instrument by which the opening of the uterus is dilated.
The form of which comes next.
And you must place the tip of the rod deep into the uterus of the woman when you wish to administer this instrument, so that what enters from the instrument does not go deeper than the depth of the uterus and harm the weak one.
If the instrument is deeper than the depth of the uterus, then you must place pessaries over the covering of the depth of the uterus: so as to prevent the entire instrument from entering the depth of the uterus. And you must place a vertigine, which runs on the instrument, from the upper side: and hold the instrument and rotate the vertigine until the depth of the uterus is dilated.
When therefore the exit is apparent and touched by hand and is soft and yielding: then you must cut it off at its head with a spatule broad.
When therefore the pus is evacuated, then you should place on the wound a clean substance immersed in rose oil: or in green oil, in which there is some astringency: and place the clean substance, and extract the section from the deep uterus.
And place externally over the uterus and over the comb clean wool immersed in water in which apples have boiled.
Then treat after two days with ointment suitable for it until it is cured.
And when the uterus and wound are washed, let it be irrigated with water and honey, then with water in which the root of lily or long aristolochia has boiled: then return to the ointment.
If the wound is hidden internally within the uterus, then you must refrain from treating it with a knife; rather, treat it as we have said in the division.
The Doctrine of Obstetrics, how to treat living embryos that have emerged in an unnatural position.
Chapter LXXVI.
It is necessary for the obstetrician to first know the natural position of birth.
From the signs, therefore, you should know this: when you see a woman compress herself towards her lower parts, and desires to smell the air, and something above her is alleviated, and the exit of the embryo is hastened: then know that this birth is in the natural position, and its exit is over its head, with the afterbirth coming with it: or hanging, or suspended from the umbilicus. When therefore you see these signs, then it must be that the abdomen is compressed so that the embryo may descend quickly.
Whoever is beyond this birth is unnatural, unworthy.
For sometimes the fetus emerges with its feet first, and its body comes out before its head, its feet, or its hand: or its head and hand come out, or its abdomen: and perhaps it turns around its neck, and similar figures that are unworthy.
Therefore, it must be that the midwife is prudent and subtle in all these matters, and beware of error and deception: and I am showing every figure from them, and how the nature therein is, and it shall be demonstrated through that, and stand above it.
When the fetus emerges with its head in a natural birth, and this causes strain on the woman, and makes the delivery difficult, and you see its strength already weakened, then make her sit on a seat, or let women support her: and let vapor from fennel decoction and moist oils be applied.
Then the midwife should introduce a small spatula between her fingers and feel for the afterbirth, and cut it with her nail until what is inside comes out due to moisture: and press the woman's abdomen until the fetus descends.
If it does not descend, then the woman must be washed with a decoction of fennel gum and olive oil.
Then command her after irrigating, that it be compressed: and make her sneeze when you insert, and hold her mouth and nose for one hour.
The foetus will immediately emerge.
If two hands of the foetus emerge first, you should reduce them with gentle and gradual force.
If it does not yield on entering, then place the woman on a seat, and elevate her feet upwards. Then shake the seat upon the ground. The woman should be held so that she does not fall during the shaking.
If therefore the hands do not emerge, and the foetus dies: then cut them and extract the remaining foetus. Bind her hand with a cloth and extract it equally, for it will come out itself.
The exit of the embryo over its feet.
When the foetus emerges over its feet, you should push them upwards. Then gradually turn the foetus: afterwards equalize it.
Then take one of its feet and extend it gradually.
When therefore they emerge up to the hips, then command her that it be compressed, and make her sneeze when you insert. For she will emerge if God wills it.
And if it does not emerge with what we have narrated, then reduce the foetus gradually until you place it in its natural position.
For it will emerge then with an easy exit.
If it is forbidden to use what we have described entirely: then take from the thick mucilage, and olive oil, and gum dissolved, and pound all of it well in a mortar: then with a linen cloth mix it with the woman's vulture and the lower part of her abdomen.
Then make her sit in warm water until hypochondria is achieved.
When you see that her lower parts are already heated, then give her a draught of myrrh: and apply it.
When she holds the draught for one hour, then make her sit on a seat.
Then make her sneeze: and close her mouth and nose: and apply gentle pressure to the lower part of her abdomen.
For the fetus will immediately emerge.
The fetus exits over the thighs and hands.
When it emerges in this form, then introduce your hands gradually.
Then let the woman lie on her back with her head raised, and let her feet hang down: and she should lie on the bed, and cross her hands.
Then apply gentle pressure above her abdomen.
Then extract what is under her feet from the cloths until it is prepared in the lower part.
If the fetus does not emerge, then take her feet and move them with vigorous motion.
Then apply gentle pressure above the hypochondria until the fetus ascends to the upper part.
Then insert your hands and equalize the fetus gradually: and command the woman that it may be compressed until the fetus emerges.
The exit of the fetus hanging laterally between the hands.
Let there be a movement to reduce his hands.
If he cannot reduce it, then lift the woman and make her walk.
If she cannot walk, then make her lie on a bed: and shake her thighs with violent shaking.
Then apply the ointment you have prepared from mucilages.
If she receives the delivery, then make her sit on a seat.
Then study the reduction of the hands, and equalize the fetus according to its natural position: and make the woman sneeze, and command her that she may compress herself until the fetus emerges.
The exit of the fetus is over its own neck, with the hands spread out, and its face is toward the back of the mother.
The midwife must hold the hand of the fetus, then rotate it gradually, and equalize it with ease.
When it is equalized, then place it on the vulva as we have instructed with oil and mucilages.
Then command her to be moved gradually.
When you have done this, then make her sit on a seat, and command her to lean to the right side.
Then command her, that she be compressed: and make her sneeze as she is placed.
The exitus foetus praeparati super latus.
When it descends to the opening of the uterus in this manner with the speculum, then cut the speculum with your nail until it is evacuated by the moisture.
If therefore it is suspended over the face of the fetus, and its neck, then cut it from the umbilicus: so that it is not retained and may die.
Then urge the fetus into the interior, until you place it as it should be: and command the woman to compress herself occasionally, for it will emerge by a gentle opening.
The exitus Geminorum, or foetuum multorum.
Know that twins often are born: and sometimes three, and four.
Yet that is foreign, and rarely occurs.
Yet five are things beyond nature, and do not live at all: and contains them, though they may multiply, with one speculum: and are separated by the siacus, distinguishing between them with a ligature around each of their umbilici.
And sometimes they emerge as one fetus emerges naturally, easily: and they emerge by an unbelievable exit, as we have reported. If however some of them are difficult at the birth, and reach that which we said from unnatural figures, then take care of them as we have reported: and let it be with great subtlety, and do what it does with facility and tardiness, and devise according to every figure with whatever is prepared for it by the skill leading to health.
Sometimes one, and two, and three, and four, and five, and six, and seven, and more than ten are formed in the matrix: and it has been verified to me that a woman miscarrying emitted seven, and others fifteen, all formed.
What was measured by the glorious wise man.
Therefore, this must all be known to obstetricians. For perhaps it will resemble that one; therefore, compare it with that one as required.
¶ Concerning the extraction of the dead fetus.
When you treat a dead fetus with the methods I have mentioned in the division of medication, and it does not pass, then you must consider using manual operation.
If therefore the woman is in good health and there is no complication from which fear of loss might arise, then it is necessary to place the woman on her back on a bed, with her head inclined downward and her legs elevated. The attendant should hold her from both sides or bind her to the bed so that her body does not move during the extraction of the fetus.
Then moisten the cervix with a mixture of wet oils and aloeswood and flaxseed. Then the obstetrician should anoint her hand with these oils and mucilages: then introduce it into the cervix with ease.
Then he should inquire where he may fix the hooks from the fetus, and places suitable for that.
Consider therefore if the fetus is prepared to descend over its head: then fix hooks in its eyes, or in its neck, or in its mouth, or in its palate, or under its chin, or in its throat, or in places near its ribs and under the hips.
If the descent is over its feet, then in the pubic region and its middle ribs.
And he must hold the hook with his right hand and place its curvature between the fingers of his left hand: and introduce it with his hand with facility, and fix the hook in one of those places which we have said, until he reaches the empty space.
Then extend it with equal tension, and let the extension not be only in a straight line, but move it in every direction, so that the exit is relieved: just as is done with a tooth during its extraction.
And it must be placed between those parts so that the tension is relaxed.
If a part is retained from that, then the Obstetrician should anoint some fingers with oil and introduce them from the side to rotate what is retained with them.
If therefore a part of the fetus emerges, then change the hooks to another place that is higher: do this until the entire fetus has emerged.
If therefore the hand comes out first, and it is not possible to reduce it because of its compression: then it must be wrapped over it with a cloth.
Then extract it until the entire hand comes out, and cut it either at the ankle joint or the elbow: and thus you must do the same in the other hand and in both feet.
If the head of the fetus is large, or there is compression in its exit, or water is aggregated in its head: then it must be that Spatialispinosum is introduced between the fingers, and it should be opened with it and the head, and the water should be extracted: or it should be ruptured with an instrument called Almisdac: whose form comes with the forms of the other instruments in the chapter that follows.
If the fetus has a nature of a large head, then it must be that Algengam is cut: or it should be extracted with Misdach, as we have said.
Then extract the bones with forceps.
If the head comes out and is compressed at the pelvis: then it should be opened until the moisture in the chest is discharged.
If, however, it is not compressed and does not yield to the exit: then cut the head by pieces, as far as possible for you.
If the lower part of the abdomen is abscessed, or there is hydrocele in it: then you must puncture it until the moisture flows out from it.
If the fetus is above the feet, then the extraction of it is easy, and its direction towards the birth canal is gentle.
If it is constricted within the abdomen or chest: then you must withdraw it with the cloth you have wrapped around your hand: and compress the abdomen or chest until what is within them passes.
If the remaining limbs are removed and the head returns: then the Obstetrician must insert his left hand. If therefore the os matrix is open, then insert the hand into the depth of the matrix, and seek out the head, and draw it with the fingers until the os matrix: then insert one hook or two hooks, and draw it with them.
If the os matrix is constricted, due to a hot abscess that has occurred: then it is not necessary to labor over it; rather, it is necessary to administer a flow of moist things, oils: and apply poultices: and sit in waters that soften and moisten.
If the fetus is in a breech position, then it is possible to bring it into a normal position: then administer what we have said regarding a living fetus.
If it is not possible to bring it into a normal position, then it should be delivered by cesarean section and extracted.
And you must not let anything from the afterbirth remain inside entirely.
When therefore you have completed your operation, then administer what we have said regarding hot abscesses that occur in the uterus.
If there is a bleeding episode, then let the patient descend into a bath of purgative waters and proceed with the remaining treatment.
And I have indeed seen a woman whose fetus had died in her womb: then she became pregnant again by the same means, and another fetus also died.
Therefore, after a long time, a boil appeared at his navel and became inflamed until it opened: and it began to emit pus.
I was therefore called to cure him, and I treated him for a long time: and the wound did not heal.
I therefore applied to it some strong attracting ointments: and an opening appeared in the place.
Then some days passed, and another opening appeared.
I therefore wondered then, since there is no opening in the womb.
I therefore concluded that the dead fetus was composed of bones.
I therefore examined the wound and extracted many bones, while the woman was in better condition: and she has now lived for a long time and only emits a small amount of pus from that place.
And I did not firm up this foreign object here, except because there is knowledge and assistance in it for what the skilled physician does by hand in the treatment.
¶ Concerning the Forms of Necessary Instruments in the Extraction of a Fetus.
Head 77.
Here is the form of the Forceps, which has two cogs at both ends of two pieces of wood.
Verumtamen haec Vertigo oportet ut sit subtilius strictorio: et ut fiat, aut ex ebano, aut ex ligno bussi.
And let the width of every piece of wood be about two fingers: and the margin of each is about one finger, and the length of each is a palm and half: and in the middle of the two pieces of wood are two additions of the same kind of wood, which are already firmly set in both, whose length is about half a palm more or less: and the width of each is about two fingers, or more or less.
And these two additions are inserted into the mouth of the matrix, so that it opens with them when you rotate the two Vertiges.
The form of the Vertigo that opens the matrix.
Another form for the same purpose, subtler and lighter.
Let it be made from ebony or busby wood, according to the likeness of forceps.
However, at the extremity thereof, let there be two additions, as you see above: and the length of each addition is about a palm: and the width of each is two fingers.
When therefore you wish to open the matrix with it, then have the woman lie on a bed with her feet hanging and the space between her thighs open.
Then insert these two additions joined together into the matrix: and you should hold the lower extremity of the instrument between her thighs.
Then open your hand with the instrument, as you do with forceps, equally according to the quantity you wish from the opening of the matrix's mouth, until the midwife does what she wants.
Forma Vertiginis alii dicunt Forma Impellentis quo impellitur foetus.
Forma Almisdac quo conteritur caput paruum. Forma Vinculi habentis spinam unam.
Forma Vinculi habentis spinas duas.
Forma forceps cui sunt dentes serrati, cum quo conteritur caput foetus.
Forma Spathamilis habentis duas extremitates ad abscindendum caput.
Forma duorum Spathamilium etiam latorum.
These instruments are all used, and the more various their forms are, and the better prepared they are by the craftsman, the faster they are to use in surgery, and the more noticeable they are to men, because of their size.
Therefore, do not disdain any of these instruments if they are prepared for you.
For their necessity is indefensible.
¶ Concerning the Extraction of the Secunda.
Chapter LXXVIII.
When Secundina retains the child during childbirth, then you must order the weak one to hold her breath.
Then make her sneeze when you place it: and hold your hand over her mouth and nose.
If it therefore emerges through this, that is good.
If not, then take a pot and make a hole in its cover: and put herbs that open the womb into it, such as calamus, rue, angelica, chamomile, saffron, cinnamon wood, and centaury. Take all these herbs or some of them, and submerge them in water, and place them over fire.
Then place a reed bulb over the hole in the pot's cover, and the other end into the womb: and hold it there until the vapor reaches the cavity of the womb.
Then make her sneeze, as we have said.
Secundina will then emerge with facility.
If, however, Secundina remains after this cure and does not emerge, then order the midwife to immerse her hand in olive oil or the thick juice of aloe. Then introduce her hand into the vagina and seek out Secundina.
When she has found it, then take hold of it and extend it gradually.
If, however, it is attached deeply in the womb, then introduce your hand as we have described, until when you find Secundina, and extract her gradually in a straight line to prevent the womb from falling due to strong suction. It must be done with ease, alternating between the right and left sides, and then adjusted according to the strength of the extraction.
For then it yields to this, and is preserved, and is discharged from adhesion.
If the mouth of the matrix is narrowed, as we have already narrated: care for it with sneezing, and from the medicine of the pot with herbs.
If it does not discharge with all that we have narrated, then beware lest you tire yourself out in repeated attempts at extraction.
True, you must bind what discharges at the mouth of the matrix to the woman's thigh.
Then treat her with a clyster using a tetrapharmcum ointment.
For it will putrefy her after a few days, and dissolve, and discharge.
For indeed when it putrefies, a bad odor rises from her to the stomach and head, and harms them by weakening them.
Therefore, suitable fumigations should be administered for this.
Some of the ancients have already found fumigations with nasturtium and dried figs to be effective.
The form of the instrument with which fumigations are administered to the woman during retention of Secundine and menstruation.
Let it be made from a vessel similar to an alcama or from a zere. Place the broad end over the fire, and position the fumigation above the prunes. Hold it until that fumigation is consumed, and then repeat with another.
On the treatment of ani non perforati.
Chapter Seventy-Nine.
Many boys are born, and their ani are not perforated, which he has already treated with a fine instrument.
Therefore, the midwife must perforate it with her finger: and if not, she must perforate it with a sharp Spatumilac. And she should beware lest the finger touch it.
Then place woolen cloth soaked in wine and oil over it.
Then treat it with ointments until it is healed.
If you fear that it is becoming perforated, then place a lead tube in the opening for many days, and remove it when the boy wishes to urinate.
And perforation of the ani has also occurred due to the consolidation of the wound or abscess.
Therefore, that consolidation must be cut out, and then it must be treated with what we have said regarding treatment and lead. Concerning the treatment of fistulas that occur in the lower part.
Chapter Eighty.
Fistulas that occur in the lower part are Nodatio and Grossitudo, which arise near the anus exteriorly or in the space of one part: and they may be a single fistula or multiple.
When therefore the Nodatio is incised, it opens, and a watery white fluid or subtle pus flows from it.
And sometimes these fistulas are penetrating.
And they are from these Fistulas when they are in space penetrating until the bladder, and until the meatus of the urethra.
And they are from these penetrating until the hip joint, and until the tailbone.
From the place where a penetrating fistula is known to reach the anus, even if it does not penetrate deeply, you may introduce your index finger into the anus: and insert a fine probe from the air or iron into the fistula when there is no tortuosity.
If there is tortuosity in it, then introduce a fine probe made of lead or horsehair into it until you feel the probe or hair on your finger.
If you do not feel it completely through, nor does anything emerge from the opening during defecation, nor flatulence, nor a worm as I said: then know that it is non-penetrating. Therefore, hasten to treatment.
And when a fistula is penetrating until the bladder or the urethral meatus: then its indication is the exit of urine from there, and its closure to prevent the area from becoming consolidated with medicines.
If indeed it is penetrating until the hip joint or the socket of the bone: then its sign is that a probe will reach there if there is no tortuosity until the opening: and the finding of pain around the area, and that pus always emerges from it: and that treatment does not work there, nor does it become consolidated with ointment.
And in all these fistulas penetrating, there is no complete cure: and the cure of them is labour and vanity to him, by the foolish physicians upon whom it is formed. In that case, however, which is not penetrating and is not old, hope for cure with a needle: according to what I narrate to you, and I have already proven it: and let the sick person lie on his back in your hands, and raise his legs until they are above his own hips, and may his hips be inclined toward his own abdomen.
Then insert lead or air, if there is a tortuosity in the fistula, until you know where it has reached by probing.
If the patient feels it around the anus, then you should insert your index finger into the anus.
If therefore you feel that the probe has already penetrated through itself by your finger, beyond which you feel between your finger and the fistula or flesh, then you may be certain that it is penetrating: therefore do not labor in it, for its cure is not as we have said.
They have said that in some people the flesh is cured, and as a result of the medication by which hope for its improvement is given, one should ignite a thin cautery according to the width of the fistula, as was mentioned before, and insert the ignited one into the fistula until it reaches the anus.
Then repeat this process twice or three times until you know that all those added fleshlike tissues have been cauterized and are like the feathers of a bird.
Then dress it with licentious cloths in butter until those cauterized fleshlike tissues emerge: then dress it with flesh-generating and consolidating ointments.
If therefore it is cured, it is good.
And if not, then it is not cured with any other cure.
And if it issues forth with the probe, and does not endure until your finger, which is in the anus, and there is between it and the probe a thick membrane of flesh or skin: and you will see an abscess in what follows the surface of the skin, then dry the skin from the beginning of the abscess, and you proceed cutting with the probe that is in the abscess until the cutting reaches where the end of the probe arrives, and the probe is released and falls.
Then cleanse those sliced flesh flaps, which resemble bird quill tubes, so that nothing remains from them.
If, however, blood overcomes you and separates those flesh flaps from you and the operation, then it is better that you cauterize it with fire or with a sharp medicine.
For cauterization with fire aggregates good qualities, such as the burning of those added flesh flaps, and the excision of blood, and the drying up of moisture.
Then care for that with clean wraps in butter or roasted stalks until the place discharges pus, and those burned flesh flaps come out as pus.
Then care for the wound with consolidating ointments that generate hard flesh: and they are medicines in which there are astringents and drying properties.
For when they are restored, then it is already cured: and you need not fear recurrence. If, however, the Fistula has reached the depth of the anus and lengthened due to excess of bodily fluid, then insert your finger into the anus and examine it with it.
If therefore you feel a barrier, and between you and it is a covering of skin or flesh, and it is near penetration: then the operation is not to be performed there, but according to the way of faith and hope.
Which is because it is treated in one of three ways: either you cauterize it, as we have said, or you cut it away until you reach its cavity, so that it is possible for you to insert a probe and effect the cure.
And do not cut too much so as not to penetrate the muscle containing the anus, and let it happen to the patient an involuntary evacuation of excrement. Then attend to that with what we have said. For it may be cured: or you may lengthen that covering and cleanse it after drying it near the anus, as we have said, or you may probe it or use another sharp instrument.
Then cleanse those filtered tissues in the incision until you can do so with probing.
Then attempt the restoration of the wound including the incision, and at the upper opening where it is being consolidated. The fistula will remain open in the inner part of the anus, and this will be easier for the patient.
And sometimes the fistula is sewn in this manner: and it is when you insert a probe into the fistula: and it is on the side of the anus near the surface of the body with skin and margin of the anus. Then take a probe with a perforated extremity, which is like an awl, that is, a prepared tendon, according to this form.
And introduce into it a wound wrapped in a thread of five strands, and about that.
Then introduce the probe with a thread into the Fistula until it reaches its concavity.
If therefore it penetrates to the internal margin near the anus, then withdraw the thread from that opening: so as to introduce your finger into the anus and withdraw the end of the thread, and join the two ends together: and tightly draw both, and leave them on one or two days. And the more the thread incises the flesh, draw it well until those flesh parts between the two ends of the thread fall off: then care for the wound until it consolidates and heals.
For you are not permitted to do this for the sake of the leg that you may not incise it.
Then proceed with it as we have said, until it heals.
The shape of the Spatulumis spine, which is used to treat the Fistula, has a sharp part for incising, and another part that is not sharp so as not to incise what is not necessary, as you can see.
For the suturing of Hemorrhoids from which blood flows after their incision: and care for fissures.
Chapter LXXXI.
There are Hemorrhoids according to two modes.
For they are within the anus, similar to bladder carbuncles or warts: or as if they themselves are grains of stone.
And they are both small and large: and blood flows from them always, and there is one and there are many.
And they are outside the anus and at its extremities.
Yet those which are outside the anus are for the most part few in moisture, from which flows yellow water or a little blood with an intermittent flow: and they are according to the color of the body.
And the cure for what is within the anus is that you instruct the patient to sit: and express it until the anus discharges and the abscesses become apparent to you.
Therefore also hang them with hooks: or hold them with your fingernail.
Then cut them at their roots.
If, however, they are not retained by the hooks due to their moisture and softening: then grasp them with a rough cloth or with a tool made from doubled linen thread, and pull them out with your fingers.
Then cut them and dust them with some warm powders after the incision to serve as a substitute for cautery.
Or cauterize them according to what was described in the chapter on cauterization.
Then cure them with the remaining treatment until they heal.
If the anus does not yield to discharge, then administer a clyster with a small dose of medicine, so that it may relax what is in the anus and cause quicker discharge when the patient expresses it.
If the abscesses are external to the anus, then they are light and easy: and you should take them with your fingernail, or take them with a hook, and cut them.
Then care for them as we have said until they are cured.
And if one abhors incision with a steel instrument, then it must be that you administer suturing according to this manner.
Take a wound thread and insert it into the needle.
Then extract the abscess upwards, and make it penetrate with the needle at the root from the other side: and wind the two ends of the thread around the lower part of the needle, and let them be widely wound: and tightly tie the abscess with a strong knot.
Then tie off the thread with a knot, and extract the needle.
Do this with all abscesses, and leave one of them, so that the excess blood may run from it.
Then place a cloth soaked in rose oil or cerate over the anus and put it on the anus: and command the patient to rest.
Then leave it until it falls.
When the abscesses therefore fall, care for them with ointments and other treatment until they are cured.
¶ Concerning the Care of Fissures.
For fissures often occur from the drying effect of feces and natural contraction.
When therefore they are ancient and medicine does not avail in them: then it is necessary to scrape with points of Spatumilis, or with your own nail, until they become moist, and the outer cortex which prevents their consolidation should be removed.
Then care for them until they consolidate as is necessary.
If they do not consolidate: then scrape them with a more vigorous reason than the first, until they bleed much, and let them excrete. Care for them until they are healed.
¶ Concerning the care of Almirmar infections and non-infections, and Athelil ulcers and ant bites.
Then care for that: and if you wish, cauterize it according to what was described in its own chapter.
From Athelil siccis, there is a small prominent swelling, rough, filtered, round above the surface of the body.
And it often occurs in the hands of children.
And the care for it is to spread the Athelil, and cut into it: or tie it with silk thread: or with hair, until it falls.
And if you wish, cauterize it according to what has been said with fire, or with sharp medicine: and now the inverted and not inverted athelia are eradicated with the instrument which I shall say. Formica however is also a small elevation filtered, coarse, rising on the surface of the body, going very deep: and when it finds it, cold is felt in it similar to a bite of a flea, and it happens throughout the body: and most of it happens in the hands.
And the treatment for it is that you take a quill from a swan's feather or from an eagle's strong feather: and place that quill over the formica, until a ring of the parts of the formica is contained within the quill.
Then turn your hand with the quill until you separate what is around the formica: and place it deep in the flesh, and eradicate the formica from its root. And if you wish, do this with an air quill or a iron quill, according to this form.
Place the quill at its upper part, drawing out the deaf person tightly, so as to alleviate the grasp on the digit and its turning.
And if you wish, cauterize the formica according to what has been said in the cauterization of athelia in the chapter on cauterization.
¶ Concerning the Forms of Instruments Used for Enemas in Diseases of the Anus, and for Bowel Clearance and Colic.
Chapter LXXXIII.
Sometimes a clyster is made from silver, or from brass, or from fused copper, or hammered copper.
And sometimes it is made from these instruments of small and large size according to those in which they are administered.
That which is administered in the cure of young children shall be small: and of those whose age are weak or painful, so also their clysters.
A large clyster.
A small clyster.
Its cannula, that is, the upper part into which the uterus is tied, should be wide according to this measure. And there should be a distinction so that the uterus is tied as you see, and the lower extremity which is inserted into the anus, should be deaf, that is, not open, soft, very fine, drawing towards subtlety: and on one side thereof are two orifices, and on the other side one orifice.
And the width of the orifice should be according to the thickness of the rays, and a little thicker, and the uterus in which medications are placed from an animal bladder: or from egg parchment, which should be shaped like a small asafetida: whose root is one palm.
When therefore the uterus is placed therein, it is tied at the head of the clyster between two distinguishing constrictions with a strong string.
Then the enema should be used with it.
And this is the form of the circle here depicted, and of the holes. The quality of the enema to be used with it is as follows: fill the bladder or reservoir with medicine which has been heated according to the tolerance of the patient, and take care that it is neither very hot nor very cold.
Then the patient is turned face downward on his back, and raises his legs toward the upper part: and place under him a cushion, that is, a skin or cloth on which people lie.
Then anoint the end of the enema with oil, or with a paste of colocynth, or with fennel mucilage, or similar substances.
Then insert it into the anus with ease.
Then the attendant should take the bladder with both hands and express it forcefully until all the contents of the enema are evacuated into the intestine. Then remove the enema, and the patient raise his legs against the wall. If the medicine induces evacuation, then the patient should retain it for as long as possible.
And if he sleeps with it all night, it is more beneficial for recovery.
If the enema causes rapid evacuation in conditions of intestinal distension, then repeat the enema until he is cured.
If there are hemorrhoids or painful abscesses in the anus, then use a very thin, gentle enema with the same preparations used for enemas given to children.
And this be the form of a thin enema for which the skin is drawn.
¶ Concerning the Treatment of Head Injuries without Fracture of the Bone.
Caput LXXXIIII.
I have already spoken about the division of the treatment of wounds in the book, and I will now speak about the treatment using both hands and medicines according to need.
I say that wounds are differentiated according to the manner in which they are inflicted, and according to the place upon which the wound falls.
Therefore, the things by which wounds are inflicted are often like the throwing of a stone, or a cut with a sword or knife, or a strike with a lance, or a stick, or an arrow, and similar to these from many objects.
Wounds that are inflicted according to the parts of the body are, for example, a wound that falls upon the head, or the neck, or the chest, or the belly, or the arm, and similar ones from other limbs.
And I am now recounting the treatments for certain wounds, so as to set forth that reasoning and rule for other wounds.
And I will begin with simple wounds of the head: for the recall will come to the beginning of the third chapter.
I say therefore.
When a simple wound occurs on the head and there is no fracture of the bone, consider then if it is from the throwing of a stone or something similar, and has only broken the skin: and it is a large wound, and fear a severe outcome of a hot abscess. Then hasten, and perform a cephalic phlebotomy immediately: and do not delay that: and draw off the blood from him according to the quantity of his strength: if nothing forbids phlebotomy, especially if the blood that comes out of the wound is scanty.
And let phlebotomy be from the opposite part of the wounded area.
And let the sick beware of overindulgence, and of wine, and of heavy foods.
If, however, something prohibits diminution, then it should be diminished from food, and let it not approach flesh, nor wine.
And apply to the wound if it happens to him an inflammatory abscess, a cloth soaked in rose oil alone, or with wine in which there is astringency.
If, however, you are free from the inflammatory abscess, then apply to the wound if it is recent with its own blood, and has not been changed by air, the powder which I will describe in a moment: and if it has already been changed by air, then apply to it certain ointments until it heals.
If, however, the wound is large, or is from a surgical incision with similar wounds, and the lips thereof do not come together through granulations, then bring them together with sutures, according to what I will describe in wounds of the abdomen concerning their suturing.
If, however, the wound has already exposed the bone and hangs down, and there is no retention of it except by a small suspensory ligament, then cut it.
Then treat the wound with medications, and restore in it hard flesh instead of skin, and instruct the sick to eat foods that are heavy, such as heads and cooked wheat, until he is well: and similar things.
If you find putrefaction in the skin and it does not adhere to the bone, then cut away the entire putrefied part and discard it. Then treat that area.
If, however, there is an artery or vein from which blood flows in these wounds: and it cannot be severed by medicines, then inquire about the artery.
If therefore you find it not ligated, then ligate it with Spatumili, or cut it.
If necessity prompts it when it does not provide what we have said, then cauterize it until the blood is severed.
¶ The Method of the Powder of Incarnated Blood.
Recipe of libanum one part, and of dragon's blood two parts, and of unextinguished lime three parts: all be well ground together and sifted. Fill the wound with it, and bind tightly until it adheres well and coagulates with the blood.
Then bind it with cloths, and leave it alone until it heals, so that it does not become inflamed.
For medicine does not remove it until it is healed.
Then care for the rest of the treatment until they are cured.
¶ Of Wounds of the Neck.
Chapter LXXXV.
If a wound occurs in the neck, then there is no difference in the treatment, and it is the same as a wound of the head when simple.
If the nerve of the neck or the artery has already been cut: then if it is a nerve, there is no art in it, unless to direct the treatment of it with what causes strong vasoconstriction, like zinc oxide and zegi, and similar substances.
Since the nerves are harmful and contract them.
And do not place anything completely cold over the wound: for the substance of the nerves is cold, and their continuity is with the brain, which is the most noble of bodily parts. Let it be what is used in treatment with mild medicines, such as chalk mixed with sweet water several times infused with olive oil or rose oil, and tuthia, when washed also with sweet water: and other wet ointments and mineral stones according to this mode, and moist unguents.
If the wound is great, then administer suturing: or approximate the edges thereof with stitches.
Then care for it until it is healed.
If the wound is deep, or a sinus occurs in the lower part thereof, in which pus has already aggregated, then puncture it in a more depressed place therein.
If the artery has already been incised in the wound and there is a flow of blood: then separate it, or dry it, and ligate it; or cauterize it if necessity demands that.
If the spine of the throat or the entire throat has already been incised and the vocal cords are saved: then approximate the skin edges with suturing over the throat cane, and do not touch the throat, but level it, and restore it to its natural shape.
Then suture it with an appropriate tension, and remove it after a few days.
Then care for it with ointments that have styptic and drying properties until it is healed.
If the wound has already made an impression in the bone, then probe it: then if there are any fragments of bone in it, remove all that you can, or what is ready for removal: and leave that which is not prepared until the wound putresces and is separated and facilitated by its egress.
If the wound is recent, then dust it with the powder I have described.
If bone is found in the wound and a fistula occurs, then care for it along with what is mentioned in the chapter concerning it.
Chapter 86.
If therefore from the wound there issues wind, when the sick man breathes hard because of it, then know that the wound is mortal.
If it has no depth, and is recent with its blood: then do not put powder on it from the first hour, nor compress it, that blood does not remain in its depth and return to the heart and kill the sick man; but apply attractive ointment to it, and loosen it twice a day.
If indeed ointment is not present for you, then apply old honey to the wound, so that it draws out what issues from it due to moisture. And make sure the sick man sleeps with his limb over the wound, so that what gathers there may flow away.
If indeed three days or more have passed since the wound, and no spasm, nor bad heart tremor, nor constriction in breathing occur, and you see all other conditions good: then know that the wound is healing.
Care for it and with linseed, and other treatments, until it heals.
If indeed the healing is delayed and it opens up always, then know that a fistula has formed.
Care for it according to its chapter.
And if the wound is from a sword or knife incision, and is simple on the surface of the chest or back: then care for it with what preceded it in suturing, if it is large; or with powder, if it is small.
If he has already made an incision in the bone and fragments result from it: then examine the wound, and hasten to extract those fragments if they are separate.
If they are not separate, then leave them alone until the wound putrifies, for the extraction of them is harmful.
Judgment concerning the accidents of wounds in other parts in the cure is the judgment which we have said.
On wounds of the腹壁，和肠的排出，以及它们的处理。
Chapter 87.
The disruption that occurs in the belly is great, medium, and small.
From a great disruption, intestine or the number of intestines sometimes protrude.
Why this occurs is that the insertion of them is greater and their suturing more urgent and more difficult.
And even a small disruption can become difficult from another manner.
Therefore, the reduction of them is more difficult if you do not hasten in their insertion to their place immediately, for they inflate, open up, and become congested; hence their entry becomes more difficult.
Therefore, the disruption that is medium becomes better: for while reduction of the intestine is not difficult in this case, it is more difficult in the two species mentioned.
Know that the suturing of the vein is according to four modes.
Two common stitches suit for suturing of the腹壁, and for suturing other wounds of the body: and two other stitches properly communicate with other wounds.
However, they are more proper for the suture of the腹壁: and I will tell you each with an explanation and declaration. I say, when a wound is small and something from the intestine emerges from it, making it difficult to reduce it: then it is for one of two reasons.
Either because of the magnitude of the rupture, as we have said: or because of inflation in the intestine due to cold air.
When therefore it is so, then you should warm it, such that you immerse a sponge or damp cloth in warm water.
Or boil it in water with saffron, calamus, and pepper, and foment the intestine with it until the inflation resolves.
Sometimes it makes sense to use wine in which saffron has been added: and it is better than water alone in resolving inflation.
When therefore you see the inflammation already resolved, then moisten the intestine with water in which althea or mallow has been decocted.
For through this, the entrance of the wound is alleviated with small substances.
If, however, the return is obstructed after this cure, then incise the rupture slightly with the instrument used for cutting hemorrhoids.
And the first treatment is better when prepared than cutting: and there is no forced necessity to cut after the need and deficiency of the instrument.
Let one part of it be twisted and acute, and the other part not acute, and let the extremity not be with subtlety like Spatumilis, but somewhat more obtuse: and that is that which is similar to a caidaya, as you see.
When therefore the wound is enlarged and enters the intestine, then it must be reduced according to its natural form in its proper place if possible: for this is better.
When however the disruption is wide in the lower part of the belly: then it must be made to lie on its back, and elevate its legs toward its head.
And if it is in the upper part of the belly, then elevate its head and its chest above its lower parts.
And similarly, if the disruption is in one of the two parts of the belly, then direct your intent and consideration always to this, that the part where the wound is should be above the other part.
And thus it must be applied in great wounds, and in medium-sized wounds.
In small wounds, place it according to how it is prepared for you.
Then make sure that a pious minister is present with his hand holding the entire disruption, and bring the edges together.
Then detect something after something for the one who follows to suture: and this is the common method of suturing.
And you should take a needle, or a number of needles according to the width of the wound.
Then release from the extremity of the disruption the quantity of the ring finger, that is, the doctor: and fix with a needle one through which you introduce thread in both extremities of skin, with both extremities being those that are under the skin from within, until you make it penetrate from another part, and you now have aggregated two extremities of skin, and two extremities of sinew: and there are four orders.
Then tie with double thread around the needle several times from both parts simultaneously, until the two wound edges are properly aggregated.
Then release the thickness of the finger as well, and fix another needle in them: afterwards, tie it with thread, as you did with the first needle.
Therefore, do not cease to do this with the needle where you need to, until you complete the constriction of the wound entirely.
And let the needles be of medium thickness between thickness and subtlety: for thin needles quickly pierce the flesh, while thick ones are difficult to introduce into the skin. Therefore, they should be of medium thickness in both subtlety and thickness.
And it is not necessary to fix the needle in the adjacent skin extremities too closely: so that the flesh is not quickly pierced, and the wound does not open before its consolidation, and do not extend even during suturing, so that the wound is not hindered by consolidation.
Then cut the extremities of the needles, so that they do not harm the weak person during their sleep: and place small pads of cloth from all sides on them, which hold the extremities of the needles: and release them until you know that the wound has already consolidated.
And this very kind of stitching with needles is more suitable for small wounds.
Since one or two needles suffice for stitching them.
The second kind of stitching is common, as you aggregate with the stitch the extremities of four: extremities, two of skin, and two of flesh, in succession one by one, using a needle on which there is a thread wrapped equally in thickness and size.
Then, when you have penetrated with the needle these four extremities, withdraw the needle from the part where you began in the same manner, so that the thread retained from the upper part of the wound falls: let the stitch be as a stitch of cloth which is tied together with stitches, and place the thickness equivalent to that of a little finger between every stitch.
They call this kind of stitch a common one.
And with this stitch I缝合了我腹部的一处伤口，发生在一位被刀刺伤的男子身上，伤口裂开约一掌之长：伤口向外从腹腔深处大约伸出两掌，伤口在腹部正中裂开。
I therefore reduced that after the intestine had been outside the wound for twenty-four hours.
The wound therefore healed over a space of about fifteen days: and I treated it, and it was cured, and he lived many years after that, occupied with his affairs.
And the physicians had judged that it would not be cured.
And it was a miracle that I did not treat that with ointment.
Since I was in a place where ointment could not be found, nor anything from medicine.
Therefore, I applied old wax twice a day over the wound, and washed it assiduously with honey water until it was healed.
But I will speak of two kinds of suturing proper according to the narration of speech.
And you should begin with sharp suturing: and insert the needle from the exterior into the interior part.
When therefore the needle penetrates the skin and enters the muscle according to the length and breadth of the entire body: release the end of the thread on the side where you inserted the needle, and make it penetrate to the other end from the interior part to the exterior in the opposite side.
When therefore you have made it penetrate, then make it penetrate according to this in the same side from the exterior part to the interior: and release the end of the thread which is on this side, and make the needle penetrate to the other end from the interior part to the exterior: and make it penetrate with the penetration by which you make it penetrate in the thread end on the side, until it penetrates into the whole.
Then begin also from this same side, and sew it itself with the end which is from the thread on the other side, and withdraw the needle from the skin which it penetrated.
Then bring it to that skin, and sew its end which is on the other side with this thread end: and withdraw it from the skin which is on its part, and do that in the forward and backward manner until you have sewn it completely according to that example.
And the sum of this suturing is that you use the sutures of butchers as they skin hides: thus you shall make one stitch from one side with one edge of the skin, and let it go on the other side with the other edge until you complete.
Second kind of suture proper, which Gale mentioned.
This speech is narrated so that you may use it according to the likeness by which some physicians use them, namely, that they bring every part together to a natural fit: and they apply one edge to another edge, and one end to another end.
And this is done according to what I narrate to you.
You must fix the needle at the edge nearest to you from the outside, and make it penetrate to the interior in that place: and let the two edges come together.
Then turn the needle, and make it penetrate from the outside to the interior at both edges, namely on both sides.
Then turn both needles, and also make them penetrate from the inside to the outside at both edges, which are on the opposite side.
And this method of suturing is better than the common and easier suture, and is the method of suturing whose mention preceded it.
This is therefore Galen's speech as well.
And some have said.
The suture of the abdomen is made with two needles.
That is, you should introduce a single thread into both: and begin with the introduction of the needle from where it is with you, and make it penetrate until the other side, according to the suture of those who sew skin equally.
And know that when the disruption is in the middle of the abdomen: then the suture of such places is more difficult than the rest of the abdominal areas.
The judgment of wound medication, is the judgment of other wounds.
That is, when you treat a recent wound with its blood before the air alters it, and you reduce the intestine, and adjust it properly, then place it over powdered incensium.
If the air has already altered the wound, then place upon it certain ointments that are present with you until they produce pus. And let the threads fall out, and may they heal well and quickly.
Then treat it as the treatment of other wounds until it is healed.
If, however, the medicines are not present with you, then place upon it immediately as soon as it begins to discharge pus, old common ones: and change it twice a day, as I have instructed you, until it is healed.
If, however, you fear that the wound communicates with the principal members in the injury, then it is necessary to soak a soft cloth in temperate warm oil or in rose oil: and place it around the areas between the groin and under the armpits.
If he feels pain, or punctures, or putrefaction in his intestines (for this often happens), then use the enema with styptic wine, black and warm: particularly if the putrefaction has already come to the intestine and produced a penetrating discharge.
And know that which is from the large intestine is more easily cured, and that which is from the fine [intestine] is more difficult to cure.
The intestine called Jejunum does not receive cure from the wound that occurs in it at all: and this is because of its great number, which is from veins, and their magnitude, and because of the subtlety of its body, and the proximity of its nature to nerves.
If that which proceeds from the wound is zirbum, and you perceive it fresh: reduce it according to your reduction, by which you reduce the intestines equally.
If, however, time has passed and it has already become green or black: then you must tie it with a thread above the place that has been darkened from it, so that no blood flow occurs.
In zirbum, there are veins and arteries.
Then cut what is beyond that ligature, and place the two ends of the thread hanging from the lower part of the wound outside it: so that the draw on it is eased above you, and its extraction at the time of the zirbum and the discharge of pus from the wound are facilitated.
Remembrance of the wound that occurs in the Intestine.
When there is a disruption in the Intestine and it is small: then it is possible for it to be restored in some people: therefore, because I saw one who was wounded in his abdomen with a lance strike, and the wound was on the right side of the stomach, and the wound was old: and a Fistula was formed, and evacuation occurred from it.
Therefore I provided the treatment until I was not confident in its healing: nor did I cease to refine it until it was healed and the site was strengthened.
After I saw the site already strengthened, I feared for the patient, fearing that an adverse event might occur in his abdomen: and no adverse event occurred to him from that.
And he remained in better condition, eating and drinking, and copulating, and bathed, and exercised on his diet.
And some experienced practitioners have said that when a small wound occurs in the Intestine, then it should be tied off in this manner.
And you should take ants with large heads.
Then bring together the two edges of the wound, and place one ant with an open mouth over the two edges of the wound.
When therefore it clamps over the wound and closes its mouth, cut off its head, for it adheres and does not loosen.
Then place another ant near the first, and continue doing this with each ant after the next according to the size of the entire wound.
Then reduce it, and dress the wound.
For the head remains attached to the intestines until the intestine is nourished and heals, and no harm comes to the sick person. And it is now possible to tie the intestine even with a fine thread: which is taken from the intestine of an animal and attached to it after it is introduced into the needle.
And you must take the end of this thread from the intestine and it should be well stripped.
Then tie with a fine thread wrapped around the end of it.
Then introduce that thread into the needle, and use it with the intestine.
Then reduce it to the disruption. And this method of suturing with threads and intestine is possible only through the way of faith and hope.
Know that a wound which is large and wide, especially if it is in one of the slender intestines, then there is no skill other than excision, and it is not completely healed.
¶ Concerning the care of Zuchemen and Fistulas.
Chapter VIII.
Know that every wound or abscess when it grows old and becomes chronic, and does not heal and continuously discharges pus without resolving, is universally called a fistula, and we call it zuchemen.
And a fistula is indeed a filtered, hard, and white node: with it there is no pain, and it has the appearance of a bird's feather: because of this, some call it risata, that is, feather.
And it is wet at certain hours, which discharges pus.
And perhaps the humidity is split at certain hours.
And sometimes this humidity is great and little: and it is thick and thin.
And I have already stated in the division, then when I said wounds, that every ulcer which does not heal and from which no flesh is born, is such only on account of one of nine causes.
Of which one is, either on account of the scarcity of blood in the body: or on account of its malice: or because between it and the edges thereof is hard flesh, hindering the birth of flesh: or because it is full of filth and uncleanness: or because the ulcer itself is putrid, and the matter which is discharged from it is of bad quality: or because the medicine used in its treatment is inappropriate: or because corruption falling into that region is a species of pestilence, or by virtue of the nature of that region, as happens in Caesaraugusta: in which there is a difficult digestion of diseases and healing of abscesses is delayed by nature: or because therein is one opening, or the number of bones.
And I have already shown all these causes and signs of them, and the treatments with medicines in the division: and it is necessary for me to make you know the treatment for Fistula and Zucken, which is done through the way of manual operation.
Therefore, you should know that Fistula can occur in all parts of the body.
For from these, there are Fistulas that reach the great veins and arteries, or nerves, or sinews: or to the intestines, or to the bladder, or to some rib: or to some of the vertebrae of the back, or to some compounded joints: such as the hand and foot. And from these, there are those that go near the main limb and its similars.
Which of these fistulas, therefore, is according to this mode, is from ailments difficult of cure, and does not receive remedy, and occupation with it is labor and ignorance.
If it is from some fistula whose depth does not reach the places I have said: and you hope and confide in its cure, and wish to arrive at knowledge of it, then take a probe of wood or iron, if the fistula trends according to straightness, and seek it with itself.
If there is a tortuosity in the fistula, then investigate it with a probe of fine lead.
Since lead, when introduced gently into its substance, bends around the tortuosity.
If the fistula has many openings, it is not possible for you to indicate it with a probe.
Therefore, the clister must be applied at one of its openings.
For the moisture with which you administer the clister goes against other openings and flows from them.
Then inquire precisely according to the manner in which it is possible for you: so that you may know whether there is a bone or a nerve, and whether the concavity of the fistula is distant or near: or whether it is one fistula with many openings, and stand over the whole of it with your utmost strength: using your interrogation, by which you question the patient, and in finding pain upon compression with your hand on the place, and similar from significations and causes leading to the formation of an abscess.
When therefore you stand in that true station, then proceed to the cure with confidence: and then consider whether the fistula is near and apparent, or at a distant healthy place from the joint, or from the nerve, or artery, or vein, or one of the places I have said to you: then dry the fistula according to what has been previously stated in my narration, and remove what exists in it from filtration and decayed flesh, which arises at its opening from the flesh, or theflul, and similar substances: and care for it until it is cured.
If, however, the Fistula is of great depth and is straight: then it must be cut therein as deep as it is possible for you.
Then cleanse it from all the corrupted flesh.
Then apply an unsheathed lintel in acute medicines: and insert it until it reaches the concavity of the Fistula which you grasped with the iron. Do this repeatedly until the acute medicine corrodes all that remains in the concavity of the Fistula from corruption.
Then restore it with ointments that generate healthy flesh until it is healed.
If, however, it does not heal through this, then cauterize it as we have instructed.
If therefore the cause of the Fistula is an opening, and you are certain of this: then seek out that opening and cauterize it as I have instructed you; if nothing from a vein, or nerve, or principal limb, prohibits you, as we have said.
If therefore you discover an opening, and there is some corruption and blackness in it: then scrape it until all the corruption is removed.
Then treat it with what induces flesh growth until it heals.
If it does not heal and discharges pus as it was doing: then know that you have not reached the complete eradication of the corruption.
Therefore probe beyond that further and carefully explain it, and cleanse it with your utmost strength.
Then restore it.
If therefore it is cured, that is good; and if not, then know that that corruption is at a great depth within the body, which you have not reached.
Therefore you do not have the skill in that, unless to release the nature itself.
If the small mouth is corrupted, and it is possible for you to do so, draw it with fine tongs that fit it.
If there are many bones, then make the extraction of all of them with great care, and do not allow anything to remain among them by your force.
If something causes a contrary effect from the moisture, and there is no fear or error in the incision: then cut those moistures and tissues if they are there, and free the bones.
If, however, you do not have the preparation to extract the bones at your disposal, then place something over the wound that will cause its corruption: and remove it until the corruption in the tissues and moisture around those bones occurs.
And guard the wound so that it does not consolidate.
And secure the incision which you made during your operation.
Otherwise, place over it something that is immersed in burned sulfur with oil, or something immersed in Egyptian ointment, or some green ointment.
For when those moistures腐烂, and the bones are separated from them, the extraction of them and their removal is facilitated.
If, however, there is one large mouth, such as the thigh bone or hip bone, and what is corrupted from it is a major part, then shave it with the last degree of precision until that blackness and corruption are removed.
Then restore the wound.
If it is true that what is there is corrupted, this is a great part, and the corruption has already reached the marrow of the bone, then it is necessary to cut it out, and incise it entirely until the place where the corruption reaches: then care for it until it consolidates. And I will tell you what happened to a man in his thigh: that you may use this as an example and aid in your operation.
There was a young man in his thirties who experienced pain in his thigh, caused by something within the body, that is, from internal sources, until the matter reached the leg and developed into an abscess with a large boil: and there was no external cause for him.
Therefore, time was extended with him until the abscess was incised, and many materials converged upon it.
And the care of him was postponed until the leg became a fistula, and many openings were formed in it: all of which emitted pus and bodily humors.
Therefore, a multitude of physicians cared for him for about two years, and there was no skill in the art of their hands until I was called, and I saw his leg, and the materials which were flowing from those openings in great quantity: even his entire body was now diseased, and his color was yellowish.
I therefore introduced a probe into one of the openings, and the probe reached the cavity.
Then I examined all the openings: and I found them communicating with each other from all parts of the leg. Therefore I incised and cut through one of the orifices until I detected a part of the bone: and I found it corrupted: which was now burned, blackened, decayed, and perforated until it had penetrated to the marrow.
Therefore I incised what was detected to me, and prepared from the corrupted bone.
And I removed what was not in the bone except that corruption, which I cut and incised.
And I had already eradicated it.
Then I applied the restoration of the wound with consolidative medicines over a long space.
And it was not consolidated.
Then I attempted the restoration of it.
And it was not restored.
Then I restored it with medicines, and it was quickly consolidated and healed. And this repetition was not necessary in its operation and sectioning, except on account of the patient's weakened condition, his small tolerance, and my fear for him concerning death: for it happened to him at all times from the excess of evacuations causing malignant fainting.
Therefore, the healing is complete: and in the place of the bone there has grown hard flesh, and a good arrangement has been made in his body, and his strength has been restored: and he has returned to his normal condition: and he did not suffer any harm in his walking.
If the bone protrudes in a place where the body is already fractured, then it is necessary to reduce it according to this method: and it is: take the ligament and tighten it at the extremity of the protruding bone: and command someone to extend it upwards: and place another ligament, thicker than the first, from wool. Then ligate it over the flesh which is beneath the bone: and extend its extremity, so that you may draw the flesh downwards: and thus you have secured the flesh over the place you wish to reduce, so that the instrument does not injure the flesh.
Place a stick or a board under the lower bone correctly: for when you do this, it does not prevent the instrument from cutting through rotten flesh.
And it should be that the instrument is placed slightly over the rotten area, so that there is no depression in the bone, and does not appear to the touch, forcing another part to bear the weight. If the bone is rotten and does not protrude, then join its part with another part: and the rot is in the middle of it or in part of it: then remove the flesh from all its parts completely.
Then place a stick below.
Then reduce it from the first part where there is rot, until the instrument on the other side continues to hold it: and place the instrument slightly along its length from the point of rot, as we have said.
If the corruption is in the joint, cut the corrupted joint itself, and file the opening where continuity continues from the other side.
If corruption is indeed in the continuity of two joints, then there is no skill except for cauterization.
If the corruption is in the tendon of the hand, or in the tendon of the foot: then the matter is very difficult.
You must inquire how the corruption appears to you.
And cauterize it, and cleanse it according to whatever disposition you find possible, and let it be corrected by whatever skill you have: when it does not oppose you with a Vein or Nerve.
And know that there are many incisors and files suitable for cutting these bones, according to the position of the bones, their preparation, their thickness, their fineness, their size, their thinness, their hardness, and their rarity.
Therefore, you must prepare an instrument suitable for every species of operation.
And know that these operations indicate to you the species of instrument you need when you have long study and preparation.
And the knowledge of the methods of this art is a testimony to the degrees of illness: for then you will find by yourself what is suitable from the instruments for every illness.

The form of the razor is suitable to the reason thereof that it is perforated from the bones.
The extremity is triangular, and its ends are sharp.
It is made from India.
And similarly, it is necessary that all which we have said be made from razors, incisors, and saws.
On the incision of extremities and the osteotomy.
Chapter VIIIIX.
Extremities putrefy either from an external cause or an internal cause.
When therefore you have treated that corruption with medical remedies and the cure does not take effect, and you see the corruption extending to the limb where nothing checks its progress, then it is necessary to cut that limb away until where the corruption reaches, so that the patient may escape death or a malady greater than the defect of the limb.
And the sign that this happens is when the limb darkens until it is thought to be putrid; when fire burns it or it putrifies after discoloration; when that corruption is cut away until what follows the limb, and it spreads throughout the entire body.
Therefore, when making the incision of that limb, and similarly if the cause of the corruption is from the strike of some venomous creatures: such as the marine scorpion, viper, or rattlesnake, and similar ones.
If therefore decay or injury is in the extremity of the finger, then cut off the finger, and do not leave space for the decay, so that it may advance to the rest of the hand.
And similarly if it happens in the hand, then cut it off from the root of the finger, and do not leave space for the decay, until it reaches the brachial artery.
And if it invades there, then cut off the arm at the elbow joint. If the decay passes through and you see it about the elbow: then death is near the patient.
And administering beyond that in treatment is the quantity of virtue.
And similarly do for the foot, when decay invades the finger, then cut it off at one of the joints: and if it reaches the ankle of the foot, then cut off the entire foot.
If it has ascended to the knee, then cut off the leg at the knee joint.
If the decay has already reached above the knee, then there is no remedy for it except to dismiss it and leave the patient to die.
And the proper way to cut the limb or saw through it is to bind the ligament below the part you wish to cut: and bind another ligament above the site.
And let the attendant extend one ligament below: and let him extend another ligament above.
And you separate the flesh that is between the two ligaments using a wide spatula, until all the flesh is exposed.
Then it should be cut or ligated.
And you should place linen cloth from all sides, and the serrated edge should not touch the healthy spot: and it happens that an additional infected wound arises.
If, however, there is an internal flow of blood while operating, then cauterize the place quickly: or place some blood-absorbing powders over it.
Then return to your treatment until it is completed.
Then ligate the wounded limb with an appropriate ligature, and care for it until it is healed.
And I tell you what happens to a man in his foot, this being the same as what I tell you.
Which is because a blackening occurs in his foot due to a burning similar to fire combustion. And that corruption first affects his toe until it began to involve the entire foot.
Therefore, the man treated himself after he saw the corruption set in with his impairment, which he found from the pain and burning he experienced: and it affected him at the joint, and he was healed.
And after a long time had passed, the same corruption occurred in his index finger. Therefore, he came to me, and I attempted to cure the discharge with what I applied to his hand after cleansing his body: but the discharge did not subside, and it began to affect another finger: until the corruption set in his entire hand.
He therefore called upon me to cut his hand: and I refused, hoping for a reflection of that surplus over the incision: and I feared even death beside him at the cutting of his hand.
Because the man's strength was above his fall.
Therefore, after he had given up on me, he returned to his own land: and he came back to me because he was in a hurry, and cut off his whole hand: and he was healed.
And I have not related this narrative except as an aid to that which falls under the category of this illness: and as a signification by which it may be indicated, and according to which action should be taken.
¶ Concerning the care of Sinuses, and the quality of clistherization with medicines.
Head XC.
When an abscess occurs in certain fleshy members and the space of the abscess is prolonged until a collection of sanious material is formed: then it breaks or is punctured, and what is within it flows out through the sanious discharge, leaving behind a vacuous place like a vessel: and the skin above it is as a thin cloth: and it does not reach its ultimate corruption, nor does it impress itself on the bone, nor in the nerve, nor in the ligament: it deserves to be named a Sinus: and it is not called a Fistula: yet if the space of it is prolonged until corruption impresses itself upon one of these members, then it is called a Fistula or zuken.
And the care of it is to cut that skin entirely away as it is turned back: and especially when it is thin like a cloth: and you are confident that it does not adhere to the place because of its corruption.
If you hope that it will adhere to the skin, and no such ultimate corruption follows from it: and if there is thickness in the skin from flesh, then treat it with a clister, and see to it for the sake of the Sinus.
If it is large, and the pus that is emitted from it has a foul odor, then prepare the clister with Egyptian medicine, which consists of vinegar, oil, and zingiber, taking equal parts, mix them in a vessel, and boil them over fire until the medicine turns red: and let it become thick like honey.
Then take what you need from it: and dissolve it with water and honey, and use it to treat the Sinus with a clister. Tighten its opening, and let the medicine remain therein for two hours.
Then extract it with expression: do this for several days until the Sinus is cleansed and the odor is removed.
And when clistered with ash water, if this medicine is not at hand: take the ashes of vine branches, or ashes from oak wood, and pour water over them.
Then keep it there and clister with it until you are confident that the Sinus has been thoroughly cleansed.
If the patient cannot tolerate the Egyptian medicine or ash water, then use it with water and honey, to which some zingiber powder has already been added.
Or clister with it mixed with honey and wine, for honey has the property of cleansing and washing: and wine makes it adhere to the Sinus, especially when there is an excess of astringency and dryness in the wine.
When you do this several times, and you are confident that the sinus corruption is now removed: then the enema itself with what it makes to be born flesh in it.
And take from the paste dyafinicon: and dissolve it with rose oil, and astringent wine: or the enema itself with certain medicines and other ointments, of which properties I have written in the treatise on ointments.
And if the sinus orifice is strict, into which the enema cannula does not fit: then widen it slightly with a knife: or place therein a lintel wrap immersed in Egyptian ointment or basilicon ointment until it is widened.
And similarly, if the orifice is even wide, then suture its edges together: and leave in it a quantity into which the enema can enter without additional insertion.
And similarly, if the orifice from which pus flows is elevated higher up: then dry it out in a lower spot that is within it, so that the pus may flow down from there: for when pus is constricted in the depth of the sinus, it prevents flesh from being generated therein.
And if it is not possible for you to dry the sinus lower down as you wish: then try to prepare the member with a preparation that will allow the pus to flow from there easily according to how it is prepared for you.
Try to prevent anything from being retained there entirely from the pus: and take consolidating medicines that are placed over the mark, suitable for what you wish.
And apply them to a linen cloth.
And let the cloth be of such quantity that communication of the entire sinus may be made.
Then cut with forceps directly into the sinus orifice to make a孔隙，稍微扩大 sinus 或ifice.
Then extend another cloth with gentle ointment over the first, according to the size of the aperture: and place it far from the sinus orifice, so that the discharge may be alleviated from there: and do not remove the large cloth unless after some days singly.
That which is over the sinus orifice, you will remove at every hour, so that what accumulates there from pus may exit: and by this you will know whether what flows from it is much or little, whether digested or undigested.
And consider again the place of the sinus itself, whether the lord feels pain therein, or there is no pain therein, and whether there is an abscess, or there is no abscess.
When therefore your treatment is thus extended, and you see the material that exits over the sinus orifice, then know that the sinus now adheres, or approaches adherence: therefore dissolve it in the morning, or on the third day. And when you dissolve the wound, then replace another cloth, and renew the ointment. If however a subtle poison exits from the sinus after a long interval, then do not despair of its adherence, for its healing is approaching, for there are people who delay the growth of flesh in their wounds, and there are those who act contrary to this.
If however pus undigested exits from the sinus after many days, then know that the sinus does not adhere.
If therefore the adhesion of the Sinus is delayed and its course prolonged, then for the drying of medicines, but let the doctors do it so that they are medicines in their substance moist and in their virtue dry: as ointment diafinicon, when added to it excess is added from zegi.
And from the very last stage of its cure, it is that you take the ointment diafinicon and dissolve it with rose oil, and let it be spread over old wine equal in its substance.
Then prepare it with it, and use it.
And now it does the same as this action when you do not have diafinicon ointment at hand, honey, when you cook it until it thickens, and use it.
Or take myrrh, and aloes, and frankincense: rub them all together, and powder it over honey while it is on fire.
Then spread it over the cloth, and bind it over the sinus: and with the honey you have cooked until it thickened, powder the preparation, and place it over the cloth, and bind it.
And sometimes aristolochia longa, and roots of celestial lily, and lily: and herb flour, and centaury, are administered in that.
Use them in their simple form or combined, rub them, and sieve them: and powder them over the honey as I have described, and use it.
If therefore the course of the Sinus is prolonged and it is not cured by this treatment: then know that there is corruption deep within it. Or it has already made an impression in the bones, or in the other hard parts, or in the ligaments: then cure it with the treatment for fistulas, according to what was previously stated. On the care of a carbuncle and a worn nail, and the incision of an added finger, and its division.
Chapter XCII.
A carbuncle is an abscess that arises under the nail of the thumb of the hand or the foot, and perhaps it may arise in other fingers.
When therefore it is prolonged and neglected and becomes abscessed with a warm abscess: or it decays and emits pus until it eats into the root of the nail: and perhaps it corrupts the whole nail, and perhaps corruption reaches the bone until there is an offensive odor: and the end of the finger becomes wide, and its color becomes dark.
When therefore you treat it, as we said in the division, and your treatment does not converge on it: then you must incise with a knife all the excess that remains from the nail.
Then cauterize the wound after that.
For the cautery is very useful.
If however the bone is sound, and the nail is also sound, and the additions of the nail have already compressed the flesh inward and are beginning to sting it and hurt it: then you must place a fine radium under an angle of the nail that stings the flesh, and drive it upward. And cut the flesh with facility, and place over what remains of the flesh from the burning medicines, corroding ones, until all of it is removed.
Then treat it with ointments until it heals.
If corruption has already begun in the mouth, then you must cut that mouth and remove it; for it is never cured while腐败已经蔓延到口腔中，那么必须切割该部位并移除它；否则在口腔中有腐败存在的情况下，它永远无法治愈。
If you see corruption and decay advancing to the finger, then cut it off at one joint, according to what has been previously mentioned.
Then care for it until it is cured.
If there happens to be nail wear or injury, and severe pain occurs, then it is necessary to bleed the patient first.
Then dry the nail with a sharp transverse slice of Spatula.
And beware that the incision does not reach the flesh which is beneath the nail, for you will cause severe pain to the patient, and this will be a cause for additional flesh to grow in that place.
Then care for the area with what alleviates pain.
A finger added that grows in some people's hands may be wholly fleshy: and in some of them, there may be bones, and a nail may be present: in some cases, it grows at the root of the joint, or its growth is in certain joints of the finger.
That which grows at the joints of the finger does not move, and that which grows near the joint of the finger may move.
Therefore, the one that is fleshy among them is easy to cut.
That is, to cut it there at its root with Spatumi lato.
Its origin being at the root of the joint is difficult to cure.
Therefore, avoid cutting it.
In that which is born at the end of the digit near the last nodes, then you must cut the flesh thereof with a round incision through to the bone.
Then cut the bone with one of those saws fitting to that.
Then care for it until it is healed.
Consolidation which occurs between the digits is often due either to the man's nature, that is, it is born with him, or from the healing of a wound, or from burning by fire, and similar causes.
Therefore, you must cut away that consolidation until the digits return to their natural form.
Then place between them licinia or wet cloths in rose oil: so that they do not consolidate quickly, and separate them. Alternatively, place between them a thin lead lamina until the area consolidates as required.
And similarly, if consolidation occurs between some digits and the palm, then dry that consolidation, as it is prepared and fits the shape of the limb.
¶ Incision for Vitiæ.
Head XCII.
Vitiæ are Veins involuted, thick, full of excess melancholic matter which affect many parts of the body: and they chiefly issue from the legs, especially from the legs of those who walk much, work, or carry things.
Therefore, you should administer the extraction of the body from black bile several times with a strong extraction.
Then phlebotomize the patient and give him basilic.
Cure of these with iron is according to two modes.
Their vein is to be punctured, and black blood is to be extracted.
And another mode is to elevate the vein and extract all of it.
The section of it is according to this mode.
Apply embrocation to the thigh first with hot water much until the thick and foul blood is resolved.
Then bind the thigh of the sick person from the upper part of the hip, down to the lower part of the knee with a band.
Then dry the vein in one, or two, or three places with a wide cut.
Then dry the nail with something downward until an amount of blood sufficient and tolerable by the patient's strength emerges.
Then ligate it: and order him to abstain from foods generating black bile. And repeat the evacuation and phlebotomy when the veins are full, and this will harm the sick person.
The elevation of it is according to this manner.
Radify the weak thigh, if there are many hairs in it.
Then insert it into the bath: or immerse the thigh in embrocation with hot water until it becomes ruddy and the veins swell: or it may be exercised vigorously if a bath is not available until the limb warms up.
Then dry the skin along the length of the vein incision: or at its end near the knee, or at the lower part near the heel.
Then open the skin with forceps and scrape the vein from all sides until it becomes apparent to the touch: and at its appearance, you will see it turn ruddy toward black.
When it therefore exits the skin, you will see it white as if it were a string.
Then insert the Radium under it, until when it is elevated and exits the skin: suspend it with a blind forceps gently.
Then dry the other incision near that incision with three fingers.
Then scrape the skin from the upper part of the vein until it becomes apparent.
Then elevate it with the Radium as you did before, and suspend it with another forceps as you did at first.
Then dry the other incision, or more incisions if needed for that case.
Then elevate it, and cut the last incision near the heel.
Then extract it to the section which is above it.
And do that until you extract it from the section which is above, or all higher sections, until it emerges entirely; then cut it.
If it does not yield to you in extraction and elevation, then introduce a needle with a strong double thread, ligate it, and extract it. Or introduce a radium beneath it, and turn your hand in all directions until it emerges.
And be careful, lest you cut through it.
For if it is cut through, it will be difficult for you to elevate it greatly, and it will enter the weak part causing harm.
When therefore you have extracted it entirely, then place over the wound a piece of wool soaked in wine and rose oil, or oil, and care for it until it is healed.
If the vine (vein) is contracted, having a twisting nature with winding and involuted parts, and it is not as we said according to its straightness, then you must find over it through all parts of its twisting nature and the places of its winding.
Then suspend it with forceps until you elevate it entirely. And be careful at the section above it not to cut the vein or make a wound, for it will be difficult for you to elevate or extract it.
Therefore, preserve your prudence.
Forma Incidentis quo sanatur Vitis.
Forma Vncini caeci.
It does not have the sharpness of the Vincis, nor is it pointed at the extremity so as not to wound the vein: and it is of great flexibility, soft: for if it were fine, it would cut the vein with its subtlety: rather its excessive thickness, as we said.
On the Extraction of the Crural Vein. Chapter XCIII.
This vein is generated in the legs in warm lands, such as Alizegi, and the land of the Arabs, and in dry, warm, tender lands, that is, in which no grass nor tree is born.
And perhaps it is generated in other parts of the body besides the legs.
And its generation is from putrefaction that occurs beneath the skin, just as snakes and ascaris worms arise within the body, and worms generated between the skin and flesh.
And the sign of the onset of the outcome of this vein is inflammation in the leg that occurs suddenly.
Then the area blisters.
Then the vein begins to emerge from that blistered area, as if it were the root of a plant or an animal.
When therefore the extremity of the vein becomes apparent, then it is necessary to wrap a fragment of lead, whose weight is from one to two drachms, around it and mark the vein: and let the lead hang from the leg.
Whenever therefore something emerges from it to the exterior, wrap that in lead and mark it.
If it is prolonged much, then cut the part thereof, and wrap the remainder.
And do not cut it to the root until it wholly emerges.
For if you cut it, it contracts and enters the flesh: and it causes an abscess, corruption, and a bad ulcer to occur.
Therefore, it must be handled gently and extracted gradually until it emerges from its last part, and nothing of it remains in the body: and in some persons this vein emerges, which is five palms and ten [fingers] in length.
And it has now reached me, because it emerged from the man at twenty palms.
If it happens to you in the hour of your medication: then introduce a probe into its opening, and puncture it with a long hole, together with the body, until all that is in it from the matter is evacuated: and administer corruption of the place with medicinal treatments for a few days. Then treat it with the cure for abscesses.
And this vein sometimes has many branches, particularly when it appears at the ankle joint or on the foot itself: and it encounters many openings, and a branch emerges from every opening.
Therefore, treat it as we have said in the division, and along with what was previously mentioned.
¶ Concerning the section on worms generated under the skin, and it is called Bovine Illness.
Head XCIV.
This Illness is named in certain lands among us as the Bull Illness: for this reason, because it often happens to bulls, and is a small worm that is born between the skin and flesh.
And it goes throughout the entire body, ascending and descending: and it is perceived by touch through its movement from member to member, until it ruptures somewhere on the skin and exits.
And its generation is from the corruption of certain humors.
Just as worms and snakes, that is, earthworms and ascarids, occur in the belly.
And it is feared because of its malice.
Because when it goes throughout the body and rises to the head and reaches a place, then perhaps it opens there, exits, and destroys the eye: and this happens often.
When therefore you wish to cure it and extract it, then this can be done only through its movement and the perception of it by touch.
Therefore, you must tie what is above it and what is below it with a strong constriction.
Then dry it above, and extract it.
If it is deep in the flesh and you do not find it, then place a cautery with fire over the spot until it dies.
And greater than what is feared is its corruption, which corrupts the eye, as we have said. If you see it has already reached the head near the eye, then tighten above it a good indentation.
Then dry it over and extract it.
And the patient should use the purification of his body with medicines that dissolve putrid and bad fluids.
And let him beware of foods that cause putrefaction.
¶ On the Incision for the Disease Nakir.
Chapter XC.
This disease is called Nakir in our land: it is a pain that occurs in certain limbs and then shifts from limb to limb.
And I have indeed seen it myself, as I am narrating to you.
I was called to a sick woman in some fields.
And she showed me her arm, and I saw a small swelling in the vein of the brachium.
And after I remained there for one hour, I saw a swelling move with rapidity, as a worm moves, ascending to her shoulder faster than can be seen: it is like live silver when it runs from place to place.
Therefore, the pain receded from that place and fixed itself in her shoulder.
Then I sat for one hour, and it ran through the rest of her body until it reached another arm.
Then she told me that it was moving throughout her entire body, as I had seen.
Therefore I have wondered about the speed of its permutation from member to member.
And indeed before that, I had not seen this illness so strangely according to this manner.
Indeed, I have seen many who find the pain permute from member to member: and I did not see it with my eyes as I saw it in a woman.
And I do not consider it to be so, unless it is because the woman was among those who are from the dry-bodied group with veins detected in the fields: hence this airiness is perceived as permuted.
And it is necessary that they do not appear according to this reason in those who are delicate and whose bodies are moist, for the veins are hidden.
Therefore, when you wish to cure it, and the patient feels that pain: then if it is visible to your eye, as we said, then bind above it and below it quickly. Dry above it until the constricted airiness exits, and cauterize the place.
If, however, you do not see it with your eyes: then treat it with the expulsion of the body, and with what expels airiness, and plug them with foul pills, and pills of serpentarum, and similar substances.
¶ On the Extraction of Arrows.
Head XCVI. Arrows vary according to their species and according to the places where they fall from the body.
The diversity of them is this: for some have large and small points, and others are concave and deaf.
And from them are those that have three angles.
And among them are those that have tongues.
And among them are those that have teeth.
Those that are according to members in which they fall, is according to two modes.
For the members are from the principal parts concave, such as the brain, and the heart, and the liver, and the lung, and the kidneys, and the intestines, and the bladder, and similar ones.
When therefore it falls into any of these members, and you see the signs of death, which I narrate to you afterward, then it is necessary to perform a timely extraction from them, for death follows him in whom it is, in many dispositions.
And when these evil signs do not appear to you, and the arrow is not hidden in the depth of the member, then extract it, and take care of the wound.
For when the arrow falls into the brain and penetrates the nose and emerges through the nasal aperture which is above the brain, it is: for from that place violent nausea, blindness, dizziness, redness in the eyes, swelling, redness of the tongue, spasms, confusion of thought, and vomiting of cholera occur.
And perhaps blood comes out from the nose or ears.
And perhaps speech is cut off, and the voice is destroyed.
And the white moisture emerges from the place of the wound similar to pus.
And it exits there similar to the moisture of flesh.
If therefore you see these signs, then abstain from treatment, and extract the arrow if it does not emerge.
The signs of the arrow when it falls into the heart are: that it is near the left breast, and one feels as if it is fixed in a hard substance with it, not in a void.
And perhaps the movement of the arrow is similar to the pulse: and black blood flows from the wound.
And follows that coldness of the extremities, and cold sweat, and syncope.
Therefore, you should know that death descends without doubt.
And the sign of the arrow when it wounds the lung is the emergence of foamy blood from the wound: and the vessels which follow the neck become inflamed, and the color of the patient changes.
And he exhales a great, deep breath: and seeks the attraction of cold air.
And if the arrow falls into the velayment, which is in the chest: then it is near the small ribs: and a great panting occurs with a severe pain, with a sigh: and all the arm muscles move.
And if the arrow falls into the stomach, then perhaps something undigested from food emerges from the wound.
And if the arrow falls into the abdomen and is fixed there: something of feces emerges from the wound, or that which is intestinal and already ruptured.
Therefore, there is no hope in curing him, nor in extracting the arrow.
If the arrow falls into the Bladder and exits through urine, and something proceeds from it to the exterior, causing greater pain to the patient: then know that it is fatal.
The other limbs, such as the face, neck, throat, palate, assistance muscles, spine, ribs, thigh, leg, and similar parts, are treated according to various methods when the arrow does not hit an artery or nerve, and the arrow is not poisonous.
And I inform you of what I have seen about these arrows, so that you may understand this for your own treatment.
Because an arrow fell into the lacrimal apparatus of one man and into the root of his nose.
Therefore, I extracted it from him, on the opposite side, beneath the fat behind his ear: and he was cured, and no harm came to his eye.
And I extracted another arrow from a Jew, which fell into the fat behind his eye under the lower eyelid: and the arrow was already hidden, and I could only grasp its small extremity, with which it adhered to its wooden part: and the arrow was large among the arrows of the Turkish bows, with soft iron, in which there are no ears.
Therefore, the Jew was cured, and no harm came to his eye. And I extracted an arrow from the throat of a Christian.
And it was the Arabic arrow, and it is of those that have wings.
Therefore I followed the arrow between the two guidegines, and it was already submerged in his throat.
I extracted it carefully, until I removed it: and the Christian was cured.
And I extracted another arrow from the man which had fallen into his belly: and we thought that he would die from it.
After thirty days had passed from him, and nothing had changed in his condition, I followed the arrow: and I carefully extracted it, and he was cured, and no ill happened to him.
And I saw a man from whom an arrow had fallen on his back, and the wound had healed over it.
After seven years had passed, an arrow emerged at the root of his thigh.
And I saw a woman from whom an arrow had fallen into her belly, and the wound had healed over it, and the arrow remained within: and nothing had changed in her condition, and the woman found no harm in any of her natural operations.
And I saw another man, from whom an arrow had fallen on his face: and the wound had healed, and it remained, not causing him much pain: and similar cases to these many.
And I extracted an arrow from one of the king's men, which had fallen into his nose, and was now slightly tilting towards the right side: and the entire arrow was hidden.
I was therefore called upon to treat him after the arrow incident until three days.
I found therefore the wound of the arrow to be very deep.
I therefore examined it with a fine probe, and did not sense it: and indeed he found a puncture and pain on the right side of his ear.
I hoped that it was that puncture from the tip of the arrow.
I applied a plaster to the area with a plaster that had the properties of attracting and dissolving, and I trusted that the place would suppure and show me a sign of the arrow, so that I could cut above it: and no accident occurred in the place that would indicate that the arrow had reached the location.
I applied plaster to him frequently over many days: and no accident occurred, and the wound healed in the meantime: and he remained ill for a space of days after its removal until he felt the arrow within his nose on a certain day.
And he told me that.
I therefore applied a sharp and corrosive medicine to the wound for many days until it opened up: and when I probed it, I felt the fine tip of the arrow adhering to the wood.
I then added the sharp medicine to the open wound until we could clearly see the tip of the arrow: and it took me that time about four months.
I then, after the wound had enlarged and it became possible for me to introduce forceps into it and move them, and they did not obey my effort: then I continued to probe and devise methods for it until one day with well-made forceps, as the form of those will be described at the end of this chapter, I was able to extract it.
Then I restored the wound.
And the physicians indeed judge that the cartilage of the nose is not restored.
Therefore I restored it, and the wound was consolidated, and the patient was restored to complete health: nor did anything at all harm him.
And I tell you the quality of the extraction of certain arrows: so that you may place that rule and meaning above what I did not say.
Since the parts of this art and their distinctions are not included in the narration: nor does the book encompass it, and a skilled craftsman compares it with a little more and a little less: and with that which is present, he compares it with what is absent: and he finds a new operation, and a new instrument at the descent of matters foreign to this art when they occur.
I say that arrows do not exit from the limbs on which they are fixed, except according to two modes. Or through attraction from the place whence it entered.
Or through the opposite part of the other.
And that which exits from where it entered, or is an arrow proceeding into a fleshy place and is attracted and exits.
And if it does not conform to exiting at the time it falls, then it is necessary to let it go for a few days until the flesh around it putrifies. The attraction of it should be alleviated, and its exit facilitated.
And similarly, if it is embedded in bone and does not conform to your desire for its exit, then let it go for a few days. Repeat the process with attraction and motion every day until it exits.
If it does not yield to you for the outcome after days, then you must perforate through the groove of the arrow at the bone from every part with a sharp drill until the arrows enlarge.
Then draw it out, and extract it.
If the arrow is fixed in the skull bone, and has already penetrated into one ventricle of the brain, and certain of the symptoms I said appear: then refrain from drawing out the arrow, and leave it until it comes to an equal state after days.
For if the arrow reaches the brain, then death is not prolonged for him.
And if the arrow is not fixed, unless only in the bone of the body and does not penetrate all the way to the brain: and the patient remains ill for a few days, and nothing of those symptoms occurs to him: then proceed with drawing out the arrow and its extraction.
If it is fixed deeply, and does not yield to you for drawing out: then apply drills around the arrow, as I have described: then care for the wound until it heals.
If the arrow has already been hidden in the body and is concealed from sense: then seek it out by probing.
If you feel it, then draw it out with instruments that are suitable for its extraction.
If you cannot draw it out due to the constriction of the wound and the length of the arrow deep within: and there is neither bone nor nerve nor vein there: then incise over it until the wound enlarges, making it possible to extract the arrow.
If he has ears that can be held, then free the fixed flesh around them from every part, by all means thou canst, and means, if it cannot escape through the flesh by breaking of the ears or twisting them until it escapes.
And when thou administerest the extraction of the Arrow, in whatever place it is, then use the twisting of thy hand, with forceps to all parts, until thou makest it escape: and with extreme subtlety, that the Arrow be not broken, and may become difficult for thee to draw it and its extraction.
If thou canst not do it in one hour, then let it alone for a few days until what is about it putrefies.
Then repeat it: for it will be relieved by the operation. But if it resists thee with a counteraction of the flow of blood, then administer as we said in the chapter on cure and guard thy strength from incising the vein, or nerve, or chord.
And administer the operation by every means thou canst for the escape of the Arrow: and let it be with facility, and tranquility, or tardiness, and firmness, as I have told thee.
And thou must do it when thou drawest the Arrow so that the patient is in the same condition as he was at the time of the Arrow's penetration.
For it is more beneficial.
If it is not possible for thee to do that, then administer what is possible for thee from the figures.
For the Arrow which issues from the opposite side or is proceeding to the exterior: or causes a hump at the end of the Arrow through a sensation from the skin near the upper part, and thou seest it protruding: cut above it, and let the cut be according to the quantity that the forceps can grasp in it.
Then draw it: for itself it becomes easy to extract.
If it is indeed retained in the bone, then twist your hand according to the roundness until the arrow presses into the bone and penetrates itself further: then draw it.
And if not: let it alone for a few days, then repeat the procedure until it comes out.
If the arrow's shaft is in it, then push it along with it.
If the shaft has fallen off, and you need to apply a push: then insert a concave instrument into it, so that its concavity enters the arrowhead: then push it along with it.
If the arrow is concave, then push it with an instrument entering into it.
The arrow is propelled by that.
If the arrow is poisoned, then it is necessary to incise all the flesh in which the poison is: if that is possible for you.
Then treat it according to what is suitable for that.
If the arrow is embedded in the chest, or in the belly, or in the bladder, or in the side: and it is close enough for you to feel it upon probing and it is possible for you to cut above it: then cut it out, and be careful not to incise a vein or nerve, and extract it.
Then dress the wound if you see it, and treat it until it is healed.
And this is the form of Forceps, with which arrows are extracted.
Let the ends be similar to the beak of a bird, which are made like iron: when they grasp over the arrow, they do not let go of it.
And many kinds, both large and small, are made from them, according to the size of the arrow, its thickness, and the width and contraction of the wound.
The form of the Impeller concave.
And the form of the Impeller blunt.
This is the blunt end like a radius, so that its entry into the concave arrow may be facilitated, and it may be pushed along with it.
The end of the impeller concave is concave like a bird's feather: so that the entry of the arrow into it may be facilitated and its impulse.
¶ Concerning the Phlebotomy of Veins.
Head XCVII. Veins to be phlebotomized, for which the custom is commonly practiced, are thirty.
Of which sixteen are in the head: two pulsating veins, which are behind the ears and called the Two Herbs; and two arteries, which appear in the two temples; and two veins which are in the two lacrimal glands of the eyes, called the Aspicientes; and the Vena Praeparata in the middle of the forehead; and the vein which is at the tip of the nose.
And two glands of Guidegy, which are in the neck.
And two veins which are in the upper lip of the mouth.
And two veins which are in the lower lip.
And these are the veins called Algecherich.
And two veins which are under the tongue.
The veins which are phlebotomized in the arms are five veins in every arm.
One of them is Cephalica, and it is from the side of the wild olive tree: and the common people name it the vein of the head.
And Fusca.
And it is the Median vein, and it is composed of the branch of Basilica and the branch of Cephalica: and the common people name it the body vein.
And Basilica, and it is placed on the domestic side: and it is also called Titillicaris.
And the common people name it the vein of the belly.
And Funis brachii, and it is placed above the foelix: and it is that vein in which phlebotomy is performed, and it is that which appears above the thumb with a clear examination.
And Salvatoria: and it is the vein which is between the ring finger and the little finger: and it has two branches.
And in the thigh and in the foot there are three veins.
One of them is which is under the curvature of the thumb from the side of sylvester.
And the second is Saphena: and its place is at the heel from the side of domestic.
And the first is Nesse: and its place is at the heel from the side of sylvester.
And in the thigh there are three veins similar to them.
¶ Concerning the phlebotomy of two veins behind the ears.
Phlebotomy of the two veins which are behind the ears is beneficial for ancient catarrhs, hemigraine, sahafati, and old malignant ulcers of the head.
And the quality of phlebotomy for them is as I narrate.
And it is done by shaving the head of the sick person: and the back of his neck is rubbed at the place of the two veins with a rough cloth for good friction.
Then the sick person should tie his neck with a bandage until the two veins become visible.
And the places of these veins are behind the ears in two depressed areas of the head.
Seek out these veins with your finger, and where you feel the pulse of these veins under your finger, mark those places with cautery.
Then take the phlebotomy knife, which is called Incidens.
Then insert it under the vein in the skin until the phlebotomy reaches the vein opening.
Then raise your hand with the vein and skin to the upper part, and cut the vein with the skin by a cutting incision.
And the length of the incision shall be the width of two joined fingers, or about that: and let blood flow out as much as you wish.
Then ligate it with sutures and remove it until it is healed.
And the cutting and cauterization of them have already been treated at the beginning of the book.
¶ Concerning phlebotomy of two arteries at the temples.
Of the two arteries that are at the temples, phlebotomy is beneficial for ancient headache, malignant headache, and continuous eye disease: and for the course of excessive flowing sharp fluid to the eyes. And the quality of phlebotomy for these is as I am about to tell you.
The sick person should tighten his neck much until two veins become clearly apparent to the touch, and their pulse should be demonstrated by your finger.
Then apply the cautery with hot oil.
Then raise the skin above the vein to the upper part with your index finger, and insert the phlebotomy instrument entering from below, and raise the vein to the upper part.
And cut it, as you did with the other two veins: and let blood flow out in the amount necessary to you. Then release the compression on the sick person, and place your finger on the vein for one hour.
After place over the abscess and poultices, and bind it tightly from above with constriction: and release it until it is healed.
And now the recall of those has come, and their incision, and their extraction at the beginning of the book.
¶ Concerning the phlebotomy of the frontal vein after cephalic phlebotomy.
The ligature of the phlebotomy of the frontal vein is to be performed after cephalic phlebotomy for ancient diseases of the face: and for hemigraine, and for liver spots: and for foul ulcers.
And the quality of this phlebotomy is as I shall tell you.
The sick person should draw his neck with the fingers, until the vein becomes apparent.
Then take the instrument called Fossorium.
Of which this is the form.
Place a prominent point at the head of the Fossorium over the vein, and strike above it with a plectrum or some other object in the same manner, and release the blood to flow according to the quantity you wish.
Then release the puncture and bind it tightly until it is healed.
And sometimes it is opened with a broad phlebotomy.
Indeed, it should not be a sharp-extremity phlebotomy, as are the other phlebotomies, but rather a broad-extremity one.
And perform phlebotomy on it according to inclination, for the vein is nearby: and perhaps the phlebotomus will break when it is thin.
Of Phlebotomy of the Veins in the Two Lacrimal Glands.
The ligament of the two veins that are in the two lacrimal glands is for the eye from scabies and rubescence: and it swells in the eye, and facial ailments.
And the quality of phlebotomy for this is that the sick person tightens his neck with a woody rod.
Then perform phlebotomy on them: and you stand over his head.
And perform the phlebotomy according to inclination at a slight length, using a small, slightly broad phlebotomus, for there is no flesh in that place.
For if the phlebotomus is thin at the tip, it may break.
Then let there be flowed out as much blood as is necessary to you.
And place warm compresses over them, and tighten them with one night's bandage, then release them.
Of Phlebotomy of the Veins of the Nose.
The phlebotomy of the veins of the nose is applied to acute fever, sore throat with intense pain, and facial ailments such as hemigraine and rubescence that occur on the face, particularly when they are chronic.
And the quality of his phlebotomy is that the sick man will stretch his neck.
Then hold his nose with your left hand, and take a fine, long lancet: and fix it in the middle of its muzzle, between that which distinguishes the nose according to its straightness.
Since the veins do not appear to the touch there, and because blood begins to flow immediately.
And you should move your hand with the lancet slightly: and let the blood flow according to your need.
Then ligate it on the same night.
For it restores itself quickly.
¶ Of Phlebotomy of Veins, by Guidehi.
Of Guidehi's phlebotomy, the benefit is for the constriction of dyspnea, the onset of leprosy, melancholic illnesses, impetigo, and malignant sores, as well as for corrodents, that is, erythematous lesions.
And the quality of these phlebotomies is that the sick man will be ligated under both sides of his neck: and the artisan shall stand over the sick man's head, and the sick man shall sit on a seat.
Then make the phlebotomy along the vein somewhat wide in length.
Then draw a适量的血量，或根据你所见的情况按需要抽取。
Then do the same with the other vein.
After this, cut the ligament, and tie the two veins with a tight thread: so that the sick person is not overheat.
And let her remain thus until morning.
The wound is healed.
§ On Phlebotomy of the Veins in Albucasis.
Veins in Albucasis are used for phlebotomy because they promote alkolism in the mouth, and corruption of the gums, and bad ulcers, and cracks in the lips, and bad ulcers, even those found in the nose and around it.
And the quality of these veins for phlebotomy is that you make the sick person sit before you, and tie his neck with a band.
Then roll back the lip and look for two veins: of which one is on the right side of the lip, and the second on the left side of him: and the demonstration of both is through the blackness of both.
And that is true: because around them are small black veins.
Therefore cut both with an incision. If there is any doubt for you, and you do not know which one it is: then direct your attention to the larger incision, and make that more apparent.
And similarly do for the two veins in the upper lip: and indeed, custom directs much with this. And cut the two veins which are in the lower lip.
§ On Phlebotomy of the Vein under the Tongue after Cephalic Phlebotomy.
Of the two Veins which are beneath the tongue for phlebotomy: it is that the Cephalic phlebotomy is for affections which are in the throat, and the illness of the uvula, and illnesses of the mouth.
And the quality of phlebotomy for these is that the sick person sit between your hands in the sun: and elevate his tongue, and look under his tongue on one side one vein, and on the other side another vein: and the color of both declines to blackness.
Phlebotomize therefore both: and watch, that you do not place your hand too close in phlebotomy.
For beneath them are arteries, and perhaps there may be a flow of blood from those arteries.
Of the three Veins in the elbow.
The three Veins which are phlebotomized in the elbow are in which phlebotomy custom has run throughout all men.
And phlebotomy of them is done according to two modes.
Or by puncturing with a wide phlebotomy lancet of myrtle: or by cutting very finely: or by cutting with a surgical knife, and this is Alnesil.
And this is its form.
Thus Alnesil is, which agrees with cutting.
And from these there are broad and fine species according to the width of the veins and their strictures. The form of the myrtle phlebotomy should be broad, as you can see.
And it is suitable for opening concave, full, outgoing, visible, thick veins, and those that contain thick, turbid blood.
And this phlebotomy is of lesser width and finer at the ends.
And it is suitable for phlebotomy of fine veins, which contain thin yellow blood.
¶ Of the Phlebotomy of Basilica.
Basilica, however, which is one of these three veins, is beneficial for phlebotomy. Because it draws blood from illnesses that are below the throat and neck, as it follows the chest and abdomen. And it is suitable for the phlebotomist to use this vein, but he should be careful, for there is an artery beneath it.
If therefore he errs and adds to the point of phlebotomy, he will hit that artery, and there will be a flow of blood.
Therefore, it is necessary to use this vein with the non-puncturing phlebotomus, not with the puncturing one.
If Basilica does not appear with a clear manifestation, then it is necessary to locate it and exchange for another vein, or you may seek one of its branches: or use the location of this vein for the phlebotomy of the arm.
It is clear and should be used with the non-puncturing phlebotomus Anesil, as we have said.
If you wish to perform phlebotomy at this location, then it is necessary to tie the arm first, so that you may touch the place until you recognize the pulse location.
Then mark the place with cauterization, afterwards the arm, and cut the vein with a concave incision using the phlebotome Alnesil, as we have said.
And beware that the blow does not fall through the space from the place of the artery.
And when you see, when you tighten the ligature, inflation at the place you marked with cauterization, then that inflation is from the artery: avoid it.
And if you see blood spurt at the phlebotome as urine from a boy, and it is thin, red blood: then know that it is from the blood of the artery.
Therefore hurry, and place your finger over the space longwise, then remove your finger.
If therefore blood is cut (for it is cut many times), then tie the arm, and release it: and let the patient beware of its motion: and let him be afraid of it.
And let it not move for several days until it is healed.
If, however, blood is not cut and it overcomes you, and you have no medicine present at the moment, then cut the artery if it appears to you.
For its extremities are drawn together, and blood is cut off.
Or take a strip of elm bark, and cut it. Take half of it, and tie it over the place of vein compression with a ligature and pledgets until another day.
Then if the blood is cut off, it is good.
And if not: then take care of it with him from whom the mention preceded concerning the place where the flow of blood is stopped by dust: and the cutting off of the blood of this is not difficult in many dispositions, because of the location of the small wound, and the possibility of ligature from the arm.
¶ Of Phlebotomy of the Blue Vein.
But the Blue Vein is useful for phlebotomy, which draws blood from the upper part of the head and the lower part of the body: therefore, because it is composed of a branch of the Basilic vein and a branch of the Cephalic vein, as we have said.
And it is suitable for the phlebotomist that she/he be above the fear of phlebotomy, for beneath her/him is a nerve.
If therefore she/he adds a puncture in the phlebotomy and finds a nerve, a stupor occurs in it, and the healing of her/him becomes difficult, and perhaps she/he is not cured at all.
And this nerve often appears to the sense.
If however it is hidden in some people and is fine and not shown, then you must place your phlebotomy where you draw blood from it, following the Alnési method, and avoiding the nerve with your skill.
If the vein is between two nerves, then cut the vein lengthwise.
¶ Of the Cephalic Vein.
Phlebotomy of cephalic veins is beneficial for bloodletting, because it draws blood from the head, and contributes to ailments of the eyes.
And it is proper in this vein, if you wish, to perform phlebotomy by puncturing it with a lancet of olive wood or with a myrtle branch, for it is safer among all veins, for it is neither an artery nor a nerve. Nevertheless, it is advisable for you during phlebotomy to use only the head of the lancet and seek a milder spot: and it does not harm if it is not found on the first strike, so that the lancet may be applied to it several times with phlebotomy. Nevertheless, perhaps an aposteme [suppurated abscess] develops in some people when not phlebotomized on the first strike, but it does not harm them if such an aposteme appears elsewhere.
On the Utility of Phlebotomy and Cautions to Be Observed Therein.
The quality of phlebotomy, and its accidents arising from it, which you should consider in its correction.
First, you should know what it is about, that phlebotomy is not performed except for the preservation of health, and its continuance, and caution against the approach of illness.
And for phlebotomy to be performed in one of the three veins located in the elbow, namely, the cephalic, the basilic, and the femoral.
And for phlebotomy to be performed at the beginning of Spring on an empty stomach, in spring and summer: in autumn and winter after a meal, when signs of excess are evident.
And let the bloodletting be on the first day, or the third day, after three hours have passed from the day.
Phlebotomia, which is administered in illnesses, does not have a fixed hour: but when provoked by convenience and necessity for that, it can be done at night, or during the day, and at every hour, and at every time.
And it is not proper to bleed children until they reach fourteen years of age.
Nor shall a pregnant woman be bloodlet except from the fourth month until the seventh.
Nor shall old men be bloodlet who have already passed sixty years.
When therefore someone wishes to be bloodlet for any reason at all: it is necessary that he purify his bowels before bloodletting with a gentle enema, if there is much feces retained in them: so as not to draw from the veins at bloodletting noxious foul excretions from the intestines into the body's principal parts.
Nor shall a patient who has colic, that is, severe nausea, be bloodlet; nor one who is intoxicated, nor one who has just recovered from intoxication, until that is removed from them.
Nor shall a patient with dropsy be bloodlet.
And bloodletting should be avoided again after colic, vomiting, flux of the bowels, increase in sexual activity, labor, exercise, watchfulness, fasting, and all that dissolves virtue from the bodily or animal substance.
Then consider in subtlety of humors before that, if blood is thick with foods and drinks and medicines: if it is possible for him that.
Then enter the bath if nothing prevents it; or exercise with some exercise to thin the blood.
And let him undergo phlebotomy on the third day, as we said, and try that his chest be evacuated on that day from all animal evils: such as distress, anger, and fear: and from all bodily evils, such as labor, pain, excess of urine, and similar things.
And let there be present at his seat things of whose use custom among men has arisen from the aroma, fragrance, and pleasure, and similar things according to the quantity possible.
Then let the phlebotomist sit on a higher bench than the phlebotomy couch: afterwards extend his arm and let the phlebotomist rub it twice or three times with his hand.
Then tie the ligament with pincers and wrap it twice.
And let the tie be适度的，因为当捆扎不均匀，或是因过度紧绷时，都会阻碍血液流动；同样，在放松时也会阻碍血液流动。
Then after the tie, let the patient rub his arms reciprocally until the veins become distended and are apparent to the touch.
Then let the phlebotomist cleanse the patient with a little old oil.
Then he shall place his left hand's index finger upon the vein at the spot where he wishes to perform phlebotomy, gently: so that the vein does not flee, and percussion may be administered.
Since you find the vein as one fleeing like a string at phlebotomy: and from there is that which is full of wind: and when you place the lancet upon it, it contracts beneath the lancet, deceiving the person holding the lancet, and the lancet does not open the vein: and if it does open it, it is narrowed. Therefore, for this reason, it is necessary to strengthen the lancet and be vigilant in all these matters.
Then he shall lay down the lancet.
And if not, then prick again at another place nearby, or above that place with haste: so that the spot does not become inflamed.
If, however, the spot becomes inflamed or the patient grows worse, then let him rest for a day, or two days: and do not bind with a bandage.
For it might draw a hot inflammation.
Neither shall he enter the bath.
Then he may repeat the phlebotomy if he wishes.
If the opening is small, or the blood flows slowly: and be careful that a quantity different from what you wish does not emerge from the blood: then prick again at the same hole according to its exact position, and add a little during the procedure.
And do that with urgency before the place suppurates, for the suppuration of the place occurs in many people during the operation.
If you therefore see it already suppurating, then you will not operate on it at all, for nothing excuses you in this regard. And place something from the oil ointment over it: for it will facilitate the flow of blood.
And it is better in this place than oil itself, and than other oils.
And similarly administer the oil ointment in all bloodletting where you let blood from veins during the prohibition of blood flow: and they do this with Tyriac, Alfarac, and Sagzenea, when placed over the area.
Blood is thinned and resolved when it is thick.
And if suppuration occurs in the area of bloodletting, a large abscess often happens, especially to those who are bled only at that time, or there is a small opening in the vein. Then act quickly and place a sponge soaked in water and salt on the area, slightly heated: and hold it for a moment; for it will resolve.
And you should do that after the blood has exited the vein itself, either with its complement or from another vein.
And indeed, boils and swellings often occur after phlebotomy at the Basilica.
Therefore place your hand upon it, then if you find it soft upon compressing it, then that swelling is bad.
Therefore, be careful to place something upon it from what we have said.
For perhaps blood from an artery is flowing from it.
But make him a poultice with it containing styptic material, so that the area may be hardened.
Then attend to it with the rest of the treatment until it is cured.
And it is necessary to draw from every person all the blood in proportion to the strength of his virtue.
And what is apparent from the color prevailing over the blood.
For if the blood is dark, then let it be allowed to exude until it becomes red: and similarly, if you see it thick, then let it be allowed to exude until it becomes finer: and similarly, if it is sharp, then let its sharpness be removed.
And it is necessary for one who is full, strong, and needs a bloodletting with only one incision, that the phlebotomy of the vein be enlarged, and let the bloodletting be broad: and in one who is weak, the opposite should be done.
And it is necessary to draw it off alternately, and let the opening be narrow: and it is better in a phlebotomy of a vein that there be a transverse section, not a puncture.
And this method of phlebotomy is safe from the flow of blood, and from the cutting of a nerve: and it is more commendable, and safer than phlebotomy by breadth and length.
And for those to whom it is accustomed to come upon during phlebotomy by syncopis, it ought that food be given before phlebotomy a small amount of bread infused in pomegranate water: or secana bin, if it is heated: and let him draw from the blood in three courses, or four.
And if it is of a cold temperament, then let him take before phlebotomy bread infused in myrtle syrup, or in aromatic honey syrup, or in fragrant syrup aromatized with spices.
And if syncopal attack occurs during phlebotomy, and the cause of its death is the escape of much blood, then it ought that he take for drink water of meat and fragrant subtle syrup: and use aromatic with algalia, and liniment his breast with it: and use the rest which we said in the division in the chapter on syncopal attack from evacuation.
And whoever wishes to treat his arm and relieve his blood secondarily: it ought that for him, whose phlebotomy is for the purpose of strong evacuation, and his strength is weak, he relieve his blood gradually according to the quantity of his strength over continuous days.
And whoever wishes to treat his arm and relieve his blood secondarily, and his body is strong: then let him do this seven or nine hours after his first phlebotomy.
And whoever wishes to draw blood from his body to the opposite part of the one toward which it declines: it ought to be treated on the second or third day.
In whose body there is much blood already heated and sharpened, and causes fever: it is necessary that the blood go out of him through one vein, and a large quantity be drawn from him: and the opening should be enlarged until syncope occurs: after which you must preserve all conditions of phlebotomy: and you shall place your hand upon his pulse at the course of the blood, that death not occur in place of syncope.
For it often happens when the phlebotomist is ignorant and falls into negligence.
And it is not necessary when you wish to let the arm sweat and release the blood a second time, if the opening of the vein is already closed and the exit of the blood becomes difficult, so that it must be pressed upon with frenzy and the wound extended quickly.
For that is very evil; indeed, leave it until the phlebotomy is performed a second time.
Or remove it with the sharpness of the phlebotomy that which has coagulated from blood in the opening of the vein, and place something of dissolved salt on top.
And place something on top of it from tyriaca, alfarroba, or sagzenea, and apply it with gentle compression until the blood comes out.
If the vein is indeed an apostema, then leave it alone and do not treat it until the apostema subsides.
If necessity prompts you to let the blood a second time, and there is no excuse, then either perform phlebotomy above that place, or on another arm at another vein.
But the vein of the arm for phlebotomy is marked by Fuscae and Basilicae; and when they are not found, and are hidden, because it is composed of them.
And the quality of its phlebotomy is that the sick person should introduce his hand into warm water until it becomes red, and the veins will appear manifestly.
Then it is tied above it with a ligature with only moderate constriction in the middle.
Then perform the phlebotomy obliquely, not laterally nor along its length: and let the incision be wide, and your phlebotomy be such that you make it obliquely above the joint of the hand slightly.
And the flow of blood in warm water is greatest during the winter.
And the phlebotomy of this vein is safer than all others, because there is no pulse-bearing vein or nerve beneath it.
The phlebotomy of the Saluatella of the right hand is conducive to diseases of the liver.
And the quality of its phlebotomy is that you tie the mahason of the hand with a ligature or your hand, after you introduce it into warm water, until the vein becomes evident and is strongly perceptible to the touch.
Then incise it transversely for phlebotomy.
And if you incise it completely, it will not harm him in any way.
And conserve, lest you withdraw your hand with the phlebotome.
For beneath it are the nerves of the fingers stripped of flesh.
Then pass your hand to the hot water, and let the blood run in it.
For if you do not pass it in hot water, the blood will coagulate at the opening of the vein and be prevented from flowing.
For when you have drawn from the blood the quantity necessary, then place oil and salt over the vein: so that it does not constrict quickly.
And similarly, you should do this with every tightly drawn vein.
The ligature for the phlebotomy on the left hand is: because it is conducive to spleenic diseases. And similarly, do this for the other phlebotomy, as you did for the second one equally.
The ligature for the saphenous phlebotomy is for diseases of the lower part of the body, such as uterine disorders, retention of menstruation, kidney ailments, and old sores of the thighs and legs, and similar diseases.
And the quality of this phlebotomy is that the patient should insert his foot into hot water and apply friction until the veins become prominent: then ligate above the ankle joint with a ligature.
And there is a vein indeed in the region of the heel, visible opposite the thumb: and from it branch out many branches on the face of the foot.
Therefore, let phlebotomy be performed on it in a larger branch thereof, or in the region of the heel at its confluence: for this is better and safer.
If you perform phlebotomy on it on the face of the foot, then be careful of the nerves that are beneath it on the face of the foot.
And make your phlebotomy through it, as if you wish to incise it, and call the phlebotomy Nesil.
If, however, the outlet of the blood is forbidden, then bathe his foot in warm water: and let the blood flow into it until it is evacuated.
If the vein for phlebotomy is in the first branch, then repeat with phlebotomy to the upper parts slightly, for the place is safe, and you should not fear any harm from it, provided you are careful of the nerves, as we have said.
And similarly with the Saphena vein of the other foot equally.
The location of the Sciatic veins, as we have said, is in the heel from the side of the wild beast.
And the remedy for phlebotomy of it is for pain in the hip when it is due to hot blood.
And the quality of the phlebotomy is that the sick person should go into the bath and hurry. Bind his leg from the side of the hip up to above the heel with four fingers using a thin long bandage: for it does not appear otherwise.
When therefore it appears, then let the phlebotomy be made according to whatever skill is possible to you, or by turning: and it is better, or that you cut it by incision, or divide it by section.
The place thereof is safer, and it is hidden in many men greatly.
If you do not find it and it does not appear at all to the sense: then let the phlebotomy be made of some branch thereof, and that is the one which appears on the back of the foot and towards the ear: and beware of the nerves, and cause a quantity of blood to flow as you wish.
Then release the tension, and place skin over the site of phlebotomy, and tighten the area.
For it is quickly cured.
¶ On Ventosation and the quality of its use.
Chapter CVIII.
Ventoza are produced from horns, and from air, and from glass.
And ventosation is made according to two methods.
When with scarification and bloodletting: and the other is ventosation without scarification. And this ventosation which is without scarification is according to two methods.
Or it is with fire.
Or it is without fire.
And the ventosations administered with scarification and bloodletting are fourteen places of the body.
One is Ventosatio Alnocrati, and it is after the head: and Alkehel, and it is in the middle of the neck: and ventosae Alhagdim, and they are two laminae of the neck from both parts together: and ventosae menti, and it is under the mandible in the lower lip: and ventosae duarum spatularum: and ventosae Alachosos above the end of the tail: and ventosae duorum focilium, and they are in the middle of the two arms: and ventosae duorum crurium: and ventosae duarum cauillarum.
And ventosatio indeed does not draw blood from you from small veins scattered in the flesh, and for this reason, its virtue does not fail as it does with phlebotomy.
Nor should ventosatio be administered with or without fire for any illness that occurs from congestion until the entire body is evacuated.
If necessity provokes ventosatio from illness or for the sake of custom, we administer it at any hour at the beginning of the month, at the end of the month, and in the middle of the month, and at whatever time it is needed.
This is because some people find that when blood multiplies in their body until it needs to be extracted through ventosatio, they experience heaviness and soreness in their head.
And among them are those who find congestion and redness on their face, head, and neck.
And among them are those who find itching on their face, forehead, and darkness and dullness in their eyes.
And there is one who slits the place for his ventilation. And there is one whose laughter is multiplied.
And there is one who finds the taste of blood in his mouth: or his tongue swells, and he spits out blood.
And there is one whose sleep is multiplied.
And there is one who sees in his sleep blood and rust, and slain persons, and wounds, and things similar to these. Therefore, when we see anything from these symptoms, and properly if it is in the middle of the third week: then we order ventilation to be performed after two or three hours have passed from the day. The collaret of the ventilation for the neck is: because it contributes to heaviness in the head, and what is poured down to the eyes.
