The hermaphrodite occurs in men in two types. One of them is that it appears below the perineum or in the scrotum skin between the testicles, a shape as if it were a woman's vulva with hair.	There are two kinds of male hermaphrodite: one has the appearance as of female pudenda with hair in the region of the perineum; the other has the same in the skin of the scrotum between the testes.	0.8614279
And urine may flow from the one that is in the scrotum skin.	Sometimes also urine is excreted through that which is in the skin of the scrotum.	0.7071662
As for in women, it is of one type. And it is above the vulva on the pubis like the male testicles, absolutely small, protruding outwards, one of them as if it were the male penis, and the two are like the testicles.	There is also one kind among women, in which there is, above the female pudenda, on the pubes, what resembles the male organs. These are small indeed, but protuberant, one being like the penis and the two others like testicles.	0.8279431
And the treatment of the three types, the two types of men and the one type of women, it is necessary to cut off those excess flesh until its trace disappears. Then you treat it with the treatment of all other wounds until it heals.	This is the treatment of all three kinds, that is, two male and one female: the superfluous growths must be cut away so that every trace is destroyed; then the usual treatment for wounds should be applied until they are healed.	0.7799126
As for the second type of men, from which urine comes out, which is in the scrotum skin, there is no action in it, nor any healing from it at all.	As to the second kind, in man, where the opening is in the scrotum and the urine runs out of it, there is no operation for this, and no cure.	0.84912205
